I did feel that 'JLS' started well. I liked the use of Jonathan's desire to break free from the flock as a metaphor for going after your dreams. I was really rooting for Jonathan at first and admired his determination to succeed. However, very soon I found the book started to get slightly wierd and hard to follow, especially when Jonathan meets his mentor Chiang and starts flying through walls, talking about space and time et al!! All very new age! It was at this point for me it changed from inspiring fable and I started to slightly loose the plot!The inspiring message of going after your dreams no matter what, is great up to a point but unfortunately, life isn't always that simple. You need talent as well as tenacity to succeed at certain things and the ability to set goals and overcome obstacles are all just part of the picture. There is often a fine line between determination and delusion, which means that going against the advice of others to pursue your dreams no matter what is not always the best option! Just remember those awful 'Americal Idol' auditions...!However, this book is good as a starting point to inspire you, especially if you haven't read self-development books before and you like the new age style of writing. It's great that so many people do feel inspired by this little book but unfortunately I seem to be one of the people who just didn't connect with it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I think this is a cute story that younger readers will appreciate. I'm not sure why there is so much hatred for this little book. If it's not for you there are plenty of other books out there to read. As a librarian, I must say that there is too much negativity in our culture towards what people read. Let people read what they like. Reading at any level improves vocabulary and comprehension. Snobbishness towards reading materials is especially counter productive. Just say why it wasn't for you and leave it at that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL was such a cultural phenomenon when it was first released in 1970 that it is hard to fairly evaluate the book. This simple (notice I said \\"simple\\" and not \\"deceptively simple\\") fable about a seagull who loves flying more than he cares to troll in the wake of the herring boats, was an explosive best-seller. Tens of millions of copies and a movie later, it's still in print.Bach's next book, 1977'sIllusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, is actually a better book. But JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL came at a time when it was the perfect vehicle to represent the last gasp of the Woodstock Era, the birthing cry of the Me Decade, and was the grandpappy of New Age commercialism. An easy book to digest, it seems to offer the reader a glimpse of profundity but without requiring effort on anybody's part. In other words, J.L.S. is a perfect mass market sop to the idea of spiritual materialism.Aye, there's the rub: For although J.L.S. is hokey beyond belief, it's also a book that can change lives, or at least set one's feet on the Path With Heart. Hardly deep (the writing has been described as \\"Kahlil Gibran Meets Captain Kangaroo\\"), the book's sincere message of transcendence over the mundane life can touch a chord inside the reader, especially if the reader has not been exposed to Kahlil Gibran (or Captain Kangaroo, for that matter). Every garbageman a guru.There are far greater examples of poetical writing (try Gibran for example, or Rumi, Peter Matthiessen, or Loren Eiseley), and the reader who comes to JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL after first findingThe Prophetwill probably roll his eyes. This is definitely a \\"starter\\" book. It rates THREE AND THREE QUARTER STARS, (but possibly FIVE if you're at where it's at). Otherwise, J.L.S. is just a curiosity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it.

I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I just finished reading this book (it took less than an hour), and I must say that I absolutely loved it! Although it's a REALLY short book, it's filled with wonderful, important insights for all those reading it with an open mind.Richard Bach uses the life of a seagull to examine the importance of following your dreams, and to highlight the reasons why many of us tend to give up - at times before we've even really tried. These reasons include: fear of what other's might think of us; being considered different from everyone else (and at times this leading to being seen as \\"bad\\"); and the inability for us to KNOW that we can do it - we can do ANYTHING we put our minds to.I would highly recommend this book to everyone with an open mind. I also think this would be a great book to read to children - the very young may not be able to grasp its implications, but I bet those around 8yrs. and up could understand the meaning if the parents discuss it afterwards."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a truly magical book. Its message can be interpreted in many ways by different people as the reviews posted here attest. To me, this book is an eloquent reminder of the power of persistence. Most things in life worth achieving don't come easily, they are preceded by struggle and hard work. There is usually a direct relationship between what we put into something and what we get back in return.Jonathan had an insatiable desire to learn. He wasn't interested in ordinary goals or activities. He was seeking nothing less than perfection. His thinking was on a higher plane than his fellow gulls. They were thinking - \\"fly to eat\\". Jonathan was thinking - \\"eat to fly!\\". He was driven to acheive his goal of perfect flight regardless of the consequences or sacrifices he had to make. Few people have this attitude, but the few who do are lucky indeed. That attitude, combined with persistence, is the key to all great acheivements.There is a quote by Calvin Coolidge that seems appropriate here: \\"Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is the ultimate fantasy of love and kindness triumphing over the mundane matters of everyday existance.

It is a very simple book and its written in a way that is very easy to follow. I find this book to be very inspirational and it shows how all of us can achieve anything we want if we just we put our mind, heart and soul into what we're doing and never give up no matter how tough the long journey ahead seems to be. I found this book late in my life, I wish I would have read it when I was much younger but it's better late than never and now that I have read it I understand so many things that had I read the book many years before I would have done differently. This is an excellent book for everyone and I highly recommend it. They should make this book required reading for school children so they can learn the true meaning of going for what they want in spite of negative opposition from others. I'm glad I found this book even at my age, it made look at life in a different perspective. EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I've read many reviews on this book. I'm not satisfied with most. Most both negative and positive have poor reasons.Most negatives I read just don't like mindless hippy-ness and empty new age philosophy (neither do I); they think the book propagates these things so they condemn it. It only propagates mindlessness if you are short-sited enough to assume that is its message. Don't be.Most positives I read just demonstrate the mindlessness that the negatives dislike. There is more to get out of this book than the \\"feel-good\\" aspect.To those who think the subject matter is thoughtless: look deeper.This is a much more accurate view of heaven than what most people have discerned from the Bible. If you want evidence of this, read Mark 12:34 in context. Heaven is not a place.It also indicates some of Bach's suspicions about the true nature of messiahs (Muhammad, Buddah, Jesus) that the world upholds and a possiblity of their true nature.It is clear that Bach meant flying for seagulls to represent learning for humans. I am in agreement with him that this is what we do best and what life is about: learning, growing. In fact this is (ironically) the same viewpoint that the negative spotlight reviewer, dbsholes, seems to have (go read new books; don't become stagnant).I like that the highest rung on Bach's \\"learning ladder\\" seemed to be love. This parallels biblical teaching (1 Jn 4:16; 1 Co 13).The most important idea (in my opinion) that the book hints at is the possiblity that God is not a being, but a mind of which we are a part.If this sounds like foolishness, read the first chapter of Swarm Intelligence (SI) by James Kennedy and Russel C. Eberhart, a graduate level discussion of minds (with a focus on artificial intelligence). The first chapter of SI is a discourse on the nature of minds (and how much of a misunderstanding most people have about what they really are). I wouldn't immediately buy it unless you are a Computer Science graduate focusing on AI or a Psychology major, but it is definately worth a check-out from the library, although I doubt a non-collegiate library would have it.We don't have to overcome the laws of nature. Never does the book state that the seagulls are overcoming the laws of nature. They are simply coming to realize that the laws of nature don't limit them, that the only thing limiting them is themselves. We assume the laws limit us when in fact they are the tools set up to help us.I don't know if Bach thought he was just making this stuff up, but the reality is he has hit the nail right on the head.There is more to the book than I have listed here. I'll leave the rest for you to discover."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I left home to join the Navy when I was 21 and this was the only thing I took with me that I still own. I was told I could only keep a bible with me in bootcamp and I told them that it was my bible ...they let me keep it. I designed my bootcamp company flag and it had a seagull on it. The book travelled with me around the world to my first ship in the Indian Ocean and then back to the US. I've had it ever since.There is magic in these pages. You can read this book at different points in your life and you will focus on different things ...often things that you never noticed before. I've probably read this book 30 or 40 times now ...generally about once a year. It gives me strength ...and compassion ...and reminds me how rewarding it is to attempt the immpossible once in a while.My life would not have been as rich or as rewarding without the gentle nudge this book gave me to reach out and try to touch perfection in my own way. Thanks so much for this gift Richard.Final Note: Regarding the great concern regarding \\"New Age\\" ideas ...I can't say exactly how Richard intended this story, but I read it as an allegory. I never assumed the author thought gulls could instantaneously travel through time and space, just as I never thought 3 pigs could build houses.

This book shall leave a lasting impression on your mind. Richard Bach tries to convey the message that \`impossible is nothing'.

Why? Because they've all been done before. Classics like Animal Farm and Watership Down define the successes of this overused technique. Jonathan Livingston Seagull shares a throne among the best of these.It's a short and simple tale about a seagull who loves to fly and wants to do his best at it. The writing is lyrical and flowing, with beautiful, almost poetic language. The story line is rich with metaphor, spirituality, and subtle meaning. It is an uplifting story, one that adds weight to the good side of the scale of humanity.I first read this book as teenager shortly after it came out in 1970. At that age and at that time this was a powerful book. It still is. I think it will be appreciated by idealistic collegians more than cynical forty-somethings, but everyone will benefit. If you don't like this book, you'd better get yourself checked out. You might be psychotic. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is among the finest I have ever read.It's beauty lies in it's simple yet effective method of relaying spiritual information in the fun form of a story, something at which Richard Bach is adept.It focuses on a seagull named Jonathan who finds himself outcast for being &quot;different&quot;. He soon discovers the eternal truth that different is a gift not a burden &amp; learns the lessons sent to try him with great success &amp; spiritual freedom. A parody of human life in our present society &amp; a prediction of how our future may turn out? You be the judge, it has a different message for each person who reads it; that's why it's such a special book. I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind &amp; a desire to create a better life,and I think that includes almost all of us."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I can remember, before I read this book about 5 years ago, growing up always seeing this book lying around my house. Of course at the time I never inquired as to what it was, I just saw it all the time. I always associated it with some Christian book of inspiration that my father was reading, which is why I never bothered to look at it.After reading this, however, I was truly amazed with the story. I knew I knew it. I mean, the story was entirely familar. Like most people growing up in a Christian household they are likely to hear the story of Jesus. Either from their parents, church or wherever. This book surprised me with the parallel to Jesus' own life. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who knew he something better to do than just eat. So he flew higher and higher and came down faster and faster. He was learning. He was experiencing.Soon, after being kicked out of his own lang and meeting some very wise Gulls. They taught him perfect speed. It was some time before I understood what this meant. But I found out one day at an Ani DiFranco concert (learning is everywhere around you). Someone said that she was the fastest female metal guitarist, or something or other. It dawned on me then what perfect speed was. Its not the speed, its not the height, but the quality. In a word: now.At any rate, this book was one of the books that really inspired me, for many things outside of it just being a Jesus parallel. It inspired me to know that we all have more to do with our time than to work to make money to eat (ad infinitum). One of the great books of its day. Highly reccomended for those who love good stories. (Oh, by the way - if you loved this story and thought you might want to see the movie. Dont! You will be utterly bored, especially by Neil Diamonds droning terrible songs in which a short book is made into a 2 hour live rendition. A complete let down, not to mention a waste of a film)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a wonderful, concise read for those of us searching for meaning to this thing we call \\"life\\". It's one of those books that you can read over and over again, and find new insights each time that you do."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is one book that changes your way of thinking.To seek out something more in life ,to be a perfectionist.Illusions is another beautiful book,it conveys a concept of opening our minds and not to judge things as right or wrong as nothing can be defined as right or wrong."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Okay, I'll be honest. At first, I was kinda turned off when I found out that Jonathan was a gull. I don't have anything against gulls, but I thought it was going to be a story about a *person*, so when I learned he was a gull, my expectations went down. *sweatdrop* But please read on.Another thing that nearly cost this book its 5-star review by moi was the fact that it lulled me to sleep. Not necessarily because the *story* was boring--it was just that the smooth prose and the calm, soothing feeling it evoked lulled me to sleep. I first picked up this book about half an hour before going to sleep, so you can just imagine how sleepy I got even before my time. -_-;But I didn't give up on this book. Jon's character... saved me, I guess. Even though he was a *gull*, his personality (er... gullity? ^_^ ^_^ ^_^) was remarkably human. I really liked him as a character, and I remembered how much I enjoyed reading &quot;Illusions&quot;, so I decided to continue reading. And that was when I finally found delight in the piece.The story seems simple enough, but its central message is advice that I think people are most desperate for in this new age. Kinda like a modern-day Gospel or something, except this one is much more refreshing to read, and much more relevant. Which isn't to diss the original Gospels or anything. But those Gospels were intended for ancient peoples of long ago. *This* one is for now, for the moment, and that is what I feel matters most.Like &quot;Illusions&quot;, this story will inspire you. And if you're the type who looks to books more for the story than for anything else the book may tell you, you'll find this an equally satisfying piece of prose. The writing style is fluid and easily understandable, and has a poignant beauty in its simplicity as well, and you'll find scenes that are amusing (there's one amusing scene that I doubt I'll forget in a long time ^^) and touching and inspiring.Just a few suggestions for new readers:1. Don't read this before going to bed (unless you're sure you won't let the warm, serene feeling lull you to sleep) 2. Look at the pictures (too bad they weren't colored, or I would have spent more time looking at them) 3. Don't rush. 4. If possible, get &quot;Illusions&quot;, too, written by the same author.This concludes my review. I hope this helped, and I hope you enjoy your experience of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a sublime and inspirational fable about the timeless quest for higher meaning ... told in this case though the eyes of an sensitive, lonely, and highly intelligent seagull, named Johnathan.I first read it when I was in high school, and at the time it moved me ... very deeply. I also grew up, and still live, near the ocean, where seagulls always maintain a constant presence - which made the metaphorical vehicle for this story particularly apt in my case. It remains one of my very favorite books, even to this day.The truly amazing thing (the thing that elevates this book to a 10) is how elegantly, simply, and deftly the author covers such profound material, with such a minimum of effort and words. The book weighs in at a mere 128 pages ... over half of them B&W; photos of seagulls ... so it's actually less than 60 pages of text. If you reformatted it to small, normal size print, it'd probably drop to about 30 pages. I recently re-read it in about 2 hours, so it's a very fast read - but it's tiny size is greatly outweighed by it's impact. One could easily argue that the story is prose poetry, rather than a short story, because of it's well honed cadence.I highly recommend this gem for anyone (particularly those in their teens and twenties) who's groping about for their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual niche in society, and life in general.Life can be hard, lonely and painful at times - but every once in a while we stumble across a rare gem ... be it a person or a moment or a song or a book or the touch of a friendly hand ... that helps us catch a glimpse of what it's really all about, and which lets us know that we're not alone, and that there are others out there, like us, who occasionally 'get it' too.For music lovers, there's also a lovingly produced full length orchestral album (by Neil Diamond) that was inspired by this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a simple story. So simple in fact that you wonder why the writer got paid for it. A seagull gets banished for flying wrong and then dies. But he comes back from the dead because freedom is the way to be, so he preaches the Buddhist-Christian gospel with the smug certainty of a kindegarten teacher.I admit that I did love this story once. It was kinda deep. Or at least my friends told me that it was deep. The problem is that it's not deep at all. It's trite and self-satisfied. It's one of those books that you love as a child but then you realize how condescending you got after you read it. Then you think about it years later after having learned more and you think back about how dumb you were to have been impressed.I give it an extra star because it is good to read once. I would have even given it three stars if it didn't have all the publicity and the hype and fanboys surrounding it. If you are expecting an amazing life changing book and you get a slim story instead it's bound to take down the ultimate joy of the whole endeavor. If I was expecting a nice little story, I would have enjoyed the final product better.One more word - I know that the pictures have been in from the original, but they are grainy blurry things that look like the author took a polaroid to a beach one day. The fact that the photographer gets credit hints that he actually is getting paid for them.

It seems like a good idea to equate our universal human aspirations for greatness and uniqueness, with the whimsical trials and tribulations of a friendly, iconoclastic, renegade coastal pigeon. Through the inspiration of his example, (Jonathan, in case you're not with me just yet) we might too one day soar high above the flock, dare to glide outside societal norms and boundaries, challenge blind authority, stand strong in the face of the disapproval of one's peers, and ultimately like Jonathan, transmogrify ourselves into mega-achieving phenoms, who are not too busy with our daredevilry to spend a great deal of quality time doubling as inspirational coaches and gurus for a whole new generation of freshly-hatched oceanic avians... *whew* hold on, let me catch my breath for a second. I haven't waxed that sententious since reviewing \\"Harold, The Friendly Buddhist Beaver\\" late last year. There, that's better. Anyhoo, for me, in the course of reading this book, which incidentally took me approximately 39 minutes, I always felt like it was Richard Bach speaking to me, pretending he was Jonathan. And hey, I felt gypped! If I'm going to read the memoirs of a seagull, then by golly, I want to hear from the bird himself, not some human who wishes he were some sort of wing-ed beak-ed creature. Meanwhile, as I honestly wanted to like this book and come to care for the flying feather bundles therein, I felt there was not sufficient character development to learn to feel anything much for any of them. I did however learn to feel that Richard Bach is several light years away from being a substantial writer, although I'm sure he's a perfectly nice man when he's not comandeering some innocent typewriter, and using it to churn out more of this sort of cotton candy philosophy of his. In closing, I would like to address the subject of the book's photography. I was absolutely baffled by its mundaneness. I'm sure most of us agree that seagulls are very beautiful birds. Their antics are charming and they possess a great sense of grace, bravery, strength and even humor in their countenance. (I live by the ocean, trust me on this.) The photography in this book is decidedly \\"artsy\\" with many photos in black and white, and intentionally out-of-focus, blurry, and non-distinct. In my opinion, the text would have been far better served by photography which captured more of the natural beauty of this bird, both in flight and at rest.

In an era when books are growing increasingly complex and complicated, Bach's book continues to stand out because of its simplicity. Bach spins a tale about a ordinary seagull who finds himself on an extraordinary spiritual journey. This book is a fascinating read, and Russell Munson's photography provides the perfect illustrations for the story. JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL remains one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Of all the countless, thousands of books I have read, &quot;Johathan Livingston Seagull&quot; is my number one favourite book. It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free, when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn. The book is short, but the powerful lesson and message contained in these few pages is one many people never learn in an entire lifetime, no matter how many lifetimes they may live."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Chicken soup for this, chicken soup for that, chicken soup for the idiot-who-doesn't-want-to-think-for-themselves- soul. If you're as sick of this tripe as I am then you'd probaly enjoy this one. So much wisdom in a very quick easy package without the &quot;christian&quot; slant so many supposedly uplifting story lean on. If you don't like it, oh well its only five bucks. Its a classic, buy two copies and give one as a gift."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This was an excellent book to ponder and enjoy. It is easy to understand yet has great depth! Excellent!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is simply amazing!If you are an individual who believes deep in your heart that there is much more to life than what people perceive, this is the book for you. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a fictional book, (to an extent, to the naked eye) whose concepts and ideas can be applied to any area of our lives. As a result, one will begin to reach a new level of excitement, awareness, and happiness in your life. Try it and you'll see; I guarantee you that you will have an infinite number of things to gain and absolutely nothing to lose."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"My boss recommended this book to me when I asked him for the meaning behind a painting of a seagull riding high , in his office. I've been trying to move my life in THAT direction for some time so upon reading, I'm even more inspired to spread my wings and soar.....to transcend the imaginary restrictions we face in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is Richard Bach's finest work. A simple story told with complex texture. The bird symbolizes the ineffable longings within humanity for a transcendental epiphany; a neon in the night of our stumblings; flash! I see! I hear! I fly! Valleys of failure and hills of hope are the topographic text through which the tale travels, and white-winged and wide are our stretchings towards self-actualization. This is a work of singular vision, aided by a slight editorial suggestion by me. Bach had just finished the final draft and we were sitting together on Santa Monica pier. Richard showed me the title and something just didn't seem to click. So I said, &quot;Rich, sure the bird idea's got legs, but Jonathan Livingston Turkey?? Take a hike along the beach and see what else you can come up with.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"\\"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" generated a fair amount of 'buzz' when it first appeared. It is a short, very short, book. Johnathan learns that he loves to fly. He decides to learn how to fly better than any seagull ever has flown. And, we get a, sort of, existential account of what follows. Johnathan finds that doing what he loves and doing it well brings him a, sort of, spiritual fulfillment and a, sort of, trancendence of self.This book appeared at, about, the time that the hippy, yippy, long-hairs were into the Beatles, who were into Indian music and Ravi Shankar, or whoever. This is, about, when \\"New Age\\" spiritual quests began.The book is a good read. It does offer some things to think about. But it is not a deep, philosophical or religious, screed. It is a simple story. Also, it does offer a modern alternative path of spirituality that is not the same old Judeo-Christian-Moslem religion plus Buddist paths that extend back over a couple of millenis, or more.However, easy does it! This book is somewhat like the Japanese Tea Garden, near the greenhouse, in San Francisco. It is great to contemplate from a short distance. But, does not do as well under close inspection or under heavy traffic. I repeat, it is not deep philosophy or deep religion and is not reinforced for heavy duty load-bearing use. I rated it a 4, for being a nice read. However, if you are looking for industrial strength religion and philosophy, start with the Bible and continue reading all the serious Budhist books, and many more. \\"New Age\\" is 'feel good' but does not offer the support that the old-time, complex, structurally multiply-reinforced religions offer.So a sort of \\"fun\\" read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Like the \\"Cookie Book\\" and \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a great little story packed with inspiration for young minds developing in a rather horrific and relentless world. It is an escape from your everyday way of thinking to, perhaps, strive to better oneself and those around us. Being an adult and already hard pressed with my own self awareness and assurance, this book does little for me. As an adult I rate the book a 1 star, but my inner child rates it a 5. Somehow it all seems fitting to place it right in the middle. Don't take this book seriously... and don't take yourself seriously.In conclusion (and in retrospect), there is little need to even review this book. It's content is so fractional that you can read this within 15 minutes, its best just to read it for yourself and find out all its hidden meanings while drinking a cup of coffee, and then, move on with your life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a wonderfull book with a great message.

And a full 15 years to read & write English fairly well. That makes it around 1991. I picked up this book at a used book store in India when I was 16 years old. I was able to read it in under 30 minutes. But from then onwards I've bought at least 3 copies of this book and have read it umpteen number of times.The book had a huge impact in shaping my outlook to life, instilling and reinforcing my desire to be better at what I do [its quite another thing whether I was able to achieve it :)]. I guess its important that you have lofty goals. Aim for the stars may be you'll reach 100 feet into the air. May be you'll learn to fly - if not like Livingston Seagull - at least like his lousy flying brethern.Along with Ayn Rand, I'd rate Bach's this work at the very top of what one should read in one's formative years.I'm a Software Developer by profession and I at least once in a day think: It always works, when you know what you're doing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"God they say is a process. JLS is a simple overview of the process. It shows the struggle to achieve oneness with the godself and having achieved it what to do with it. Do we stay in the oneness or elect to help other people find the path to this oneness.JLS elects to go back and show others the way to the one. It is simply written but it illuminates a number of spritual truths one of course being -- IT IS A LONELY PATH HOME!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Nice to read that again, reminded me of many happy hours spent during my student days, back in the 70's.

And, it will inspire those with an imagination to reach greater heights! Read this book and learn to fly..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is much more than just a bird learning to fly. It's a story that teaches freedom, dedication, and desire. This story teaches people that there is more to life than what meets the eye. I would recommend this story to anyone who is struggling with decisions about what they want to do in life, or rather what they believe they can do with their life.I read this story at a good time in life. Right now I am trying to pick a career that's going to satisfy my needs and myself. Instead of doing something only for the money, since that's essential for life, I want to do something that I can wake up every morning and look forward to doing it. I thought about becoming a nurse but figured I wasn't smart enough to go into that. This story taught me to believe in myself and go for what I want. It doesn't matter if I think I can handle it or not because I can do anything I set my mind to.Like I said, I would recommend this story to anyone who is trying to decide where to go to college, what to major in, what sports to pursue, and other big decisions such as those. It's hard to explain the lesson to the story or the feeling you get when reading this story, you just need to read it and find out."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A 30 years old classic book that still works, because the story is one that we can easily get into (You don't need to know about ancient history for example). The story of Jonathan is one we all can get attached to and we can learn from.Unlike other books of this kind (You know, learn more from yourself, self-betterment and all that) like &quot;The knight in rusty armor&quot;, the book doesn't seem like a disguised &quot;Learn to love youself&quot; book, it is a nice story, and it is left up to the reader to pick up what he wants. And by the way, I am in no way fan of the &quot;Self-betterment&quot; books, I actually don't find them interesting, but this book was WAY different....that above was comming from a 16 year old :) , have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I find more meaning to this great book every time I read it.

Instead he devotes himself to perfecting his flight, going higher and faster than any gull ever had before. He is eventually expelled from his flock, but continues his flight perfection. One day he is met by a pair of gulls who take him up to a 'heaven' where all gulls seek perfection.

Everytime I'm blue or lonely, i just pick up that book and read it. It's just wonderfull!There are statements there that you construct as inspiring words for thought, such as &quot;heaven is not a place, and it is not a time, for heaven is being perfect&quot; or &quot;We choose our path in life through what we learn.

I really cannot fully describe what i feel for this book, and all i can say is that you better read this to immerse yourself in this extraordinary story of a gull who seeks for higher purposes in life... and made others believe in him...Jonathan's race had began 30 years ago... and until now, it is still on the grow...Buy this book... for your own good... and you'll never regret buying one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"For those who recognize &quot;the flock&quot; for what it is, and desire to break free of it or have broken free of it, this is a good story that you can relate to. &quot;Those who dance are viewed as insane by those who can't hear the music.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is one remarkable book.

Bleriot's book last year about flying in the jungle did the same but no one beats this wonderful bird."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Totally inspiring. Would recomend for anyone searching for an answer to what direction to take. Live in the moment and freedom is yours."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this book again recently - had a copy when it first came out that I gave away to a friend. It's one of those books that can help you to live in the here and now and to enjoy life simply by doing what you do best. Whether it's based on Buddhist or Christian ideas doesn't really matter, the story promotes the idea that each person (or seagull in this case) has a higher self - and it's important to let this higher self guide you to become a better person (or seagull). The central character, a seagull, is focused on flying perfectly, being totally in tune with himself and not distracted by greed, supremacy, belonging etc. It's a delightful tale, told simply with drawings of birds in flight, useful for those who get stressed out by the small things in life and need to learn about the bigger picture."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an easy read. Critics say trite, condescending, and literary drivel. I found the book fascinating. It is simply a short novella about growth. Growth as an individual, at times alone and at times with others. May I never stop learning and growing. The book is a hodgepodge of every philosophy at once while having no real tenets itself. It is not a religion. It came into pop culture at the end of the hippie era and the beginning of the leisure suit society. Although not the first, it does fit in with self help genre which ran rampant at that time. Richard Bach's personal life has no bearing on the positive message which is simple - Believe in yourself and your ability to overcome."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Literary EvaluationJonathon Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach is a fairly short but well written parable. The story concerns the main characters determination to perfect his flying skills. Not for selfish ambition or to dominate the flock but for the love of the knowledge. His banishment from his flock and through practice and learning his transition to a new level of existence where he also learns about love and forgiveness. It makes us consider the human condition. Are we just one of the flock or someone who is not afraid to take the path less traveled.The author relates a story in which he uses a flock of seagull as an example of the human group. Most of them have no particular ambition and because of that they are not particularly happy and spend their time squabbling and arguing with each other. \\"til a crowd of a thousand seagulls came to dodge and fight for bits of food.\\" Although written in 1970 we still face the same issues today. Are we someone that thinks independently and wants to learn and perfect our skills. \\"For most gulls it is not flying that mattered but eating.\\" But be careful, that independent line of thinking can get you into trouble. You may even be banished from your flock but maybe that's when your journey really begins.The author tells us that if you dedicate yourself to a task it will lead to much greater things. Eventually you will wish to return to help those that your path to knowledge made you leave behind.Even 40 years after these words were written they still speak to the human conditions, now as they did then. \\" Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight- how to get from shore to food then back again.\\" The individual who thinks differently is often marked as a trouble maker. Bach tries to explain to us that this can be why individuals are held back from doing extraordinary things. \\"Why, Jon, why? His mother asked. Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock\\" So the inability to achieve extraordinary things is simply a mindset. Sometimes the dogmatic thinking of the group is impossible to change, at least initially.The story tells us of the inertia of the group, but also how some individuals find a better world through the perfection of knowledge, love and forgiveness. Although the story is short, like a Japanese brush painting, a few carefully placed strokes can make a beautiful picture."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Ever have one of those days where something pops into your head, a distant memory of something you did once years ago that you suddenly recall as if it were yesterday? Well that's what happened to me recently when, for whatever reason, the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull came to mind. I had read it in 6th grade or so, and recalled the soaring tales of Jonathan Seagull and the life lessons taught through Bach's words. So I bought the book, had it shipped to my home, and read it in one quick sitting. I'd long since forgotten the intricate details expressed in this little book that packs a mighty message of self-confidence, the will and courage to be oneself, not being afraid to express who we really are, and importantly embracing even those who reject us. What a lovely book, as relevant to me now that I'm in my late 40's, as it once was when I was an 11 year old."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"loved listening to the selection as it was used for a wedding.

The author casts beautiful imagery in one's mind while simply stating his message. As for the message itself, it is lovely. Maybe not the be all and end all of philosophy, but fulfilling and inspiring. Maybe if I had read it in the 70s I would have got more out of it. Instead it's 2013 and I'm perhaps a bit jaded to this sort or self help rhetoric.

Richard Bach is extrodinary in this book and really makes people realize their worth. When I am feeling down about life or myself I pick up this book and journey with Jonathan. The photography in this book is a great addition and really makes you feel the story. Writing about the book doesn't give it justice. You need to read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is possibly my all-time favorite. It combines two subjects which I absolutely love!

I am planning on purchasing a large number of these books as gifts for both friends and strangers as soon as I get some extra cash. Read it!

May we all become enlightened like Jonathon Livingston Seagull."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This simple yet deep story brings together a wonderful spiritual message with the advanced research of physics and energy work. Timelessness, spacelessness, and the vibration of the human energy field are central to Eastern spiritual traditions and to advanced Western science. Bach weaved these together in a unique fashion and thus, the allegory can be understood on many levels - hopefully you will see this. Let your curiosity be piqued and try not to overlook the human potential to transcend the physical existence. Indeed, this is what being fully human means. As for the simple spiritual level and lessons, his words resonated deeply."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I first read this book when I was about eleven, and it's been one of my favorites ever since. It's a true classic, one that you can read over and over and over again, and never get tired of, and find new insights and nuances in it. Now every seagull is an incarnation of Jonathan to me. And there is a film of it as well! I didn't get to see that until it was out on video, but it was well worth the wait. I cry every time I see it--not because it's sad, but the photography is SO BEAUTIFUL!! Especially when coupled with Neil Diamond exquisite songs. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"After reading the book, one thing has become pretty clear in my mind. we are not here for mere earning our bread and butter. Life is all about exploring new heights, think about them till you reel under the pressure, dream about them and nurture them. It also tells us that to follow freely the promptings of heart, one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse and ruthless in its own wayward course. The book is a bid to rekindle the sleeping Jonathan Livingston Seagull in us. Thru the seagull, the author explains us and takes us to the finer nuances of life. What does a man need, we always think. Bread, Butter and a bed to sleep on. NO, you will know after reading the book. There is much more to life than getting these things. You don't have to simply live for them. How about bringing a pose of roses for your beloved from the stiff cliffs of Alpine, when roses are out of season. This book will teach and prompt you to do that. Thanks Richard for letting me know the Jonathan Seagull in me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"How often we take a pause in our onward journey in life, how often we feel content with whatever little achievements we make, how often we pat ourselves, how often we glorify our record breaks!

This story is just not about a seagull or about flight. This is a story on the need to leave the mundane behind and push yourself to be perfect in whatever you do. It also tells you that it is not easy to reach there, but the joy of reaching there is worth the efforts. A must for youngsters in particular. Wheever Iam down I just read this again and am back on track going where I want to go. A book that will live forever.C T Lakshmanan, India"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The title of the book I read was Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach. The characters were seagulls and the main characters were Jonathan and Fletcher. The main setting was by a coastline. It was three parts long. The book was about a seagull that was concentrating more on flying than eating, which seagulls are supposed to do. He didn't listen though. He kept flying and flying. He was later taken away from the flock and lead to the cliffs. There he met the best seagull. He taught Jonathan everything. My favorite part was when he learned to fly in the past and future. I think you would like this book because it seems pretty real.By Edward Ryan, Jr. Age 8"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Less than an hour, no guilt, and you feel really good when you're done (unless you don't get it. Try again in a couple years). I've probably read it fifty times.

People keep saying that this story is unrealistic because seagulls aren't intelligent enough to reach a state of perfectness, but this story isn't about birds. I'ts humans that are the flock and are too caught up in society to see that there is a way to drop the things that hold you back achieving perfection."},{"Title":"ADSI CDO Programming with ASP","review":"Freidlitz and Mondor are obviously experts in the field and their experience and knowledge are impressive. It's hard not to find the book valuable if you are at all involved in Exchange/Outlook projects. The book is, however, almost fatally marred by its atrocious syntax and grammar problems; and this makes learning from the text an overly onerous task. The publishing house obviously did not want to invest in a professional editor (astonishing given the price of the book!). Be prepared for an inordinately steep learning curve, due to these very same syntax problems. You almost have to be as knowledgeable as the authors to gain from their presentation! I cannot recommend the work as wholeheartedly as I can Thomas Rizzo's, &quot;Programming Outlook and Exchange&quot;."},{"Title":"ADSI CDO Programming with ASP","review":"I agree with the first reviewer-the presentation is just too poor. For the price I expected more in-depth coverage.

Not enough clear examples nor does it really have practical application examples. More of 'this is the line of code to do this'.

While the high intensity training enthusiasts like to be dogmatic in their bashing of this type of training, it has been proven effective time and time again. In fact I had the opportunity to speak to a strength coach for the NFL who said most of the athletes who came to his team from a school that utilized high intensity training techniques seemed to be more susceptible to injuries. HIT training has it's place. But so do plyometrics. I have done them for years with no injuries resulting from them. Tudor Bompa is well respected in the field of strength training and for good reason. All of his books that I have read are excellent."},{"Title":"Power Training for Sport: Plyometrics for Maximum Power Development","review":"This was a good alternative to training for power with weights. Since not everyone can get to a place to workout. I found it helpful in giving me another method to train. I also liked the small variations of each jump along with the jumps being listed in a simple progression pattern."},{"Title":"Power Training for Sport: Plyometrics for Maximum Power Development","review":"Tudor Bompa's Power Training for Sport is informative along anatomical lines, but erroneous otherwise. This book promotes dangerous training techniques that offer very little for athletic improvement. For those who read this book and practice plyometrics, I pray for your safety. Authors Mike Mentzer and Ken Hutchins provide excellent information on weight training. (As well as Brian Johnston and others whose books are not found at Amazon.com) These authors will illuminate the proper way to improve strength - which is the only way to dramatically and safely increase power.AMMENDMENT (12/14/02)Having been accused of dogmatism, I feel the need to clarify my review. As for finding alternatives to gym-style workouts this text may very well be of use but as this is not it's primary purpose readers should probably look elsewhere.That being said, I'd like very much to read the proof of plyometric exercise effectiveness for it is not what Mr. Bompa provides. The premise upon which I wrote my previous review is that the force a human can generate and the motion by which it is applied, are seperate. An athlete's physical performance is based on (1) the efficiency of motion, and (2) the force applied to that motion. Power is the synergy of these two factors. (Power = Force / Time)&lt;&lt;&lt;Tohji et al. (1991) found that subjects who used a combination of moderate speed and isometric (i.e., no movement) muscle contractions enhanced their maximal muscle power production significantly greater than a group that used both moderate and maximal speeds of movement.Behm and Sale (1993) showed that subjects who trained one limb at 300 degrees per second and the opposite limb isometrically showed similar increases in high-speed power in both limbs.1) Behm, D.G., Sale, D., Intended Rather than Actual Movement Velocity Determines Velocity-Specific Training Response, Journal of Applied Physiology, 74(1): 359-368, 1993.2) Tohji, H., et al., Effects of Combined Training Programs on Force-Velocity Relation and Power Output in Human Muscle, Thirteenth International Congress on Biomechanics, (Marshall et al., eds.), University of Western Australia, Perth, 311-312,1991.>>>**Information provided free of charge at www.i-a-r-t.com(And no, I have no affiliation, but I do not wish to plagiarize.)Given the evidence I have seen, read, and experienced via my own personal endeavors, improvement in any sport is predicated upon the advancement of strength and skill (and mentality - I suggest The Mental Game of Baseball by H. A. Dorfman, Karl Kuehl, the contents of which apply to any sport) and that the two can be achieved separately. The separation of the two is important because they are inherently safer independent than combined.P.S. I can speak for no college, university nor NFL team. I do however find it difficult to take the safety advice of an NFL strength coach - unless, of course, he is speaking on the use of hyperdermic needles."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"The Moghul most interesting story. A bit hard to read due to unfamiliar terms/names in India. Needs a bit of editing but still a good read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This book reminded me a lot of Rushdie's Enchantress of Florence. Mughal history seems to be an excellent resource for action, political intrigue, sensuality and pure eye-popping extravagance. The kicker in all of this is, some or more than some of this actually happened. The only sour note was the inevitable realization by an Indian reader about what actually happened subsequent to this period-the colonization of India for 3 centuries."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"I loved the way this book transported me to a very alien culture and made me feel like I was there. It's the kind of old-fashioned historical novel that made me love historical novels when I was growing up, the kind that when you're done leaves you knowing quite a bit about real history. It's long, which I also loved, knowing as I read it that I had several evenings of pleasure to look forward to as I sank into the world the author created.This book differs from the historical novels in vogue nowadays in that it seems to have been written for a male audience and the main character is very much the embodiment of a male wish fulfillment fantasy. (Today's historical novels are much lighter on history and heavier on romance, probably because they are written primarily for female readers.)The Moghul's hero is supremely competent, capable of negotiating the most complex political environments and of defending himself against attackers no matter how large, well armed or numerous. The women he encounters (and there are many) are all beautiful and sexually skilled, and require no wooing or emotional support of any kind. When it's time to leave them he does, without a pang, on to more heroic adventures.But, somehow, it works. The pace of the narrative and the exceptional way in which the setting is brought alive was enough to keep me reading even after I realized that the main character was a male wish fulfillment fantasy. There are several wonderfully well done battle scenes--which were so vivid it was like watching a movie to read them. The world of the Palaces, ports, and milltary camps of 17th Century India come alive.By the time I turned the last page I was sad, in the way one always is when one reaches the end of a long and entertaining book whose world one reluctantly must leave behind.I can't imagine why Doubleday made this whole book free, but I'm glad they did!"},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"The Moghul gives the reader a feel and understanding for the era in which the story takes place. It's almost as if Hoover succeeds in placing the high tension of the time period in our own chests.In addition, the story he tells is filled with rich characters, enticing aromas we can almost smell, awe-inspiring sights we can see when we close our eyes, understanding of a civilization and traditions older then we can comprehend, and very much more.This book is very different from anything else Thomas Hoover has written, yet in my opinion, it's him at his best!"},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Very interesting comparison between England and India society during the 1600 - 1700's.

I am an avid reader of historical fiction and have been to India many times, so this book seemed a good it for me. It was an excellent read! It has enough juicy plot to keep you interested, enough history to teach you a bit, and some of the passages are very well written. Don't get me wrong - overall it is well written. But, there are some descriptions that are very, very good. For example, there is a wonderful description of the god Shiva as the Nataraj. It is one of the best I have ever read for a Western audience. And, I will be using it in a class I teach on World Religions. I don't know why this book was available for free, but I am very happy about it!"},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Story was nice. But a story which should have required 250 pages was written in over 500 pages. Descriptions of plots, characters and actions was so elaborate that they provide a nice visual picturization.

Now I hope there IS a movie being made.....I will be among the first in line."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Really enjoyed this novel. It's kinda Shogunish, but I mean that in a good way. It go's into some detail about Indian and Mogul customs and culture, I like that, some may not. The ending is rather vague, and apparently the author doesn't plan to continue.Given my intense dislike of long drawn out duologys and triologys I can't complain."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"A great reading especially if you have a passion for India. One of the Indian epic stories. Was great to read it again, even better on Kindle."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This is an &#34;ok&#34; book. I liked it at the beginning, but somehow, as I read more and more, it did not keep my interest. There was action and a great setting! But, somehow, I could not get into this book. I tried again a second time and had the same result. I like historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This book was definitely one of the best I've read. It's gripping, adventurous, sensual, emotive, and challenges you to explore your own beliefs. It also, in a way similar to Wilbur smith and Bryce Courtenay, teaches you a great deal about the culture and historical context in which it is set- but it does so through a killer storyline. Can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"I have read a number of books by Thomas Hoover and he is a very versatile author who researches his subjects thoroughly this one is no different but perhaps it needed more research than most. The story is not entirely fiction but a blend of fact and fiction which works well but I found some of the later parts of the book particularly with the politics where lots of names were very similar heavy going. It is a book that could have been much improved on the Kindle by linking unusual words to the essential glossary which I wish I had realised was there before I got to the end of the book. In parts I found it difficult to realise who was being described as it sometimes jumped rapidly from scene to scene.It is however a book worth persevering with as it gives a fascinating insight into the culture and politics of India at the time before the Raj."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Thomas Hoover has written an epic tale loosely based on the beginnings of the East India Company's entry into India. It has the flavor of a well researched story with perspectives of the Pope-centrism Portuguese, the self-centered English and the 'Heathen' Indians. There is something for everybody with battles, adventure, romance, wild animal hunts, cultural immersion and political intrigue. You will soon feel like the Portuguese and English were the 'heathens' and India a little understood cultural mecca.The Portuguese have had control of trade with India, by water, for a century and the English their own agreement with India. Enter Captain-General Brian Hawksworth and his two ships, as England attempts to gain a toe-hold in trade with India. We start with a sea-battle, make a hazardous landfall at the trade port, are immediately immersed in political intrigue and in-fighting, adventure across country to meet the Moghul, ride elephants, participate in wild animal hunts and more. A fantastic tale of India!This is a story I could easily read again and have rated it 4-Stars."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Excellently written story in which Hoover takes you into 16 century India with a masterful combination of James Michner's historical novels and Clive Cusslers adventure. If you enjoy novels based on entralling historical events, intrigue, adventure and an amazing storyline, you will love this."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"\\"The Moghul\\" was one of the best books I've read in quite a while. It's not Great Literature, but it was more enjoyable than much of the Great Literature I've read. Compelling prose, a plot that keeps moving along quickly, well-drawn characters, action, violence, sex, political intrigue, history, exotic settings. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"The book has great history and I normally love historical books, but this one was slow to begin and didn't really pick up until 3/4 of the way through. I felt like I was forcing myself to finish it."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Hoover created a character and story much like James Clavall's English pilot in &#34;Shogun&#34;. Both characters gradually transform over the arc of the story, providing the reader with fantastic insight into the culture of the host nation. This is a great read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"The book was ok, it's just sooooooo long. I couldn't finish it, because it just drags and drags and it's neverending. But some parts of it are really interesting (e.g. shiptravel in old days, cultural shock for english captain coming to India etc.)"},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Clearly either James Clavell either read The Moghul or is psychic because his 'Shogun' is quite similar. For this reviewer, having read Shogun in no way reduced the enjoyment of 'The Moghul', however.Set in India, we have an Englishman who wishes to open trade up with that area currently ruled by invading Muslims who have taken over a good deal of what was then called India ruling it under a tolerant mostly secular rule. The book is based on real folks but is fictional in actual events. Like Shogun, the Portuguese mostly represented here by a priestly cast, opposes England's desire to trade both on religious and commercial grounds.The book reads, in usage and pacing like one written today. I was expecting a cross between Henry James and John Dos Pasos so got a major surprise at how things clipped along. There is a good deal of romance (ok, sex) and like Shogun, oriental manners and cleanliness is contrasted with England's crude dirt.While a rousing adventure very much worth a read if you enjoy swashbuckling historical fiction as I do, there are a few drawbacks. First, the book excessively relies on flashback. For example, while not in the book, this could be at least stylistically. \\"John woke up to contemplate his missing feet. He thought back to three weeks ago when he still had his feet and that fateful encounter with a dragon.\\"Also some scenes just jump around as if a mad editor hacked a few pieces out of the book. At one point, the hero is in danger of execution if a certain event doesn't happen. Next scene is a few weeks later and the hero is still above ground so obviously the event occurred but we are left to infer this.Worse, the ending just sort of wraps up in an unsatisfactory narration which does close the arcs but it feels to me as if this book was meant to be Book 1 of a series. I can easily envision Book 2 opening showing some of the assumptions in the narrative to be wrong so our story continues perhaps in another area or later or both.Still, a good rousing read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"i really enjoyed finding this book. my grandfather is from india, and i wanted a fiction book that covered a bit of the history. not quite as broad as a rutherford novel, but quite interesting. the ending is quite abrupt, especially given the length of the novel. but quite enjoyable to those who like historical fiction or interested in india."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Can't believe I got this book for free. It was terrific. I've read a number of his books. Many of them were good, this one was my favorite."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"One of the best books I have read. It clearly demarcates fiction from true history. I gained immense knowledge about India. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"It was so much like Shogun that it was like reading the same story over again. I stopped reading it after a couple of chapters."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"The Moghul is an overlooked book that offers enough action, sex, violence and shady characters to keep you turning the pages until you sprain your thumb. During the reign of King James I, English Sea Dog, Brian Hawksworth, is sent on a mission by The British East India Company to try to break the Portuguese monopoly on trading with the sub-continent. Needless to say, the Portuguese do not consider this a great idea, and they do everything in their power to sink him at sea and assassinate him on land. As if India wasn't dangerous enough on its own with a drunken Moghul who allows his Persian wife and her brother, the Machiavellian Prime Minister, Nadir Sharif, to run the affairs of the nation.Hawksworth has a weakness for Indian luxuries, wine, and beautiful women. Don't we all? But, in this nation of myriad plots and sub-plots, he learns that nobody is what they appear to be on the surface. Not even Brian Hawksworth. He sees both sides of the issues as he first becomes a Khan at The Moghul's court and then gets caught up in the rebellion of the charismatic Prince Jadar. The book provides interesting background on Hindu, Sunni, Shiite, and Suffi religious traditions and lifestyles, not to mention a look at how Christian traditions appear to pre-colonial Indians. (One wife? Barbarous.) King James, whom many of us revere for the translation of The Bible he commissioned, does not fare well at the hands of Hoover. However, from what I have read of Stuart history, Hoover is dead on.In the long run, the book hangs on its characters. We root for the underdog Hawksworth, wonder what trick Nadir Sharif will pull next, admire the brains and beauty of the Queen and the exiled harem woman, Shirin, Hawksworth's only love interest (though hardly his only bedtime companion).A rousing adventure tale that will satisfy those who loved Shogun."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Thomas Hoover has taken the real history of the first interaction of English men with the Moghul court in India, and moulded it into a cracking good read. He sends his swashbuckling English sea captain, Brian Hawksworth, on the trip of a lifetime through 18th Century India. On his trip the Englishman is used and abused by various factions in the internal power struggles of India as he represents an opportunity to break the Portugese stranglehold on the Indian trade.He is exposed to Muslim and Hindu culture, exotic foods, drinks and drugs, overt sexuality and worship of the senses, heady music, tiger hunts, unbelievable wealth and fickle abuse of absolute power.A veritable feast for the senses, and a fun read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Thomas Hoover's Moghul is a story which will stimulate and please many people. It is a tale of adventure full of anticipation with a wonderful sense of being there. Character development complements the swashbuckling story showing human development much like that witnessed in Shogun.I thought it a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This epic takes place in early 17rh century India during the period of its early contact with England while all Indian trade was controlled by Portugal.The story line is based upon actual events of the period with many of the characters historical, including the prince who became Mogul against fierce odds and who had the Taj Mahal built in honor of his first wife, also portrayed in the book. The plot easily holds your interest as events unfold and complications increase for the English captain, ambassador to the court of the Mogul as well as for the main Indian characters due to the difference between friendly words and on-going intrigues.The book is full of both intricate and bold Intrigue, adventure, and believable characters. It is full of vivid historical descriptions of many facets of the period, such as costumes, decorations, customs, food, dancing, artistry, military, etc., the colorful descriptions fitting closely with the action narrative, not at all a distraction.It is obvious that the author did an enormous amount of research, including into original period documents, as well as enjoying the advice and editing of expert professors and others knowledgeable of the period.The read is very enjoyable, entertaining, educational, and moves right along with action, both in court as well as in the field. ."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This book isn't great literature, but it's well written, piqued and held my interest, and was entertaining. It's definitely not chick lit, and I suspect that my husband would also enjoy it, possibly even more than I did."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"BlurbIndia 1620: India is ruled by the son of the great Akbar, and is about to pass his crown to one of his sons. Brian Hawksworth, ship's captain and emissary of King James, must choose sides, but will he choose correctly? The future of England, and of India, depend on it.He had come to India to open trade for \\"barbaric\\" England and squeeze out the Portuguese, who try to kill him at every opportunity. But once on land, he becomes captivated by the country and the people. The beauty and romance of the exquisite Moghul Empire seduce him from his material goals to a new quest for supreme sensuality in music, mystical visions, and sacred lovemaking.From pulse-pounding sea battles, to tiger hunts, war elephants, harems and forbidden love--The Moghul takes you on a breath-taking tour of the India that existed before the British Raj.This is a long book! I have to say I enjoyed the first third of the book, but then, for me, it got bogged down in Indian politics of the time and made the reading a slow progress.The Moghul is not for the faint-heated and not one that you can easily put down for a few days and pick back up again. I did this and found myself lost. What makes it difficult is not only the foreign names, but the many characters. I am one who loves books that have numerous characters, but this book, with its unfamiliar place names and politics of the rulers of India at the time, was tough going in parts.The descriptions are wonderful and at the beginning the plot is clear and enjoyable, but sadly the middle to the end of the book lost some of its magic because of the weight of intrigue and I lost interest in those fighting for the kingdom.If the author had cut back on the politics I would have enjoyed the story much better.I did learn much about the early times of India though, which was very interesting.I read The Moghul by Thomas Hoover on my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"I guess the ultimate test of a good book for leisure reading is that you don't want the story to end. Add &#34;The Moghul&#34; to that list!This epic novel of an Englishman sent to India in order to break Portugal's trading monopoly gives a great, in-depth look at the people and customs of that era. Since it was loosely based on actual characters and events, I found lots of details about a period totally unfamiliar to me. While the twists and turns are sometimes not easy to follow, they reflect what must have been the character of the times.It's well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"First let me say that this book has some terrific characters, sinisterly dark political machinations together with exciting action scenes on both land and sea. The plot is very well described in the other reviews here, so I will keep this review to some personal observation I would like to share.Much as I enjoy descriptive writing we suffer overkill here as the author attempts to explain the sounds, rhythms and nuances of the sitar, or the drum accompaniment. Then we are asked to appreciate the appearance and performance of Indian dancers who's every hip-wriggle, bum-shake and stamping foot are lyrically detailed. Apart from the music and dance, we are assailed with reams of pages dedicated to intricate analyses of every facet of Indian life, love, cuisine, gardening, dress, religion, after-life, architecture..... the list goes on. As expert as the author clearly is in these areas, there is way, way too much quality plot time dedicated to this travelogue type text. The pace and excitement of the story for me, was seriously hindered by these descriptive elements. Apart from effectively increasing my speed-reading skills, this constant stalling of the unfolding adventure was a irritation.Was also disappointed that a book so long and detailed in the telling came to such an abrupt ending; leaving us in the middle of the gripping Indian political and military power struggle, and providing an apology of a mention to the possible ultimate fate of the principle fictional characters.This book is grammatically very well written with an almost complete absence of those annoying typos that abound in many Kindle efforts. That said, there was a regular misuse of dashes (colo-nial, Hawks-worth, ser-ious, etc.) that irritatingly appeared on almost every other page. Presume it was some sort of formatting glitch.Conclusion: I felt this was something of a missed opportunity to tell a thoroughly exciting, intriguing story with pace and action. I found the book enjoyable, but a slog; overlong and an ultimately, an unsatisfying reading experience... for me, that is."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"Interesting story with too much detail about British frigates, ships and officer rankings.The descriptions of India were very visual and full of opulence. Characters were mentioned and then dropped making the storyline hard to follow at times. However thread of the basic romance between a British commander and a beautiful Persian woman prevailed even to a disappointing and rushed ending."},{"Title":"The Moghul","review":"This book took me forever to read, in a busy period where my only time was the 15 minutes or so before I fell asleep each night...and yet, it held my interest completely, right to the end. I really LIKED Brian Hawkesworth, Shirin, Prince Jadar and to a lesser extent some of the other characters and really wanted to follow them through to the end of their story. The atmosphere of India in that period is well detailed without being boring, and I felt the writer had done his research thoroughly. Fans of Diana Gabaldon will like this one, I'd think.I've also read Caribbee by the same author, and this is by FAR the better of the two.Definitely read this one on your Kindle! If you were carrying a book, you'd need a wagon :-)"},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"For too many Americans, Mexico is terra incognita. Even most U.S. visitors have only partial impressions of this vast and variegated country based on a quick trip to the border, a holiday in Cancun, or a brief stopover in Mexico City. To make Mexico less of a distant neighbor for Americans, Alan Riding has written a superb, highly readable synthesis of Mexican psychology, history, politics, social issues, and regional diversity. Sure, &quot;Distant Neighbors&quot; is a bit dated at 16 years old, but it's still well worth reading today.The first chapter is a lucid description of national character to rival Thucydides or de Tocqueville. Mexicans may object to Riding's stereotypes but he's dead-on 95% of the time. Equally insightful is the way he deals with social issues (land, Indians, social well-being, and the family) and regional diversity. These six incisive chapters get to the heart of the nation's urgent problems and survey the country's dramatic contrasts. The historical and political sections are models of brevity and perspicuity. Even though the Mexican political system has changed out of all recognition since 1984, Mexico will be a long time dealing with, coming to terms with, or ridding itself of the 71-year legacy of one-party rule that Riding describes so well.Of course, every book has its weaknesses. The last chapter, a sort of &quot;whither Mexico&quot; postscript, should be read as an object lesson on the pitfalls of prognostication. The chapter on Central America is interesting but irrelevant. Although the overview of U.S.-Mexico relations provides good historical background, NAFTA has overthrown most of Riding's judgments on that score. The economy and culture sections are lucid but superficial.In sum, I highly recommend &quot;Distant Neighbors&quot; as a first-rate work of formidable breadth and depth written with exceptional grace and edited with meticulous care (amazingly, I couldn't find a single solecism)."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I bought and read this book twice in a time span of ten years. I was fascinated since I read it the first time. Being a mexican, Distant Neighbors provided me with insight from a foreigners perspective. It is not a plain book and can not be differet. As Mr. Riding explains so clearly, mexicans complexity and contradictions are due to the mixture of occidental and indian concepts.I can see myself in this book.In practice, the author speculates, the PRI would not survive in a democratic environment without provoking its own destruction. In theory it would have to change so much to the point of becoming unrecognizable. As I write this line, the PRI is in such stages! The words of Alan Riding are becoming a prophecy."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I had to read this book as part of a foreign study program in Cuernavaca, Mexico. It is a brilliant social history of the perception on the Mexican people. Our educational system is built around a brief New World history on top of an extensive European tradition; unfortunately the lands south of our borders generally aren't a part of our perception of history.Alan Riding makes this very plain early on in the book; in the first paragraph, he states, &quot;..nowhere in the world do two neighbors understand each other so little. More than by levels of development, [these] two countries are separated by language, religion, race, philosophy and history.&quot;Perhaps Riding can summarize his own purpose best when he wrote that &quot;the purpose of this book is to make Mexico more accessible to non-Mexicans. It is inspired not by a desire to expose the country's vulnerabilities, but by the belief that Mexico would be served if better understood by its northern neighbor.&quot;If you're interested in putting Mexico in a perspective complimentary to your boiler-plate knowledge of world history, read this book. After you read it, your mind will begin to &quot;look south&quot; when examining issues close to home (especially if you live near the US-Mexican border)."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I am surprised that people seem to be critical of Alan Riding's excellent work. The key here is an objectivity that is so seldom seen in this type of work. This is not a travel guide...it is a guide to understanding the differences that are real, profound, and do exist between two cultures. I was able to enjoy Riding's book as I purchased it shortly after moving to Mexico to work in 1993. It helped me so much that I have loaned copies (yes I have purchased more than one copy) and given them to visitors and other ex-pats working in Mexico. I am a Canadian citizen who is married to a Mexican citizen. This book has not only helped me understand Mexicans it has helped my marriage too! It is not Mr. Riding's place to critique or spew contempt for the PRI party, he merely provides the truth and lets the reader make up their mind. As far as Mexican people enjoying this book, I have passed it for review and commentary to Mexicans of all social classes and they all enjoyed the book and offered little in the way of unfavorable reviews. I have read Octavio Paz and the Labyrinth of Solitude and it is very introspective but very subjective. Riding may not be a poet, but he is also not a Mexican author who is subjectively speaking for an entire population. Alan Riding is a keen observer and he presents the facts! Read it and make up your own mind!"},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"As someone who has lived in Mexico, studied the country for over 15 years, and now teaches classes on Mexico, let me say that Riding's book is a classic. I have yet to find a single volume that offers so many insights into the country. Each chapter focuses on a different topic (e.g., the economy, the political system, culture, Mexico City, the indigenous communities, etc.) and each are readable apart from the others... There is an entire chapter, &quot;Corruption: Oil and Glue,&quot; devoted to the corrupt nature of the political system.The most biting &quot;criticism&quot; that can be leveled against this book is that it has become outdated. Chapters on the economy and the political system are obviously out of date. Significant economic, political, and social changes have taken place. But if you want to read ONE book on Mexico to understand the context for change today, you would be hard pressed to find a selection..."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"The Rocky Point (Puerto Penasco) Times calls this the best book in English about Mexico. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was some of the history. It needs someone to do an update of Fox's Presidency and Commandante Marcos.Growing up in New York, it was just a facsination. I now live in Tucson, Arizona. The border is an hour away. Distant Neighbors is an apt description. American and Mexicans talk past each other without really hearing each other. His best chapters? The beginning chapters about how the Mexican nation was born and the later chapters about the different regions of this diverse country. Distant Neighbors is my guide to start exploring beyond Nogales."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"Distant Neighbors sets the standard by which all books about the Mexican &quot;experience&quot; should be judged. Having read the works of Carlos Fuentes (my favorite author and intellectual), Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda and Octavio Paz, giants all to be sure, I have yet to to read a book that conveys to the uninformed regarding what it is to be Mexican, better than Distant Neighbors."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I really liked the book. I thought it provided a great overview of Mexican society and the Mexican personality, yet even more interesting was his descriptions within a historical context. Of course, you must keep from applying the personality descriptions in a stereotypical way, yet I thought the perspectives were helpful in understanding society as a whole. Several friends of mine in the US and Mexico have read it and felt it was an interesting overview of Mexico.My only frustration with the book is that it is so outdated, and Mexico has changed so much since the early 80's, that one is left wondering how his perspective might have changed with the events of the recent past.I would recommend this book to anyone as a basic introduction. I would begin your understanding of Mexico with this book, but I would also pursue deeper and more modern perspectives on Mexico as well."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"The book does offer excellent insights into the workings of the PRI and Mexican culture, particularly from 1960-1985, a period glossed over by other texts. However, with the emergence of Fox and PAN, its observations do not reflect Mexico's current profile. If you're seeking an understanding of Mexican history pre-1960, &quot;Mexico: A Biography of Power&quot; offers a far more thorough and rewarding read."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"The book was given to me as a gift when I first started working in Mexico in 1992. I found it extremely insightful. It helped me understand better what drives the morals, values and thought processes of the Mexican people. Over the years I have purchased many copies and given them away as gifts to friends who traveled to Mexico for work. This is NOT a travel guide. This book is for the person who will be considerable time with the Mexican people. This is for someone who is willing to invest time and deep thought to better understand what drives these beautiful loving people."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"Alan Riding's book-length description of the people and culture of Mexico is as broad as the Rio Grande, as sprawling as the Sierra Madre, and as dry as Lake Texcoco. Dated, too, published in 1985, well before NAFTA and the collapse of Mexico's long-ruling PRI party, but what really hurts the readability of this book is Riding's total disengagement from the subject.\\"At risk of caricature, a typical Mexican family can still be stereotyped,\\" Riding writes. \\"The father is the undisputed figure of authority who has little respect for - or communication with - his wife. He expects to be served royally at home, but he spends much of his time and money drinking with friends or visiting his mistress. He pays minimal attention to his children, although he carries great importance to having a male firstborn who carries his name. The mother, rejected as a wife and a lover by her husband, tries to alleviate...\\"Riding goes on like this for a while, but I won't. What really annoyed me about \\"Distant Neighbors\\" aren't his generalizations (they may be perfectly valid) but the tone of jaded detachment behind it. He might as well be tracking hippos in Zambia for all the passion he derives from his subjects.Another thing I had trouble with: What exactly is \\"Distant Neighbors\\" about? The title seems to suggest the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and he starts in that vein noting how odd it is two such different countries share so long a border. But the theme isn't carried through the rest of the book, which deals just with Mexico. The idea then seems to be the \\"distant neighbors\\" of class, beliefs, and ethnicity that divide this closely-packed country. If so, it is not drawn out.Riding covers a lot of ground, though more with dates and statistics then by capturing the voices of real Mexicans. When he finally returns to the subject of Mexican-U.S. relations in the last fourth of the book, it's a well-observed narrative with striking observations, like how deep the wounds of the Mexican War still penetrate the Mexican psyche and how badly Mexican President Lopez Portillo got on with U.S. President Carter. Oddly, Lopez Portillo was friendlier with Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, despite the wider gulf in their ideologies; Riding notes deftly how this bespeaks a certain divide between rhetoric and reality where Mexican politics are concerned.But for the most part, \\"Distant Neighbors\\" is a relentless, reflexively pessimistic book. \\"The system has in fact never lived without corruption and it would disintegrate or change beyond recognition if it tried to do so,\\" he writes, as if one would be as bad as the other.Worse, it lacks a sense Riding really invested himself of where he lived and worked for years as Mexico City bureau chief for the New York Times. Timesmen like Hedrick Smith (\\"The Russians\\") and Thomas Friedman (\\"From Beirut To Jerusalem\\") managed to produce books about past beats that give the reader a real flavor, and even zest, for the places and the people they describe. Riding, by contrast, gives you the feeling he couldn't wait to leave Mexico. In his hands, neither can you."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"The main reason I bought this book is because the description said it had to do with the Mexican Drug Cartels. Not really talks about it; more like a history of Mexico. It's alright."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"It seems to me that Alan Riding wanted to write the ultimate book about Mexico, but that he was so desperate about being quoted that he exaggerates easily and allows himself a lot of &quot;poetic licenses&quot;. There is a lot of gossip and common places in the text, half truths and many myths about the country (specially about the indians and their culture) that the american public eagerly wants to believe.I am a middle class mexican, living in an average city and my family is quite traditional, and I dont see my reflection or my &quot;portrait&quot; in this abundant description of the mexican society. I wonder if he was living in another country or probably in the poorest regions of Mexico while doing his investigation?The only thing that is worth mentioning is the 440 pages manuscrit (in the spanish version) which must ve taken a hell of time."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I found this book excessively dry and too detailed. This is typical of British authors. Quite frankly, I simply cannot understand how any modern commentator on the mexican scene can do anything but condemn in the fullest manner the long, tremendously destructive rule of the PRI. The only thing you can give them credit for is the stability of the country during their rule. And the gains they claim to have made reminds me of the same claims you heard from communists a few years ago eg. Fidel Castro. The author nowhere in here condemns the rule of the PRI. Finding the bottom line to most chapters is difficult. It is , however , a good read for someone who is quite interested in the travails of modern mexico. But, you must have an eye for detail and a general sympathy with quasi-marxist-socialist third world governments to get through it. Mr. Riding was bureau chief of the NYT for six years in mexico and worked for the now Labour supporting Financial Times of London. In this book this shows."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"If you want to read a book about the way Mexicans think, read Paz's &quot;Laberynto de la Soledad&quot;. Besides, &quot;Laberynth of Solitude&quot; is where Riding gets most of his &quot;stuff&quot;."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I read this book 10 years ago (Sapnish version) when a was living in Mexico and gave it a try again a few months ago (English version)after living in the Sates for Several years and the feeling after reading it is different , I can see now Mexico from the distance and compare my point of view, as a Northern Mexican , with this book , and i can say that this book is a very acurate description of &quot;mexicanism&quot; from a Chilango point of view."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I read this book years ago and still use it as a reference. I have traveled and studied in Mexico for many years and speak Spanish. So few Americans really understand Mexico, especially the roots of corruption, things like Mordidas, the military, police etc. This book enlightens and explains. A number of Mexican friends (certainly not those in the Government)agree. The sad fact is there are many things about Mexico that the Mexican government would rather not discuss or have us know. One of the reasons so few books deal honestly with the problems of Mexico. This book or (any book) that deals honestly with the problems of Mexico must necessarily risk engendering some feelings of hopelessness among some readers but such is, often, the nature of truth."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in Mexico. Covers all facets of Mexico and reads like a novel. I don't know if it has been updated to take into account the present situation in the country. Even if it hasn't, it's good reading.AdT"},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"It's a sign of how essential this book is that older reviews express frustration that it's twenty years out of date. But this paperback comes with an extensive Afterword about the historic peaceful surrender of power by the dominant party [which created euphoria depressingly like the hopeful Obama election], and I hope Riding finds time to cover the Fox years and the tragic unraveling of Mexico following the bitter Bush vs Gore-like elections of 2006.I have just re-read this book - a good one for skipping around to different topics if that's your bent - and the puzzle was how an economist could write so well and so engagingly. Riding, it turns out, is a Shakespeare scholar! Reader comments in his \\"Essential Shakespeare Handbook,\\" written with Leslie Dunton-Downer, could apply to \\"Distant Neighbors\\":\\"... also a good read (a quality lacking in most books of this type)\\"!Riding is too good an historian to be judgmental, but he's a bit hard on the Mexican father. Fortunately, there's a very different book that shines a bright light on the Mexican mindset in a realm Riding hasn't lived, having been ambassador and dealt mainly with the upper echelons. \\"Con Respeto... An Ethnographic Portrait\\" by Guadalupe Valdes plumbs the depths of the financially struggling but deeply committed, famously strong Mexican family. The couples she follows rely on each other far too much to be abusive. To his credit, Riding does point out that the higher up the socio-economic ladder, the more likely husbands are to physically \\"correct\\" (and cheat on) their wives. \\"Con Respeto\\" studies the poignantly steadfast marriages on the lower rungs of that ladder.(In our nation of spoiled brats, we have a great deal to learn from Mexicans, something no one seems eager to point out.)\\"Distant Neighbors\\" has become a classic because it's so well informed and reads like a novel. A must-read."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"I first got an introduction to this book in 2006. I was supposed to read it for a literature class and never finished the first chapter, but I was thoroughly impressed by what I did read. Being Mexican myself and having grown up in the U.S., I did have a craving for an understanding of the culture I did not get to thoroughly know. This has clarified so many aspects of Mexican life and custom to me, it really is an incredible read."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"This book provides an analysis of Mexico since the Spanish Conquest, with an emphasis on the 20th century. The book is equal part historical essay, economic tract, and social commentary. Written for an American audience of college-level reading ability, the book examines all the different facets of Mexico, from its native populations, to its flirtation with communism, to its troubled relationships with the USA. Written during the mid-1980's, there is only a brief mention of the illicit drug trade, which really did not come to dominate US-Mexican relations until the 1990's. There is a whole chapter on immigration to the US, however like the rest of the book, it is written more like an essay when some tables of numbers would have helped. Overall, an OK book."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"excellent book for anybody who wants to know a little better the mexican culture and their problematic ways of life. This is a book with a prespective from somebody who is not mexican, awesome analysis."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"This is a terrific book. The history section is naturally outdated, but some people could still benefit from this book:-Businessmen: you usually deal with rich people when you come here and the upper-class in here has not evoluted very much since the mid 80's. It seems they have changed quite a bit, but not so. Most of them are still pretty much the same deeply religious Catholic people. You could meet their daughters who have gone to rich nations to get college education; many of those women even work, but eventually let their husbands make the money. You can see how this upper class has not changed in the fact that they rule the business world here and most companies are being wiped out by foreign competition. They are not innovating or changing. In other times they would blame the government for their misfortunes but the current government is made of this type of people.-Exchange students: Again, you are likely to deal with rich people so read paragraph above.-Students majoring in Mexican or Latin studies: Even when it outdated you'll hardly find a book that keep again from Liberal or Conservatives agendas. The book presents a very balanced view of the Mexico conquest by then Spaniards. Traditional Liberal textbooks portray the Spaniards as the bad guy. But this books shows that the Indian were always in wars, they helped the Spaniards to get rid o the Aztec oppression and the Spaniards stopped the human sacrifices. You will really need to read these sections in order to have a more balanced view of Mexico.The author even considered the relationships of Mexico with Central America. That was good indeed; many people in here seem to think that beyond our borders only rich countries exist. This why when many journalist complain about mistreatment of Mexican in US, some others well state the Mexico doesn't treat Central American well either."},{"Title":"Distant Neighbors","review":"Alan Riding's classic book that sets out to explain to Americans how Mexican think and feel, what the historical basis is for their feelings and thought, and how Americans can relate this knowledge to their own terms: remains one of the most important works of our times, if for no other reason than the fact that we continually become more and more enmeshed with our Southern neighbor in trade and immigration issues, and in the problems arising form the the drug trade. Our almost complete ignorance of the Mexican mindset keeps us at a disadvantage in our dealings with the Mexicans, who take the time to understand us and learn our language, while we generally remain completely in the dark about the nature of their society, which is so remarkably different from our own. Riding sets out very systematically to give us a remarkably concise and well constructed outline of the Mexican character and historical experience, including such subjects as the meaning of the verb &quot;chingar&quot;, which conveys the historical trauma represenated by the interplay between the Mexican achetype mother figure of La Malinche and the father figure of Hernan Cortes. This subject has been expounded by Nobel laureate Octavio Paz and other renowned Mexican authors much to the rejuvenation of Mexican political and cultural thought, and Riding shows the value of understanding this somewhat oblique subject for Americans who wish to see what really makes Mexicans &quot;tick&quot;.

The book was published in 1883. The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age. This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure. There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't. Some of these people use others just to get what they want. I did not like the book at all. It could not keep my attention. I found the book quite boring. The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it. It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it. Personally it has way too much violence for me. But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more. All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons. I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Back in the days when young men and women read adventure tales there was none better in the adolescent genre that the imimitable Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94). Stevenson was a Scottish Presbyterian who was trained in law but forsook it for the sake of fiction. Among his classics are \\"The Black Arrow\\"; \\"Kidnapped\\" and his great novella\\"Dr Jekyll and Mister Hyde.\\" Stevenson was a sufferer of TB and died at the too young age of 44.Treasure Island was published in 1883. It began as a story Stevenson narrated to his wife's son Lloyd Osborne.It tells the thrilling tale of buried treasure on Treasure Island. The island is fictional but Stevenson seems to have located it near the California coast. He lived in California for a time. Jim Hawkins is the teenage narrator. When the old seadog Billy Bones comes to the Admiral Benbow Inn he carries with him a map of Treasure Island. Bones had been a sailor on a sea expedition led by the pirate Captain Flnt; he had just received a black spot sign of death from the blind sailor Pew.Hawkins joins forces with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey and later Captain Smollett aboard the Hispanolia in search of the buried treasure. On the ship there are 19 mutineers led by the one legged Long John Silver and his famous parrot Captain Flint. After a series of adventures and much violence the treasure of 700,000 pounds is discovered and Hawkins returns home a rich young lad.Stevenson is good in melodramatic action and in characterization influenced by his mentor Sir Walter Scott. Clearly drawn characters such as Silver, Ben Gunn, and the evil Israel Hands are colorfully drawn. The author is adept at word painting excelling in lush descriptive passages of the sea journey and Treasure Island. He has borrowed the parrot from Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\" featuring young Jim Hawkins is not a deep work but is purely and simply an adventure tale to be read and reread as long as the art of writing and the practice of reading are part of civilized life."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"It my opinion that RLS excels in the short story/novella genres, and is somewhat lacking in momentum in longer stories and novels."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Our school was trying to match an existing set of Treasure Island books.These books were exactly what we wanted, and following our order, we received them very quickly."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Perfect condition; great price.

Wyeth illustrations. A great addition to any library with a piratical bent of mind."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The classic pirate tale by Stevenson, \\"Treasure Island\\" has been retold in various forms for the last 100 years. And there is a good reason why this story has been kept alive, as it is a classic adventure tale and a coming-of-age tale. It is geared toward a younger audience, but a reader of any age should find this tale entertaining and an easy read.Throughout the book, the unlikely hero of Jim Hawkins emerges. He is first introduced aa a fearful young boy, who runs to his mother in the face of intruders to their seaside inn. However, Jim quickly matures as cabin-boy of the treasure-seeking ship, and he soon realizes his full potential as a young hero. Although he may be impulsive, his actions help to defeat the pirates. Indeed, Jim shows his bravery and intelligence as he attempts to capture the ship away from the mutineers single-handedly.Certainly an overriding theme is that of greed and desire. The nobleman Trelawney becomes giddy and gleeful when he hears of a possible treasure and quickly procures a ship and crew. The pirates, or \\"gentlemen of fortune\\", lead their whole lives whose sole purpose is the pursuit of wealth by whatever means necessary. Indeed, it is this greed and burning desire for gold that eventually leads to their downfall.Overall, this is a great adventure tale that appeals to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. The author described the characters and the settings very well. The author used very interesting word choices and he used very interesting ideas in the book. I had trouble understanding the old English words in the dialect which was sometimes incomplete. For example when the pirates are talking to each other they would talk with incomplete sentences which made it hard to follow.My favorite character in the book was Jim. He was clever and brave. Jim was the narrator in the story and the main character. This book took place in the time when pirates sailed the oceans. The story starts when a strange pirate arrives at Jim's family inn. Then, the pirate was visited by unfriendly pirates looking for his treasure map. Tha inspired Jim to go treasure hunting himself.I think that the book was too hard for me to understand the dialect. It was also hard for me to remember the characters in the book. It was also hard for me to determine if the characters were the good guys or the bad guys. Another thing I did not like about the book was that it took a long time to get into action and it made me want to not read on. The book would be very hard for people under grade 6. Since I am a six grade student and it was challenging for me. I would recommend the book for people over the age of 12.

His parrot was also a high point and should've played a more active role, albeit inane tidbits.

It has a nice face page followed by the Table of Contents which is well set up, followed by an Introduction which gives a good history of Robert Louis Stevenson. Although the book was originally written more for boys, several of my friends and I enjoyed the book in our pre-teen years. There is also a page of \\"Suggestions for Further Reading.\\" The book is broken up into six areas each with three to seven parts. Pre-teens and teens may find the book interesting as it contains mystery and much adventure which takes place back in the days of large sailing ships and pirates. There is an APPENDIX A: 'MY FIRST BOOK\\" (1894) andAPPENDIX B: TALES OF A TRAVELLER at the end of the book.Adults who like adventure stories might enjoy this book as well."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I thought it was a very good book.

His mom and dad take care of teh inn. Jim's life was just as normal as any other kid's in teh 1700's until one day an old seaman came and registered at the inn. All was alright with the seaman until one day he fell dead. A map was foujnd in the seaman's jacket. Jim gaters up a crew to seek the treasure,only later finding themselves sailing with some of Flin'ts bloodthirsty crew. Will Jim get out of this mess alive? Will Flint's crew leave them on the island?Positive Points: It puts barriers in the way of Jim. He doesn't just go to the island, find the treasure, and go home. That would be a short and boring story plot. Jim has to get around Flint's crew and other barriers. Robert Louis Stevenson shows grea action and suspense in his writing.Negative Points: The ending is a little of a let-down. It doesn't have very much action. It may be hard to do, but if a book has action throughout, it would be a five-star easily.I think my rating would be 4 1/2, becaust it wasn't a very exiting ending.

This book delves into the lives of farm animals as they try to create their own perfect society away from the entrapments of man. This book begins with the pigs taking charge, of the pigs two strong leaders emerge Napoleon, and Snowball, and each of them feels they are the best. Eventually, Napoleon chases Snowball off using viscious dogs that he raised from pups so he has the majority of the power. The irony in this book is awesome it comes rushing at you like a flash flood. This book is targeted for young adult readers, and it is a quick read.Anyone would like this book from the fifth grade on up. Allthough it is more suited for raders ages 13-24 due to the subject matter. Animal Farm is based on animals turning a society that was democratic into a communist one. The society that was intended to make life easier actually made it a more miserable existance for all. &quot;All animals that year worked like slaves.&quot;Animal Farm deeply dives into the ideals of a society without flaw, and then slowly turns into communism, and a dictatorship. The writer reveals the irony of the perfect society turning communist brilliantly. The ideals of the animals change drastically in this book, and it is perfectly boud together so that it will really make you think.This book was very well written. It presents a great deal of politics, and the idea of an Utopian Society. Animal Farm slowly reaveals all the animals ideals turning into the very thing they despised on the first place.Young adults will thouroughly enjoy Animal Farm. It shows that there is no such thing as a perfect society , and there is no point looking for one.

These books are often found on those hated list (hated by any kid out there) of \\"have to read\\" in any school in the world. One of those books definitely is Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. When you look at the book and its contents wihout joy and with sensations of punishment if you fail to accomplish the task that has been given to you, no book can prove any kind of enjoyment, or artistic eye-opening, whatever you like the best.But, every now and then, when you are older, and you try to remember those dear times that are long gone, and you try to evoke them by any means avaliable, sickness that is peculliar to humankind, sickness that we often call nostalgia, you stumble upon some hidden jewel, and suddenly, that that has been covered in dust for many years, starst to shine with a brilliant light and you cannot avert your eyes.There is great ammount of all kind of adventure books out there today, many of those will never be read, reasons being what they are, and there are books, like this one that will often remain in our memory as brilliant example of something that existed in some other time.Story of Jim Hawkins, pirate Long John Silver and their treasure hunt, story that would be called shallow and naive in these days, is wonderfull adventure novel, with charaters so charming in their naivette, with their archaic english, with sea-faring that evokes waves of never-felt nostalgia, with corsairs, pirates, ruthless crimes, chivalry, cunning and many of those long forgotten atributes of world and novels that are being rewritten (or deconstructed) nowadays.In search for your own treasure, whether the one of your spirit, culture, or what-you-like, you should stare back for a moment and remind yourself of the times when you were kid, and when the world was much simpler than it is today."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is at turns dreadfully dull and blood-poundingly enthralling. Be prepared to plow through the mire of overly detailed passages relating tactical events to get to the great character-building climaxes. The people in this story were to me so much more interesting than the plot.It may be my own deficiency that I wasn't able to enjoy the action in this adventure story, but it seemed to drag on and on, and many times I had to force myself to re-read paragraphs to understand the development of a situation. When it comes to the characters in the book, however, I am transported to a movie set in my mind. I appreciate the impact this book has had on swashbuckling tales and our perception of pirate culture. For that we are indebted to Stevenson's imagination. I'd just rather see the film."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book Treasure Island is an exciting book. It contains mutineers, pirates, and a big treasure it is a challenging book to read though. There are loops and turns around every corner. Jim, the mail character came across a ship called the Hispaniola, and rode it for the rest of the book. He takes on many troubles throughout the book. At first, he meets a man called Long John Silver. He seems very nice at first but at the end he turns very evil.There tends to be mutinies when a ship sets off for treasure. And that's exactly what happens. One day, the ship is sailing on and BOOM! There sounds a gunshot! The wicked mutineers attack the ship killing one person, shooting them in the head. But it's not over yet! Three muskets go off at a time and one of the mutineers falls. The fight goes on and it is soon found out that the mutineers had lost more souls then the ships company and that was good for Jim.At one point in the book, Jim comes across a man that was on an island that had been marooned and he had been there for over three years and had to live off eating goat.The sentence structure of the book was a very hard. The sentences were very hard to read and there were a lot of things going on at the same time and it never seemed to end. One reason that the book was so hard was it was almost a different kind of English. The book was written in the late 1800 so it was very hard to understand. The sentences were long and choppy and they went on. But on the other hand some sentences were only two words.The word choice of the book was two ways mostly. That means that some words were long and some words were very short. But the words were switched around so it was even harder to read.The description of the book was not so great. Robert didn't describe the setting too well. Sometimes you couldn't tell where Jim was at some points because of the poor description.My opinion of the book was not so great and it was hard to understand because of the word choice and the settings were very bad at some points. At one part of the book Jim comes off the ship and it doesn't explain what was happening and it seemed there was something missing. And at some points it seemed that they were too long and you were waiting for something else to happen and it got boring. After some sentences it was so confusing that you had to read it again until you got what was going on. That was hard to do and that's one reason I didn't like the book all that much.I think that the appropriate age for reading this book is about teen. I think that it was not so good fir my age because I didn't understand it all that much, and if someone were older, then they have a better learning experience and they can understand the hard words. I am only eleven years old and this book is not such a good book for my age. But everyone has there own opinion and some people have different reading abilities.Ben Schwartz 6th Grade"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Over all I thought the book Treasure Island was somewhat good. I thought at some parts some of it was quite confusing. I do not think it was the writers fault for my confusion. I was confused simply because the book was a bit too challenging for me. I think I could of enjoyed it more if I was older reading it. My favorite part of the book was when they finally found the treasure in the caves. Another part that I liked was towards the beginning of the book when the boy was with captain at the inn. I enjoyed the pirate fights too. Also I enjoyed very much the way the pirates talked in the book because how they used phrases such as \\"shiver me timbers\\", \\"arrg\\" as well as other similar phrases. The book was not too predictable. I think the author was very clever. I would have never guessed that the treasure would be hidden then re-hidden! That is why I like the book.There are many reasons why I do not like the book. One thing is that it often went on about things that didn't have to do with the book that much. The pirates would have very long conversations with each other and they took away from my understanding of the plot even though that was probably the authors goal so that I wouldn't guess the ending of the story. It did not have any humor or jokes at all in the conversations or throughout the book, if there were jokes then I was not old enough to understand them. Also, I could not memorize the names of all the pirates. Therefore when they mentioned a name that was not a main character, I did not know whom the Author was talking about. I also did not like how I did not get to know the characters and their personality that well before another character was introduced. Some of these names were: Mary, Tom, and Frank!? I think if I got to know the characters more, it would of made book even better. I also thought there were too many characters. The story was not touching. Unless bad guys randomly killing people, greedy mutinous pirates, and boys taking maps from dead people is touching to you. For so much plot, I didn't feel like I was in the story. It was not compelling. It did not give me any life morals either. I had trouble telling if the characters were good or bad as well. His book was definitely not my favorite but for sure no my least favorite. It could have been more enjoyable. All in all I thought the book was ok. His is why I rated my book 2 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I hadn't read Treasure Island in many years, but when I saw that it was available for my new Kindle I downloaded it. A good move for me, as I had forgotten how great it is. Although I was a teenager when I first read it, I think I enjoy it even more now that I am over 60.

Yes, the language used takes some getting used to, and it is certainly quite different from what most youngsters are reading these days in terms of the language style and form, but the themes in this literary classic are still relevant today and those who are not put off by the style will appreciate this work.

The writing style may be considered a bit dull by today's standards, but I really liked reading this. This is the original pirate adventure book. Yo ho ho!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I picked this one up for the kids and ended up just reading it to myself one day because I had missed it in my youth. It really is a great story and is well told."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Often considered a children's book, Treasure Island, like all great children's books, can be readily enjoyed by all. Though very different from current children's works, it certainly has much that young readers are likely to enjoy - rollicking adventure, an astonishingly quick pace, great suspense, colorful characters, an engaging young narrator, etc. However, it has at least as many elements that anyone can appreciate, such as deft plotting; few works draw us in so immediately or are as well put together, and the action never lets up. It is very hard to put the book down even after more than a century; modern thrillers certainly have nothing on it. For pure adventure and excitement, it is nearly impossible to top. The plain, straightforward prose is still lucid, and Treasure has the great virtue of being easy for anyone to read. Perhaps what really makes the book, though, are its characters. The notorious Long John Silver is the most famous, a splendid and unforgettable creation; he is one of the most lively and simply fascinating characters ever. Many others are also memorable, not least Jim Hawkins, one of literature's most notable young protagonists and narrators.Treasure belies its children's story origins in several ways, such as strong binary oppositions between heroes and villains in regard to alcohol, religion, thriftiness, etc. However, it has many serious, even thought-provoking themes; for example, it is in large part a very fine bildungsroman, which young readers will certainly appreciate. That said, reading it shows just how much children's stories have changed; such a work would never be considered, much less marketed as, a children's story now. This is most obviously due to surprisingly graphic violence and a strong glimpse or real evil; more fundamentally, it has much to do with moral murk. The good/evil distinction is far less clear than it first seems. For instance, Silver is very hard to pin down; no character can dislike him fully, and much the same can be said of readers. This may go a long way toward explaining the seemingly mysterious fact that he is by far the best-known character, is often depicted at worst as ambivalent, and has had his name used for such things as a fast food chain. He somewhat recalls Shakespeare's Richard III in that we are - somewhat perversely - drawn to him because of his evil, but the issue is very complex and subtle. None can deny that he has several conventional virtues, including bravery, determination, and resourcefulness. Conversely, the heroes' actions also give us much to think about, as does Treasure itself; to begin with, it deals with several important morality questions like justice, law, mercy, etc. All this will more than satisfy those expecting something more than adventure, though the book certainly has plenty of that.Treasure is one of the few books that everyone should truly read. It has become a true cultural institution, still immensely popular and constantly adapted. If nothing else, one should at this point read it just to see its immense effect on the popular consciousness, especially the view of pirates and everything associated with them, which the book virtually invented. There are few books I would recommend unhesitatingly to readers of all ages; this is one, and I recommend it very strongly indeed."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I was not expecting much when I started to read this book. I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure. The book is scary, with some real surprises and well-developed characters, and I loved it."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This classic went to a 7-year old boy.

It's enduring appeal to generations of adventure loving boys (big and small) is sufficient proof. I have read this book many times including even in Latin (yes, there is such an edition:Insula Thesauraria (Latin Edition)) and still find it an exciting read. After all, what could be more appealing than a tale of vicious pirates, a fabulous treasure and a journey into the unkown across exotic seas? Another exciting book isThe Drum, equally suitable for young readers by AEW Mason."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"How can you even review the ultimate pirate book of all time? I read it when I was 9 and loved it. I read it again when I was 34 and loved it again! (Actually, I read it several times between, as well.) Long John Silver is arguably one of the most Macchiavellian characters you will ever find between the covers of a book. (I'm mainly reviewing it to raise the average rating. Anyone who thinks this book is boring has to have a screw loose!) From the arrival of the mysterious Billy Bones, to the attack on the inn, to the sea voyage, to the mutiny, to the battle for the island, to the treasure hunt, even to the final fate of John Silver, this book is a stunning rollercoaster of suspense and adventure! I'd give it ten stars if I could.Here's a bit of information you other readers might enjoy: the meaning of the pirates' song--Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!The real-life pirate, Edward Teach (Blackbeard the Pirate) once marooned 15 of his men on a small island named Dead Man's Chest.

My review analyzes the novel Treasure Island by Robert Lewis Stevenson. Treasure Island was first published as a book in 1883. It has an enormous influence on the modern day perception of pirates, from their association with tropical islands and the \\"X\\" marking the spot where treasure is hidden; to the image of pirates with a wooden leg, parrots on their shoulders, scarred faces, and three cornered hats.Treasure Island is a magical treasure hunting adventure on the high seas. The book is filled with pirates, mutiny and swashbuckling. It is told from the perspective of a boy Jim Hawkins. The story is filled with such unforgettable characters as the pirate Long John Silver, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney as they sail in search riches hidden on the mythical Treasure Island. The book opens in the Admiral Benbow inn, where Jim lives. Following a series of strange events involving a blind beggar, an old sea chest, and a scar faced old sailor; Jim becomes involved in the sea bound search for Treasure Island. The characters end up on a tropical island but find themselves caught up in a dangerous mutiny. This culminates in a battle with the mutineers in which several of the men are killed. Finally the search for the buried treasure commences. The story ends with the finding of the treasure and the marooning of the former mutineers.Due to the time period in which Treasure Island was written, the language and sentence structure is complex and at times can be difficult to understand. Stevenson writes with a precise attention to detail and plot occasionally gets lost in the minor points of the story. I think that while Treasure Island is a great book, I would only recommend it to older readers owing to the complexity of the story. Although it can be tedious with its long descriptions and many fine points, I really enjoyed reading Treasure Island and would recommend it as a wonderful introduction to more complex novels."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I have a copy of this as well as the one with Wyeth illustrations. I prefer this for the kids as there are more illustrations throughout the book, it is a bit larger and pages printed to give a parchment look. The quality of the illustrations is outstanding. This is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"All four things mentioned above can be found at your fingertips with Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island.\\" Before Johnny Depp stumbled off of the Black Pearl, before Errol Flynn took us on swashbuckling journeys, and even before \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey took to the water, Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins thrilled fans of high-seas adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" tells the story of one young Jim Hawkins. It starts off in the simple setting of a family-owned inn where we are introduced to Billy Bones, an old seadog who has a secret. After a couple of visits from some strange characters, a confrontation occurs and a treasure map lands into the hands of Hawkins. From there, we set sail on the Hispaniola with Hawkins, the squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, the sea cook Silver, and a whole slew of pirates and scoundrels in general. All are after the treasure of Captain Flint, who graciously marked his treasure map with an \\"X\\" to show the way to the riches.This is a wonderful tale of intrigue, double-crossing, greed, and swordplay. Promoted as a children's book, I'm sure that any adult will find this story captivating as well. Robert Louis Stevenson is a literary legend and deserves that honor based on this book alone. However, if you read this book and are interested to read more of Stevenson's work, check out \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" \\"Kidnapped,\\" and \\"The Black Arrow.\\" He also wrote a number of traveling books which are also fun to read.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I sure hope that kids, and adults too, are still out there reading this book. What an amazing gift to English literature. I can still see in my mind the worn hardback copy of Treasure Island at my hometown library. This is the one book that I can remember reading two or three times over when I was a kid. I recently read it again to my own kids, and delighted in the masterful storytelling and drama of the book. The story is complex but well-known: Jim Hawkins, the resourceful son of an infirm innkeeper, finds himself the possesser of a pirate's treasure map. The benevolent greed that grips the town's merchants who want to exploit the map eventually leads to the malicious greed of a band of murderous and mutinous pirates led by the cunning and deceitful Long John Silver (who would enjoy a second career as a fried fish pitchman). The single-minded pursuit of GOLD leads all of these men to face the sea, disease, and privation, and to kill each other. The story ends well enough from our protagonist's point of view, but it all seems quite \\"realistic\\" and gritty. Don't pass this one over - a classic, richly told and written well, that deserves a place in your canon."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I am dumbfounded by the reviews that my peers have given Treasure Island. This book is a masterpiece of children's literature. It has everything one could hope for: action, intrigue, pirates, buried treasure... What more does it need? I, too, read the novel for my class, but it did not put me to sleep at all. Instead I couldn't put it down and had to read by flashlight after my Mom made me turn out my lights. It was incredible. Long John Silver is a creepy guy! As for the other reviewers who are my age, I hope you adults do not judge my generation by their ignorance and unwillingness to accept anything without man eating dinosurs. Treasure Island is an excellent novel."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I had already tried reading my copy of this book when I was far younger, but I was not as avid a reader as I am these days. Recently, parted from my copy, I picked up an old nondescript hardcover of Treasure Island at the library to complete the book in its entirety.I found the first half of the book highly enjoyable, one that I recalled warmly as I re-read it. But as the book progressed, I was astounded at how difficult the reading was becoming; the pirate slang and their use of strange metaphors obviously grew proportionate to the amount of pirates in the scene. In one of the few moments of humor, the hero Hawkins even says, \\"\`Well,' I said, \`I don't understand one word that you've been saying. But that's neither here nor there[...].'\\" The dialects makes the book that much more realistic; in my mind, however, I wonder if children reading this book fully comprehend it, or were they simply smarter in the 19th century? After spoiling myself with easy modern thrillers, I had to hunker down and really concentrate my efforts in trying to understand the subtext. The rough slang slowed my reading down greatly, but increased my enjoyment. And, of course, having finally completed the book and knowing the true story, my re-read in a few years will be thrice as good!In 1881, while vacationing in Scotland, Stevenson painted an island with his stepson which became the inspiration for the novel. He soon wrote 15 chapters, and completed the rest in Switzerland at the rate of one chapter a day. It was finally published as an entire novel in 1883.Stevenson throws together goods that have become legendary in pirate lore: Pirates with fantastic names, like Captain Flint, Billy Bones, Black Dog, Pew, Israel Hands (based on the real-life member of Blackbeard's crew), and the now-infamous Long John Silver, himself with a parrot on his shoulder; a single treasure map that has three red crosses (designating two piles of treasure, one pile of arms); a beautiful schooner that's put through its paces; a 23 member crew (excluding Jim Hawkins, Doctor Livesey, and Squire Trelawney), most of whom become gentlemen of fortune; mutiny; double-crosses; the shanty \\"15 men on a Dead Man's chest/Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\"; the notorious Jolly Roger; spirits, superstition, and lore; and even a skeleton or two.Treasure Island actually refers to the fictitious Skeleton Island---perhaps an inspiration for the children's book The Secret of Skeleton Island (1966)---, a sweltering jungle in the day and eerily submerged in mists in the early mornings. A strange coincidence I found led me to some interesting finds. Stevenson named an anchorage point after the pirate Captain Kidd. In 1935, Harold T. Wilkins published a book entitled \\"New Facts about Mysterious Captain Kidd and his Skeleton Island Chests,\\" in which can be found one of Kidd's treasure maps. Two years after Wilkins's book was published a treasure hunter found an uncanny resemblance between this \\"Skeleton Island\\" and Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Oak Island's impervious Water Pit is purportedly where Captain Kidd buried part of his treasure before being hanged in 1701 (the Pit is also the main inspiration for the 1998 novel Riptide). In a twist worthy of Robinson himself, despite Kidd's map uncovering some of Oak Island's mysteries, Wilkins eventually stepped forward to admit his maps were fabricated. But was Stevenson alluding to Kidd's connection with Oak Island?Treasure Island is an adventurous classic I heartily recommend anyone to read. I personally advocate reading the book if you're older, or re-reading it, to fully enjoy the environment created through the striking language. A fantastic aid in understanding pirate slang is the online Encyclopaedia Piratica. While you're at it, go to any map engine and plug in the latitude and longitude found at the end of Chapter 6, \\"The Captain's Papers,\\" to see where Billy Bones claimed booty!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Simply put, this is an excellent book! I didn't read it until I was 37, but it was worth the wait. I certainly would not classify this as a children's book at all. In fact, I strongly suspect that the few negetive reviews this book has received here have been due to children being forced to read it in school. My view is if you force a child to read anything, he's going to hate it. The fact that the book was written over a hundred years ago, when people talked very differently than they do today, and novels were written very differently also, spells disaster for anyone expecting a child to understand it, let alone like it. That aside, this is still a wonderful book full of adventure with descriptions that are vivid only if you have a vast vocabulary. If you can get through the first chapter, it gets easier and it's definately worth the time and effort to read. I loved it and plan to read it again very soon. Do yourself a favor and ignore any negetive comments you've seen about this great book. Read it and then judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"RL Stevenson was born in 1850, and died in 1894. \\"Treasure Island\\" was first published in 1883, though was originally written for the amusement of Stevenson's stepson, Lloyd Osbourne.Set in the 1700s, the book's hero is Jim Hawkins. Jim is, apparently, an only child whose parents run the Admiral Benbow - a quiet inn, though with a good reputation, not far from Bristol. His troubles begin with the arrival of a mysterious sailor - a rather intimidating, poorly dressed and generally filthy character, though not one who was short of money. He's reluctant to give his name, though claims to hold the rank of captain, and he generally says little. However, occasionally his tongue is loosened a little by his fondness for rum - upon which he would either burst into song or tell the most terrifying stories. At the mysterious sailor's request, meanwhile, Jim keeps an eye out for another salty old sea dog the nameless captain seems keen to avoid : the unwanted visitor's most notable feature is his one leg.Things change with the arrival of an even nastier sailor named Black Dog. He's obviously acquainted with the Admiral Benbow's resident sailor - whose name, Billy Bones, is soon revealed - though they're not on the best of terms. Things turn nasty, one thing leads to another and before you can say \\"oh, arrr\\", Billy has died of a stroke. Jim and his mother quickly rifle Billy's sea chest - he'd left a substantial bar bill, and Mrs Hawkins meant to collect payment - though among his possessions they also find a mysterious sealed packet. When eventually opened, the packet proves to hold treasure map of a notorious pirate called Captain Flint. Shortly afterwards, Jim joins Squire Trelawney and Dr Livesey on a mission to retrieve the treasure. Unfortunately, their ship proves to be manned by a crew of treacherous pirates - including the one-legged Long John Silver...A very easily read, fast-moving and enjoyable book - and one that (presumably) has had a huge impact on how we still see pirates : lots of songs about rum (naturally with a few yo-ho-hos thrown in), treasure maps where X marks the spot and one-legged salty old sea dogs with parrots that scream \\"pieces of eight\\". Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Unlike the BBC production which takes liberties with the original story and a Jim Hawkins who sounds about 25 years old, this production by Colonial Radio is faithful to the story. The music is as usual fantastic, and reminds you of those great swashbuckling adventures from the 40's. The actor playing Jim has great energy and I totally believed I was there with him on this perilous voyage. Long John Silver is great, and the on again / off again friendship, or \\"trust\\" ship with Jim is spot on. The supporting cast is also excellent, and I think this is a magnificent audio production of a great classic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Bought this for a long cross country trip for my husband and I to break up the driving. It was very entertaining and the fact that it used a whole radio troupe and orchestra added to the interest. It is probably geared to a more youthful adience but we had both enjoyed the book when we were young and enjoyed the cd. It wasn't as long as some audio tapes but still worth the money."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"What can you say... This book is a classic for a reason! It's a great read.

It is every bit as good a tale on rereading as it was at first. It has a glossy hard cover, good print and appears to be, perhaps, one from a series of \\"classics\\" for young readers. If you like stories of pirates of old and buried treasure, you will enjoy this at any age. However!A caveat for youger readers. Victorian prose usually has a lengthy development and is often excessively wordy for modern readers. If you're looking for \\"fast\\", you won't find it here, but it is still a good tale and has, I believe, been made into a movie a couple of times, so if you're not into leisurely reading, go for the movie.

The peg-leg, the parrot, the island, the mutiny - so many elements found in every other piratical tale can first be found here. The telling is sometimes interesting, sometimes functional, and has an oddly sedate tone for a supposed adventure story; the pace is in general much slower than a modern reader might expect, or be satisfied with.That said, the edition assembled here should be reviewed by every single publisher of ebooks ever. The main story is well-formatted and free of errors. Illustrations throughout come from multiple sources, both black-and-white drawings and fully painted scenes (making the Kindle, ironically, not the ideal device to read it upon). Finally, the supplements are a veritable treasure trove of extras: Robert Louis Stevenson's metafictional vignette \\"The Persons of the Tale\\", author biography, list of characters, a timeline of the novel's events, chapter-by-chapter endnotes, various articles and essays, and much much more.Kent David Kelly has discussed his irritation with how the rise of ebooks has led to shovelware epublishers, who flood the market with badly-made classics. Anyone who has scoured through multiple versions of a classic, only to find none to be at all acceptable, can understand his ire. In such a context, the hard work and passion that has clearly gone into this work is awe-inspiring, and gladly appreciated. For that reason alone, I'll be buying every new Kindle Master Edition he puts together, and will eagerly await each new release."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read the children's classic version of this book back when I was about 8 years old. Since then I had always assumed that somewhere out there lurked the \\"real\\" version, which in my mind was pictured to both look and read similar to \\"The Three Musketeers\\" or \\"Moby Dick.\\" When I finally got around to reading the \\"adult version,\\" I laughed when I realized that this is still a children's novel. It's an old fashioned action adventure clearly written with little boys about the age of 12 in mind.The short summary: Jim, is a preteen who lives with his parents at the little inn and tavern that they own. A rough and unruly customer comes to stay with them, a salty old pirate with inappropriate stories and foul drinking songs. Jim is enthralled with the man and befriends him; the old crusty pirate even pays Jim to \\"Keep an eye out for a man with one leg.\\" When the rest of the pirates locate the inn where Jim and his family live, they make an appearance, demanding something that the old pirate had taken from them. Through an act of both luck and bravery, Jim and his mother escape the pirates and take with them the hidden object - a map showing the location of an enormous buried treasure. Jim, the good Doctor, and a few other individuals from town decide to rent a boat to go after the treasure... but when they start their voyage, a man with one leg joins the boat as the cook and the rest of the crew isn't behaving quite properly. The rest of the tale involves mutiny, back stabbing, treachery, treasure, gunfights, castaways and adventure of the highest caliber.This is one of the most well written adventure novels I have ever read, and I have encouraged my 10 year old son to try to give it a read. Back when this was written, I would assume that every 9-12 year old little boy (and many little girls as well) probably lay in their beds at night reading and dreaming of being whisked away by pirates to find buried treasure. Since then our language has changed so dramatically that I believe that the under 12 crew may have difficulty with some of the phrasing and word choices in this novel. If giving this to a younger child, I would plan to work with them through some of the tougher portions, specifically the technical bits about the ship (explaining what a mizzenmast is) and some of the pirate's dialogue which is often written phonetically. You can solve the pirate problem by telling them to read it aloud and try to sound like Captain Jack Sparrow from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\" My son had a much easier time when I would read those passages to him doing a pirate accent.Even if your much older than 12, I still highly recommend reading this, it is a quick read with a truly fairytale ending. The good guys win and the bad guys lose and the moral of the story is honor, duty, keeping your word, and being a good person will bring you good fortune, whereas acting like a despicable pirate will only bring you down in the end. There also seems to be a fairly strong anti-alcohol message in the book, as the good guys capitalize on the intoxication of the pirates over and over and rarely drink the stuff themselves. It's not beaten over your head... but it might just be strong enough to make the little ones think \\"Well I'm not going to do that!\\"I couldn't recommend this story enough, for individuals of all ages; we are planning on reading it out loud at bedtime so that our 7 year old can enjoy the dreams of buried treasure and pirates. There is a reason this tale has stood the test of time, and I suggest reading it yourself, and with your little ones if you have any.Parent note- in my summary I stated that the Pirate sings foul songs and tells inappropriate stories, these are not related in the book and are only reference in the fact that Jim's mother is horrified that the pirate tells him such things. So you don't have to worry about profanity or any other lewd discussions."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's _Treasure Island_ sets the standard for books about pirates: buried treasure, intrigue and mutiny, even the ditty \\"fifteen men on a dead man's chest\\" all originate here. The book, simply, is a FUN read.The story is told by Jim Hawkins, a young man who accidentally finds himself in the possession of a map to a pirate's buried treasure. Embarking with a crew of familial friends (and a motley crew), Hawkins soon finds himself in the adventure of a lifetime: battling pirates, stealing a ship, and hunting buried treasure. The \\"sea slang\\" one would expect in a pirate story can be found in abundance, with plenty of swashbuckling to go around._Treasure Island_ is certainly readable for younger audiences, the story is exciting for anyone. Recomended."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is a picture book adaptation of the classic story of adventure, which has been carefully abridged for younger readers. The expressive full-color, museum quality illustrations by the late N. C. Wyeth perfectly complement this great classic by the great nineteenth-century author Robert Louis Stevenson. Treasure Island is very highly recommended for novice readers just about ready to graduate from picture book to reading to more involved and complex stories."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The problem I face with most kinds of classic books is the fact that it is held on such a high pedestal it will never reach the standard that I have imagined it would be, but that isn't the writer's fault. It is the fault of those annoying intellectuals who discuss them in their book groups, and look down on those peasants who haven't been lucky enough to go to university and taught why these books are so great, the (insert your own appropriate description of these people). It is also my own fault, because I'm an opinionated narcissist who scorns any who oppose his views, which is why I hate those people who belittle simple book for being simple and not an intwined conundrum of revealing insights to the writer him/herself, sometimes we just like simple!I picked Treasure Island up after watching the recent version on TV, starring Executive Transvestite Eddie Izzard (well done if you know that joke), and I wondered how far off this adaption was to the book. Previously I had watched adaptations of many books to film, and decided to see if this show had gone the way of The 13th Warrior (watch this film, it is absolutely amazing) or the dark rage filled minutes of the modern Clash of the Titans (a terrible film, watch the older version just for nostalgia purposes). The show was placed in a comfortable middle, not good, but didn't completely ignore the book, and just use the title because Hollywood couldn't be bothered with thinking up their own title and names!!Now my quota of classic fiction is very bare. I have always found the writing dull and sometimes difficult to understand, even though the obvious reason being that is was made in a different age, and I should stop being such an uncouth bum hole and appreciate the genius of the work. However I fear that I have set my bar for classic literature very high due to reading Dumas Count of Monte Cristo, a book I have advised everyone I've met to read, and so far proud of the fact I have made three people read a masterpiece they never would have if it weren't for me. I know this isn't a review of Monte Cristo, but I can't stress enough how amazing this book is, it passes the hate filled cynic part of my brain, and makes me feel that there still is hope for humanity.Treasure Island should be taken for what it is, a boy's adventure. That is the basic plot line of this book, following the adventure of young Jim Hawkins as he searches for the lost treasure of Captain Flint, but faces the survivors of Flint's old crew, led by the original wooden legged pirate John Silver. This book is a amazing tale of swashbuckling heroism of some true English gentlemen as they embark on a voyage that has danger lurking around every corner. Now there are some very annoying aspects of this book, but I fear that it is because it hasn't escape through the misery of my personal being, but these are few and far between. The book doesn't drag out descriptions or dialog like many novels will, nor does it focus on the inner turmoil of the protagonist. What it does it leap and bound between action and adventure like any boyish adventure should. Areas of the novel that some writers could drag on and on, Louis Stevenson doesn't, he writes an excellent book that could be read on a warm summer's afternoon where you could transport your mind away from whatever dull meaningless existence that you are living, to a world of pirates and adventure that you dreamed of when you were a child.The only problem that I do have with this book is that the pirates are held in an almost good light, just as vagabonds or loveable rogues like Silver is shown, when the sad truth of these men is a far darker tale. Now I know that books couldn't be written like they can now and the book was a harmless adventure, but I can't help but like Silver's character, which is I'm sure the aim of the book, but that is what I find the problem. I wanted to hate Long John Silver like I hated Pew, but you find him a nice guy, which we know wouldn't have been the case. However I can't argue with the fact that this book helped spark the love of pirates that every boy has, and because of this book I hopped around on my garden wall trying to impale my brother with a stick demanding him to walk the plank. It is this amazing adventurous spirit that I love about the book, and the reason that it should hold the title of classic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I saw the original paintings done for this classic at the Brandywine River Museum, and bought the book simply for the Wyeth prints.

The vernacular is spot-on, even a century later.

Here we have one of the most complex, fully developed characters you can find. One that will still ring true, even today.

This book is so great that I had a hard time putting it down, so I finished it in a bout one day. I think that this book is way better than the Pirates of the Caribbean series."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"(Author's note: Several years ago I took a course in children's literature at a nearby collage, and one of the novels that I had to study was Stevenson's now iconoclastic novel \\"Treasure Island\\". This is an adaptation of my paper on the novel. You can thank Beatrice Catherino for this. There will be some plot spoilers.)\\"Treasure Island\\" starts when Billy Bones, a weather-beaten, and cranky old sailorman, comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow, a modest seaside inn. He brings a bit of minor-league chaos with him, but he pays his bills, and takes a liking to young Jim Hawkins. Then one day his past catches up with him, and it brings an end to his life. Bones will die of fear as pirate scallywags raid the inn, forcing Hawkins and his mother, his father having since died, to flee, and Hawkins shows his reliability when he stands by his mother and refuses to abandon her when she is overcome with exhaustion while fleeing.Coming back after the raid, Hawkins finds a map amongst Bones effects, and he recruits friends Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney to go on a treasure hunt. A ship, the \\"Hispaniola\\", will be purchased, and a crew is then hired under the charge of the ever \\"dependable\\" John \\"Long John\\" Silver.Here the novel becomes a rousing tale of adventure and survival as this novel becomes an example of what Joseph Campbell calls \\"The Hero's Journey\\". This is because Hawkins quest starts for one purpose, and that is to get the pirate's booty. The trip seems to be cursed; the mate goes overboard and Hawkins accidently hears about a planned mutiny. Despite great odds stacked against him, Hawkins does the right thing and reports the mutiny, and as the crew mutinies he sticks with his friends, and with a select few he will escape the mutiny to Treasure Island. It is here that they set up defensive encampment inside an old abandoned fortress built by Silver and Bones' original employer, Captain Flint.Tension builds within the encampment, there is a raid, and Hawkins impulsively runs away to set the \\"Hispaniola\\" free to beach itself. It is here that Hawkins is finally forced into an adult situation as he is forced into killing Israel Hands in self-defense. He tries to return to the fortress only to be captured by Silver and his remaining mutineers. Silver manages to save Hawkins life, and as the treasure hunt by the pirates commences, there will be another revolt, this time against Silver, forcing Silver to join the side of the righteous.During the novel Hawkins constantly finds himself confronted with temptations, but he stays on the moral straightaway. He never abandons his friends, always keeps his word, even when it puts him into physical danger. He is a good counterpoint for \\"Long John\\" Silver, a man he constantly looks up to as a kind of father figure throughout the novel. Hawkins constantly stays on the straight and narrow, always treating Silver with respect, even when Silver clearly doesn't deserve it. It is Silver who often comes across the more immature of the two, constantly, and opportunistically waffling, and weaseling his way into and out of circumstances as it pleases him. So erratic is his behavior, at times we are not quite sure how Silver will react in the circumstances that he constantly finds himself.Of course, Hawkins isn't infallible, when Billy Bones dies, Hawkins initially steals Bones' money, but then is forced by his mother to return the money, but by the end of the novel, Hawkins has gone through his trial by fire, and has been forced to mature. Then, when the pirate's booty is found, and it is divided up equally among the survivors, Hawkins manages to let Silver get away with a bag of gold coins.Stevenson also does well in creating some of his minor characters. Take for instance the characters Abraham Gray and Dick. Dick was once a good man, with a strong moral upbringing, who was also literate (he could read), and who had gone over to the Darkside, while Gray was a character who stood on the edge of the abyss, didn't blink, and took the right moral course in life. While these characters take up a relatively minor amount of storytime, they acted as a contrast to the more major Israel Hands/Jim Hawkins conflict, in which Hawkins confronts Hands, is forced to kill him, face the darkness within himself, defeat it, and still keep his moral center.\\"Treasure Island\\" is an early example of the multi-perspective novel. As while most of the novel is told from Jim Hawkins viewpoint, there is a fair share that is told from other viewpoints than his so that the readers can get a more rounded perspective on the events that are happening in the novel.Unlike the more ornamental authors of his (and our) time, Stevenson let the story do the work, and so his story can be read as easily today as it was when it was first published. As you read Stevenson's novel you keep thinking that Jim and his family COULD HAVE owned an inn, they COULD HAVE been raided by greedy pirates looking for a map and for revenge. Jim COULD HAVE fallen into the good graces of several well meaning mentors and gone on a treasure hunt, COULD HAVE survived a mutiny, and COULD HAVE, along with his companions, have found the pirate's booty, and Jim COULD HAVE had the adventure of a lifetime.Such is Stevenson's storytelling skill that this adventure COULD HAVE happened to somebody Jim's age, and social class, even the whole thing IS pretty improbable. As it is seen through the eyes of Jim Hawkins, Treasure Island (the island) is pretty generic, so that even the Treasure Island itself COULD HAVE actually existed. Because even MORE unlikely things have happened, including the fact that there have been female pirates as tough as most of the male pirates.We also never really find out the mystery of what adventure caused events of \\"Treasure Island\\" to happen, and maybe it's better that way, just as Stevenson leaves open the possibility for a sequel. Stevenson was constantly and chronically sick, so that novel was never written, but others have tried their hands at it to various degrees of success.This review is based on a copy is a reprint (a facsimile?) of the original 1911 Charles Scribner's Sons edition, and this reprint is a very attractive book. The print is big and easily read, there are fifteen luscious paintings on glossy paper, by N. C. Wyeth (see customer images for some examples), illustrated endpapers, plus another painting for the cover, a map, and the book opens with a whimsical bit of verse by Stevenson. The book is sturdily constructed and the text is printed of thick, durable paper. This book contains some antiquated phrases however, and if you're not familiar with sailing ships, these phrases may be hard going; so a glossary would have been greatly appreciated. Still, for those who enjoy a great adventure this is a five star package all the way around.Warning. There are various editions of this book on this site, so try to make sure you get the Scribner's Sons edition, with the ISBN number 0684171600."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"My quest through the free Kindle classics continued with Treasure Island.Having never read this book it was all new to me.I found it was very well written as it kept me roped in to the story from start to finish and was perfectly formatted for the kindle.This book should be required reading in school!

I can't believe this was called a classic this book could barely hold my attention! The only one I liked was Captin Flint because I like birds but besides that I wouldn't read it! wait untill your older! my class read it and no one liked it! Alot of people told me that this book shouldn't be recommended to kids who don't like sea adventure, prirates, or anything under that category!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read the first 40 pages or so and it didn't grab me. The narrator isn't described, there's no texture, no detail. It just jumps into the story too quickly and I didn't feel anything about the characters or interest in the plot."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"It is no surprise that \\"Treasure Island\\" was written by Stevenson just in a few days as its carelessness and pretty bad style attest. On the contrary, it's really surprising that this poor novel could have been intended to be read in \\"one sitting\\" as it took me no less than five days to finish this bore.One of the main reasons I disliked the book was that I usually prefer \\"clean English\\" to \\"slang\\"; if I read English books is precisely to improve my grasp of the language and this novel doesn't contribute to that at all. There are many dialogues in the story written in a confusing and illiterate \\"pirate jargon\\" which make the novel very annoying to read. I should have bought a translation.But, personal preferences aside, this is not the only drawback because, as I kept reading, between one snore and another, I wondered how repetitive and pedestrian the language was and how unfriendly, conventional and dry the characters were. Even the character of John Silver is scarcely charismatic and flat. The book also struck me as so devoid of substantial and perennial meanings that it is beyond my knowledge why it is considered a \\"classic\\" to this day. For me, the only portion of the story I enjoyed were the first six chapters, where you can perceive that something is brewing up; after that, the novel sinks into tediousness until the end.My final piece of advice would be: don't bother to read this poor example of an adventure novel. There are some other books in the genre which I think excel \\"Treasure Island\\". Try for instance \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, \\"The Boats of the Glen Carrig\\" by William Hope Hodgson, or even the sometimes pedantic but ultimately rewarding \\"Moby Dick\\" by Melville. Although any of these books I've mentioned are exempt from minor flaws, they all leave Stevenson's forgettable romance in the gutter. \\"Treasure Island\\" is just a book more popular than others but nothing else.Uninteresting, and you may lay to that..."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Well on top of it all i didnt enjoy the book well!

Fortunately, they escape from the band of thieves and set out traps on the island. After they discover the treasure, Jim and his friends secretly strike a bargain with Silver.

There is alot of action in this book - the good guys vs the bad guys. This is a good book but the vocabulary was diffiult to understand because of the time it was written.

That maybe there is actual buried treasure somewhere on an island that we don't know about. Maybe if we explore more we will find a hidden island. So, if you read this story I hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed it!!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book Treasure Island is an adventure book, and for good reasons. This action packed story takes place hundreds of years ago and the setting goes from a dangerous home, to the sea, and finally to an island. In the story Jim Hawkins finds a treasure map and he says in the book that he will try to get the treasure. The main characters are Jim Hawkins, the young lad pursuing treasure, Long John Silver, the experienced sailor who is the cook, and one of the bad guys blind Pew. This is a book that kids would like but is probably recommended for older people due to its reading difficulty. The sailors and Jim Hawkins try to find an island with buried treasure but first they must overcome many treacherous obstacles. The reason this book blows away the competition is because you will always wonder what will happen on the open seas were rules hardly apply. I cannot be sure of the way sailors used to talk but from what I know the author rights it exactly as it would have been said. The reviewers say, \\"masterfully crafted\\" which is only one of many phrases that can portray the excellence of the book. You have to read this slowly, page by page because it has a lot of information on each page and if you read it to quickly you won't understand what just happened. This is not a book you can read right before bed because it's hard to put it down and you might end up reading all night. This book is like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter because people are out to kill you and this book shows many scenes were the characters make narrow escapes, but sometimes they don't. When you read this book you wonder is like a mix of fiction, non- fiction, and science fiction because the adventures are so detailed you might think you are there but it has many surprising scenes that you wonder if that could happen. Although the author has a slow pace it shows every last repetitive thing you have to do at sea. The author also is good at making it feel real, like you are really there. In away this book is like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate where at the very beginning the characters are pretty happy but then someone comes and ruins it then that person keeps going at the people for the money that is rightfully theirs. Basically what I have been saying about Treasure Island is that you should read it.-Kyle Watson"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is an epic story about a mutinous gang of pirates and buried treasure. The classic story starts when a strange man walks in to the Admiral Benbow Inn. He tells a boy named Jim Hawkins a very important warning, to watch out for a seafaring man with one leg. So when Jim found one, he knew not to trust the one-legged man, Long John Silver. Even though I saw all the movies and knew what was going to happen I enjoyed Stevenson's details and the way he turned Jim Hawkins into a spy for his captain."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Michael Prichard's narration is flawless. The story is gripping, laden with suspense, and still fresh despite the events in question taking place in the 18th century. The \\"sea-going man with one leg\\" may even give you nightmares."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"We know this is a good story and we know that its a long story. I have grandchildren and I enjoy reading to them. However as they grow older -5 and 6- their patience is less, but their curiosity, knowledge and imagination still thirst. These types of stories and their presentation quenches this. My grandsons will sit, listen and join in the reading. The book itself is 220 pages long. It is abbreviated and has a black and white picture on alternate pages inviting comment and reading. The presentation of the story and its plot invites understanding and enjoyment quickly. Each chapter is short and builds up the characters and action very well-sometimes I may read 2 or 3 chapters because they don't want to stop If you enjoy reading to your kids and want to introduce them (and yourself ?) to a classic go for this book. I do not know if the other books in the series are as good in it presentation but if they are I'll look forward to them."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"For the past two years I have been searching for the perfect adventure book to suit my dreams, and I finally found it, Treasure Island. This story was told hundreds of years ago and changed over time. The author was Robert Louis Stevenson. This book had 232 pages of jam-packed action. This story was suppost to take place in the Pirate times. There were lots of characters thruought this stors,y, but the two most important ones were Jim Hawkins, the leader of the pack, and Long John Silver, a kind of two faced person. This book was about Jim Hawkins and his friends going to sail to Treasure Island, hoping to find the burried loot of Captain Flint, the toughest of all the pirates. But they didn't know that the crew of their own ship is made up of Flint's old crew, led by the evil, one-legged pirate Long John Silver. Once on the island, Jim and his friends must find the burried treasure and escape efore the pirates capture them. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story because it will ruin a great story like this for you.

I don't see how that's possible. I think that those people are not use to the dialog in which the author writes in. I admit at that I did find it difficult at the beginning but I got use to it. This story is fill with adventure and suspense from beginning to end. From the time Billy Bone enters the inn to the time the hunt for the treasure was in. My favorite part is when young Jim over hears Long John silver planning the mutiny. I'm quite fascinated by the character of Long John silver. He is able to find away out of almost any situation, a great persuading people into getting them to do what he wants. He is an every complex character. He knows how to use people to benefit from them."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A great adventure story. I never read this book when I wasyounger and I wish I had.

I read this book when I was much younger, but I still love it today. If you have a hard time understanding old english, you may want to skip this book.

On my best books list this is definitely in the top 5. The adventure and suspense just makes you want to read more. You're missing out if you don't read this book.

Many twists in the plot and a good outcome. Gives at the same time a look in early 19th c. life and a bunch of less used vocab, including maritime vocab :).The Kindle edition should have links from the table of contents (which was nicely scanned from the printed version), to the various chapters in the book.I remember that I have read (a translated) paper version a long time ago, and that there was a postscript, saying that 'he would not reveal the islands location' or something to that end. I missed that in this edition. Not sure why. Where there different editions originally, some having a epilogue, and some not? Is my memory failing? Something else?

Many of the things we think of today as being trademarks of pirates (buried treasure, treasure maps, peg legs, parrots, desert islands) come more from Stevenson's tale than from history. But this book isn't about history, it's about pirates, adventure, and coming of age, and it delivers marvelously on all of those promises.The narrator, young Jim Hawkins, lives and works at an inn owned by his parents. One day, a mysterious seaman takes lodging there with an equally mysterious chest. After some time, other sailors arrive looking for the first seaman. Out of this, from the seaman's chest Jim manages to find a treasure map leading to the untold riches of a now-dead but still famous pirate named Captain Flint. Jim takes the map to a couple of country gentlemen, who decide to charter a ship to look for the treasure and take Jim along as cabin boy.Unfortunately for Jim and our heroes, but fortunately for the plot, they have a hard time finding sailors, and they turn to their new ship's cook, the one-legged Long John Silver, for \\"help\\" in rounding out the crew. Silver, as is hardly a spoiler, is actually a former pirate and crews the ship accordingly, having heard what they're after and eager to find those riches for himself.The excitement mounts as Jim goes on several daring adventures to save himself and the faithful party, and Silver struggles to keep control of his mutineers, all the while treasure is calling. Jim shows a great deal of growth, taking charge of several perilous situations and demonstrating considerable bravery he never possessed when dealing with the mysterious sailor in his parents' inn. Silver, meanwhile, is a savvy character who's self-interest and ability to play both sides against the middle knows no bounds. If you're looking for a master of duplicity and double-cross, Silver could give Jack Sparrow lessons.Stevenson's writing is fantastic. The colorful language of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience. The drama steadily rises, despite the fact the book's story is well known and I've read it several times before. It's certainly no accident that this book has had such a powerful effect on an entire genre of fiction even 130 years later.I've also listened to the book as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to on several other stories. If you're considering which audio version to listen to, you can't go wrong with Cosham's.Treasure Island is about as easily available as a book can be, as every library will have it on hand, it's on Wikisource for free, Amazon has it for Kindle for free or in paperback for $2, and I've even seen it at Target for $1. It's also only 300 quick pages. Seriously, there is no excuse for not reading this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is a very convenient edition to carry around--small, and with multiple page markers (2 flaps on the dust jacket, plus a ribbon marker)--I've been taking it with me to work, reading bits & pieces on my lunch hour. The print size is okay on the eyes, though I'm not sure kids wouldn't find it a little small. Don't be fooled by the miniaturized (and colorized!) illustration on the jacket--there are 17 handsome black-&-white pen and ink illustrations by the excellent HM Brock, all very well reproduced, depicting iconic moments from the narrative with near-cinematic eyes. My personal favorite is Jim and Mrs. Hawkins' terrified faces, stopping their rifling of the sea chest as they hear the arrival of Blind Pew.On to the story--I've only just finished the book, taking it with me to read over my lunch hour at work. What a pleasure! Piracy, hidden treasure, a boy becoming a (young) man before our eyes, a shipload of adults (some of whom can't be trusted), and one of the more complex central figures--Long John Silver himself. Father figure? Villain? Your call, reader! And to think this complexity is brought forth in a children's adventure yarn..."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The story is so exciting and fun to read aloud! I love Jasper Britton's different voices that he brings to each character. The story is already perfect, and he makes it even more so!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is another classic I've finally gotten around to, and it did not disappoint!In \\"Treasure Island,\\" we sail along with young Jim Hawkins on a treasure hunt that is sure to make him, his mother, and a few honest men from his village rich. But little do they know that the friendly sailor they've enlisted as their cook is a murderous pirate, and that he's hired a crew made up of his own kind.What's not to love about this classic pirate tale? The imagery is spooky, the characters are colorful, and the story is packed with excitement and adventure. It's a fun \\"boy's story\\" almost on par with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and far better than most of the paperbacks I read as a child in the 90's. (There's far more to enjoy in this single novel than in a dozen of the \\"Goosebumps\\" volumes I grew up on.)The conclusion seemed a bit rushed and was a little pat, I suppose (especially in regards to the fate of Long John Silver). I guess I expected a twist or an open ending, but to be fair, it didn't exactly close with \\"happily ever after,\\" either.As far as pleasant surprises go, I enjoyed the coming-of-age aspect of the story. Though the book spans, perhaps, a year (with the main story occurring over the course of just a few weeks), Jim sees some significant character development. He has to adapt and quickly transform from a scared kid into one daring enough to... well... you should read it for yourself.I wish I'd read \\"Treasure Island\\" around the age of 12 or so, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy reading it as an adult.

His fate has already been sealed though and the pirates set upon the inn with violence, seeking the map that leads to Cap'n Flint's treasure. However, in an attempt to make good Billy's debt, Jim has already stolen away with it, not knowing what it is. When he finally learns what he has, he along with Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, Long John Silver, and a mutinous crew depart from the port of Bristol in search of treasure.This is the classic pirate story from which all others follow. Without Treasure Island where would Pirates of the Caribbean be? I adored this story from start to finish. It was easy read, written as it was for a younger audience, but it was just so much fun that it didn't matter. Having previously seen movie adaptations of the story, I already knew what to expect, or thought I did. I certainly didn't expect to enjoy the adventure as much as I did. I read it in two sittings and went to bed dreaming of pirates and treasure. I can see exactly why it is such a favorite of young boys and why the pirate, cruel though most of these were, remains such a romantic figure in the collective psyche."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I never read this book as a kid, and I don't even remember seeing the movie. I have a whole new view on eating at Long John Silvers now!I thought it was an enjoyable story, albeit a bit far-fetched that young Jim was so capable, and that Long John could get around so well on a crutch. Despite that, it was a fun read, and one I will recommend to my kids."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I can now see where Johny Depp gets his inspiration. This is the great granddaddy of pirate stories. Treasure Island cast the mold for all such tales to come. A true classic! Now read it and away with ye!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my review ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).(Sorry, I had to pull this review off Amazon for a few days because I accidentally wrote it on another user's account.)Ye be warned: Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson, 220 pages) may leave you wishing that you were living inside it's brilliantly imagined world. Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting.

I do wish I had read it when I was 12, but I think there were elements of the book that I would not have picked up on at that age that I enjoyed now. I'll suggest it to my boys when they are old enough to enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is amazing! When I started reading Treasure Island I couldn't put the book down. The story is gteat and exciting. This is a great childrens classic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"After several mishaps, a boy called Jim and his mother find themselves with a treasure map. They get help from the squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey. Once Trelawney gets the schooner Hispaniola, they get a crew together and head for Treasure Island. During the trip Jim finds out that there are pirates on the ship. They want the treasure for themselves. I believe the theme to this story is expect the unexpected. I believe this to be true because Jim did not expect that he would meet pirates along the way.I got a very good picture of the setting from all the descriptions. Robert Louis Stevenson did not write how the characters felt, which, in my opinion would have been more useful than the descriptions. I could picture myself in the characters shoes and know how it felt. If you like adventure I encourage you to read this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book \\"Treasure Island\\" is one of the greatest books ever made! The author of the book, Robert Louis Stevenson, is a literaly genius. His book had all the necessary parts to make the reader read for hours. It is a story of a young boy and a mean pirate, known as Long John Silver, and his terrible band of pirates. It is a story that has a perfect mix of good and evil, which leaves the reader wanting to know what is going to happen next.It all begins when Captain Billy Bones stays at the Admiral BenBow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother live. Jim shows the captain to his room and then tells him where the dining room is. When Jim asks for his name, he tells him to call him Captain. A few days later, a man comes to the Inn to visit Bill. Jim tells him there is no one there by the name of Bill, but there that there is someone called Captain. Just then the Captain opens the door and says \\"Black Dog\\". Then Bill asks Jim to leave them alone for a while. A few minutes later, Jim hears a loud smash and runs out to find out what is happening with both of them. Black Dog decides to leave the place after the fight. The next day the Captain faints and Dr. Livsey informs that the Captain has suffered a stroke and is not allowed to drink rum anymore. The next day a blind man comes to the Inn and asks to talk to Bill. Jim tells him that Bill is sick and isn't able to see anyone. The blind man grabs his arm and says he will break it if he doesn't tell him where the captain is. Jim gets very scared and leads him to Bill's room. The blind man gives Bill a piece of paper with a dot on it and on the back it says: \\"You have six hours until we return\\". Bill tells Jim the pirates were coming to the Inn in six hours and, if he didn't live long enough that he should take the key and open up his treasure chest and take the map. Jim doesn't understand what Bill is talking about and, when he turns around, Bill drops dead on the floor with a bottle of rum in his hand.This is just a small part of the excellent book. As you can see, this book is an amazing novel of adventure. It is much better than other books I have read, because it contains good plots, moral lessons and exciting action scenes."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I was just reminiscing about how this book was required reading for me over one summer vacation back in elementary school (yes, I had homework over the summer). I was a voracious reader but preferred books that gave insight into the experiences of girls or women. Laura Ingalls Wilder and Jane Austen were much more my thing. So I put off reading this book until the last week before school started and then only picked it up because of my mother's nagging. I dragged myself through the first few pages and then I was shocked (a little horrified I confess) to find myself loving it! I couldn't stop turning the pages. I sucked up the book in a day and enjoyed it all immensely. It changed me. It expanded my &quot;girlish&quot; view of the world. The experience taught me to try books out before rejecting them. Who knows if I would ever have read &quot;manly&quot; authors such as Hemingway and Steinbeck if it had not been for that experience? I'm looking forward to reading it with my own two daughters. Anyway, I give it two thumbs up :-)"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is a CLASSIC! Unforgettitable characters like Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesy, Or Tom Redruth entwined in plots and scenarios with the opposite type of people like Billy Bones, Ben Gunn or Abrahm Gray. Don't get yhis book wrong though it's not \\" a torcher\\" or boring. They don't ride a boat and find treasure, They Have to gallantly fight against traitors Long John Silver, Isreal Hands and try not to be surprised when Long John's parrot Captain Flint swoops in on you. There's fighting, decept, affection, and adventure, all rolling in to a happy ending. Other great reads may be The Three Musketeers series, The Count of Monte\` Cristo, both by Alexandre\` Dumas, and The Reddwall series by Brian Jaques."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I had to read this book...I wasn't to thrilled about it, because it really didn't look like anything that I would be interested in, just a lot of hundred year old balony, right? Wrong. I was taken away from my mother to go on a dangerous adventure, found myself upon a ship filled with real pirates, then fought with a man desperate to do away with me! All that and much more in one book! READ THIS BOOK! LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"There's a whole demographic group out there of students who are not being exposed to this book, who are growing up bereft of any knowledge or feeling for terms like \\"shiver me timbers\\" or \\"smart as paint.\\" One measure of a great book is whether kids like the story itself, and then if there's even more to it to appreciate as an adult. By that measure, this belongs in a well-fitted library and on the floor next to the bed of all your kids.The colluquoy between Israel Hands and Jim Hawkins is as precise a look at good v. evil, materialism v. spirit as you can find, and comes out effortlessly in their brief encounter after Jim has gone back to the ship while the battle between the good guys and the pirates is waged on the island.Whatever else went through Stevenson's mind as he lay dying of consumption in Indonesia after writing this, the way he squares off these concepts amid the diffuse clamor of a bloody mutiny, and using a conversation between a young boy and an illiterate but lethal pirate, is a lasting monument to substance in the midst of what is essentially children's literature."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"When I started reading it in reading class I thought &quot;Great, anthor book we have to read&quot; like any other 1st grade student would say. but when we started reading it, it was really interesting and i was thinking that there should be a sequil to the book. Everyone in my class wrote a chapter to the sequil and it came out great...we made it into a play and acted it out. it was so much fun."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A great adventure story. I never read this book when I was younger and I wish I had. Reading it as a adult, I still feel the suspense, mystery, and excitement that was promised by the cover notes. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I was required to read Treasure Island for a Children's Lit class I took last summer. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I drove my kids crazy, talking like a pirate for weeks afterwards. Don't believe those who say this is a boring book--it's not! It is fun, fast-paced, interesting, and exciting."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A tale of suspense, filled with pirates, hidden treasure, and a plot not soon forgotten, Treasure Island hits the top of the charts. When Jim Hawkins comes in to possession of the notorious Captain Flint's treasure map, a crew is rounded up and a hunt for the treasure beginns. Little do Jim and his companions, the Squire and Dr. Livesay, know that many of Captain Flint's murderous pirates are part of that crew. That changes though, when Jim hears something not meant for him to hear. He, the Squire, and Dr. Livesay are now unaware of who and who not to trust. It becomes a battle between the good and evil in a race for the treasure. Greed was a major aspect that caused many sailors to turn against what they knew was right; sticking with their captain and boat. But they wanted the treasure for themselves, and their greed consumed them. Just remember though, greed will not get you anywhere, as this book shows. All that it gets you is more trouble than you need. The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, uses foreshadowing, a technique that gives a hint of what is to come, that keeps you wanting more, and creates an atmosphere of mystery. Treasure Island is a \\"must read\\" for all who love pirates, treasure hunts, and a great story."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I have never taken it upon myself to read this wonderful classic.

The book was boring and very,very long. Weird book"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The main character is Jim and the book is about how all the pirates on the ship are trying to get to treasure island. I think that the auther did a very good job with describing the characters and places in the book. I also think that the auther was not very descriptive when he was talking about things. At times the plot was very confusing. In the book the sentence structuse I think sometimes was very pourly done. I think that because the sentences went on and on but the pharagragh was vey fine sizes.Sometimes the book is very hillarias. Over all the this book was pretty good. I would not recommend this book to younger aged kids because the book uses a couple curse words and some of the words are kind of challenging. When you read the story it keeps you interested, yet it is a good sized book. I think that this book is really interesting because it will keep you thinking the entire time and it relates to other sea books."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The all time worst book a teacher ever made me read I wouldn't make my worst enemy read this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Well, mates.

Don't recall any profanity."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"My negative review is based on one major fact. There is no where in the description that the book is 6 1/4 x 4 inches in size with only one illustration. Thus it was not at all appropriate for the three little girls ages 8-10 who were to receive it this Christmas."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"First I want to say the movie was horrible, confusing, stupid and every other negative POOP!!!!!! It made no sense and was incredibly unrealistic. The plot was so mixed up and nothing like the book I would later read. So after seeing the movie, I farted."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Let's face it: this is a children's novel. It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think.The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience.However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"It's too long and boring. I think this book is not suitable for Hong Kong students in primary six. It makes us sleep. There are a lot of difficult vocabulary words. I wish there were more pictures and easier vocabulary words. We shouldn't buy this book. It's more boring than the Bible. I prefer to play computer games."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the story of a young boy who searches for treasure. The characters are the most memorable thing about this story, including the blind pirate Pew, the passive-aggresive Long John Silver, amongst others. There's some hidden meaning here, but it's pretty buried and probably not noticable if someone doesn't point it out to you.That said, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone, only adults who are looking for action adventure. The dialog can be pretty tough in places because it's full of slang. The pirates are especially difficult to understand, even the main character jokes about not understanding one of the pirates. There is a lot of violence, and it's pretty realistic, which is probably not ideal for the little ones."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"\\"Treasure island\\" was a hard book to understand at my age (12). Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused. The sentences were also pretty long. There word choice was hard and confusing. On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words. The description was good but at times the plot was confusing. A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did. So all in all, I would give the book a three on a one through ten scale."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is extremly confusing and i found myself thrusted into a world i had no idea about. I respect the authors writing style but as a person knowing nearly nothing about the world of pirates, i found myself not wanting to read any further than the first 10 pages. This is truly sad, as i am a fan of classic novels."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"What is every teens fantasy? It's running away from home to get away from parents and rules and homework etc. and to have an adventure like Jim Hawkins. After seeing the movie, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, for the 3rd or 4th or 5th times teens are going to fantasize more about joining a crew of pirates to have an adventure on the high seas. Only there are no longer pirates like those who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries. But teens like me can escape and have adventures by reading pirate books like TREASURE ISLAND and ROBINSON CRUSOE. (The latter is based on a real pirate named Alexander Selkirk who was marooned on an island. Fortunately a ship picked him up in a short time not years later, and he didn't have an encounter with canibals like Robinson Crusoe.) Treasure Island is slow in places, but there's no law saying a reader has to read the slow parts. I just skipped over them and got to the good parts. I've read parts of other true books about pirates. But the modern day one I liked the best was THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO. No, it is not dorky. It has a good story with good characters (slave children) who watch Blackbeard as he holds their city hostage. In the back of the book you can see real photos of pirates, jolly rogers, and slave stuff. There is also more information about pirates of that time, and they weren't quite like the ones in the movies. I recommend everyone read Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, and that new book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"\\"Treasure Island\\" is the classic adventure novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Set on the high seas amid treasures and pirates, it is the story of a young boy's adventure. \\"Treasure Island\\" has been done by everyone from Disney to the Muppets. It's been imitated many times and influenced countless books and movies.A mysterious pirate shows up at an inn owned by Jim Hawkin's mother. The pirate is killed by a gang of rogues, but Jim finds a treasure map belonging to the pirate. Jim then embarks on a journey to far away island to find the treasure. Of course, nobody can be trusted - especially the cook, Long John Silver. With his peg leg and parrot, Silver is the stereotypical pirate. Once the island is reached, sides are chosen - the mutinous pirates against the ship's crew. Jim goes on a journey within a journey on the island, going from one side to another, as the treasure is hunted for.Everyone should read this book at some point. It's especially good for young boys, due to the fact that the main character (Jim) is a young boy. It's well crafted, and easy to read. And it's hard to put down once you get going. What else can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is a good book. The story is interesitng but can get confusing. There are so many twists in the story you never know what is going to happen. If you like adventure you would love this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This was a really great book. I think that everybody should read this masterpiece. After all, it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat because of the suspense. Your wont want to put it down. Also, its great for kids. Though the text is hard to understand at points, the humor is to die for. After all, who on earth is afraid of the French. A great read for adults and kids alike."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Pirates, mutiny, heroes, swashbuckling- many of the stereotypes of the pirate genre are rooted in this book. Long John Silver, peg legged and patch eyed. \\"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest\\", buried treasure, etc. Most of what we think of being \\"pirately\\" (whether accurate or not) came from this novel. This book really doesn't really need another review, it has been in print for a long time which is testimonial to how good it is. I rate it with Tom Sawyer and The Hobbit as one of the most cherished books of my childhood as it really made me relate with the main character. One of those books that leaves you feeling like you've gone on a journey after you've read it. It is very entertaining and imaginitive"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This one will capture the imagination of every young boy. I've read it twice and may read it again.This story is like Robinson Crusoe or like Macbeth: It is a classic that will never be forgotten or become outdated.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson will leave you wanting more. Join characters Jim Hawkins, Long John Silver, Captain Smollett, and Squire Trelawney on a treasure hunt. The crew gets a schooner called the Hispaniola and set sail not knowing the problems they will face. I think the theme is never trust someone you don't know. I enjoyed this book and suggest it to those who want a great book about adventure."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"As a young boy, Jim Hawkins encounters a threatening man namedCaptain. His experience with the captain leads him on an adventure of a lifetime. He finds hardship, backstabbing (most of the time literal!!) and new enemies. Written with superb vocabulary, Robert Louis Stevenson knows how to attract an audience. The first few chapters were a real bore for me. The rest of the book makes up for the lack of excitement, though. I read waiting in suspense for what would happen next. Another thing I enjoyed was the characteristics of the pirates, from the greediness way up to the drunkenness. All in all, Treasure Island is a book everyone should read if they are looking for excitement, gluttony, survival of the fittest, and treachery."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is about a boy named Jim who once lived at the Admiral Benbow. Once Captain Billy Bones enters the inn, disaster strikes! Now Jim has a map of Treasure Island showing three potential places where treasure could be. Not knowing the problems or obstacles that they are about to face, Jim, accompanied by Captain Smollet, The Squire, The Doctor, Long John Silver (an unreliable cook) are on their way to the treasure with the rest of the crew.The tone that Robert Louis Stevenson puts into the book is very serious, and the descriptions seem like they go on for pages. However, because of the descriptions, I felt as though I could feel the ocean mist upon my face and felt just as excited when I saw the island come into sight. The words that Stevenson chose were familiar but he used English dialect, so I was puzzled when I came across some of the unusually interesting words for example: noggin, I usually think that that would mean head but he used it to mean a drink. The message in this book is to be careful whom your friends are or who your close companions are because you never know if they are going to stab you in the back (literally). I recommend this book to any one who likes, pirates, adventure, and mischief."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island, a story about a boy who goes on an adventure of a lifetime (a treasure hunt!), is an action packed book for young adults to enjoy. Though the book had too much description to get to the point, it was a good read. From good guys, to bad guys, sailors, to mutineers, friends to enemies, Treasure Island has it all. The authors' word choice for this book is incredibly sophisticated and makes the book a little more descriptive, ( though I was not always sure what the words meant). Using \\"ship slang\\" and having the characters say just what they need to say at the right time. The theme in this book is one we always need to keep in mind \\"be careful who you trust, people aren't always to be what they appear to be\\". So if ever you need a good book to read I definitely recommend Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I had to read Treasure Island in a 7th grade english class.At first,I didn't get it.But as I read on,I began to understand what the author was saying.He was telling of an adventure on a ship that took courage to make it through.Jim Hawkins was a boy who had that kind of courage.He dealt with all types of people.But he stuck through and ended up being a hero at the end.READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT A GOOD ADVENTURE!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book was a pleasant read from start to finish. A minimum of imagination is required to get suspense and entertainment from Stevenson's classic story. It is also rather short. For a good action plot demonstrating Georgian British lifestyle and values get this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"&quot;Treasure Island,&quot; by Robert Louis Stevensen, is a very good book. It has everything you could ever want in an adventure story. I have seen people who rate this with 1 star, and I cant understand it. I also cant understand how they maneged to spell the name of the ship wrong. Anyway, this book gets on the top 5 of my favorite books, among &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth,&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; You cant go wrong with this book. P.S: Not that youd care, but the character Isreal Hands was the Blackbeard's first mate in real life."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"OK YOU GUYS THIS A REAL COOL BOOK .I'VE READ AND MY PARENTS HAVE READ IT .MY SIXTH GREAT GRANDFATHER WROTE THIS AND IT IS REALLY COOL!IF YOU GAVE IT LESS THAN 3 STARS YA'LL HAVE BAD TASTE."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book held me from the begining when old Captain Bones came to the Admiral Benbow to the end where they get the tresure. It was describtive but not boring. The characters were great and the way Stevenson brought out the life on the sea in not only this book but Kidnapped too. If you have to read a good classic let it be this one."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I enjoyed Treasure Island alot, till they landed on it. The first scenes in the inn and on the ship are great and full of possibility, but as soon as the pirates mutinied I lost intrest in it. Nothing but geography and strange descriptions and the ending was very unsatisfying. This isn't by far the worst book I've read, but it wasn't that great."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Very nice work on this piece. Keep up the good work"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I just finished Treasure Island and I think it's an awsome high seas adventure book. I think Stevenson did a great job on this book and should do more books like it. I was so thrilled with it im now reading Kiddnaped and it's pretty good so far. More people should read this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I don't know why Treasure Island is described as a children's book. There is no way a child can comprehend the complexities of emotions, etc. that Stevenson so perfectly chronicles. I have read this book three times and can't wait to read it again in a couple of years. Treasure Island is like a Steven Spielberg movie in is largeness and vividness. Spielberg should actually give this movie a go, he is the only one who could afford to do it right. Robin Williams has to play Ben Gumm. One of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I highly recommend reading Treasure Island to anyone who likes suspenseful classics. Although Robert Lewis Stevenson wrote it in 1883, the classic is still in print and is appropriate for anyone in grades 5-8. The journey begins with no major problems, but when Jim and the rest of the crew approach their destination everyone on the ship gets their own idea of the way things are going to work. Throughout the story Jim Hawkins, the main character, takes risks for the well-being of himself and his colleagues. Finally, his shipmates lose faith in him but he prevails.

I enjoy reading the classics and just made my way to this one, which I am very glad I did. The book is a fast-paced, lean adventure story with all the expected elements of a great pirate yarn. The only thing it is missing is a dramatic walking-off-the-plank scene. Some of the jargon is outdated and can be hard to understand, but it is not impossible to get through. Minor Spoiler Alert for people who haven't read the book - don't read the rest of this review! Long John Silver is a terrific character, a more sinister version of the modern-day Capt Jack Sparrow. He is an interesting repository of moral ambiguity in a book otherwise populated by characters that fall clearly on the side of good or evil. I also really enjoyed how the regimented moral uprightness of Captain Smollett serves as a foil for Long John Silver. He is not such a fabled character, but he is an almost equal force in the novel and has the respect of all parties, even Silver himself. It was hard to believe he would ever consent to go on the cruise, since he seemed to smell a rat from the very beginning. Jim Hawkins, the main POV character, tells the story of his adventure with charming impulsive boyishness. A great read and a great story that still holds up today!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Great to revisit a great adventure of a time long ago.

After staying in the inn for weeks, the sea captain dies inthe inn's tavern, and Jim discovers a treasure map hidden away in the captain's treasure chest. Lookingfor an adventure, Jim decides to head out in search of the captain's fortune, assisted by Long John Silverhimself.As I read Treasure Island, I was captivated by the author's vivid descriptions of settings and characters.Stevenson used the element of flashback to tell the story. For example, the books opens with Jimrecalling, \\"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full ofdangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange as ouractual adventures,\\" which definitely gave the narration a more prevalent voice. As with most otheradventure novels, exploration is definitely a strong theme throughout the plot, however, not only isexploration of land important in Treasure Island, but also exploration of yourself and who you are."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"To be honest, I began this book quite reluctantly as an extra-credit opportunity for my English Studies course. The first 20 pages or so had to be trudged through. But once through this beginning bit, the reader will find themselves delving into a seafaring world of adventure, piracy, and suspense. Progressively this book improves on itself the longer you read. For those interested in well written, enchanting books, this is one for you. All those who enjoy a minor literary challenge, requiring you to take a step back from time to time to reread a passage due to swashbuckling dialect and jargon, will find great fun in this novel. All in all, this book is deserving of the five stars I've rewarded it with. Highly recommend for younger, ambitious readers."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Had never read this classic.

Later, I read the Classics Illustrated (comic book) version. It was not until I was 23 years old and in the Navy that I finally got around to actually reading the book itself in the edition with the Wyeth illustrations. I found it to be a perfect masterpiece. Of course, I was already familiar with the characters and the plot, so nothing came as a surprise One oddity of my childhood was that I somehow managed to get through it without reading any of the classic books except in comic book form, so it was only in my twenties that I went back and read the actual books. I visited Scotland and toured a museum in Edinburgh devoted to Burns, Scott and Stevenson. Among other items, I remember that there was a rocking-horse that belonged to Stevenson as a child. Adults reading this book need to find an essay by Stevenson on the internet titled A Humble Remonstrance, which sort of goes with this book, but would be boring to a child. In the 1960s I remember being on a bus that was going along a causeway in Miami, and one of the artificially-created islands of the causeway was Treasure Island. There was a boy on the bus who said to his mother that he was sure that this was the real Treasure Island. Fortunately she didn't spoil his opinion with the rude truth. Recently I was talking with a trio of teenagers and told them that this was my favorite book. They responded in a rude fashion and declared that it was boring. I suppose that they had been forced to read it in school, a process which seems to invariably backfire in its well-meaning attempt to cast pearls before swine. Stevenson was looked down upon by intellectuals for a long time because he was popular and wrote for the young, but eventually even the snobs had to admit that he was a fine writer.

Young Jim Hawkins works at his mother's inn until a strange pirate, Billy Bones, takes up residence and hires him to keep watch for the dangerous man with one leg. Violence rocks the community when a blind pirate named Pew delivers the dreaded black spot to Billy, causing him to fall over dead of a heart attack, and the pirates attack the inn hoping to find his treasure. But Jim has already claimed the most important part of Billy's treasure, a mysterious map with directions to Skull Island. Jim boards a shop with a doctor, the squire, and the charismatic Long John Silver who quickly charms all three of them until Jim stumbles upon John's part in a plot to mutiny with several of the other sailors, kill those not with them (including Jim), and claim the treasure for themselves. I'd only seen the movie adaptations of this story, so I was surprised to see at the portrayal of John, who was far more slippery, honorable, and smart that I expected. The story is a sure winner with children who love adventure stories, even in the violence can be a little graphic, but my seven-year-old daughter was unphased by it and couldn't wait each night to hear another couple of chapters. The story is every boy's dream: secret treasure, heroic actions, villains who are overcome, and a safe return home with an amazing story to tell."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Wonderful.

The book is not terribly long (so you won't feel like the author fancies the killing of trees for sport) and keeps a rather good pace of narrating the action. Treasure Island is a must read. (A) It's free, (B) You'll knock out reading a classic, and (C) You'll feel all that much more enlightened when you throw up in front of it's namesake hotel in Vegas. Yarr."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is one of those books that is thought of as a boy's book, a classic that nonetheless is designed for the youth that craves adventure. As such, it delivers, but that is not the only reason one should read this classic. The appeal is present for the fully grown man, if not woman. In fact, there is hardly a woman character in the novel, and though Robert Louis Stevenson had contributions from others in the writing of it, women were conspicuously absent in the influence, contributions primarily coming from his stepson and his father.It is evident from the novel that Stevenson's description of the landscape does not mesh well with something from the Caribbean, but possibly something from California (which he visited -- in pursuit of a certain married woman, which he later married himself), with the inclusion of trees that can only be described as Redwoods. He does not really say where the island lies, in any case. The story goes that Stevenson drew the island first, then the story was developed later, influenced by other stories by such as Washington Irving.This is an adventure that is a beautiful version of escapist literature from an imaginative writer, and though Stevenson was obviously influenced by others, his tale has influenced more modern tales, such as \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" theme song and all. I think women may enjoy the tale, as well, but on the whole, this is a story for boys and men, especially ones in search of a worthy adventure of the mind.As a little quibble, on page 179, I noticed a place in the Penguin paperback version where it says \\"tail trees\\" rather than \\"tall trees,\\" and it was not simply a printing imperfection, but an outright error. Still, the Penguin version has many extras...an introduction by a scholar, an essay at the end by Stevenson on the writing of the book, and a section from Washington Irving's \\"Tales of a Traveller,\\" which influenced the beginning of \\"Treasure Island.\\""},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This Kindle edition of \\"Treasure Island\\" featuring N.C.

The main character and the narrator is a boy named Jim Hawkins who lives and works in his parents' Admiral Benbow Inn. A drunken buccaneer has been living at the inn and causing quite a scene among the locals. After he receives a black spot (an item representing pirate judgment) from an old, blind pirate named Pew, the buccaneer dies, leaving behind an unpaid room and a seaman's chest. Jim and his mother open the chest and find a bag full of coins of all different nationalities and a document containing a map. They escape the inn just before a band of pirates begin to break in and search for the map, which leads to an island containing Captain Flint's buried treasure.Jim takes the map to Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney, who then immediately embark on a voyage on the ship Hispaniola, hiring Captain Smollet and a crew recommended by Long John Silver. Silver and most of the crew he brings with him were part of Flint's voyage to Skeleton Island, unbeknownst to Livesey and Trelawney. At sea, Jim finds himself in a barrel of apples and accidentally overhears plans for mutiny from the pirates, which he soon relays to Livesey, Trelawney, and the Captain. Soon to land at the island, Jim Hawkins and the rest of the trustworthy crew plan a way to make it off the island with the treasure and their lives.My ReactionUntil I read this book, I did not realize how much I already knew about it simply from references in popular culture. International Talk Like a Pirate Day could very well have been originated from a group of readers fond of this classic tale of pirates, treasure, and island adventure. In fact, I found just about everything I think about when I imagine pirates in this book. (The only thing Stevenson left out was a few hundred uses of the now ubiquitous pirate word \\"Arr!\\" but that may be anachronistic.) This alone I think demonstrates the far-reaching influence of this book as it applies to the popular view of pirate caricatures.Normally when one thinks of reading \\"classic literature\\" one expects a laborious trek through hundreds of pages of archaic phrases and unfamiliar circumstances. Treasure Island is a refreshing reminder of why there are \\"classics\\" and has encouraged me to seek out others to read. Despite being over one hundred years old, it is easy to immerse oneself in Jim Hawkins' place throughout the action.It took me a few pages to get used to some of the nautical terminology and Stevenson's use of apostrophes and phonetic spelling to illustrate the way the pirates were talking. However once I figured out what he was doing, the characters' voices in my head were clear. The action and suspenseful moments kept me turning the pages. I even jumped a bit in the part when Jim accidentally ended up with the pirates in the middle of the night. Descriptions easily laid out the setting of Skeleton Island. In fact, some of the more bloody scenes were surprisingly descript considering this was a tale aimed at young boys, but nowadays the target audience has seen more than that in a single video game.I was also impressed with the character development within the novel. This was truly a coming-of-age type of tale for Jim Hawkins, learning nobility and honor practically as he fought to keep his and his party's lives and dignity. Long John Silver was mostly the star throughout because of his interesting mannerisms (\\"and you can lay to that\\") and his manipulative character. Just when I thought I figured out Silver's motivation, he pulled out another trick. The rest of the characters were distinct and multi-dimensional, with only one or two archetypes (Pew being one of evil villain, though he doesn't last long in the book).Overall, as many other reviewers have said, Stevenson did not waste any words in writing Treasure Island. Everything written had purpose and added to the story. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a fun exciting page-turner, as well as to anyone wanting to get started reading the classics."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Moving beyond Muppet Treasure Island, I had a hard time even wanting to pick up this novel. Alas, I had to grow up and read the real story. I'm glad I did. While the novel is absent of catchy songs and puppets, Treasure Island makes up for it with graphic fight scenes and an outstanding narrative framework. I love that the story is mostly narrated by Jim Hawkins, our main character. Jim's voice places me so deep in the story that I felt every setting in the novel, from ship to island. Great classic and a must read for any English major."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the best illustrated classic book I found so far. Reading the original can be a great challenge for young readers.

I don't regret reading it, but I know it will be a long time before I read it again.While the story was good, the writing was uneven. In the beginning there is a lot of detail (almost too much at times) but yet by the end the story feels rushed. The amount of detail early on made it drag at times, but the lack of detail towards the end made the ending feel abrupt. It felt as if Stevenson had spent so much time on the beginning, that by the time he got to the end he just wanted to be finished with it.That said, I still think it is a book people should read once.

Since its first publication, it has remained one of the best-loved adventure stories of all time.What is little known about this wonderful novel is that it was born out of a fictitious map that was drawn by Stevenson in 1881 for his twelve-year-old grandson.

And he has the right to be nervous, because he possesses a map drawn by Capitan Flint, the most feared pirate to ever roam the high seas.Well, Flint died, but there's plenty of men who served with Capitan Flint still alive who feel they deserve a fair share of the treasure. The map, though, ends up with Jim Hawkins - (it's a near thing, read the book to find out how that happens). Jim confides in the local doctor and squire, who work together to acquire a ship, a crew, and provisions to sail for Treasure Island. There is a weak link though, because although Squire Trelawney is well-intentioned, he has a big mouth. By the time the Hispaniola is ready for sea, she is boarded by the old murderous mob who sailed with Flint!There's a scene in the book where Jim, hiding in a barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to take over the ship and make this journey their own, taking all the treasure for themselves. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim, aboard the ship.And now....You will have to read the book for yourself to see what happens next. This is a fantastic story of double-crossing and deceit, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if Jim hadn't been involved. For it is he who finds Ben Gunn, marooned on the island, half-mad with isolation. And it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you, you will have to read this amazing pirate tale for yourself."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure IslandBy Robert Louis Stevenson.I am a twelve year old reviewer that is in the 6th grade. I enjoy fantasy adventure books the most. I have quite a good memory for the details in books that I enjoy. If books are not of interest to me I have trouble getting through them and then I forget about what's happening. I can never forget about a good book. I always go back to check out a good book over and over again until someone will buy it for me. I like building my own library because then I will always have the book I want there to read. I stay up late at night reading and if I'm lucky I might stay up the whole night reading. I am someone that does not enjoy looking up words in the dictionary so I just read on and try to figure it out. Treasure Island was not a book I stayed up all night reading, but I still enjoyed reading it. It hand the adventure I wanted, it hand mystery, and it hand a lot of sword fighting.A strange pirate named Captain Flint walks into the Admiral Ben Bow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother own, live and work. Little does Jim know that this man will change his life forever. Captain Flint has a treasure map that another pirate named Long John Silver wants more then anything in the world. This map will lead the Long John to the treasure. When Flint died Jim found the treasure map. Soon after he finds the map pirates attack his house and Jim must flee. When Jim goes looking for the treasure he has to work for a mysterious cook named Long John Silver. When they set upon there journey to the island in search of the treasure Jim gets put to the most challenging tasks. When they see the island Jim gets betrayed by Long John Silver and his cronies who want the treasure more than anything. When Jim gets on shore he must fight pirates for the treasure. As Jim is running through the jungle he finds a man named Ben who was marooned on the island. Ben knows his way around and he may help lead him to the treasure. Jim might lose his life looking for the treasure.I thought that the author had a very interesting way of writing. He would go all out on the exciting parts. I think he made the most important parts of the story sound dreadfully dull. This was a book that I would not stay up all night reading. At some parts I felt like just closing the book and throwing it away. Then he would pick it up again and make it exciting and it made me want to continue. One thing I liked was how I could relate with the character, Jim, at certain points in the book. Something I thought was good was how the author made you use your imagination for the island and how you could picture Ben, the man, and how he lived on the island all alone. The author expressed Jim emotions very well. I could tell when he was scared, sad and mad. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"There is more to this book than meets the eye, you may lay to that. Apart from the fairy tale plot there is superb dialogue and dialect hidden in the pages. The relationship between Long John and Jim unfolds grippingly. There are also superbly detailed scenes of action and adventure allways achieved with an economy of language. The seafaring language is used very deliberately without any ostentation. Always a pleasure to read. Great pace."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"J M Barrie said \\"Over Treasure Island I let my fire die in winter without knowing I was freezing.\\" This is a captivating book that will make you forget little things like freezing to death. Barrie recalls his mother feigning disinterest in the book: \\"'Oh, I may take a look at it again by and by' she says indifferently, but nevertheless the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens, as if by some mechanical contrivance. I remember how she read Treasure Island, holding it close to the ribs of the fire (because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas), and how, when bedtime came, and we coaxed, remonstrated, scolded, she said quite fiercely, clinging to the book, ' I dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till I see how that laddie got out of the barrel.'\\" A well written story of pirates, buried treasure, sailing ships, and adventure, Treasure Island is also a literary treasure. Stevenson deftly creates a whole Piratical lingo for this tale. Parts of the book stick with you like Jim Hawkins meeting marooned Ben Gunn. Ben tells him \\"Marooned three years agone,\\" he continued, \\"and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\\" How can we ever forget Long John Silver's parrot Cap'n Flint crying pieces of eight! pieces of eight! until Silver throws his handkerchief over the cage. You may even hear the surf booming about the coasts of Treasure Island in your dreams. Long John beckons to Jim during the voyage \\"Come away, Hawkins,\\" he would say; \\"come and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son.\\" and so Silver welcomes us all into this splendid yarn."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I now know where every stylized motif used in Pirate's of the Caribbean came from!I don't know if this is the original use of pirate speak..."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I loved this book as a child and now my grandson loves it.

In my youth I read Tolkein, Burroughs, Howard, and many others, but, somehow I never got around to reading Treasure Island. Not only is this one of the great pirate tales, it is also THE buried treasure book, and, one of the truly great adventure stories of all time. While there are many that will find fault with some aspects of the story, all in all, I would suggest that all would-be writers desiring to tell a tale of adventure should take the time to reread this tale before they begin their labors. I should say that having done so, the bulk of them would recognize how far short their own efforts fall. Technically; the book is extremely well written, the plot moves along at a brisk pace, the characters are well drawn, and the dialog sparkles. There is plenty of action, adventure, and suspense, all of it told in a crystal clear prose that wastes not a word. In a nutshell this may indeed be one of the greatest tales of adventure ever told.Although it has traditionally been perceived as a story for younger readers, having just read it at middle age, I believe that you shouldn't consider this a children's tale. Long John Silver is as darkly evil a character as ever appeared in print; he seduces men with a ready confidentiality, warm, friendly, knowing banter, and then cold-bloodedly murders them when their back is turned. He suffers no scruples, knows nothing of mercy, and sells anyone at anytime to the other side if he thinks it will profit him. I think Long John Silver would have done well as a Wall Street corporate raider."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I've read it when I was 12, then I 've re-read it in University and now I am 32 years old and I am reading it again.

It first starts out when a big dark man with an scare on his cheek shows up at his family's inn the \\"Admiral Benbow\\". What Jim (the lead character of the storey) did'nt know was that this larg scarey man was the begining of his horific adventure. Later in the book Jim finds his self sailing off on a boat called the \\"Hispaniola\\" to treasure island along with real seamen and an rude captain.The sentence structure of this book was a bit complicated for me. The sentences were long and very detailed. Some sentences were short and choppy and did not explain enough, were others were long and over detailed and never seemed to end. It seemed like you were always waiting fore some thing exciting to happen, but it never came. The description in this book seemed a little over board. There would be these long and descriptive sentences explaining things that should have not been that long. There would be some thing that was very simple and they would write it in complex detail.I reconmend this book to teen readers. I think that that14 year olds would most enjoy this book because the vocabulary is at proubly their level and they can take in the description more. This book was very long and a little frustrating for me. It seemed like because of the big words and long sentences I could not engage into this book.Also it was hard for me to determend were Jim was in the book. The author would transition from one setting to another way to quikly for me to follow were he is going. It was also hard for me to understand what going on because he would be talking about one thing going on then emediatly switch to some thing else.Alex Meallet."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This isn't a terrible book but I think the plot doesn't make sense.If you are going to read it prepare to be confuced"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I made it to chapter 8 in this book when lo and behold it skipped all the way to chapter 13!

However they are not the only ones who knew about the hidden treasure. They are pursued by the former ruthless crewmembers of Captain Flint, these men will stop at nothing to lay their hands on the map!\`Treasure Island' is absolutely great. From the beginning to the end its filled with non-stop action. Jim Hawkins is telling the story, so as young people are, he is straight to the point. No unnecessary details are given which will certainly appeal to youngsters and best of all it is written in simple and plain English.

Rum finally takes its toll on the pirate and he dies, leaving behind a mysterious chest that the strangers are interested in.

Ultimately, a raging battle takes place on the island where Jim and his friends must outwit the pirates who are led by the one-legged Long John Silver.For a children's book, this book had a lot of inappropriate material - drinking and violence.

I do not remember exactly what she had to say about Captain Silver and Jim Hawkins , whether she felt the cunning and dishonest old curmudgeon Silver was somehow a sympathetic soul, and young Mr. Hawkins was a very worthy and wily apprentice. I do know that around about the same time the Big Screen showed a version of this tale which brought it more vividly to life. As a child I could not exactly understand why Captain Silver had to be ' bad ' at all, and what exactly Mr.Stevenson wanted for us. The treasure , the map , the finding of booty did not appeal very much to my young soul, and to tell the truth the whole tale seemed more like yet another ' adult trick' to make ' children' feel interested in 'school'. The rousing yarn that has held the attention of so many largely confused me. In this one however my guess is my own childhood impressions are pretty well of the mark, and do little justice to a book which has given so much suspenseful pleasure to young readers."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"No doubt Treasure Island is one of the greatest adventure stories of all time, though in my opinion, many readers (especially kids) will have difficulty with the archaic language.

If you are looking for a fun pirate adventure story, but prefer a more readable book, I would recommend an interesting new adaption of Treasure Island, called Wave Hunters, by Chris Lacy. It is basically the same story as Treasure Island, only it takes place in the present day amongst a group of surfers in Indonesia.

While snooping he finds money from everywhere and a map.He sets out with a crew destined to find the treasure. Along the way he makes friends with the friendly cook Long John Silver. He soon finds out the truth about silver and his crew, theu're pirates determined to find the treasure and kill the crew that gets in their way. As they arrive at the island they are soon diveded by power and fright. a battle takes place and soon they realize who has the true power.Jim diobalicly outsmarts the pirates and prove to them that hes not just a boy.This story is full of alcohal and voilance, something not expected in a story meant for children. It can be boring at times and and is full of terms and slang that some may bnot even be able to realize if they didnt put the peices together. All in all it is a wonderful story full of detail and mystery. Its wonderful to find out what happens with the treasure and what ever happens to Jim....?

I'll just say it's excellent, read it.Frankly I'm stunnedto see what people are saying about this book. I mean, I can understand, sort of, why somebody might possibly consider other excellent books, like &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; or &quot;My Antonia&quot; boring, though I don't. But to find THIS book boring?? What in heck DO people read that's so much more exciting than this? I suppose that if a book has 30 seconds that aren't filled with explosions and poison gas, it's considered dull, huh? Aargh.Well, to each his own, I guess."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I have tried to read Treasure Island numerous times. A couple times when I was younger and once as an adult. Every time I found it to be a bit boring and ended up not finishing it. This time I was determined to make it through it. I made it, and the book was okay but I think compared to modern day adventures the adventure in this book was pretty tame. I read this on my Amazon KindleI think everyone knows the basic story. A young boy and some companions form a company of sailors and take off to find buried treasure on Treasure Island. Ends up part of the company are pirates and mutiny upon landing at the Island. Struggles on Treasure Island commence between the loyal sailors and the pirates.The writing style of this novel has definitely aged with time. It isn't horrible to get through; it's pretty readable and the beginning of the story really grabbed my interest. As time goes on though the story gets bogged down with description and predictability. This isn't a story where characterization or action scenes are a strong point. It is an excellent adventure in the sense that they end up on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere; the struggles they face though are more related to dealing with the pirates than dealing with any trouble the Island throws at them.Maybe this story is just too well known, but for some reason I found it very predictable and this made getting through the lengthy descriptions even tougher. This book does do a wonderful job describing pirates and personifying their characters, but it isn't much fun.I think younger readers will find the story tedious and boring, they may also struggle with the stilted language. Older readers may appreciate the lush descriptions, but will ultimately find the action scenes lacking and the adventure to be not quite as adventurous as in modern day works.Overall an okay novel. Not as exciting and engaging as I had hoped for. Now I can say I read it and move on. I don't know that this is one I will read to my son when he gets older, I think it would bore him. When compared to other classic novels I have read this year, this was my least favorite. I found both \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be more engaging and interesting."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the first complete novel that I ever read as a child. Years later when I was traveling around America with my wife and concocting my first book \\"Hobo-ing America\\",Hobo-Ing America: A Workingman's Tour Of The U.S.A.I read this book aloud to my wife before turning out the camper lights every evening.For many years I could only imagine that Robert Louis Stevenson had grown up to be a pirate. How else could he have known the pirates ways so intimately? When I read a biography of Mr. Stevenson and found that he was a sickly child who was often confined to his room for long periods and had thought this whole business up in his vivid imagination, I was more than impressed. I was astounded. As a writer I have always found this fact inspirational.Long John Silver is now folklore like Paul Bunyan and John Henry. And Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the greatest writers ever.Can you believe that the same man who created Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hide also concocted Treasure Island.

Our boys sat through the entire recording in one day!!! That's how much they enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I re-read this recently, after first reading it as a child about twenty years ago. I liked it both times, but enjoyed it more this time. As a child I remember frequently being stalled by the unfamiliar nautical terms, looking them up in the dictionary andfeeling little wiser. Many of them refer to pieces of equipment and, without a picture, the best dictionary in the world isn't going to let you visualise it. But as anyone who's read Patrick O'Brian without being a naval historian knows, all those nautical terms might just as well be made up grobblebems and bindledums, because the story isn't about them. It's about the people, and about treasure, and what people will do to get some, and that's all we need to know about to understand everything that goes on.This time I was more focussed on the colourful characters and swashbuckling adventure. I found I'd almost entirely forgotten the opening chapters, with the inn terrorised by the wonderful horrible old pirate, and the procession of progresively more terrible visitors, but they were one of the highlights on this reading. Long John Silver is by far the most interesting character, narrator Jim Hawkins being something of a colourless \\"good boy\\". And perhaps Jim should be called Lucky Jim, for the chief weakness of the book is the extent to which blind luck saves the day, and the number of times that some inexplicable, irrational act of Jim's turns out to be just what was needed to make everything all right. But all that is more than made up for by the genius of Silver's character, and the unpredictability that he brings to the story.One thing that raises this above a lot of other adventure fiction is that the characters live in a world of economic reality, driven by the need to earn a living and the desire to not have to earn a living any more; whereas so many adventure characters seem to live in a rent-free fantasy world. Possibly this aspect of the book contributes to its greater appeal for me as an adult reader; to a child the pirates were just bad people who did bad things because they were bad, but as an adult who has to earn a living I can better understand why they want that treasure so much."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"\\"Treasure Island,\\" written by the 19th century novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, is the timeless story about life on the high seas with pirates, treasure, murder, and treachery.When young and naive Jim Hawkins is given a treasure map from the mysterious old pirate, Billy Bones, adventure and trouble are not far behind. Soon Jim finds himself aboard a ship with a villainous crew led by the cunning and mendacious pirate, Long John Silver. Greed and the lust for gold driving the pirates, they have murder in mind when they reach the dubious Treasure Island.Skillfully yet simply written, Robert Louis Stevenson gives us an alluring tale that sparks the imagination. With its dastardly plot and mothly crew of rogues and villains, it entrances the reader, and keeps them wanting more. \\"Treausure Island\\" is the perfect read for anyone just wanting a good, exciting story."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is absolutely amazing! The beginning may have been a little dull, but towards the middle I really started to get into it. The story kept me glued to the book. I would get dissapointed when I was told to stop reading. It seemed that every time I had to stop, there was some adventure that had just begun.It starts out with a struggling family who owns an inn. One day, an adventurous seaman, known as the \\"cap'n\\" comes to their inn. Once the pirate dies, the inn owners son, Jim, starts to check out the cap'n's chest that was in his room. Jim discovers a map that leads to Captain Flint's buried treasure. This brings along many adventures, and laughs!Jim and the town doctor and the town squire set out to find this buried treasure. During the trip to Treasure Island, Jim makes the startling discovery that the people working and sailing the ship are planning to overthrow the captain and his men. Once there, Jim, the captain, the doctor and the squire sneak off to the other side of the island. This leads everyone to war as Jim meets a castaway that had been on the island for three years. This man helps Jim and the other men to saftey, while the leader of the pirates, Long John Silver, continues to hunt for the treasure.Jim and the castaway take control of the pirates ship and are soon looking for treasure themselves. Jim, wandering about on his own, falls into the clutches of the enemy. This creates commotion as the castaway and the other men try to free him, but cannot. The pirates are soon out looking for the treasure again with Jim and make it to where the treaure should be. To their surprise, it is gone!The doctor and squire kill the other pirates, except for Silver, and take him and Jim to the castaways cave. The castaway, having been on the island for three years, had found the treasure and carried it all to a hidden cave by the coast. Inside the cave was also meat that the castaway had hunted for. Jim and the others make it to the cave and move the treasure onto the boat.Then they sail away and everyone lives happily ever after (except the pirates)."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"TREASURE ISLAND was first published in 1883 by Cassell & Company, Limited, London, England. Has probably never been out of print since, though first published as a serial in a boy's magazine, it has become a book for almost everyone.Some editions of the book have a map included, others do not. My 1965 edition of Signet Classics does not, but my later Signet edition does. Some readers find the map interesting and helpful, others such as LORD OF THE FLIES author, William Golding, referred to the map, as only an \\"overrated chart\\". When reading introductions or afterwords in the various editions of TREASURE ISLAND one can find almost anything, from praise or lack of praise where Robert Louis Stevenson is concerned. Since I know little of his Scottish background or Calvinism or much of anything else of the man, I find TREASURE ISLAND only a very fine book and am not surprised at all that, though it began its life as somewhat a failure as a magazine serial, it has become a lasting classic.Even should one not have read the book, characters such as Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins, Blind Pew, Black Dog or Billy Bones and various other terms such as pieces of eight, or black spot, are familiar terms in and of themselves. Though some reviewers say the characters are only two dimensional, RLS certainly put enough of them in the book. There are more than enough black hearted pirates to go 'round, and in the character of Long John Silver Stevenson struck pure gold. So much in fact that his original title for TREASURE ISLAND almost was 'The Sea Cook' based on the part ole 'barbecue' (Long John Silver) has aboard the Hispaniola. Yes, Silver is a character well worth his salt, starting out somewhat good, becoming bad, and then morphing back into somewhat good, a character to remain long after the reading. And he escapes the gibbet in the end, not an easy feat in England at that time. Before reading the book I had felt it to be an 'Englishman's' book of England of sorts, yet nothing is farther from the truth, as Robert Louis Stevenson was very much a man of Scotland and the book becomes more of a Scotman's view of the English. Interesting indeed with some subtle truths and asides if one recognizes them.Stevenson started with only the map, one he had drawn for his young stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, yet this map gave birth to the novel. Stevenson's father gave idea to Billy Bone's trunk and its contents, going so far as picking the name Walrus for evil Captain Flint's old ship. From stepson Lloyd we also get the structure and stricture that there be no girls in this book, only male sailors and pirates. Lloyd wanted a boy's book of treasure and pirates. Fortunately girl readers have had as much enjoyment as the boys down through the years.If a reader enjoys a return to their youth of pirate ships, pirates, and an island of treasure to the amount of 700,000, then get on board the Hispaniola and ride with this group to Treasure Island.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Although written primarily for boys, Treasure Island is one of the few books I remember being wildly excited about as a girl. I decided to share it with my 5 year old (who appreciates a pirate adventure) and I am reading a chapter at a time to him at bedtime. Although it is sometimes a little much for a 5 year old (some deaths and pirates with missing body parts) I can read it in a way that interests him. And, it is a great learning experienced due to this \\"enriched classic\\" version. I can tell my son about real pirates (who he now knows were actually \\"bad guys\\") and about the way things were in the mid 1700's. I explain a lot as I go, but he is fascinated- and we're learning a lot together! I highly recommend it... especially to read to kids slightly older than my 5 year old.

This book deserves all five stars, it has everything you could ask for such as, suspense, comedy, action, drama and a great plot line. R.L. Stevenson puts a lot of detail into his main characters such as Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins just to name a few. He describes the scenes with such great detail that at times I had to remind myself that it is only a book. I spent more than 2 months reading this book and I enjoyed every part of it. I could RARELY find a paragraph that was dull, the book was very exciting overall. This book is fairly easy to read and I would recommend it to adults and children of all ages. The book moves at a very good pace, not too fast, not too slow. This book is anything but boring, something new happens in every chapter for instance, when Jim witnesses a murder and when he gets into bar fights, those are just some of the many things that happened. I was very surprised myself when I read this book because it seems a little childish but in fact it's quite the contrary.

Since I never read Treasure Island as an adolescent, I decided to give it a try. It is absolutely delightful! It is a tale worth reading. Robert Louis Stevenson's prose is appropriate for youths or adults and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep the reader on their toes. The story is rich in detail and intrigue. Stevenson is able to develop character with a few details, as does Charles Dickens. Quickly we empathize and identify with the feisty, clever, honest boy Jim Hawkins. The pirates are great. They are such a lousy bag of scum and Stevenson has the ability to make them evil and also individuals, a real skill. We also learn the tale through the eyes of an adolescent boy. This is a wonderful technique used by Salinger in Catcher in the Rye and used by Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This technique is powerful in that it allows the character as well as the reader to encounter characters and situations with naive eyes and thus must use native intelligence to separate lie from truth, safety from danger. While the boy main character is trying to figure out who to trust, the reader is also. Jim Hawkins is a likable boy and Stevenson has a sense of the physicality and movement and energy of boys. He has Jim engaging in physical activities in which an adolescent would undertake in an emergency that an adult might not. This feature helps explain the popularity over many years of this book for adolescent males. Jim, the son of a terminally ill tavern owner and his wife, is exposed to the pirates when Billy Bones comes to hide out in their remote tavern and inn. Immediately Stevenson lets us know that some adults are not to be trusted and are of low, dangerous character. That is another great aspect of the book since it doesn't sugar coat adulthood but allows Jim to see adults as a mixture of virtue, foolishness, greed, and homicidal intention. The Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey are examples of realistically developed adults, sometimes foolish and sometimes heroic. Another fine aspect of the book is that it is about recognizing, understanding, and counter-acting treachery. The character of Long John Silver is wonderful. He would be classified as a psychopath by today's psychological standards but when written, he was very evil and very smart, a deadly combination. Without giving away any of the plot, Jim must outsmart Long John Silver just to survive and thus the tension developed by character and an economical storyline makes the book a real treat. The book deserves to be considered a classic and deserves more than 5 stars since it is an enjoyable classic, the best combination."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"\\"...and sail away...laden with crimes and riches.\\"--page 232Robert Louis Stevenson was first and foremost a terrific, and very entertaining, storyteller; and \`Treasure Island,' a much-deserved classic, is a page-turner of an adventure story.Recommendation: Very highly recommended; especially for children, regardless of their age."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"When I first read this book, I was 11 and I loved it.

This has proven two things to me, the first being that a great classic work never becomes outmoded no matter how many years may pass, and the second is that to really appreciate a book it ought best to be read more than once, and probably more than twice ... especially if that book is a good book.Treasure Island, as many who read this know, tells the story of Jim Hawkins, who leaves his hamlet in England and goes to sea after a mysterious and violent series of events leaves him in possession of a sea captains chest, among the contents of which is a treasure map for locating buried loot on a remote island. The start of the event triggers off a series of twists and turns that lead to a tale of high adventure and of a boy's coming of age that has been imitated by many but in my opinion, rarely handled with as much verve and creative power as Stevenson's original classic.One of the discoveries, or re-discoveries I made on reading Treasure Island, was that this is more than a mere adventure tale, but a story that deals with a number of issues of central importance to the human condition that are part and parcel of its overall theme. I think one of the main issues that Stevenson is commenting on is the nature of human greed, and the difference between those who are overcome by it and those who aren't. The pirates are depicted as often behaving a lot more like animals than like human beings, by contrast with the captain and crew of the British ship of the line. Another is the value of working together toward a common good versus being motivated by lust for gold or glory, as is also reflected in the difference between the ships' crews.There are more messages, but don't make the mistake of thinking that Treasure Island is a message book. It wasn't back in school, and it isn't now. What it is first and foremost is a top-notch adventure thriller, and for my money as entertaining a tale as any Pirates of the Caribbean adventure which, come to think of it, might profit from a little of the subtext that Stevenson put into his own immortal work."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I have to confess...I never read this as a child and I'm shocked that I didn't.I did read Pirate Brig which is why I probably sail today...smile...This came up on my phone for free so I decided to kill some time to read it; absolutey captured me and took me hostage even though I had a pretty good idea what the end was going to be after so many \\"versions\\" of the plot in cartoons etc over the years.Still a great book to read and a must read for every boy."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I loved this book.

There are memorable characters and slippery plot complications that make this literally a genuine trip as you turn the pages.

A few times during the thick of the plot, I actually gasped aloud thinking it may be the end! Altogether, this was a very good and easy read.

Recently, parted from my copy, I picked up an old nondescript hardcover of Treasure Island at the library to complete the book in its entirety.I found the first half of the book highly enjoyable, one that I recalled warmly as I re-read it. But as the book progressed, I was astounded at how difficult the reading was becoming; the pirate slang and their use of strange metaphors obviously grew proportionate to the amount of pirates in the scene. In one of the few moments of humor, the hero Hawkins even says, \\"\`Well,' I said, \`I don't understand one word that you've been saying. But that's neither here nor there[...].'\\" The dialects makes the book that much more realistic; in my mind, however, I wonder if children reading this book fully comprehend it, or were they simply smarter in the 19th century? After spoiling myself with easy modern thrillers, I had to hunker down and really concentrate my efforts in trying to understand the subtext. The rough slang slowed my reading down greatly, but increased my enjoyment. And, of course, having finally completed the book and knowing the true story, my re-read in a few years will be thrice as good!In 1881, while vacationing in Scotland, Stevenson painted an island with his stepson which became the inspiration for the novel. He soon wrote 15 chapters, and completed the rest in Switzerland at the rate of one chapter a day. It was finally published as an entire novel in 1883.Stevenson throws together goods that have become legendary in pirate lore: Pirates with fantastic names, like Captain Flint, Billy Bones, Black Dog, Pew, Israel Hands (based on the real-life member of Blackbeard's crew), and the now-infamous Long John Silver, himself with a parrot on his shoulder; a single treasure map that has three red crosses (designating two piles of treasure, one pile of arms); a beautiful schooner that's put through its paces; a 23 member crew (excluding Jim Hawkins, Doctor Livesey, and Squire Trelawney), most of whom become gentlemen of fortune; mutiny; double-crosses; the shanty \\"15 men on a Dead Man's chest/Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\"; the notorious Jolly Roger; spirits, superstition, and lore; and even a skeleton or two.Treasure Island actually refers to the fictitious Skeleton Island---perhaps an inspiration for the children's book The Secret of Skeleton Island (1966)---, a sweltering jungle in the day and eerily submerged in mists in the early mornings. A strange coincidence I found led me to some interesting finds. Stevenson named an anchorage point after the pirate Captain Kidd. In 1935, Harold T. Wilkins published a book entitled \\"New Facts about Mysterious Captain Kidd and his Skeleton Island Chests,\\" in which can be found one of Kidd's treasure maps. Two years after Wilkins's book was published a treasure hunter found an uncanny resemblance between this \\"Skeleton Island\\" and Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Oak Island's impervious Water Pit is purportedly where Captain Kidd buried part of his treasure before being hanged in 1701 (the Pit is also the main inspiration for the 1998 novel Riptide). In a twist worthy of Robinson himself, despite Kidd's map uncovering some of Oak Island's mysteries, Wilkins eventually stepped forward to admit his maps were fabricated. But was Stevenson alluding to Kidd's connection with Oak Island?Treasure Island is an adventurous classic I heartily recommend anyone to read. I personally advocate reading the book if you're older, or re-reading it, to fully enjoy the environment created through the striking language. A fantastic aid in understanding pirate slang is the online Encyclopaedia Piratica. While you're at it, go to any map engine and plug in the latitude and longitude found at the end of Chapter 6, \\"The Captain's Papers,\\" to see where Billy Bones claimed booty!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island remains, perhaps, the supreme adventure story for boys. It has all the classic ingredients - a brave and reasonably credible hero, pirates, a voyage, treasure, and an uninhabited island. At the same time it is worth reading, even re-reading, by an adult: it treats death and moral depravity realistically, and underneath all the excitement there is a note of sobriety and resignation. What puts it in a class of its own are two elements. One is the chief character, the one-legged pirate John Silver, who is both hugely vivid and psychologically subtle - so that by the end the reader feels he knows him well without fully understanding him, like all the great characters of fiction. The other is the plotting, that is full of brilliant twists that leave the reader gasping (even where they are partly predictable) and produces a series of memorable and well contrasted episodes.This is probably the best of Stevenson's full-length novels. His other two great works, in my estimation, are \`Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' and the \`Fables', which come together in a volume in the old \`Tusitala' pocket edition, which can easily be found secondhand."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is arguably one of the greatest works of storytelling in the English language. Stevenson created other novels, with greater depth and insight, but the highlight of Treasure Island is the combination of color and poetic prose that distinguishes his tale of piracy and boyhood adventure from the rest of the field of other adventure books. The title alone paints an image of suspense, and salty pirates battling over great riches. Most people tend to view Treasure Island as a story for children, but it can be enjoyed by anyone longing for a rollicking adventure. Like so many stories from the 1800s, each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and once you get used to the language the author's humor shines through."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island / 0-375-75682-5There's been so many movies based on \\"Treasure Island\\" that it's almost impossible not to be somewhat familiar with the story. Stevenson shines here, managing to carefully craft a story for children that will also appeal to adults.The boy hero of the story is respected enough to be included in the plans and tribulations of the adults on board, but is not kowtowed to the point of offending adult sensibilities. The pirates are realistically rendered, but not to the point where real children would likely be frightened - the violence here is fantastical only, of the sort that was seen so vividly in other classics, such as \\"Peter Pan\\". Indeed, I am tempted to categorize \\"Treasure Island\\" as a children's classic, alongside such classics as Barrie's work, but I feel that the slightly dated format and feel of this particular classic might present a barrier to young children. Perhaps this is best read as an adult's guilty pleasure, or as a group reading choice, with the adult explaining the more esoteric references and sea-faring minutia.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is an excellent book. I highly recommend adding it to your classiccollection.It is great reading for older children or adults. The author makes youfeel you are there, with the salty sea in your face, running for yourlife.The illustrator, Wyeth, one of my favorite artists, compliments the flavor of the adventure."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"TREASURE ISLAND is quite simply *the* classic pirate story. It is a supremely enjoyable read, an adventure tale with danger, mystery, suspense, and travel to exotic places--not to mention pirates!Robert Louis Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND tells of the coming of age of the boy Jim Hawkins, the son of innkeepers. One day, Jim's parents take on a strange boarder, the \\"captain,\\" later revealed to be a pirate mate, Billy Bones. The \\"captain\\" kept in his room a chest within which, it is revealed after his death, there is a treasure map indicating gold and silver buried on a deserted island. Jim takes the map to the local physician, Doctor Livesey, and the squire John Trelawney. Spurred to action, Trelawney secures a ship, the Hispaniola, which is captained by Alexander Smolletts. He invites Livesey to serve as ship's surgeon and Jim as cabin boy. Trelawney also hires the crew--most of whom turn out to be pirates associated with the treasure map's original owner, Captain Flint. The pirates are led by the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a wily, one-legged, parrot-bedecked, opportunistic pirate chief. (Stevenson's Long John Silver profoundly shaped later popular pirate lore.) The pirates intend to kill the captain, squire, doctor, and Jim on the return voyage after having found the buried treasure. What follows is Jim's adventure of a lifetime.Though intended to be a story for youth, TREASURE ISLAND's nineteenth-century language, particularly the patois of the sea dogs, will challenge readers under ten. Amusingly, it sometimes also challenges Jim Hawkins, who can't always follow what the pirates are saying. Though the language at times may be difficult, the suspense of the tale will keep propelling readers forward to its exciting and satisfying end.This \\"Whole Story\\" edition is lavishly illustrated with color drawings based on the story. There are also pages devoted to types of sailing vessels, sails, knots, compasses and other nautical stuff. The book also includes a number of sidebar-like illustrated fun facts about pirates and other things only tangentially related to the story. In fact, I often found the additional material not terribly germane and sometimes intrusive and distracting. Still, it makes for a handsome gift book. One simply interested in reading this ripping yarn might choose an edition with simple illustrations or no illustrations at all, save for Stevenson's treasure map."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is truly a treasure that many teenagers do not discover. Its rich language and stunning plot will captivate anyone. Teenagers should take the time and make the effort to become acquainted with this literary classic. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in pirates and this book is right up there with the best of the stories. Full of adventure, treachery, and deceit, this yarn is wonderfully spun. As you read, you go back in time to the years of the pirates. You meet evil, sinister Israel Hands, and honest, innocent Jim Hawkins. It is a fight between good and evil. While the good and the bad are fighting against each other, one man is trying to decide to be good or evil. Long John Silver, the merry, unscrupulous buccaneer cannot decide what side to be on. One day he is a greedy pirate looking for loot and the next he is helping the good guys conquer the bad. Treasure Island is like a study of good and evil with many examples of human nature and the consequences that come from the choices that are made. For anyone who is in need of a great book, Treasure Island is it. The story travels from a sleepy inn disturbed by a drunken buccaneer to the rolling sea and then on to the incredible island. Battles are fought and foes vanquished. The wide variety of characters with exotic personalities will engage a reader of any age."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book has nice pen and ink illustrations throughout and includes the original Treasure Island map illustration from the original edition. The cover art is by a different artist who has clearly adapted the image from the very familiar publicity photo of Jim and Long John Silver from the Disney film--kind of humorous."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Originally written for Stevenson's young American stepson, TREASURE ISLAND is a lighter read and less mature than his other works. Still, it is a highly entertaining, fast-paced novel that certainly deserves its status as a classic in English literature. Being perhaps the most influential book on the pirate mythos, this is one that you'll find familiar even if you've never read it before. From the one-legged Long John Silver and his motley band of scoundrels to treasure maps where 'X' marks the spot, this is the book that helped shape 'gentlemen of fortune' in many books and stories since then.Jim Hawkins, the young hero of the story, is the principle narrator, telling the story of his adventure in a rather breathless manner. Sometimes obscure details are described while traumatic scenes are sort of glossed over. In this way, the story really takes on a realistic feel, as Jim tells his story the way he remembers it. Unquestionably brave, Jim doesn't gloat on his accomplishments and victories, but relates the story in a modest way, hardly hesitating to describe his fear and admit his weaknesses.The other characters really drive the story. Long John Silver and all the pirates are some of the most colorful characters you'll ever find. Rough, deceitful, and hard, their motivations are never difficult to discern. Their sometimes hilarious manner of speaking displays their character and brings them to life like no amount of purely descriptive writing could. Jim Hawkins' friends are much less interesting as characters, but are nonetheless important. The squire, the doctor, and their men play key parts in the tale but are never really the focus of readers' attention. To be honest, compared to the other characters, they are rather dull.Robert Louis Stevenson's first published work is highly entertaining, but somewhat less mature than his other work."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I missed this one as a boy though I had always loved adventure fiction. So years later, and no longer a boy, I picked it up and tried to read it. But I just couldn't get into it and so put it aside. More recently I picked it up again, this time determined to see it through.Although it wasn't compelling at the start, with the appearance of an old pirate, Billy Bones, at the Admiral Benbow Inn run by young Jim Hawkins' father, it did start to pick up a head of steam as I pushed my way into it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it catching me up with the discovery of the map and the appearance of the pirates in hot pursuit of Billy Bones, and Jim's race to Dr. Livesy and Squire Trelawney to gain their protection. Intriguingly these upstanding English gentlemen, pillars of their community, decide to hunt the treasure for themselves though the squire, at least, lacks the good sense or discretion to keep the project secret. And so young Jim is swept along into the excursion, upon the death of his father, and soon finds himself aboard a suspect ship manned by an even more suspicious seeming crew on the way to a desert island in the Caribbean where old pirate Captain Flint's treasure is purportedly buried.The most interesting character is, of course, the by now famous Long John Silver who has long since entered into the cultural zeitgeist. But Silver's not nearly as charming or charismatic in this book as he has come to seem in popular recollection. Young Jim Hawkins, for his part, is a mischievous fellow who manages to get himself into one scrape after another while always coming out alright, even when he is obliged to face down a treacherous mutineer or when he stumbles unthinkingly into the pirates' own nest.In truth Treasure Island is not quite as exciting or as easy a read as one might expect for all its reputation. Still, it was nicely done and kept me reading to the end (though it did end with something of a letdown, leading me to think it somewhat overrated). It was a boy's book from the first, according to its author and I think it works well enough as that. Still, it's somewhat dated and lacks the excitement we've come to expect in our adventures today. Good but not among the best, in my view. I thought Stevenson's Master of Ballantrae much the better book.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A tale of pirates, peglegs, parrots, purloining and perfidery and old Blind Pew.A lost treasure map is wanted by many, who are willing to kill to get it. These men are pirates, and a young lad, Jack Hawkins, and the odd other innocent get caught up in the struggle.A source of much classic pirate caricature and pretty enjoyable."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"By Laura B.Treasure Island is an amazing story of adventure on the high seas, a tale of betrayal and friendship; an exciting saga of pirates on a search for buried treasure, this is a story that any age group will love. I have only seen Treasure Island movies in the past, and on reading the book I found the story different from what I've known. I am going to tell you a little about the book, I don't want to spoil the story so I won't tell you the entire thing.The story first tells of how young Jim Hawkins got Captain Flint's Treasure map from Captain Billy Bones. Jim found the map in Billy Bones' sea chest when Jim and his mother were looking through the chest for the money that Bones owed them. Because you see Bones had died during his attempt to escape the evil pirates who were after him. So Jim and his mother had to hurriedly look for the money, and while his mother was trying to count out the right amount of money Jim took Captain Flint's map.After the pirates attacked the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" that was the name of the inn that the Hawkins family owned, Jim goes and gets help from Dr.Livesey and Squire Trelawney and together they board a ship called the Hispaniola and set a course for Treasure Island.On board Jim becomes friends with the ship's cook Long John Silver (who owns a parrot named Cap'n Flint after the infamous pirate captain), but little does Jim know that Silver is actually a pirate and an ex-member of Captain Flint's crew. Jim soon learns of a sinister plot being made by Silver to steal the treasure that might endanger him and his friends.I won't say anymore. If you're the type that enjoys stories of pirates, treasure, and a parrot that says \\"pieces of eight, pieces of eight\\" you'll have to read the book. You can also read other Robert Louis Stevenson books like Kidnapped which I haven't read but it's supposed to be good, but the book you'll enjoy most is Treasure Island."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is one of the greatest books.

I was amazed that even with such an explosive plotline, the story is in no way rushed; in fact it is quite the contrary. Each chapter gets its fair share of events and specific plotline, which really is an advantage to the book all the way along, it, is not boring in any paragraph whatsoever. Each character gets their own individual personality, such as feelings, emotions, and the decision of \\"What would this character do if this happened?\\" It is clearly obvious that R.L. Stevenson spent most time on the character of Long John Silver, whose personality changes from good to bad to good to bad almost within every chapter, and also the character of Jim Hawkins, who finds the adventure just one long disaster after another, finding himself in the most dangerous of situations: Almost being stabbed to death, overhearing a mutiny plan, witnessing a murder and stumbling into the enemy to name a few. Each chapter sends the reader onto a total roller-coaster ride of emotions, including sadness, comedy, rudery and tension making Treasure Island definitely worth reading, the only problem with it is that once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I missed reading Treasure Island as a child, but I'm happy to write that I enjoyed it thoroughly as an adult.

I really enjoyed all of the characters in this book, although I think a few too many of the good people died. The story starts off a little slow but it speeds up very quickly.

Captain Long John Silver has been quite a fictional figure not only for my self but for the world (ex. Long John Silver's restaraunts). I must admit that I liked the book, but there was a flaw in it that I found. Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times. In one spot expecially, might I point out, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all. Now that's a little obvious, don't you think? Perhaps if the author had found a way to avoid these give-aways I would have been more surprised with the story line than was when I read it for the first time. In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes at making the plot too obvious too soon. Oh well. I do have one more thing to say, though.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read to my 11 and 9 year old daughters, a chapter a night and this one was perfect. It's not only a great story line, but allows children to identify with the main character. The graphic scenes describing various altercations between the crew and owners is relevant and realistic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This classic purchased for kids intertainment and education on a road trip but adults probably enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Every image I have ever heard about pirates is perfectly captured in this one book and sets the standard for all others to live up to. I wish I had had time to read this when I was younger since it was obviously written with younger readers in mind, but I enjoyed it just as well at my current age, and I look forward to reading it to my own children.Since this was written for a younger reader, there is a lot of foreshadowing, which takes the edge off of the mystery and suspense. I guess Stevenson did not want the younger readers to worry to much about whether the main character is going to be all right, so that they could focus more on enjoying the story.This story has everything. Buried treasure, maps, one legged pirates, people walking the plank, talking parrots, murder, secret islands, hangings, sea adventure, drunken sailors, and songs. I can see where Jimmy Buffet probably got a lot of inspiration for some of his songs.Long John Silver is a despicable character that you can't help admiring one minute, and hating the next, only to find yourself somewhere in between at the end of the story. He's brave and cunning, but very conniving. Jim Hawkins is an excellent young character who has the habit of always being in the right place at the right time. He is young and impressionable, and I'm sure most of the readers can relate to him, and put themselves in his shoes. Captain Flint, who's character is not actually in the book still carries a lot of weight as an evil villain. Other characters not mentioned like the Doctor, Captain Smollett, and the Squire are quite honorable and hold their own throughout the story.No matter how deranged and twisted it might seem, these pirates have their own laws and their own coat of honor which they keep to in one way or other throughout the story. I wonder if Stevenson based this on any actual facts he may have obtained regarding real pirate's or whether he invented it all in his head. Regardless it is fascinating how they justify their actions. This book is on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written, and I thoroughly agree with their assessment. The images drawn is this particular book were wonderful, and really captured each scene."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A page-turning classic adventure tale of crusty pirates and heroic gentlemen told through the eyes of a daring youth.

The Wyeth illustrations in this edition are simply electric -- large, colorful and very crisp, while in the other edition the same illustrations are dark and blurry."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A century and a quarter after it first appeared, \\"Treasure Island\\" is still the quintessential story of pirates and treasure, the one that all others are measured against. It is also by far the most \\"readable\\" (if you can handle a little 18th Century nautical slang) of all so-called Literary Classics. If they made you read it in school, try it again; if you missed it in school, give it a try now.What gives this novel its peculiar staying power? Why can it still fascinate a reader (child OR adult) of the 21st Century? Well Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the great storytellers to start with, and since he was writing it for a child, his stepson, Treasure Island lacks some of the Victorian literary fashions that otherwise could have dated it. Also piracy and treasure hunting offer ample opportunities for exciting adventure. In addition Long John Silver is a truly brilliant creation; a character whose conflicted ambiguity has resulted in dramatic interpretations over the years ranging from total villain to foster father.However, I think the forgotten ingredient is simply this: unlike most fictional treasure hunts, in Treasure Island the good guys get to keep the treasure. Stop and think how many treasure hunt stories end instead with the treasure being lost forever or returned to the rightful owners and the heroes ending up with nothing or just a handful that leaves them little if any better off than they were. But the truth is that whatever the dangers of getting rich quick most of us would be willing to take the risk if we could find a treasure that belonged to no one else. Treasure Island feeds this need in a way that very few of its imitators do.As for this edition,Treasure Island (Courage Classics), I like it because it includes the fascinating essay RLS wrote about writing Treasure Island, particularly the genesis of Long John Silver."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Do you love blood thirsty pirates and treasure huntin'? Then this is the book for you. Filled to the brim with pirates, such as Billy Bones, Black Dog, Blind Pew, Israel Hands and even Long John Silver, this suspenseful novel is about young Jim Hawkins who gets Captain Flint's treasure map and teams up with the local doctor and squire on the adventure of a lifetime. As they go on their voyage in search of treasure they are faced with a mutinous crew who served Captain Flint. Even though Captain Flint is dead they all think they have a fair share at the treasure. Read this historic adventure full of treachery and deceit to see if Jim Hawkins and the trustworthy men of the ship survive.I think this is a great novel and would recommend it to any of my friends. If you like adventures you will love this book. It is action packed and suspenseful all the way through and it never gets boring."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is bar none one of the best adventure stories of all time. Whether you are young, old, or young at heart this book has something for everyone. Join young Jim Hawkins on the quest for pirate treasure and marvel at his treacherous & motley companions like Long John Silver. Robert Louis Stevenson is a master story teller in terms of pacing, tone, and his characters. Although it was written more than a hundred and twenty years ago, this book is still considered a classic for good reasons. Do yourself a big favor and READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I thought that \\"Treasure Island\\" was a very good, exciting book and it made me want to read. There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue. Adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones,death, was also a part of how it made it interesting. over all it is a very good book and I advise people of all ages to read it"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the best classical book I have ever read in my life. It is a little hard to understand, but kids can follow it pretty easy. This is a very 'fun' book. For the adults it has a lot of adventure and mystery and even a couple minor fihgting scenes."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I thought this book was a really great book. It was full of adventure and action. Even though this book had alot of action and adventure some chapters were not that exciting.This book was about battles between pirates and a group of people who both are trying to claim treasure for themselves.In this book you discover a moroonar,a boy named Jim Hawkins,a one legged pirate and a man named Captian Flint. I reccomend everyone should read this book because of its action,adventure, and mystery."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is one of my favorite classics of all time. I was first introduced to this book in the eighth grade (I'm 22 now) and have loved it ever since, even keeping the copy given to me in class, telling my teacher I lost it so I wouldn't have to give it back.What makes this book so fun? Overall, it is an fun adventure, making it a fun read. The main characters are fleshed out well. For example, we the reader feel just as betrayed as young Jim Hawkins when he learns of Long John Silver's plot to steal the treasure.The story itself is broken into nice sections and flows together from start to finish. There is never really a dull moment in the book.Treasure Island is a great read and a classic novel. Just don't confuse it with Pirates of the Carribean."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is a beautifully written classic that can take you to a different world, or maybe two. Set in the time of pirates, this book takes you on a treasure hunt that is full of back-stabbing, loyalty, and adventure. The author keeps you compelled to read on because of his lack of detail for conflicts. You just cannot wait to turn the next page to see why this man is angry, what happened in the past, and what kind of foreshadowing you can get for the future. The only bad part about this book is the extremely confusing language. That author uses the slang and terms that of the time and setting, which is great because it's accurate, but almost annoying because it's hard to keep up with. This book also requires a little back-up knowledge of the story, because the language you read might confuse you, and cause you to not get enough information on the story at hand and characters in it. In this book my favorite character was \\"the bad man with one leg\\" (you'll find out who it is later in the book, I won't ruin it) because even though he's the evil character, he's so wonderfully generated and portrayed. His evil-ness is overtaking the man itself, and while you'd love for Hawkins(the main character) to avoid him, and stay safe, you find yourself also begging for confrontation, just to see what the \\"one legged man's\\" scheme will be. Overall, I think this is a classic for every generation. And unless you're obsessed with love stories, this book will have it all. Also, people who don't even like adventure type books will enjoy this novel too because of the sheer greatness of it all. \\"Treasure Island\\" is constructed amazingly well, with all the good cliff hangers left for you to read and figure out for yourself, and all the parts that \\"make you twitch\\" are in all the right places."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The best book I ever read was Treasure Island. I liked it because it is an adventure story. Adventure books are my favorite type of books! I thought the treasure hunt would be the most exciting part, but it wasn't. The gun fight was much more exciting.This exciting book is about a boy named Jim Hawkins. He lives and works at a hotel. One day a pirate comes and gives Billy Bones, Jim's boss, the black spot. The pirate leaves and Billy faints and never wakes up. Jim found Billy's treasure map. The pirates come back and attack his house. This is only the beginning of Jim's fantastic adventure to find the treasure.I recommend this book to anyone who is bored and needs some adventure."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is a non stop thriller of excitement, pirates and mutiny. This exciting classic was told by the young Jim Hawkins about the finding of a map to Treasure Island. The enchanted young buck gets the map from the dying Billy Bones. He later finds that it is the infamous map of the legendary Captain Flint's never ending treasure. He takes the lucky find to his friend Doctor Livesey and they were off to sea. They find the most trustworthy sailor by the name of Long John Silver. He gets them the most seaworthy crew and all seems well until the Captain warns them that the crew is untrustworthy and mutiny is in the air. Swashbuckling abounds! They are in for an adventure that they must see through to the end. Few thrillers today can match all the twists and turns of this legendary tale. Yo ho!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed a chance to read Treasure Island after so many years. I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time I read it so many years ago. I highly recommend it to others who are seeking some escape from the modern era."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The young Jim Hawkins tells the tale of buried treasure and treacherous pirates led by Long John Silver who wants to keep the treasure for him-self. From the Admiral Bow Inn the tail sails on in the Hispanola galleon to treasure island. Set to magical pen and ink artwork this book will delight. A must read."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is the first greatest pirate story of all times. The young and brave Jim Harkins, the scary but honorable Long John Silver, the smart and solid Doctor Livesey. Frankly I could go on and on listing interesting characters, major or otherwise, but let me just say that, having never before read the novel, I totally enjoyed it. It has everything, from a blind beggar to a treasure map to drunken pirates, a parrot, and lots of plotting. Who is with the good guys? Who is with the bad guys? Who is out for themselves? Read and see."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This ghastly book is an amazing adventure. It starts out with a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim and his family live in their inn called the ADMIRAL BENBOW. Captain Billy Bones is a man that holds the map to Treasure Island and the buried treasure. Jim and the crew of the HISPANIOLA head to Treasure Island. That's when Jim gets to know Long John Silver. It just happens to be that Long John Silver takes most of the men and mutinies, in order to take the treasure himself. The others that were mutinied went to the Stockade, a small little cabin in the forest. Jim hid and snuck out with the mutineers. When he got away from the mutineers he found a man named Ben Gunn that was marooned a few years before. Then Jim finally found the Stockade. The rest of the book has multiple twists and turns.This book was a complicated read for me. It has very hard to read the language and it has some very detailed violence. This book is made for readers that love adventure big challenges. This book is made for advanced 6th grade readers or higher. This book had to have taken Robert Louis Stevenson awhile because of the complicated storyline, language and character development. Having a good soul and sprit will lead to wealth in both physically and mentally and that is what this book teaches. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this book as if it took place in old Great Britain with Pirates. He describes everything so well. Sometimes the descriptions are hard to understand. Robert also makes the book sound exactly like the time he set it in (around the 1700's). If you want a book full of adventure, treasure, pirates, ships and a challenge, then this is the book for you!Chloe 6th Grade"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This was one of my favorites when I was young. I remember reading it over and over again, and even when I wasn't reading it, I would take the book down and look at the wonderful illustrations in it, and be enthralled. I remember that when I got into college, one of the first things I did was write an essay for one of those intro to college courses in which I claimed that I was going to be a pirate when I grew up (I got an A), and of course, the essay was inspired by Treasure Island. I owe so much, including my bright future to this book...Anyway, about a decade after having read it last, I picked this little novel back up. It wasn't as long as I remembered it. And I started to read. And it grabbed me just as much as it had years ago. From the beginning, Stevenson's got you. It's easy to relate with Jim, and the cast of characters still doesn't fail to entertain. It's difficult to imagine any character that captures the imagination quite like Long John Silver does. And of course, Captain Smollet, Captain Flint, Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and all the rest are something else, too. And, of course, the plot's deservedly classic. There are the cliffhangers and other standard adventure devices, and even though they've been used everywhere else, it's still authentic here. Anyway, it's still a great read to me, and I finished it in less than a day.So, it's a great book. Anybody on earth who can read would love it I'm sure. I've read a lot of adventure novels in my life, and this one is still toward the top of the list."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read this book as a child, and was getting fuzzy on the details, so recently re-read this famous tale. I can assure you that it is more than worthy of its status in literature. Jim Hawkins is a young boy who meets up with a strange and sickly traveler who stays at the Inn for which he is working. The sailor -known as Billy Bones -dies in the night. Upon searching the contents of the dead sailor, a map is found - a treasure map no less! From there we follow the adventures of young Jim as he meets the secretive Long John Silver and his insightful talking parrot on the quest for gold. What mysteries and turns of fate lay waiting for them on Treasure Island? This is a relatively short book, but there is great adventure waiting if you are willing to set your sails for this masterpiece.Relic113"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is a classic adventure story. I knew and loved it as a child, and as an adult am seeing my children know and love it too. The main characters are complex and intruiging. Long John Silver, while being the quintessential bad guy, still has a sense of honor. He was so good at seeming like a good guy that he had everyone fooled. This book is a stimulating read for grown ups as well as a captivating one for kids. It was written at a time when people didn't feel they had to pander to children by dumbing down their writing. It is a great vocabulary builder for kids also."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is great. It is not fast-paced and pure adventure and excitement by current day standards, but it is excellent in it's own way. This is a simple story being told through the eyes of the protaginist, Jim Hawkins. It is rich and lush with descriptions of the seas and of the bizzare and treacherous characters. From the simpleness of the book, I could place myself into the roll of this young boy and my imagination did the rest. It was an extremely exciting book; but, not because of the action packed descriptions. It was exciting because it was a pure adventure on the high seas, and I really felt like I was looking for the treasure and listening to rugged pirates.The villians were perfect. They were not hard-core grotesque characters, but just balanced with self-preservation and greed. They were not rapists and excessive killers, just evil enough to fear them on the open waters.This book is wonderfully told. If you do not really get into books or don't enjoy excercising your imagination, this book is probably not for you. Otherwise, prepare for a wild adventure on the high seas."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"After a former pirate dies at his family's inn, young Jim Hawkins inadvertently stumbles across a treasure map of the notorious pirate, Captain Flint. he, and two others decide to set out to find Flint's treasure, but they are not the only ones who know of the map's existence....Once onboard their newly purchased ship, the Hispaniola, Jim overhears the plans for mutiny by the crew, most of whom sailed under Captain Flint while he lived, and who are led by Long John Silver, the supposed amiable ship's cook.\\"Treasure Island\\" tells of the conflict between Jim Hawkins & co, and the mutineers, and is full of well developed characters, who, while they are not \\"perfect people\\", have good intentions, and act as you would think they would in real life. the pirates are treacherous and double-crossers, who care only to get the gold, and the protagonists are merely trying to stay alive; while this plot may be a little cliched, in some cases, cliches are what work, and I have nothing against that. unfortunately, this book isn't one of them. My only complaint was the overused plot style, which wasn't either original or suprising, as I mentioned earlier, and despite colorful and innovative language and characters, it still follows the simple good vs evil/going on a treasure hunt scheme, which doesnt appeal to me personally.All in all, if you're looking for something new and different, this probably isnt the book, but if you don't mind a return to the classic adventure stories, than start reading!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This novel is one of the best novels written in this genre. It has been turned into every imaginable type of media. Plays, musicals, operas, and a movie adaptation by the Muppets.I don't need to go through a detailed analysis of the plot. Nearly everyone knows that. The contribution this work makes to pirate lore is legendary. Everyone in the culture knows of Captain Flint and the quest for the treasure. The Black Spot, et al. demonstrates the complete cultural penetration this work has. It is a masterfully developed one. If you know of the previous matters, and have not read this book, do so, you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book is fine and the transition to digital is very readable.

I took the opportunity to read it again myself on Kindle Touch. It brought back all my memories as a young boy reading R.L.Stevenson's timeless book, with its heroes and villains. Thoroughly enjoyed it again after many years. Thank you Amazon for making it available!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I first read TREASURE ISLAND when I was 10 years old, and have not read it since. Now fifty years on I downloaded the novel on an impulse while on a recent vacation -- and was struck by the novel's narrative velocity, the gripping quality of the tale (even though it's now an oft-told variety of story that has been redone, revamped -- and amped up -- all the way up to and through the recent \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" film franchise). The novel is artfully structured -- seamless, in fact -- as it moves briskly from one tense plot point to the next while consistently maintaining a very reasonable level of verismilitude. (Once one gets past the somewhat outlandish premise that a couple 18th century English gentlemen with no experience of ships, sailing, or, moreover, piracy and criminality, would abruptly decide to launch an expedition to an uncharted island in search of loot stolen by a thug generally held to be the most savage pirate of them all. But, that aside ... ) It was a pleasure to take a few hours and read this novel again. Definitely fun, and striking to see how contemporary a feel in language and narrative drive that Stevenson maintained in a book published in 1883. Of note is that this novel was originally published as a \\"story for boys.\\" Indeed -- the only female character of even passing note is Jim Hawkins's mother, and she is left behind early on in the story. These days we would want -- and need -- a female character or two. But, again, looking at pure literary skill exhibited through economic prose and a plot design that delivers the goods, TREASURE ISLAND holds up well."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I can't believe I didn't read this story as a child.

I finally read this well into my adulthood, and am surprised to hear how many read it as a child given the complex use of pirate lingo.

In it you watch a young boy grow into a young man who has to learn about trust, integrity, adventure, duties, and survival.

The great author Robert Louis Stevenson organized the tales contained in Treasure Island so greatly that putting the book down for even a moment is a shame. Stevenson is a famous author for many reasons, possessing many skills that are necessary to write truly beautiful tales. One of these skills that Stevenson has mastered is the ability to give each and every one of his characters a distinct personality, as distinct as any real person. Throughout his adventurous novel Treasure Island Stevenson impresses his audience with the way he develops each of his characters, as he does, Jim Hawkins, Dr.Livesey, and Long John Silver.We are introduced at the very beginning to our narrator, Jim Hawkins himself. By orders of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey Hawkins writes down all of his adventures, leaving out only the position of Treasure Island for there is still treasure supposedly buried there.Hawkins is a young boy of about twelve or thirteen living in his family's Inn, the Admiral Benbow, he is (as most young boys are) very relaxed and not very aware of the potential dangers about him. An old pirate Billy Bones wanders into the Inn, throws down some money for a room and makes himself right at home. After many months of terrorizing and staying long past where his money paid for Bones falls ill, at almost the same time as Bone's illness Hawkins father passes as he has been very ill as well. Once Bone's has become well a man presents him with a black spot, or a pirates symbol of guilt or judgment which causing him to have a stroke and die as well.After seeing Bone's die Hawkins seems to mature a bit, suddenly realizing the dangers that could now harm him and his mother. Acting quickly Hawkins and his mother unlock Bone's chest, and escape the Inn as it is being attacked with a logbook and map in hand.Hawkins and his mother meet up with Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney in hopes that they can help with their new found map. They are told that this map is to a huge treasure, assumed to only be a legend. This being where we first meet Dr. Livesey, an extremely responsible and safe man, never doing anything without thinking twice and making sure of that's its outcome is the best it could possibly be. Stevenson, (our author) makes Dr. Livesey personality easy to predict, only in a good way of course. He can be relied on in the heat of the moment to come up with a last minute ingenious plan to save the day.Squire Trelawney quickly rounds up a crew and ship to start an expedition, with a top-class crew they all set off, Dr. Livesey, Trelawney, and Hawkins. Each of them quick to notice that their crew is nowhere near what they expected. Hawkins is stuck with the ships chef, Long John Silver in hopes that this will keep him out of trouble. Sometime into the voyage Hawkins overhears Silver discussing a Mutiny with the other crew members and immediately reports this to the captain and all the trustworthy men. They reach land and the captain gives all the crew some \`leisure time' on shore in hopes to get ride of them. Hawkins follows and after witnessing Silver murder a man of the crew he flees from the pirates coming across a slightly crazy man named Ben along the way, who in the end is a great help. This epic tale goes on into many more betrayals and discovery's to end in a traditional happy ending.From the beginning of the book to the end Jim Hawkins develops from a child to a man, and a strong man at that. He learns to defend what he thinks is right and how to choose the right side in the end. After finishing off his adventures as a one-time sailor he goes back to the Inn with his proud mother, fixing it up of course. Going from a young boy who never knew any better to a man who could do it all again a million times if he had too. His personality never once wavers from what he truly is, always in character. Then there is Long John Silver, although he may switch from side to side throughout the book it is always what you expect him to do. It was in Silver's persona to do whatever it took to get his treasure and not to care what that meant he had to sacrifice.When it comes to making a character with true substance, making it seem like they could step right out of a book, a living breathing person. Only great writer's can make such amazing things come to life, a gift that Stevenson did definitely possess, among many others I'm sure."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I got this movie which motivated me to buy my first book as a kid.

It's too little,too late. This is the classic tale of pirates. Its' themes have been worked and worked again,but it remains untouched. Stevenson is a master storyteller at the top of his form. From beginning to end the plot never lags,and the characters possess a richness and depth rare in an adventure story. Every reader of English ought to make their acquaintance--Jim Hawkins,Billy Bones,Old Pew,Silver,and the rest--at some time in his life,preferably when he is young,and his heart still believes it can find that treasure. Treasure Island has been francised,moppetized,filmed,and abridged,but never bettered. Accept no substitues! Read the entire book. There is plenty here for children and adults. Like all great literature,it works on more than one level. Dominating the whole Story is the figure of Long John Silver. As his name implies he has a lunar quality. He is attractive,facinating,powerful,but with a dark side. Again,he is murdering,lying,and infinitly self-seeking,yet like Jim we cannot help liking him and wanting him to like us. At this level Treasure Island is a study in criminality that asks: Why is it that the best,the most full of natural power, often turn their gifts to evil? And why do we find evil so attractive? A word about editions. There are many,but by far the best is the hardcover featuring the illustrations of N.C. Wyeth. No one has succeeded as he has in capturing the spirit of the tale. If you are looking for a cheaper paperback edition that won't blind you with cramped layout, or ruin the whole experience with goofy illustratons,choose the Puffin Classic. It's unabridged,sturdy,and features a beautiful cover illustration."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Please note: This title is heavily abridged and aimed at children but, the Amazon title doesn't tell you this.

We kept the author's style. And we kept the important imagery and heart of the tale.\\"With its large font and many illustrations the book comes out to 181 pages; whereas, the Sterling Classic unabridged with its regular sized font and no illustrations comes out to 232 pages.

He overhears the crew's plans of mutiny, headed by the polite, one-legged &quot;gentleman,&quot; Long John Silver, and is plunged into a world of treachery. The characterization is beautiful: the doctor, shrewd and kind; the squire, fiery and outspoken; Jim Hawkins, quick and intelligent; the crew, sly and devious; and Long John Silver, so unsuspectingly polite, so wickedly sly... A must-read! (BTW, I am 13-years-old.)"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Unfairly dismissed as a writer who wrote simple adventure stories, the popularity and longevity of Stevenson's novels have allowed them to join the literary greats, the most famous of which is \\"Treasure Island\\" (followed closely byStrange Case of Doctor Jekyll And Mr. Hyde (Tor Classics)andKidnapped (Scholastic Classics)). To say that it is a classic is an understatement, as everyone knows of the one-legged pirate Silver, the dreaded black spot, the buried treasure on the mysterious island, the stretched-out skeleton that points the way, and of course that infamous scene of young Hawkins overhearing the pirates from within the apple barrel. Yet, as is often the way with classics, everyone knows certain aspects of it, though comparatively few people have read the book itself. Instead, most are introduced to the story through movie adaptations (and there have been a few, from the memorable Disney classicTreasure Islandto the definitive 1930sTreasure Island, to the inexplicable sci-fi versionTreasure Planet. Heck, even the Muppets got in on the act withMuppet Treasure Island - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition).So, here's your chance to read the original work as penned by an excellent storyteller. Told in first-person narrative by the young Jim Hawkins, we learn of an old buccaneer at the Admiral Benbow Inn, a man named Billy Bones who leaves Jim in possession of a treasure map. It doesn't take Jim long to release that he's not the only one after this map, and together with figures like Doctor Livesey, Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollet, he sets sail upon the Hispaniola as cabin boy to the mysterious Treasure Island. Hawkins makes particular friends with the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a cheerful and quick-witted sailor who is surprising nimble despite having only one leg. But as the ship nears closer to its destination, Hawkins becomes aware of rumblings of mutiny amongst the crew - to kill the officers and snatch the treasure for themselves.Once they reach the island, the plot really kicks into high gear, as Jim is torn between the officers and the pirates, and the race to the treasure begins. On three separate occasions Hawkins acts recklessly, and yet each time his actions take a serendipitous turn and result in favorable outcomes. As such, \\"Treasure Island\\" is just as much a coming-of-age story as an adventure tale for young Jim, as he learns to take care of himself, take the initiative, learn not to judge by appearances, and separate friends from enemies. This is especially true of Long John Silver, easily the novel's most fascinating character. Devious, untrustworthy, charismatic, intelligent and able to switch sides at the blink of an eye, you never really know what to make of Silver, save that you cannot help but admire him. Despite all his double-crosses, he seems legitimately fond of Jim, and even Stevenson himself can't bring himself to send Silver to the gallows. In fact, Stevenson had originally titled the manuscript \\"The Sea-Cook\\" before this was vetoed by his publishers, shedding light on the importance of Silver within the context of the novel.Although it has entirely British cast, \\"Treasure Island\\" has an American dimension to it, perhaps owing to Stevenson's years in California - whatever the reason, it's hard to shake the feeling that the story has been \\"adopted\\" by American culture. Likewise, despite the fact that there is only one female character in the entire novel (Jim's feisty mother), it would be wrong to think it's exclusively for boys. There are plenty of thrills to be had for readers of both genders, and because it is a surprisingly slim volume written in action-filled prose, there's no reason not to think children of a reasonably young age can read it themselves. This edition in particularly is noteworthy, beautifully bound and illustrated - though any unabridged manuscript is more than enough."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"There are few novels that have had as much influence in popular culture as \\"Treasure Island.\\" Pirates with talking parrots, treasure maps, mutiny, deceit, this novel has it all. In spite of this, a great many individuals pass on reading the book because they think it is simply a childrens story. If you are leaning toward this bias, you should know that this claim is not true; the novel is filled with witty and believable characters. It also shows the duplicity of human character when brought about by greed and self preservation. Not only is it a classic for it's influence, it is also a classic for it's depiction of human behavior in abnormal circumstances."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"While Treasure Island may have its detractors (usually those who were forced to read it as children or those who cannot handle the period speech) it is certainly a classic that can delight both young and old. Stevenson make a strong effort to catch the \\"tune of the time\\" and give vivid prose to the tedium of long sea journeys and the rapid pace at which life can offer strange events to deal with, as young Jim Hawkins discovers.The story is set in mid-18th century western England where Jim helps to run a small out-of-the-way inn with his parents. They have a strange boarder: a grizzled sailor very fond of his shanties and rum. The sailor hides a secret map to a buried pirate treasure that comes into Jim's hands. The local squire recruits Jim and the village doctor to join him on a sea voyage to find the treasure for themselves.They obtain a ship and a crew including the most iconic pirate of all: Long John Silver (created well before the seafood restaurant and Jack Sparrow!). Silver eventually betrays Jim, revealing himself as a longtime pirate, but makes good his escape in the end. Stevenson filled Treasure island with all of the--now cliche--paraphenalia: marooning, parrots, and such. The pirates have enough colorful language that even Robert Newton must have tired of it during his enthusiastic performance in the 1950 Disney film adaptation.Perhaps my fondness is newfound since I only read it for the first time this year while I was on a week's cruise in the Caribbean, but Treasure Island now holds a favored spot on my bookshelves."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I remember the first time I got a copy of the book \\"Treasure Island,\\" I was about eight years old. I tried to get people to read it to me, but they always wanted to read something else, something with more pictures, and something with fewer words! It wasn't for several years that I finally got to read the book on my own - it took a while for my reading to advance, but I kept the book with the boy and pirate and the bird on the cover. It looked very interesting, and I knew there was treasure to be had inside of it!The narrator is Jim Hawkins, son of the innkeepers of the Admiral Benbow Inn. A mysterious stranger, Billy Bones, lives at the inn and likes to spin stories, including the one about the one-legged man who he warns Jim to keep a watch for. A blind man appears and so frightens Billy Bones with the black spot that he dies of a stroke. Jim and his mother find Billy's sea chest, and in there is a map.You knew that there had to be a map, didn't you?There were coins and other things, but soon others arrive in search of the map. Jim has care of the map, and takes it to people he trusts, the Squire Trelawney and Doctor Livesey. They recognize the map as a treasure map made by the evil Captain Flint. The Squire purchases a ship called \\"the Hispaniola,\\" hired a crew and a captain, Captain Smollet. The cook is perhaps the most famous name in the book - Long John Silver. He is a one-legged man, too.Jim discovers that some of Smollett's crew were part of Flint's crew, and are plotting to kill them all and take the treasure. Once on the island, most go ashore, including Jim, who discovers in hiding an ex-pirate named Ben Gunn who was left on the island by his former crew. Gunn promises to help Jim and his friends, who have taken refuge in an old fort on the island. The other pirates with Long John Silver attack the fort, but without success in getting the map.Jim manages to sneak into the fort, but the gunfire continues the next day, without success on either side. Jim sneaks out again, takes Ben Gunn's boat stealthily out to the Hispaniola, and cuts its ropes and sets it adrift. The next morning, the sea is rough, and Jim has to fend off the attack of a remaining pirate. Jim manages to get the ship into a cove.The fort falls, and the Doctor gives Long John Silver the map. There is some give and take among the pirates as to what to do with the doctor and Jim. After some tussle, in which Long John Silver almost gets the black spot of death himself, they go after the treasure chest. Will they find it?There is a lot of excitement here. Finding the treasure chest, after all this adventure, turns out to just be the beginning. Ben Gunn has a secret, you see, and the Doctor isn't out of the picture entirely, either. Long John Silver isn't quite the bloodthirsty pirate through and through, and in a strange twist, there is a relatively happy ending.It certainly made for an exciting story for a young boy, and when I re-read portions of it now and then, I get a bit of a thrill again. The characters are brash and well written. Robert Louis Stevenson is a great novelist, knowing how to put together plot and character, and his use of the language gives the reader a sense of the salt air and rough and tumble of the seas."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"For the past two years I have been searching for the perfect adventure book to suit my dreams, and I finally found it, Treasure Island. This story was told hundreds of years ago and changed over time. The author was Robert Louis Stevenson. This book had 232 pages of jam-packed action. This story was suppost to take place in the Pirate times. There were lots of characters thruout this story, but the two most important ones were Jim Hawkins, the leader of the pack, and Long John Silver, a kind of two faced person. This book was about Jim Hawkins and his friends going to sail to Treasure Island, hoping to find the burried loot of Captain Flint, the toughest of all the pirates. But they didn't know that the crew of their own ship is made up of Flint's old crew, led by the evil, one-legged pirate Long John Silver. Once on the island, Jim and his friends must find the burried treasure and escape efore the pirates capture them. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story because it will ruin a great story like this for you. Have fun reading it!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is one of a small number of books that are both for children and adults. The appeal of the book for children relates to the story line: pirates, buried treasure, sea voyages to faraway places, and a boy hero. The appeal of the book for adults is in seeing a wonderful example of how events operate at many different levels. Long John Silver quickly becomes the focus for adults. What is his true nature? What will he do next? Clearly, Silver is one of the most interesting and memorable of all fictional characters.A problem that children will have with this book is that the language is somewhat foreign to them. Some adults and children will find that the book starts slowly compared to newer novels (which often have the equivalent of a chase sequence in the first 5 pages).My advice is to stick with the story for the first 6 chapters, and see how you are doing. By that time, the story will either have cast its spell on you, or you will be able to tell that this book is not for you.A final reason for reading Treasure Island is because the book has been read by so many people. You will find references to the story in other literature and in conversation with others. You will also run into establishments called The Admiral Benbow Inn. It would be a shame not ot know its heritage. Also, finding someone else who likes Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver for the same reasons you do is a great shortcut to becoming better acquainted.Personally, I found the story irresistible. I would have written a very similar book if I had the skill to do so. The plot is nicely balanced, and the characters provide an unusual perspective for what could easily have been a real potboiler with little to recommend it. The book has great charm, given its focus on pirates, which makes it compelling for me. I have now read the book 3 times, and enjoyed it more each time.Have a great read!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"the provider failed to say it was an abridged item and for children.

This is one that my homeschooled son is going to read this year and I'm looking forward to discussing it with him. It has adventure, suspense, surprise twists and turns - everything you expect in a great book. One of the reviewers mentioned that some of the negative reviews for this book might be because a student was forced to read it for school. He said that if a student is forced to read something then they will probably hate it. I disagree. My son has read a lot of books for school and loved most of them. If you create a love for books when a child is young then he will grow up with an appreciation of great books. This is one of those great books.

The action is paced just right, and the descriptions of the various places and scenery is just enough - not too much, not too little. While the characters may seem cliche, it's important to remember that they only seem so because our popular culture has drawn so much from them.

One thing that bothered me was how short some lines were and how others went the full width of the screen. The lines were laid out in a non-sensical way.

It didn't make me want to stop reading because I enjoyed the story but it seemed odd that the ebook would be set up like that."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my review ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).(Sorry, I had to pull this review off Amazon for a few days because I accidentally wrote it on another user's account. I'm also sorry it appears twice. I'm not certain how this happened but I'm unable to get rid of either of my reviews.)Ye be warned: Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson, 220 pages) may leave you wishing that you were living inside it's brilliantly imagined world. Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting.

It's engaging and I just find the 1700s and pirates/sailing really interesting. It can be a little difficult to understand some of the writing, being as it was written in the 1820s or 30s I think, and sometimes Stevenson uses phrases and figures of speech that are definitely not used anymore, but with context you can usually figure out what they mean. I am well into part 2 (out of 6), and the main characters are right about to leave port for the first time. Even before the actual sailing has started, the book is exciting.

I had first read the book at age nine without the least knowledge of seafaring or sailing terminology, and with no ear for the lilt of nineteenth century English narrative style or dialogue. From an adult reader's perspective, and with a familiarity with Victorian wordplay and pronunciation, the story sailed along like a schooner on the trade-winds. If you have a talent for a spectrum of British accents and dialects, or the ability to act, read this book aloud to your kids. It is rather gory in places so it is probably not recommended for very small children, but it will be loads of fun for most young adventure-seekers. The story has not lost any of its charm or suspense in over 100 years. As a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, I noticed a thousand details in the book that had made their way fully intact from Robert Louis Stevenson's nineteenth century imagination into those recent and popular films.

From sailing the seven seas, to finding Treasure Island and the cursed treasure itself, and to even facing up to Captain Long John Silver himself, this book takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows as ferocious as a violent squall. To miss out on this treasure of literature is to miss out on one of the greatest adventure tales of all time! This book is a must read! A Literary Classic!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Quite possibly the most interesting and entertaining island novel i've read since Robinson Crusoe. This book defines all pirate tales and hidden caches of treasure. Outstanding!!!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Who doesn't love the story of Treasure Island? I think it's a great book. Some people say it is not very good because of the &quot;ancient&quot; way it is written. Just goes to show how dumb modern man is. Buy it and maybe get a better vocabulary."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The story of Treasure Island takes place during the glorious 18th century, when seamen still sailed the oceans in search of wealth and fame. The most feared enemies were the sea pirates. Young Jim Hawkins discovers a treasure map in the sea-chest of the murdered pirate, Billy Bones. Jim joins Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney to form a partnership to search for buried pirate treasure. The presiding genius of their crew is the one-legged pirate turned sea cook, Long John Silver. Long John is cunning and bloodthirsty, without a shred of conscience. But his buoyant humour and vitality are irresistible. Their sea voyage turns out to become quite perilous when the first rumours of mutiny are being whispered on board of the Hispaniola.The point about classics such as Treasure Island is that you cannot doubt the relevance of such a book, since it is still popular more than 120 years after it was first published (1883). Hundreds of books following Treasure Island have used the image of the pirate Long John Silver and made it a universal type. Ask anyone to picture a pirate and in nine out of ten cases you will get something closely resembling Long John.The strongest quality of Treasure Island is that it is still surprisingly fresh. It has a pace that can stand comparison with any contemporary novel. Stevenson did not add a lot of moralising to the story, which is quite remarkable for a coming of age story dated from that period. The character of Long John suffers clearly from a certain machiavellian duality, a topic that will return more prominently in Stevenson's later work: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"always wanted to read this book but never seemed to have the time now i have kindle time is no problem"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"A true classic, enjoy reading it, seen different movies of it andstill enjoy it.

Now reading it again and enjoying it as much as i did when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson defined the pirate Morphic Field, for literature. There is no other way to say it. He would tell his subconscious mind to give him a chapter the next day, and wake up with a chapter.

I love this story and I can't believe anyone gave this a one star review!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The free download for Kindle of \\"Treasure Island\\" is hardly a feature rich edition of the classic, but it does have the most important part, which is the novel itself. Originally the book was serialized in \\"Young Folks\\" between 1881 and 1882, but was then published as a book on May 23rd of 1883. \\"Treasure Island\\" is a wonderful adventure for younger readers, and has had an impact on popular culture. The popular stereotype of pirates, and buried treasure marked by an X on a treasure map, all comes from this story.Most of the story is narrated by Jim Hawkins, the son of the owners of an inn, who becomes involved in a mystery involving sailors and treasure, though there are a few chapters narrated by Doctor Livesey, whom Jim looks to as a trusted magistrate. The adventure takes place at some point in the 18th century, though one cannot determine the exact time frame and regardless it isn't important for the story.This is a great work for younger readers as it is full of adventure and interesting characters, and a young hero in Jim Hawkins. The best known of the characters, though, is Long John Silver. Hired as a cook for the expedition, it is no surprise that Silver turns out to be much more. Silver has much more complexity and depth than any other character in the story, and that is perhaps the main thing that makes the story as engaging as it is. There is no shortage of film adaptations and TV shows based on this work, and though its story is clearly of a time, the enjoyment of reading it is timeless."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"As a child, I only listened to someone reading this adventure to me. On reading this book for the first time as an adult, I found the story full of intrigue and drama. An entertaining 'boys own' adventure.

Because of my enjoyment in reading this book , I will follow up by reading 'Silver' which was published recently."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good.

I thought it would be a treat. So predicable, it was painful. My guess is it was for a childrens audience or there just wasn't a lot of choices to read back when this book came out. My opinion: move on, do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Excellent book. Good example for someone wanting to write a book. It is hard to believe Robert Louis Stevenson published this in 1883. It has suspense and mystery, adventure, and the excellent use of point of view would work for today's novels. I believe the author cleverly moved the main narrator, Jim Hawkins, from one group to another to have first hand point of view. Only once did point of view switch to the doctor. Stevenson also let Jim overhear the pirates in a way to know what was going on. I finished reading it while on vacation in St. Thomas Virgin Islands, not far from where the model for Treasure Island is supposed to be."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is a terrific adventure story. It capitalizes on the romance of piracy, while exposing the moral emptiness in an entertaining way.A story from the point of view of pirates or the ships they attacked would simply be about straight up murder, robbery and rapine. By starting out on dry land, and focusing on the treasure on a tropical island in the Caribbean, Stevenson is able to present the pirates as real, fearsome but pitiable people.Although Jim Hawkins was warned to watch out for the one legged man, he and everyone else falls for the lies of Long John Silver -- one indication people with lost limbs were so not unusual at that time.Long John Silver is capable of absolute moral relativism (in modern terms). He's capable of being pleasant, friendly and seemingly reliable while plotting treachery. When his plans fail (partly because the pirates are incapable of sustained discipline), he switches sides again to sell out his friends and escape the noose, and then slips away at the end.You have to wonder why a fast food chain would be named after him.The author has a keen eye for the fun of a treasure hunt, and even keener eye for the human failings of both the good guys and bad guys."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is a superb book on many levels. Adventure - escaping pirots - going sailing to a tropical island- escapig pirots again - winning out through courage and hardiness. What could be better all done in the comfort of home.It also explores a deeper level: Good friend - bad pirot; trust under extremely difficult conditions; never giving up; loyalty; the sorrow of parting; the ultimate triumph of good. I believe it helped me to become a better man. I first read this book over 55 years ago and have rererd it many times since. I envy you if you have still to explore this clasic tale."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Up until this point I had only ever seem Muppet Treasure Island.

Another thing that kinda made the book less enjoyable (and this is not the author's fault) is the fact that there's been a lot of pirate movies lately and most of them seem to resemble certain parts of the book, I guess if I hadn't seen the movies that wouldn't have been an issue. Overall I'd say that it is a very good book and great for young people to start to get to know the classics."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is legend. It has defined the stereotypical look of the pirate. Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver are nothing short of immortal. The fish restauraunt can tell you that! This book is the most famous by the GREAT Robert Louis Stevenson; published in 1883, it is one of the landmarks in the late Victorian Age and it still continues to be read and cherished by young and old alike. Going off the subject for a little indulgence, wouldn't it have been genius if there was a biographic movie of the life of Robert Louis Stevenson with the very UNDERRATED actor Donald Sutherland playing the part of probably the greatest author who ever lived? (Robert Louis Stevenson who'd you think AVI?! HA HA! AVI SUCKS LIKE A LEECH!) Since Sutherland looked exactly like Stevenson, the movie could've been gold and there was a golden opportunity for Hollywood to capitalize on, but now, Sutherland has aged and the opportunity is all but gone, sadly.Sorry about that, just something I had to get off my chest because Stevenson and Sutherland look exactly alike. Getting back to the subject (I ramble too much I know. I just love the man Robert Louis Stevenson and his writings of gold. Don't worry folks; I got a million of 'em!) This book is nothing but adventure on the high seas, treasure, pirates, \\"pieces of eight,\\" and pure joy.Getting back to what I said earlier, there is little chance that the \\"pirate\\" would've survived into the culture today had it not been for Robert Louis Stevenson's immortal work.Read this (Would you believe you have been reading the review of someone who is obsessed with Robert Louis Stevenson and has not even read this book yet! I'll be alright folks. Thanks for sticking with me my friends) and you'll be convinced that Robert Louis Stevenson could be the greatest writer who ever lived. If you are not convinced after reading this (very small chance of that. The only way you don't finish this book is if 1. the book is destroyed 2. You go blind 3.You die 4. You forget how to read) check out The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Kidnapped and you too will be a rambling nerd like myself.Answering the question in the title, I would give a rousing, \\"HELL NO!!!!!!!!\\"Robert Louis Stevenson1850-1894"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.Some of the characters are Jim,Jim's mom,Dr. Livesey,Pew, Admiral Benbow,and others. Jim is the boy who goes on the adventures with the pirates. Jim worked an inn with his mom and dad. A sstrangwe visitor came around that was a pirate. Jim's dad died and so did the pirate... which is where Black Dog came and Jim's whole adventure started. He traveled across seas to find treasure, and he thought that the island was scary and haunted.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure IslandA young boy named Jim who has lived all his life with his parents working at the Admiral Benbow had a normal life.

After arriving at the island he encounters more than he bargained for. Robert Louis Stevenson put together a great book that every age would adore. He starts with details to make the story clear and then takes of on a fascinating story. Jim Hawkins & Long John Silver are classic imagination.

Normally that is a good thing, but in this case the Hollywood versions are better. The ties between Long John Silver and Jim were much more tenuous in this book than in more recent portrayals and I think that's not as fun. Because it is a well known story it also lacks the excitement of something really new.That said, it think everyone should read it. It is a fun, short book, easy to read despite some old English and it was a blast to see from where the quintessential pirate and pirate story originated.

And that's fair--the book is a great one for a young boy or girl; it's not too long, has wonderfully vibrant characters, and is filled with action and adventure. I mean, it has pirates!But Treasure Island is also a book that can be read when you're older with no less fun or excitement. Also, if you've never read this classic, you'll learn by reading it exactly why it's such a big part of literary culture, why everyone seems to know at least a little bit about it. Long John Silver is one of the most enjoyable villains in all literature, Jim and his allies are all heroic and likable, and the action sequences are gripping.In the particular edition that I recently read, there was an essay following the story that talked about how Stevenson and Treasure Island are not really respected in the academic community because Treasure Island is, at heart, just an adventure story. But let's not discount \\"just an adventure story\\"--great stories are really the reason why people continue to write books today, and Treasure Island is not \\"just an adventure story\\"--it is a *wonderful* adventure story that will thrill readers, young and old. Treasure Island is well worth the read for adults, and also a perfect choice for reading to your children."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.Great Illustrated Classics is in between the others in length and complexity of sentence structures. It's not as easy to read as Stepping Stones but offers a slightly better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure. The language is still more basic than Classic Starts, and the story suffers some because detail is left out that would embellish it. GIC may be the best series for children readers.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary and the Little House series, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible.Note that the illustrations are poor and don't really add anything. These are just paraphrased classic stories. The illustrations in GIC are the least appealing and not any more frequent than those in Classic Starts. If you want lots of illustrations, try Illustrated Classics (comic book versions). The stories are very poor, but there's lots of illustrations, none of which are fantastic by comparison to a good imagination with an adaquate telling of the story.I recommend Great Illustrated Classics for the avid chapter book reader. For stories to be read-aloud, I prefer Classic Starts."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The book is nice and i enjoy the illustrations.

Its unfathomable how children around the age of 9 can read this.I do no know whether it was because I kept picking it up and starting and stopping again or if its the style of writing. The book sometimes seems a blur when I was reading it and and cant grasb the details. For instance I didnt realize the main charactor was a boy not a man- I just learned that from a review. There is a lot of sailing terminology which the writer expects the reader to already know, where as in Moby Dick the writer explains. I still enjoyed the story and charactors and it is still worth reading as its only a couple of a hundred pages."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson may not have known what he had created when he wrote \\"Treasure Island\\" for his nephew, but let's hope he had some measure of how many imaginations he would spark with this, the definitive pirate novel.This timeless tale of youthful adventure and derring-do focuses on two characters - the young Jim Hawkins and the dastardly charming Long John Silver. Jim narrates most of the tale, and while he's a young lad of thirteen or thereabouts, he's an adventurer to his core. One of the most exciting aspects of this novel is watching young Jim take on challenge after challenge, risking life and limb, all for what he believes is good and true. Whether it's facing down a murderous pirate, or seizing a ship single-handed, or sticking to his word at the risk of his life, Jim is as much a hero as Bilbo Baggins or Harry Potter.What elevates the novel, though, is the nefarious character, Long John Silver. Every pirate in popular culture stems from this magnificent creation. Profane, noble, violent and gentle, Silver is a man for the ages - a peg-legged brute with a parrot on his shoulder and a cutlass in his hand, Silver is the stuff of nightmares and legends. Playing both sides of the fence in his devious ploy to steal Captain Flint's buried treasure, Silver confounds Jim's moral compass and earns both disgust and admiration - no small feat for any author.And through it all stalks the ghost of the murderous pirate, Captain Flint. Forever offstage but never far from our hearts, Captain Flint terrifies even the hardiest soul.When you close the book after reading the last page, you can't help but drift off to sleep with visions of sailing the seven seas, searching for buried treasure, and hearing that parrot squawk, \\"Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\\"A timeless classic that holds up despite all its imitators."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is a classic book that consists of Pirates, Treasure and much more. It will be read by kids for years to come. It has cleverly thought-out character names such as Long John Silver and Captain Flint. It has an amazing plot line, and because of this, this book has gone down in History. First published as a book in 1883, it also went under the title of The Sea Cook, meaning Long John Silver. It has just kept on gathering steam over the many years, and shows no sign of stopping any time soon. Since the day that this book was published, whenever Robert Louis Stevenson's name is mentioned, people automatically think of Treasure Island. This book is arguably the best of Robert Louis Stevenson's work, and many other people would agree too.The book begins with young Jim Hawkins running into a frightening old sea captain who drinks more rum than water. Jim and the old sea captain get to know each other pretty well, but when the Captain dies, Jim decides to open up the old captain's trunk and finds and old treasure map that begins his entire adventure. Before Jim knows it, he is aboard the \\"Hispaniola\\" with the Squire, the Doctor, and the seemingly pleasant cook Long John Silver, on their way for the treasure. The whole voyage was going very pleasantly, until Jim overhears Long John and the crew discussing mutiny. Jim knew that the Captain of the \\"Hispaniola,\\" the Squire, the Doctor and he were not safe, so he immediately told the Captain. The next day the Captain has the crew go on shore so he, the Doctor, the Squire, and Jim can load the supplies on to a separate part of the Island. By the time the Mutineers figure this out they are safely on shore. Despite numerous attempts by the mutineers to get their hands on the treasure map, they fail each time, and Jim manages to find the ship and hide it safely away from the mutineers. But when he returns, he finds that the doctor gave the treasure map and the stores to Long John Silver. He is then forced to go hunt the treasure with the Mutineers, only to discover that it's not there! The Mutineers are furious and advance on Jim, but just then the Doctor and a Maroon save Jim, and take him away to a cave. It is there that he discovers that the Maroon found the Treasure a long time ago, and had many stocks in his cave, so the doctor decided to give the Mutineers the map and watch them go on a wild goose chase. The only problem is that they think they lost the ship, but Jim tells them that he stole back the ship, and that they can sail home for England!!My opinion of the book was that it had a nice little surprise around every corner. The author described each character very nicely and put a clear picture in your head. It was very clever of the author to use Jim Hawkins as the narrator of the story. He also had the Doctor narrate for a few chapters to show another side of the story. The author usually foreshadowed before a big event, making you want to read on. At first, the language is a little hard to understand, but once you get used to it you cruise along. I thought that the author overall did a great job writing the book. I always wondered how he got the ideas for the plot twists. This book is the kind that will make you wish that there was more after you finished. I think this was a great book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"For those of you who love a good book about pirates, mutiny, treasure hunting and \\"swash buckling\\" in general, Treasure Island is a must read classic by Robert Louis Stevenson.This is about a young boy seeking adventure and a way to help his family. The boy's name is Jim Hawkins. His first idea was to get on a boat and find a secret island, Treasure Island, which was said to have mounds of gold. But Jim's adventure turns into a nightmare as the crew begins to mutiny on him and the captain. The mutiny was led by Long John Silver. Now Jim and some of his fellow sailors must get to the treasure before the rogues do. This struggle to win the race leads to tragedy and a secret. You read along as Jim goes through an adventure of a lifetime. He meets pirates, a lost man who eats goats to stay alive, to name only a few. There were many men who died in these adventures, some trying to save Jim, while others were trying to kill him. This is a great story that captures your imagination with fantasy and adventure in every new problem that needs to be solved. I didn't find the reading difficult to follow. The writing was realistic and the characters almost seemed real. With all the pirate movies out lately, you could somewhat imagine what he was writing about even without a visual. I found the story had mystery and was comical at times.The author's voice is first person through the main character, Jim. There was action, fantasy, mystery, and a swash buckling good time for anyone reading this book. This author also wrote the book Mr. Hyde some years later. I was surprised to find that the author wrote over thirteen novels, poetry, essays and even plays. He wrote this book in 1881 and it was published in 1883. The author traveled many places with his family around the world. I think his travels influenced his writing, especially this book. Given that I enjoyed this book as much as I did, I hope to read more of his books and find out if his other writing is as detailed and full of adventure as this book is.I love reading and this book will be added to my list of \\"read again\\" and make sure I share with my kids the fun and exciting adventures this book offered me. I hope you enjoy the book and find yourself feeling like you are searching the seas for the treasures that remain lost.Philip P - 6th grade"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island Bantam, 1981, 194 pp., $2.25Robert Louis Stevenson ISBN 0-553-21249-4\\"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.

Unlike some of the reviewers below me, at 9 I had no trouble at all comprehending Treasure Island or anything else Stevenson wrote.Full-blown characters, and what a passel of them. The story runs on from the start like a runaway freight train. The duplicity of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey versus the cunning of Long John Silver made for excellent conflict. Captain Smollett was the right kind of leavening.And even after all his conniving and treachery, Stevenson was able to give Silver a certain likeability -- I wasn't unhappy to see him sail away, and neither was Jim Hawkins.Of course, even with all his initial innocence, Jim Hawkins came from just the right mold, believably apprehensive and fearful when that was called for, but able to rise to essential occasions.This wonderful story was praised more eloquently than I can by culzean7@cs.com below.It's a pity that school teachers still force-feed good stuff down the throats of kids today, then turn them loose to plaster graffiti all over these review pages.

That delicious, golden tan, breaded, slightly questionable piece of seafood eyeing you into submission. Calling your name, \\"eat me I'm...\\" Wait, hold on a second, we're being handed a sheet of paper... Well, this is one of our more embarrassing intros. Did anyone else know that Long John Silver was actually a Pirate?Sorry for that, actually, Treasure Island is the inspiration for a whole lot more than just a chain of fast food restaurants.

Thanks to a wooden barrel of apples, Jim finds himself in the very center of the melee, which includes, but is not limited to; mutiny, drunkenness, marooning, and a little known sea cook named, Long John Silver.Treasure Island is wildly popular and has birthed countless prequels and sequels.

This is my second time reading it and I love the story and the characters."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"\\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson is an 1883 fictional adventurous and classic pirate story. The book follows Jim Hawkins, a young man, who has found a treasure map and with the help of friends hires a crew to find the treasure. But the crew has their own plans.In the mid 18th Century at a seaside village in south-west England Jim Hawkins, the young son of the keepers of the Admiral Benbow Inn, meets and old seaman named Billy Bones. Quickly Jim discovers that Bones is a pirate and that his old crewmates want Bones' sea-chest.Bones dies and Jim opens his sea-chest to collect the money owed to the inn - only to discover a mysterious oilskin packet. The packet is a detailed map of an island Jim, together with Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney, hire a crew to sail to the island.But the crew are not the honest sailors they think they are and the sea-cook, Long John Silver, turns out to be the most dangerous one of them all.I read \\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson as a young boy and always remembered it as one of my favorites. Recently, as part of a classics book club, I read it again.The two main characters of the book, Jim Hawkins and Long John Sliver have certainly cemented themselves as two of the most intriguing and dimensional characters in literature. I was happy to reconnect with them almost as if they were old friends.The first half of the book was a breeze to read, but the second half was a bit more difficult due to the pirate's slang, cumbersome metaphors and tongue tied conversations. However, I quickly re-discovered that those quirks were part of the charm of the book. Even Jim Hawkins admits he has trouble understanding the narrative - so I wasn't alone.I read the Barnes and Noble classics version, which came with a fascinating biography of Stevenson especially regarding \\"Treasure Island\\". The book was actually written for Stevenson's stepson, after painting the island he started the novel and completed 15 chapters. Stevenson finished the book in Switzerland writing a chapter a day.Unknowingly, Stevenson created much of the pirate lore which we have been accustomed to. The pirate speaking almost unintelligibly, a parrot on his shoulder, missing a foot and ready to double cross his best friends for a buck or two.My biggest surprise upon reading \\"Treasure Island\\" as an adult was that I realized that the story is not about Jim Hawkins, but about Long John Silver. Granted that usually the villain in any book is usually more colorful and fun than the upstanding protagonist - but this discovery has taken by surprise. Silver's moral ambiguity is well known but just how amoral the character is I never fully realized as a nave child (even though I have become a nave adult).I was happy to discover that \\"Treasure Island\\" truly deserves its status as a beloved classic. The story is suspenseful and the adventure can be enjoyed by children of any age."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is a great introduction to a really fantastic story.

When Billy Bones, an old buccaneer that lived in the inn, dies and leaves his large chest for claim, Jim snatches the key from his neck and opens his chest. He finds an oilskin package that contained a map to buried treasure and embarks on a journey to recover it. He and some of his companions go to Bristol, set up a crew, and board the great Hispaniola and depart for the island. One of the crewmembers they acquired while in Bristol was the famous pirate, Long John Silver. While on the journey, Jim overhears a conversation between Long John and three other members in which the men prepared plans of mutiny and determined how they would carry them out. They reach the island and the crew begins their corruption. Jim and his companions fight many conflicts while on the island. They are low on supplies, outnumbered, injured, and tired. Jim set out to retrieve the Hispaniola and completes his objective successfully.

Little do Jim and his companions, the Squire and Dr. Livesay, know that many of Captain Flint&#65533;s murderous pirates are part of that crew. That changes though, when Jim hears something not meant for him to hear. He, the Squire, and Dr. Livesay are now unaware of who and who not to trust. It becomes a battle between the good and evil in a race for the treasure.Greed was a major aspect that caused many sailors to turn against what they knew was right; sticking with their captain and boat. But they wanted the treasure for themselves, and their greed consumed them. Just remember though, greed will not get you anywhere, as this book shows. All that it gets you is more trouble than you need.The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, uses foreshadowing, a technique that gives a hint of what is to come, that keeps you wanting more, and creates an atmosphere of mystery.

Tremendous book...I recommend it highly...."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Jim Hawkins is the young hero who comes into possession of a treasure map leading to the golden hoard of an infamous pirate. Hawkins enlists the help of a reputable doctor and his servants in going after the treasure, but one of the servants blabs too much, which attracts the interest of the pirate's former crew. The former pirates sign on with Jim Hawkins and company in their new ship and plot to mutiny once the treasure is attained. Due to fortuitous events young Mr. Hawkins stumbles on the pirates' plan and warns his compatriots, and the rest of the book is a tense standoff between honest crewmembers and pirates. I won't tell you who wins, but the most fascinating character in the book is Long John Silver, the pirate captain's former quartermaster, who plays both sides in a constant back-and-forth that ultimately sours Jim on him and earns him the enmity of the honest men in the crew. As the pirates and the honest men fight it out it is never clear who is going to win and who is doomed to fail and be killed or left behind on Treasure Island.This book is a gripping adventure yarn that starts out fast-paced and never lets up. Its terse, tense storytelling style plays pirates against the honest crew members in a series of bloody face-offs that sees many men killed and others greviously wounded. All through the book you wonder if Jim is going to find the pirate treasure or if he's going to get perforated before he gains so much as a penny. Jim takes many risks along the way and gets lucky a couple of times, and in the end he wins through, though not without some scars (physical and emotional) picked up along the way. This tale won popular acclaim in the Victorian age and continues to fascinate today with its bold story and action-adventure, and I can well see it retaining its charm a hundred years from today. It's written for young adult boys but should be appealing for anyone, even younger children, who want an exciting story of piracy and the hunt for pirate gold. The footnotes are of great value with all the pirate-talk, which I otherwise wouldn't have understood, but there aren't a lot of notes and they're easy to pick up on.

It seems to me that this classic novel has done well to satisfy in that role, and I will also add that the Oxford World's Classics introduction, explanatory notes, and other supplements were useful, if unessential.That said, I am afraid there is little to recommend Treasure Island to the modern reader. The story itself has been surpassed many times over, and the archaic maritime language is a double-edged sword of charm and impediment; the writing is fun and quotable for the same reasons that often render it a right chore to comprehend. If one's sole purpose in selecting Stevenson's tale of the stalwart Hispaniola crew's quest for buried booty amid the treachery of Long John Silver upon Skeleton Island is merely to be entertained by a hardy lads' romp, it must be said that many superior (and less frustrating) options have become available since it was published in 1883. You and I are simply too removed from this work by time to enjoy it properly.However, I am ultimately glad that I read Treasure Island. Its historical value is clear both as a genre pioneer and as the origin for so many well-known pirate tropes, and, although it can be difficult in the telling, to be sure, the tale is not an unpleasant one."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Gotta love that Jack Hawkins kid.

If you have any interest in pirates and good, classic literary works, I think you would enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The pirate theme has always been one of my favorite. I'm a big fan of the Goonies and Peter Pan may be my favorite Disney animation. I even enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the other two... not so much. The pirate genre didn't start with Robert Lewis Stevenson's classic novel but his is probably the most influential. Treasure Island was written in the later half of the 1800's before \`Shiver Me Timbers' and \`Pieces of Eight' became overused pirate phrases and \`Dead Man's Chest' became the traditional anthem of movie pirates.It isn't a deep engaging story that makes Treasure Island such a classic. Quite frankly it's a pretty straight forward tale involving a treasure hunt and a mutineering crew of pirates. What makes this story a classic is in the storytelling and Mr. Stevenson makes it seem effortless. When I read books of lesser quality I can sense the author chiseling out the words rather than letting them flow. Books shouldn't feel crafted they should immerse the reader to the point where you forget there's even an author behind the story. Movie scripts are particularly egregious in trying to pound out a catch phrase to stick in the audiences mind but I see it in books also. Without even trying Stevenson created or popularized half a dozen or more sayings that have survived for over a century. With Long John Silver he essentially created the pirate template that has been used endlessly from Captain Barbossa to Spongebob Squarepants', Patchy the Pirate. Just don't blame Stevenson for the fact that John Silver has become a clich&eacute;.Young Bill Hawkins is the main protagonist in the story but Long John Silver steals the show. Silver is a wonderful multi-faceted anti-hero that you can't help but root for by the end of the book. This is the kind of book anyone can read but the target audience is probably teen and preteen boys. In fact it is probably the quintessential example of a book that targets young males, a genre that has essentially withered away from its hay day in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Perhaps books like this could inspire younger male audiences to read more than just comic books and video games cheat codes (not that there is anything at all wrong with either pastime). Let me reiterate that if you are not young or male I still recommend this fantastic book. Treasure Island is definitely a story that exceeded my expectations and lives up to the title of classic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I really liked treasure island but their is one thing: it's not a book for four year olds. it has a lot of people dieing an d getting injured in that book.

I enjoyed this as a kid and it's even funner re-reading it as an adult. Now I know where all those silly pirate cliches come from. It's all there....Long John Silver with his wooden leg and the parrot on his shoulder, the treasure map with \\"X marks the spot,\\" and a kid hero taking on the bad guys. You can't go wrong with this book. Read it, swabby!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Jim Hawkins is living a quiet life, helping his parents run an inn. When an old pirate captain checks in, though, things change dramatically in Jim's life. Soon there are dangerous men coming to visit and threaten the captain, and the man decides that Jim is the only one he can trust.When the captain dies, Jim finds himself with a map to treasure, and sets off with some old friends from town to follow the map. On the high seas, they discover the treachery of much of their crew, and must decide how to escape the island with the treasure and their lives.This is a great adventure story, and Jim is a spunky and smart protagonist to narrate it."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Though some people may not find much that this book offers in comparison to more recent books, I think that it meets the goals of its author very well. The book is simply something that has stood the test of time because it is a very simple story. There are no major plot twists or complexities. It is something that could be read to a child (And as a side note, the alchohol mentioned was a common practice of pirates and fully helps to show the baseness of them and show them as having no standards whatsoever, also it was more common in the time period written of that people drank alchohol rather than water for various reasons. The mear fact of that is something that adds an historical aspect to the story). The wording of everything also lends both atmosphere and a chance for a story-teller to embelish on accents and such. Overall, with this book being compared to any of the Treasure Island movies or remakes, you can't beat the original. This story, almost by itself it seems to me, created the entire Pirate Archetype in literature. All the aspects of language set in this book have been followed by later books and movies. So to say this book isn't worth reading is simply a lack of (or for that matter, an excessive ammount of pride in one's) intelligence. It is a simple, good book that is quite a page turner in my oppinion."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Jim Hawkins can't decide who should be his dad, so he skips the question entirely and turns into a man himself. Also, rum."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book is good, has it's fair share of excitment and adventure, but it being a classic does have it's boring moments. These are the periods that just drag on and on with description or with attempt at building anticipation. This might just be a problem to me because I have grown up in a day and age where the build up has to be darn good to keep the population's attention. All in all, because of it's classic status and it's effect on literature and movies about pirates, I would definatly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is about a boy, Jim Hawkins, who discovered a great treasure by means of a treasure map from an old seafaring man that stayed at his father's inn. With this map he sets off on a voyage with a crew picked by another sailor named Long John Silver, who is the cause of the trouble on the ship.A little while into the voyage, Jim hides in an apple barrel when some of the crew comes into the room he is in, and overhears that Silver has planned a mutiny. The captain and the loyal crew members must decide what to do about the mutiny and how to get the gold back without a ship.This is a classic adventure novel. It will keep you reading until you are done, and then you will want to read it again. I can't see how anyone would pass up the opportunity to read this great book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I didn't really come into the reading of Treasure Island with any expectations even though the tale and characters are iconic. Yes, I knew it involved buried treasure, pirates and Jim Hawkins but was ignorant of the specifics of the plot. All I was expecting was a good tale. I found that the iconic status of the book was more impressive than the actual work, something not uncommon in the digital age.The family of the young Jim Hawkins' runs a not quite prospering inn and everything seems to be going on its drudging way until a man with no name shows up. He bears a scar and a sea chest and comes to be known as \\"the captain\\". He spends most of his time boozing until some shady chracters show up to talk to him. The captain will draw Jim and his family into his past and a violent present after his death and the discovery of a treasure map. Jim's life will speed up to encompass pirates, pursuit, buried treasure, and that mascot of fish franchises, Long John Silver, and his ever-present parrot on his shoulder. No, the parrot's name is not Polly.Treasure Island is a fast moving narrative that keeps on pumping energy on every page. Stevenson has a real talent at keeping you interested. The character of Jim is well-drawn as are most of the main characters. The problems come with the minor characters. The pirates are completely stupid and you wonder how they could have ever earned a living doing it because they are so incompetent. I really don't see why this book has the place it does in the canon of good literature. It's an average young adult novel."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"could be.

He and the whole ship's crew go through many challenges during their voyage like mutiny, murders, and trying to fight the evil pirate (also the ships captain) , Long John Silver, that would kill his own friends to keep all the treasure for his own.

I certainly hope it's the former, I'd hate to think that kids today aremissing out on all the great pirate tales that we used to thrill too. Foremost of these was, of course,Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.I may well be wrong here, but it seems to me that Stevenson pioneered one of the central techniques ofchildren's literature ; placing a child at the center of what might otherwise be a typical adult adventurenovel. This simple but ingenious idea gives kids a character to identify with and allows the author towrite from the child's perspective.In the case of Treasure Island, young Jim Hawkins narrates the story of how he and Squire Trelawney,Dr. Livesey, and the enigmatic Long John Silver ended up on board the Hispaniola, looking for thelost treasure of the notorious pirate Captain John Flint. Packed with betrayals, battles, mutinies, andeven a parrot squawking &quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!&quot;, the book is the source for many of theenduring and beloved clich&eacute;s of the genre.This is a classic that each generation should discover anew. Heck, if enough kids start reading it again,maybe Hollywood will even take another crack at a pirate movie, this time a decent one.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Written in the early 1700s by Robert Louis Stevenson the old-fashioned style of writing adds to the realism of the adventure. Feel the heat scorching down on sweaty bodies and taste the gritty sand between clenched teeth as bullets whistle through the air of the disease ridden swampy island during the golden age of sailing ships and pirates.Although we're meant to be cheering for that pesky Jim Hawkins I couldn't help having a soft spot for scheming long John Silver and hope he finally gets to meet up with his missus and his fortune, however ill gotten.Read it and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I have never been very interested in pirates or plunder or the skull and crossbones flag until I read this book. Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely. My personal favourite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost \\"two-faced\\". His one side is well mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven. However, he has been quite a fictional figure not only for my self but also for the world. In Part One, &quot;The Old Buccaneer&quot;, the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily &quot;to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street.&quot; The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has travelled with. On the other hand, Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times. In one spot especially, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all. In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes by making the plot too obvious so soon."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"The master of this book-Robert L. Stevenson-is a very brilliant man. I recomend everyone, young and old, to read this fine piece of art. While reading this book it's as if the book just grabs ahold of you and won't let you go. The historic legend(Long John Silver) the mery, unscrupulous buccaneer-rogue whose greedy quest for gold cannot help but win the heart of every soul who everlonged for romance, treasure and adventure. If you love suspence you must take hold of this book immediatly."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I found reading tedious until the part when Jim got to the island. Then the story picked up though I still hated the language, but I was spoiled by reading trash when I was younger so that probably explains it. The beginning was slow to me, but then the story picks up quickly."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read Treasure Island for a language arts project. It was a very descriptive book, with very detailed characters and the settings. Robert Louis Stevenson had an incredible word choice and great ideas in this book. One of the things I had trouble with is that his sentence structure would be very jumpy and some times incomplete. For example he would have his characters fighting in the stockade and then the next sentence a guy was dead, shot through the head. My favorite character was captain Silver; he had one crutched leg and a good humor. He was not the main character but he did play a good size part, some of the things he said frequently made me laugh. His book is set in a time of pirates and treasure hunters and Stevenson captured their unique vocabulary, \\"why, shiver my timbers, if I hadn't forgotten my score\\". Some of the most significant events were in the beginning at the Admiral Benbow lodge, when there were a lot of unpleasant visits by an old captain carrying a sea chest, but this is where the main character Jim found interest in treasure hunting.My opinion of this book is that it was too hard for me. I'm a very intelligent student, but I couldn't always follow along with the book. I couldn't remember some of the characters roles as the crew and all the abbreviations were just so hard for me to read. It had good action in it so that definitely made me more interested in finishing it. I would say that this book is most likely to hard for any grade lower than 6th. It is good for any one 12-40. Over all I gave this book two stars."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Just ordered and downloaded this book to my pc. The book is not complete only 27 pages long! What's going on?

Every one from the Muppets to Monty Python(Yellow Beard) have drawn upon the characters so richly created by Stevenson. How many truely authentic pirate stories lack a Long John Silver like character with his single leg and a parrot on his shoulder squawking &quot;pieces of eight&quot; or a drunken rendition of &quot;yo ho ho and a bottle of rum&quot;. In fact so many of the striking images associated with tales of piracey on the high seas were created in this book that reading the original almost seems cliche. The mark of a true classic. What Dracula was to Vampires and Robinson Caruso was to castaways (anyone seen the &quot;Robinsons&quot; in Lost in Space Recently) Treasure Island is to Pirates. An absolute must for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I thought that it was a good book.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This review is for the Heritage Press 1941 edition of Treasure Island, illustrated by E.A.

The names of the characters brought out the story, such as Long John Silver, he had a wooden leg and he was very tall. The author also made me very impatient, because at the beginning I knew that this was going to be a story about a treasure hunt, but I had to read a lot to get to that point. The setting was very evenly set out, like the author talked about the captain in the day, and Long John the mean person in the night. The author made the book exiting by not making the characters sail to the island, then find the treasure, and come home. He made it interesting, while they were sailing, and when the reached the island. The best part of the story I liked was when Jim a young boy, is of to take a tour of the island by himself when he hears shuffling in the bushes, this happens until Jim looks behind the bushes to find his old friend who has been stranded on the island for many years.

Author Robert Louis Stevenson draws readers in early as the Captain arrives at the Benbow Inn in Britain, focused on incoming ships, and warning young Jim Hawkins of one-legged visitors. The story picks up as Billy Bones arrives, bringing danger and discovery of the treasure map, a discovery that leads Jim and his companions to risk the long trip in search of riches. I felt the suspense as Jim's group boards ship with a hardened sea crew that includes Long John Silver and other tough cookies. Then the ship finally arrives at the Island, where Jim and his companions must survive treachery and deadly struggles at the fort - before they even see the treasure.I just taught this abridged version to English-literate students at a high school in Latin America; most liked it although some wanted even more action. This is a solid read for adventure fans, capable young readers, and those that desire a good story."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"My dad and I are reading this book, and we think it's totally awesome! If you are 11 or 12, you may want to read this book with an adult, but you'll love the adventure and pirates, the treasure map and the Hispanola. I think I am going to start learning pirate lingo now, so I'll be ready if Long John shows up at my door! If you read this book you'll have to rate it a five star because of the adventure. Kids, hope you can get YOUR dad to read it with you!!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Michael Page reads this great classic like a full cast of different actors. Treasure Island deserves its rank as a classic in every sense of the word. It is an extremely well-written book with both intriguing characters and a truly adventurous plot. Listening to this rendition is just plain fun!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I just read Treasure Island, chapter by chapter, to my six year old son as a bedtime story. As soon as we finished, he wanted to re read it; and we will. In the morning and during the day, he spontaneously talked about the characters and the action and asked questions that he had clearly been giving a lot of thought to. We stopped during every page, sometimes on each paragraph, to talk about words and concepts that were new for him. It was a powerful experience for him in just how great reading can be. It was a great read for me, too. Stevenson is writer with a gift for economy of description who at the same time creates clear pictures and moves his story with striking action scenes. This book is far more gripping than most being produced today to entertain or train children, maybe because it's not a \\"children's story\\"; the author never condescends. I don't see why anyone would bother with any of the abridged or retold versions, if you do, you are cheating yourself and your child. The origianl is not hard to read or understand and it's fun and exciting. For most readers today I think this book will also reconnect to or open up a world that goes far beyond the action of a great story. I recommend this version because I love the Wyeth illustrations; his dedication to creating them just shows the way this book reaches into the hearts of the young and old. We're buying \\"Kidnapped\\" next.Warning, for some children it might be disturbing that Jim's father dies. Also, Jim's mother's portrait is limited and unflattering (though Long John's wife is portrayed as loyal and independent and competent). However, these are not flaws in the novel, but depictions of the world that Jim lived in and part of the underlying, understated, power of the book, which is of a piece with its times. If it were not, why read it?And they never say \\"Aaarrhh...\\""},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"In an effort to add a few classics to our reading list, one of the members of my book club chose TREASURE ISLAND for us to read. Coincidently, I had recently visited a cottage, turned museum near Saranack Lake in New York, where Robert Louis Stevenson spent some time right before he wrote TREASURE ISLAND. It was a timely read for me!I thought that I knew this story, but the years had passed and my memory was not as vivid as I had thought. The story was as fresh to me as a new novel. This is the adventure of young Jim Hawkins who was lucky or unlucky enough to have found himself in possession of a map to Treasure Island. Jim is filled with curiosity and adventure as he sails forth on the ship, the Hispaniola. Jim's friends who are sponsoring the voyage are Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey. Notable crewmembers are Captain Smollett, a no nonsense and very capable seaman. and Long John Silver, a charming, but very cunning man who was hired as the ship's cook. Silver's companion is a parrot that he calls Cap'n Flint.The excitement and danger of pirates, the lust for buried treasure and a mutiny aboard ship makes for an exciting book. TREASURE ISLAND continues to be a great story for any child or adult who savors adventure."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure Island by Robert Louis StevensonThis is a sea-fairing tale of a boy named Jim finding himself entangled on a considerably large pirate adventure. In the beginning of this sea story Jim and his parents ran an inn named the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" a shady character that ends up being a pirate walks in and that is how it all started. He soon finds himself part of a crew in the Hispaniola, Captain Smollett runs the crew along with a Mr. Trelawny, and the mysterious one-legged chief Long John Silver. Silver and his crew betray the captain with mutiny, and take over the ship, forcing the doctor, Jim, Mr. Telwany, Mr. Grey, the captain and some loyal sailors to ship out in the smaller boat, the Jolly Boat. Being chased by the Hispaniola, the Jolly Boat quickly takes ashore on Treasure Island. This is the last place where a great battle between good and evil takes place just for reckless greed. This book, in my opinion deserves a 5 out of 5 because it has great plot twists devious and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Great book! I recently reread this, about 25 years after I first did as a 10 year old, and, again, enjoyed it immensely!It is a real rip-roaring page turner that I found hard to put down as there is very little let up in the action. It isn't a cheesy fairytale either, with several truly awful people portrayed in it, quite a few of whom die some nasty deaths.It is a riveting read for any body with an active imagination, full of salty sea dogs, piratical sayings, nautical manoeuvering, sword play and double crosses. It's time it was remade as a movie!I recommend this book wholeheartedly to young and old readers!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"This book was a good book, but I would only recommend it to middle-schoolers because the plot and sentence structure is complicated. The words Robert Louis Stevenson used in this book were old English and hard to understand. In the book, he used a lot of sailing terms like yard, riggings, hull, bow, etc. He wrote using a lot of description. A picture of whatever he was talking about popped up in your mind. Some significant events in this book were gunfights, fist fights, and mystery. The climax in the book comes relatively early and if you like a lot of action, you should read this book.I gave this book five stars because I like action early in a book. All of the action starts in the middle of the book unlike some others where the action waits for the last pages. In Treasure Island when there is no action the story turns to a mystery. The mystery part in this book is mostly trying to find out why people kill other people. The main character, Hawkins, is a young boy that is seeking adventure and fortune. He is very brave and towards the end grows up into an adult. All in all I recommend this book to anyone who can get their hands on it."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Wow. It may be days until my mind allows me passage back for this memorable island. A part of me may always be marooned there. The words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters of this book were indeed the true treasure.Jim Hawkins was the perfect narrator for this story as I doubt any other character would have ignited my imagination as much as a boy. His naivety earned my heart and he held onto it with his bravery. His tempo was invigorating and captivating. Combined with the simplicity of his age, his account was easily read and brought me many quick hours of turning pages.He also was given an interesting supporting cast, including a \\"Gentleman of Fortune\\" I would dare never forget ~ the infamous Long John Silver. I think he was written perfectly, notorious though admirable.This book is easily recommendable for young and old alike. There is no question on why it is a classic."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I had previously read \\"Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde\\" and was impressed.So I recently picked up \\"Treasure Island\\" and was surprised to find out it was a kids book--written for kids. This book is amazing. Its also amazing what happens to the kid, Jim Hawkins, in this book. He even says so to Long John Silver when hes cornered. Quite the experience; quite the capable lad.Fast paced, believable, action packed.Jim, the son of an inn keeper, meets up with a pirate. And that pirate finally gets tracked down by others of his kind, which means Jim gets mixed up in their business and lands himself a treasure map. He shares the info with a doctor and the local squire and they set sail unknowingly with the previous pirates old crew. There is trickery and mutiny afoot. These are no gentlemen pirates, especially peg-legged Long John Silver. This is where you get the pirate lingo that has been used by our everyday public. Its great to go back to the beginnings of \\"shiver me timbers\\" and \\"sixteen men on a dead mans chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\".When they get to \\"Treasure Island\\" all their plans, and the pirates go awry. Jim proves his resourcefulness, bravery, daring and childishness all along the way.Excellent tale. You will enjoy it. Its got everything for a great adventure. And a skeleton, too!"},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I think most people have a pre-conceived notion about this book and its characters, but I read it for the first time recently and found that most of what I thought about it was wrong; the book and characters were both better than I had anticipated.The characters in this book are well developed and well written. Stevenson's use of dialogue is what really sets this book apart; you can tell from their dialect exactly what type of person each of the characters is and which group they fit into.The most interesting character isn't the narrator, but Long John Silver, the evil pirate. Silver is eminently adaptable and manages to charm everyone he comes into contact with by telling them what they want to hear; he reminds me of many of today's politicians.Overall, this is definately worth the read."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"If studious youth no longer crave the naivety &amp; adventure that Jim Hawkins, &amp;c. did, they do themselves a disservice.The fact that this book has accreted 45 reviews is testament to influence. What then remains to discuss are its merits.Accessible enough for young people (I first read it when I was eight), even for the refined reader it will evoke that arresting singability that the great adventures from the Odyssey to Beowulf to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea all can &amp; do.It is not high art. Stevenson wrote popular fiction. In order for such higher art to exist it must have a healthy popular fundament to support it, to paraphrase Pound. Treasure Island is such art--fit for the scops, &amp; the ears of the restless.The best support for Treasure Island may be the epigraph penned by its author, which serves as an elegant &amp; frank testimony to Stevenson's feelings about the importance of the folk tradition:&quot;IF sailor tales and sailor tunes, / Storm and adventure, heat and cold, / If schooners, islands, and maroons, / And Bucaneers and buried Gold, / And all the old romance, retold / Exactly the ancient way, / Can please, as me they pleased of old, / The wiser youngsters of today:&quot;SO be it, and fall on! If not, / If studious youth no longer crave, / His ancient appetites forgot, / Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, / Or Cooper of the wood and wave: / So be it also!

However, the price per copy was so reasonable that I decided to make a gift to each student. I like this edition because it has a series of post scripts."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Treasure IslandBy Owen MoynihanThe book Treasure Island is a very good book. It is written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The book is about a boy, named Jim, whose family owns an inn for sea travelers. One day a strange sea captain comes and takes a room. Eventually the captain's old crew comes for the treasure map he has. The captain never paid full price for the room he stayed in, so Jim takes the treasure map and calls it even. Then the doctor, the Squire, and Jim decide to find Treasure Island, where the treasure is hidden. They buy a ship and hire a crew. The voyage starts out well enough, then things take a turn for the worse when Jim falls in an apple barrel and hears the crew and the cook, Long John Silver, talking about mutiny, once they found the treasure. Jim tells the Captain and your going to need to read the book to find out the rest!The book was very exciting to read because every time one problem is solved, it wasn't long until a new one comes and the problems get more exciting each time. You almost never could guess what would happen to the characters next and you would need to be very lucky to guess it. You could feel like you were in the book because the author was very good at giving just enough detail to everything, so you could easily picture it. All the characters were incredibly realistic; you could see these people, or people similar, probably walking around during the time of this book. The only time I didn't feel in the book was when the characters talked, because the author wrote it to sound like how people talked back then. That was confusing. The main conflict was very interesting because it just kept changing and each time got more exciting. You would never be able to predict it. The characters were very realistic. The author gave very good detail about the characters and their personalities, so you got to know all the important characters very well. The book's ending was very satisfying and quite funny. It wrapped up everything very nicely and made you laugh quite a bit. I was very pleased the author didn't screw up the ending like other books I've read.The author's voice is first person through the main character, Jim. In a few chapters he switches over to the first person doctor but he tells you so you are not shocked or confused. The author uses the same vocabulary they would during the time the book is set. It is confusing to understand a good portion of the time but he explains some of it and that helps. The author really did capture the way people spoke and used it very well in the book but it was hard to follow. The author was very good at describing and giving good detail to the things important to the story and not too much on minor things. The author uses very good dialogue to advance the plot and let you learn about the characters. Some conversations were a bit hard to understand but it was still a good book. The author gave detailed descriptions of characters and the setting. He never did too much or to little to anything in the book, it was just right. The author's writing is unique because of the reasons above and he made a great story about a boy following his dreams and succeeding against all odds.Compared to other books I would give this book a eight and a half out of ten, only because the conversations were hard to follow and annoying to understand.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books and to anyone who likes book about buried treasure, the high seas, and pirates. Hope you enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."},{"Title":"Treasure Island","review":"Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car.

Few adventure stories have had such a wide-ranging impact on storytelling and popular culture.

It's very spare in the information it gives. There's practically nothing on how to roof such a structure (and secure the roof to the tires) or place and secure windows and doors. If you're not a builder or a carpenter you'd be well-advised to seek professional help.The book also, as do so many alternative home construction manuals, covers building only in the American Southwest. Nothing wrong with that, except most people don't live there. I wondered if my local soil (a heavy loam) is suitable for compacting tires and what an alternative to the book's adobe covering of the tires would be. Humidity and vicious cold might not mix well with adobe.Since there's no follow-up book or other serious source I could find on tire houses, and the [...] site apparently has nothing on the subject other than what's in this book, I have to wonder just how successful this whole tire approach is. The idea appears to have been abandoned.That's the bad part. The good is that this book will give you some idea of how to pack the dirt into the tires, modify the tires themselves for easier compacting, anchor them with rebar if you wish, and place lintels above the doors and windows. It delves a little into how sturdy and long-lasting a tire house could be and relates the homeowners' satisfaction with those thick, sound-deadening walls. The idea itself still appeals: warm, massive houses built of tires otherwise destined for landfills. I bought the book to see if building a chicken coop of tires was practicable.

He muddles the works by making it look like Ethan is the target and if they don't discover the truth soon Arcadia will find herself in deadly danger.TRUTH OR DARE is Jayne Ann Krentz at her very best. Her quirky characters include a Feng Shui psychic interior decorator, a body guard that looks like a skeleton and two cute children who play matchmaker for their mother. They make this work of romantic suspense a delightful reading experience. There are three different couples and several sub-plots that lead into the main storyline that adds a sense of family to what is essentially an action oriented tale. Ms Krentz's talent continues to grow and change in amazing ways that will please fans of this talented author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Ms. Krentz's latest is another chapter in the Whispering Springs saga, as interior designer Zoe Truax and her new husband, Ethan, try to make a go of their fledgling marriage. While Zoe competes with fellow designer Lindsey Voyle for a decorating gig, her psychic powers lead her to some disturbing conclusions, as she witnesses some negative energy in a model home she is helping design. Several plotlines carefully mesh together, as friend Arcadia fears that her supposedly dead husband may find her, Zoe searches for the source of her psychic episodes, and Ethan becomes the target of a murderer. Yet readers will not only be attracted to the smoothly transitioned story line-the characters are both believable and likeable, making this second Whispering Springs novel(after LIGHT IN SHADOWS) a must read. One can only hope that Ms. Krentz's literary pursuits will include more novels in the Whispering Springs series."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I enjoyed watching the relationships (friendship, familial, and marital) of the various characters introduced in Light and Shadows continue to develop. Both Whispering Springs books are \\"keepers\\" and I have enjoyed them enough to have not only purchased the hard copy, but the audio and e-book editions as well."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"JAK was never the most complex author around. We know this. But her latest book has me worrying about the deterioration of her talent... or what the publishers consider fit to put into hardcover.Was this a book written for adults? JAK's sentence structure, while never complex, borders on simplistic in this book. With lines like \\"Daria looked very happy\\" and \\"he could feel the positive energy of happiness in the air\\" I was beginning to wonder if she'd decided to write a novel for twelve year olds and then threw in a few less-than-spicy sex scenes to please the romance fans. She's also developed this annoying habit of bringing the reader up to date on things that happened only a few pages ago, filling in the gaps of her characters thought patters as if a rational adult couldn't think the situation through.The plot is boring, with too many strains to follow and not enough emotion to make me care whether Zoe and Ethan stay together - in fact, the only hint of excitement in the story was the bit concerning Arcadia's supposedly dead husband, and that was over so quickly you had to wonder why she put it in at all. This novel didn't seem to have a point, save that the preceding book was rather good, and she felt it needed a sequel. But this isn't a sequel. It's an afterward, at best.Add one star, I guess, if you can get this from the library and not shell out the money for a hard cover. I feel like I've been burned and certainly won't be paying for any of JAK's future efforts."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling \\"spiderwebs\\" when she walks in a room. I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I elected to listen to the unabridged audio version of this book. Boy, it was full of fluffy dialogue that had nothing to do with the &quot;plots&quot;. A few action scenes squeezed in between boring interaction between the characters. It got painful to listen to every detail the character did while speaking. Do we really need to know that she opened the car door, took the grocery bag out, closed the car door, walked 3 steps to the green gate, etc. It went on and on. Maybe actually reading the book wouldn't have been so bad.Or maybe I should have listened to the abridged version. It could have been condensed to 2 discs!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"First off I have to say I'm a long time JAK fan and have ALL her books. I was quite disappointed in this book I was bored silly I really didn't care what happened to them. It's so bland!!!I can't say I liked Light in Shadows alot it was ok. I truly truly hated the eclipse bay series I really think she should not do trilogies or series I'm sorry but she's just no good at it.I actually was getting very disappointed in her books to the point where I considered not buying them any more then she seem to come back and I was enjoying her books again but the last 2 certainly is making me wonder. I am a VERY loyal reader and while I won't say I will completely stop buying her books yet I would certainly consider buying the hardcover books. I'm not sure if she will do another book on these characters I for one sure hope not?????"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book was wonderful and I highly recommend it. It is a terrific follow up to LIGHT IN SHADOW. I can't wait for the next book in the Whispering Springs Series."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Truth or Dare is a good quick read--a pefect companion for a boring waiting room or plane ride. Jayne Ann Krentz picks up right where she left off in Light in Shadow. Zoe and Ethan Truax are still trying to see if their experimental marriage will work, all the while working on their respective careers as interior designer and private investigator. Zoe's friend Arcadia begins to ge the feeling she's being watched and the romantic thriller takes off. The pacing in this novel is a little off--the main conflict is resolved with about 50 pages left of the novel, and suddenly, there is another conflict that wasn't really hinted at earlier. That, though is my only complaint about this enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"... because there IS no center. The plot wanders, the characters talk too much about nothing important, and they all seem dead from the neck in both directions. Very disappoinging."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"In this sequel to Light in Shadow, we find Zoe and Ethan trying to settle into married life, but the fear of the other leaving has both of them holding their feelings back. Zoe's fellow escapee from the psychiatric hospital Arcadia Ames is also feeling out of sorts. She has also assumed a new name trying to escape the husband trying to kill her, and she feels someone is watching her. Zoe is still hiding her psychic abilities from Ethan. Ethan is still trying to deal with the death of his brother. Everyone is ill at ease.I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one. I was hoping Ethan and Zoe would solidify their relationship, but they didn't. As long as Ethan doesn't believe Zoe is psychic, they can never be truly happy. I was hoping for some event or something to happen that would convince Ethan of her ability."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I adored JAK's Light in Shadow - the first in the Whispering Springs Novels. The characters were crisp, witty and it was JAK at her best.This is not.Not that it is bad. It's just this is in the pattern of her recent trilogies of books. One really good and then two weaker continuation of the same story. I really hoped since Light and Shadow was so strong that she would break that curse. I love JAK - she is one of my favourite writers, but I do feel let down by these weaker part 2 and 3 of her JAK and Quick efforts of late. Only the Eclipse Bay books were as good all the way through. In paperback, maybe you would grump less, but at hardback prices her fans deserver a little bit more.When we last saw the Whispering Hills gang, it was just a month early. Ethan Truax, PI, had married Zoe Luce to stop Zoe's brother-in-law from trying to pop her back in to the high-priced Candle Lake Manor Psychiatric Hospital. The bluff had worked and the mystery - who killed Zoe's husband - was solved. Zoe's fellow escapee from Crystal Lake - Arcadia was now living with Harry, Ethan's PI friend. Neither Zoe or Arcadia had mental problems, but Crystal Lake specialised in hiding rich people's &quot;embarrassments&quot; - for enough money they quietly keep the problemsome relative away from prying eyes. However, in Arcadia's case, she was actually hiding from a husband, and deliberately checked herself into Crystal Lake. Grant Loring tried to kill her. She figured her husband would never look for her at an institute for the mentally ill.Arcadia suddenly fears, Grant's still alive - not dead from a skiing accident as reported - and that he has now decided to come after his wife who has too much information on him. She fears her &quot;new&quot; identity has been compromised.But the whole gang, for one reason or another is uneasy. It's November, the month Ethan's brother was murdered, leaving Ethan, Bonnie, his sister-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief. Ethan also is concerned about his marriage. He jumped at the chance to use the excuse of protecting Zoe, when he really wanted to marry her. Now, he fears she may be having second thoughts. Zoe is having seconds thoughts, but not because of love. She loves Ethan, but he refuses to believe Zoe is psychic, just chalks up her &quot;gift&quot; to good intuition. She feels if he cannot accept WHAT she is how can he love her? This is a sticking point, especially when she starts running into &quot;spider webs&quot; of dark emotions somehow connected to Crystal Lake. But those worries, take a back seat when someone tries to kill Ethan. Is it connected to his brother's death? Connected to Zoe's stay at Crystal Lake? Or the con man that Ethan exposed?Frankly, this books is a pleasant read, with some really fine JAK's humour, but on the whole, she once again has too many story lines going all at once - to hide there is not much of a mystery (Smoke and Mirrors problem). The romance between Zoe and Ethan gets pushed aside as it become the &quot;Gang's&quot; Story. It's like JAK has lost the heart to write romance, so she covers it with food, food and more food (Quick's Don't Look Back's Problem).This is enjoyable, diverting, and will please fans, but they would do well to wait for paperback. Then you won't feel so let down.The same complaints I see from other readers concerning her last half dozen books - thin mysteries, too many story threads and not enough romance on the leads - seems to be a trap JAK is falling into over and over again."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I adored JAK's Light in Shadow - the first in the Whispering Springs Novels.

A) Ethan and his family deal with the third anniversary of his brother's kidnap and murder, B) the growing attraction between Ethan's sister-in-law, Bonnie and biker, bookstore owner, computer expert Singleton Cobb, C) Ethan looks into solving the old mystery of writer Walter Kirwan's death and missing manuscript, D) Grant Loring, Arcadia's husband, is trying to eliminate her, E) Zoe must deal with a person from her past, F) Can Zoe and Ethan make their marriage work?, G) Zoe has interior decorating competition in the form of Lindsey Voyle, H) Is Nelson Radnor's wife having an affair?This is just a little of what is happening in this very busy novel. The story is so busy that there is very little time for romance but the author does a good job weaving the story that you really don't notice it. Now that Ethan and Zoe are married, there is a different approach to the romantic segment of the book.The writing is fast-paced, easy to read and precise. All loose ends are tied up with a heartwarming finish except one tiny issue that dogged Ethan and Zoe throughout the book. You will have to read it to find out what it is.I was delighted with this very entertaining read. I would like to read more Whispering Springs novels in the future."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This may not be JAK at her absolute best, but it is still a very nice sequel to Whispering Springs. There were enough good characterizations and plot turns to keep the reader engaged, and personally, I enjoyed it a lot. The best part about the book was a very accurate portrayal of how lack of direct communication and misunderstandings can affect relationships, and she illustrated this very well.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Like a raft caught in a strong current, JAK's writing carried this reader along on a fascinating journey full of mystery, romance, companionship and good fun. I enjoyed the many story lines, woven together. I liked getting to know the 'old' characters better, and watched them wrestle with different angst than the typical romance. (The chapter with Singleton talking with Jeff about his murdered father was particularly poignant.) I laughed aloud several times. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a few hours."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"After reading the negative reviews on this book I tried to keep those complaints in mind when I sat down with my copy. I have to say that, for me, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. JAK delivered on all accounts as far as I'm concerned. We get more insight into Ethan and Zoe's relationship, which is beautiful and steamy as they share their insecurities. Ethan having been left by 3 previous wives causes him to question how long before Zoe does the same. And Zoe, knowing Ethan isn't big on the psychic \\"woo-woo\\" thing is afraid that he'll never fully know/accept her differences. Previous characters share in the story but not the \\"spotlight.\\" That can be annoying, I know, but these are characters that you love to hear about and that also carry major roles in this Mystery and in no way detract from the story. I also love the fact that we follow a multitude of Ethan's cases. Some intertwine, while others are an added layer of interest. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this author, she is very talented. This is a romance/mystery mild on the suspence, not at all like Karen Rose or Anne Stuart darker novels. JAK is what she is, in my opinion always enjoyable."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"The main characters and plots are well developed. Zoe and Ethan Truax continue to develop their relationship despite their differences in just about all areas. Ethan refuses to accept Zoe's paranormal abilities as anything more than intuition. While she tries to find ways to keep him safe and improve his health. The sub plots in this sequal are wonderful. The relationship that develops between Arcaida Ames and Harry Stag is heart warming. The book was funny. A must read for a Jayne Ann Krentz fan."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Even when she is not at her best, she's better than many of the authors out there.

This second in the Whispering Springs series, has various plot lines and scintillating characters. The two work at their marriage and at the same time try to protect their friends. Krentz has written a winner. She has decided to flesh out the main characters, much to this reader's liking and I hope that she will write a third novel in this series. Thank you for an enjoyable read over the holidays."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I know this is supposed to be intellectual fluff. The book equivilent of TV to be read when you don't want to be challenged, and I accept it as such. I don't know if she has just gotten complacent, ran our of time, or what?I have read several of her books under one of her other pseudonyms Jayne Castle, and I expect better writting and story development. If you like this type of book try reading Orchid, After Glow, or After Dark, published under that &quot;other&quot; name instead."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"One of four books I'm reading. Very good book like all of her books so far. I recommend it to by sister, nieces and friends. They visit just to read and snack."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Great second book. It's nice to see where a relationship goes after the romantic ending. This story had several layers of creepiness, suspicion, mistrust and outright doubt that the marriage would work. Even their dreams were forboding and held the spidery taint of something not quite right. I love the conversations about what it means to really be crazy and what it takes to accept the quirks of the one you love. Fun, slightly scary, and a little on the dark side, this book is a great second book in the series."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"The StoryZoe was in need of help from a PI, she just happened to walk into Ethan's office.

They aren't sure who they are after, but one thing is certain - there is danger! Ethan tries to find out what is going on and who is after them. Together Zoe and Ethan will get to the bottom of this using Ethan's PI skills and Zoe's psychic ability.ThoughtsI was hesitant to read this book, but I'm so glad I did. It wasn't what I expected at all! I loved all the characters, very well written! I really liked Zoe and Ethan, their relationship is perfect. They complement each other very well.

So to find two women living in a small town after they escaped from a mental institution was implausible at best. I was occasionally confused since I did not know the back story. It wasn't as exciting or romantic as I had hoped, so I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"After \\"Light in Shadow\\" I had hoped this would have more mystery and substance and romance, but it was light on all three. If this is the first JAK book a reader has picked up, they will surely be disappointed. I picked this up used and cheap at a local bookstore so it was even less than a paperback. I enjoyed the humor and subplots and \\"sub\\" romances but felt too many storylines made for lack of the usual detail and suspense in other JAK books.This is good for light summer reading and some fun. These characters, Zoe, Arcadia, Ethan, et al are better defined in the \\"prequel\\" and this time some of their motives seem strange. I did enjoy getting to know Singleton Cobb a bit better but other than his character the rest were shallow unless you had read the previous book. I'm not going to describe the plot as there are several but enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I love JAK and have read quite a few but the sequel to Light in Shadow is not as good as the usual Jayne Ann Krentz books. Somehow Truth or Dare lacks the \\"suspense\\" and romance that is usually in her books. Ethan Traux is good as the Private Investigator and \\"strong\\" guy. Zoe Luce as the psychic didn't do so well. Ethan and Zoe solve the mystery and save Arcadia Ames but the book lacks the pace. A one time read for me."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book once it came out in paperback! The sequele to Light in Shadow, Truth or Dare rapped up all the lose relationship strings. Arcadia's 'deciesed' husband showed up and her relationship with Harry finally cemented. Bonnie and Singleton movied further along in there progressing relationship and Eathan and Zoe finally solidified there marrige.Jayne Krentz's book provids twists and turns that just when you think you have the protaganist nerrowed down she unfold some new clue that makes you second guess yourself.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"JAK used to be an auto-buy for me and though I was hesitant about her earlier book, Light In Shadow, it did turn out a little better than I expected. Not so with Truth Or Dare. JAK finished Ethan and Zoe's story just fine in Light In Shadow and if she felt it needed more, then it would have been better to lengthen it with a couple more chapters. I expected this book to be about Arcadia's story but no such luck. It was Ethan and his baggage dragged around even longer and Zoe's insecurity over her marriage and husband making me cringe.I saw no reason for writing an entire book just to continue Ethan's and Zoe's story. I was expecting a new suspense plot but there wasn't. Arcadia's character was also inserted as if JAK happened to remember she was in the previous book and so merited a casual inclusion.This book was lacking in everything that had made JAK one of my favourite authors. I have no idea why and hope she returns to her old form. This hardback is going straight to the USB!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Another enjoyable JAK novel.

As a fairly new Krentz reader, I found this book just the right companion for a boring evening alone. The quirky characters and dialogue made me smile. Descriptions of the locations were riveting and logically presented so that action is easy to follow, and the story moved right along. What's not to like? Krentz doesn't pretend to be a literary novelist. Thank goodness!A year or so ago, I wrote a very negative review of my first Krentz book, Summer in Eclipse Bay, which I felt was so bad I didn't pick up another of her titles until now. Glad I did. This one is in another league altogether. A nicely balanced book. Very entertaining!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Maybe I should have read \\"Light in Shadow\\" first, or maybe I shouldn't have read the flyleaf, because this bestselling novel did not deliver the suspense, intriguing subplots and romantic twist that were luridly promised.Many of the supporting characters are two dimensional for most of the book, and then suddenly beefed up in a few paragraphs at a suitable time to enhance whichever tangent the writer was angling for at the time.The main characters all have dark or unhappy pasts, which they bear either stoically (most of the men) or hysterically (most of the women), and even though there are some good parts peeking through the cobwebs, it rambles around all sorts of other space-filling things, and when you get to the ending, everything wraps up at warp speed, not even pausing for a coherent thought.As a romance it fails miserably, because there's nothing even vaguely rapturous or tempestuous in there. As a suspense novel, it does a little better, but the ending drags it down considerably. The jury is still out on the intriguing subplots, because I seemed to have missed them completely.If you have enjoyed other books by this author, and are having a slow afternoon, maybe this book will serve to pass a few hours, but wouldn't be the best choice if you've got other stuff on your to-read list. It's a 2.5 star effort at best.Amanda Richards, February 5, 2005"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz and all of her literary alter egos have always been hit or miss for me and this book was most definitely one of the misses.The beginning promises some dark paranormal thriller mixed with Krentz's generally heavy duty romance, but the book fails to deliver either. Instead, it's a muddled mishmash of characters who never gel on the page; instead of focusing on heroine and hero Zoe and Ethan, the author distracts with supporting characters that I couldn't have cared less for.Zoe's supposed to have big angst from her time in a psychiatric institute and her ability to literally read the walls of a house. Both could have been devices to ramp up the drama, but instead Krentz can't get a psychological grip on Zoe and winds up turning the character into a confused and lifeless cariacature. Ethan gets the same short shrift: what could have been a deep, dark and sexy character is instead insecure and disrespectful and not all that sexy.The mystery is so convoluted that there's no way for a reader to be engaged in solving it. The clues come and go, red herrings that don't make sense keep popping up and just when you think the story is moving along, bam - Krentz switches gears to one of the incredibly boring subplots involving the supporting characters.I hate it when authors push out books for the sake of having something on the shelves. Truth or Dare feels like Ms. Krentz's editor wanted a contemporary paranormal book (and a sequel to an existing book) of a certain kind and rushed this into print even though the author herself didn't have a cogent storyline for it. Every single aspect of it seems rushed and as if the author herself didn't care much how it came out; if she doesn't care, the reader won't either."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Average is the word for this book. Like others I eagerly await the release of any new JAK, this one is disappointing. The characters are wooden, the speech stilted and the plot virtually non-existent. Why write this in the form of a trilogy at all? all of the content of this book would have made a good 2 chapters at the end of the previous one, thus finalizing the tale of Zoe and Ethan Truax and the other inhabitants of Whispering springs without the added expense of yet another pricey hardback. As far as I was concerned this was much too formulaic and totally without the finesse in her older books."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Krentz created the characters on paper and then did not bother to breath bring some life and character into them. She used to be one of my top 10 authors that were a must buy, now don't waste your money. It's like someone else is writing her books for her, where's her editor and publisher? You don't even like the characters they are like paper dolls, no depth at all. i am was very disappointed in her last 3 books. She used to write real hot romance, a class act."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book was hard to put down. It really pulled the reader in. Very few slow spots. I highly recommend this book ."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring. The heroine has this \\"amazing\\" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business. Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!). There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other. At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I reached page 150, and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED YET!!! Except for lots of pizza dinners between the characters. I had thought this book would be solely about Arcadia, whose story I thought was a logical sequel to Light in Shadow. Instead, it was an epilogue, with more blathering on and on about how Ethan and Zoe (surprise, surprise!) still haven't trusted each other enough to share their inner-most secrets after a whopping 6 weeks of marriage. This story actually underscores how little Ethan and Zoe have in common, which is typical of this author's heroes and heroines.

He chose the movie and does indicate this before starting the story. The difference here is that 2001 the novel had the stargate on the Saturnian moon, Iapetus. Instead he writes as if the first novel followed the movie completely with the stargate orbiting Jupiter.The book 2010 is very similar to the movie except for another ship from China landing on Europa and discovering life there just before the \\"Leonov\\" russian ship arrives in orbit. The \\"Tsien\\" the chinese ship discovers a creature from the ocean on Europa. It's too bad the movie did not include this as i think it would have made great cinema. There are some other chapters on Dave Bowman coming back to earth, visiting an old girlfriend and his mom in a nursing home. I really enjoyed the book as Athur C Clarke is so good at helping us understand the real science behind the story. For this alone i would recommend the book."},{"Title":"Comus and other poems","review":"Hodges' reworking of Milton's play \\"Comus\\" is a wonderfully illustrated tale. While the story is not your typical children's literature moral-esque story, it is definitely a wonderful taste of classic literature. To deem a story where three lost youngsters are saved by the Good Spirit \\"not acceptable for children\\" seems to me to be a silly approach to selection. The story is not typical, but it is classic; and who better to influence the imaginations of readers than one of the great English poets, John Milton?"},{"Title":"Comus and other poems","review":"Trina Schart Hyman is an amazing illustrator and our family has long enjoyed her work, particularly in George and the Dragon, as well as The Kitchen Knight.

Then when Grandma arrives, she takes Harry for a walk in the park and up in a tree they see a bird with a new nest which looks exactly like Harry's sweater. This is a nice story.

Harry, a white dog with black spots, gets a present from Grandma--a sweater with big roses all over it. He hates it. He gets laughed at when he wears it, so he tries losing it...several times. He is finally rid of the sweater in an imaginative plot sequence that involves a mother bird. It's a sequence that also spares Grandma's feelings, thank goodness! The story ends with Harry receiving a new sweater from Grandma, one he likes very much. It's a white sweater with black spots. The ending is no doubt a reason why the book is a favorite of mine. My two-year-old likes all the Harry Books. The stories contain wonderful twists of plot but are written in simple language.

Roger Radford's Informed Consent is a fictitious story which begins with of one of those possible 'mistakes.' The story is of a woman who suffers devastating consequences following an epidural for 'painless' childbirth. Her husband, a former IRA hit man, plots revenge against those he holds responsible for his wife's suffering. Until the very end the reader is held in suspense wondering if he really means to carry out his threat. Despite Kieran Kelly's violent past, this reader found herself sympathising with his mental torture and almost willing him to succeed in his mission.The author dramatically writes this story revealing facts about what has been described by many as one of the British Government's best kept secrets. Informed Consent intelligently combines both fact and fiction.It tells of medical and pharmaceutical cover-ups (which, I believe, threaten to stir many guilty consciences), and brings awareness of the little known disease of Arachnoiditis. Roger Radford has deliberately taken the opportunity of exposing the sad reality behind so much unnecessary suffering, and this is very well portrayed through the characters in this story. There is nothing exaggerated in his description. There are sadly many who can relate to this suffering and who will share the pain and anger through every written word.This is Radford's valuable contribution to society. A book that everyone should read, because this story, based on reality, informs its readers of the truth behind certain dangerous medical procedures. Hundreds of thousands of patients have become victims of toxic injections (with no informed consent) or so-called failed back surgery. In the guise of a thriller, the author has provided the public with important information that is otherwise denied it. It is a book which could prevent a lot more suffering.There is no-one more qualified to write a novel on this subject than one who has suffered the agony of this little- known disease, and Roger Radford is one of its many victims. He has dedicated his book to the many silent victims of invasive spinal procedures, with acknowledgement to members of COFWA (Circle of Friends with Arachnoiditis) whose courage and fortitude gave him inspiration to write this novel. Informed Consent comes from the heart and deserves to be a bestseller and cries out for a film to be made.Janet KraalAuthor of Released from the Web."},{"Title":"Informed Consent","review":"Roger Radford, I have a bone to pick with you...

I think the book could make many teens feel less \\"misunderstood,\\" and realize that their feelings are normal, and that there are many effective ways they can deal with the ups and downs.However, at the end of each section, there is a segment called \\"What if it still doesn't work?\\" (As in, what if I've tried all of these things to no avail?) This is where we have the problem... there are several of these segment endings that suggest the teen do things such as stay in their room most of the time and focus on planning for when they're old enough to move out, or to get the help of others to arrange for changes in custody, etc.While I agree that there are certainly situations in which such measures would be appropriate (such as changing custody due to physical or mental abuse), we do not think it's appropriate to suggest teens take such steps over things like siblings borrowing their things without asking, arguing with their step parent, etc.Overall, it was a good book for us adults to get a closer view of how the kids may feel, but we are still undecided as to whether or not to give it to the kids to read because we feel these few \\"segment endings\\" are inappropriate. It's a shame, because the majority of the book is fantastic. Fortunately, our kids are not having any huge problems, so if we decide not to pass it on it will still be okay. But still a shame because it could have been a fantastic resource for them.Overall, I would suggest reading it yourself first and then deciding whether to pass it on to the kids."},{"Title":"Stepliving for Teens: Getting Along with Stepparents, Parents, and Siblings (Plugged In)","review":"As a an author and mediator that works with stepfamilies, I do not come across books about which I say, \\"I wish I had written that\\", but Stepliving for Teens is one of those books.

After having read this one, I knew it would be perfect for stepchildren. The book focuses on real questions &amp; problems from actual children and answers from two psychologists who work with families. A wonderful book for any child who finds his/herself in the midst of a new family. What I liked most about this book was that it dealt with topics other books for kids haven't touched, including crushes on stepsiblings. One of my favorite parts of the book was the &quot;fill in the name&quot; letter stepchildren can give to a stepparent when kids feel they're being pushed into having a relationship with the new parent.

Meanwhile, the advice is excellent, as it comes through the filter of an extremely insightful therapist who puts the kids' happiness first. My 12 year-old stepson has been rejecting me for the past 3 years because of pressure from his mother, but when my husband gave him this book, he actually started reading it!

My fiance (her mother) and I decided to read through it to make sure it was appropriate for her and we were pretty disappointed with some of the advice this book offers.We know this book was written some time ago but, regardless, I'm not sure how I feel about telling a teenager that it's ok to hide in their room and begin making plans to move out if they're unhappy with their situation. Sometimes, yes, things can be dangerous but this isn't referring to times like that.It was also very upsetting to see the book referring to a child's biological parents as &#34;real&#34; parents. What does that make us step-parents? We went as far as to white-out every time the word &#34;real&#34; appeared before &#34;parent&#34; and wrote in &#34;bio&#34;. It completely defeats the purpose to refer to one set of parents as &#34;real&#34;. This book was written at a time when step-parents were seen as &#34;real&#34; parents so in context I guess the verbiage makes sense but not anymore.Nonetheless, we decided not to give our daughter the book. It offers seeds of information and plants thoughts and ideas, like moving out, and staying at a friend's house for long periods of time, that we don't want to expose her to.It's very disappointing and I don't really recommend anyone in my situation purchase it."},{"Title":"Stepliving for Teens: Getting Along with Stepparents, Parents, and Siblings (Plugged In)","review":"This book was brilliant for our kids and step kids (aged 11 and 14).

Many of the holds and maneuvers are illustrated.Additionally, you will find material suitable for how to increase your chances of surviving a crash or fire. One concern that is dealt with is water ditching, which is interesting, because the text notes that there have been no water ditching of commercial aircraft since World War II.

The perfect handbook for self defence on aircraft. I assumed this book would be an instruction manual for how to act in case of terrorism in flight, the atypical passive instruction guide on how to come out of a nasty situation alive. Little did I realize that I was about to learn not only how to react, but how to prevent the possibility of terrorism, hijaking and how to increase my chances of surivival in the event of a crash.I particularly liked the information on how to defend myself in a small space. The diagrams prove that even if you are small framed, like myself, there are numerous maneverus one can use to disarm a criminal in a second. This information is vital, not only for aircraft, but for everyday life. The author has done his research and this book cites several reasons why group attacks on villans are essential to saving lives. A concept not many travellers think about when boarding an aircraft.This book takes you to the next level of travel. It has covered all aspects of safety, insider tips for comfortable travel and detailed instructions on self defence.

Also, this books has a lot of spelling and typing mistakes, and has about 20 pages only with airplane floorplans (and some are wrong!

Although she praises Lenin and Trotsky for their success and their support of the Revolution, the discussion leads us to some important criticism.Unlike other extreme left-wing Socialists of the time who rushed to support and adopt Leninism as their model of organization and practise, Luxemburg is sceptical of the benefits of such methods as the ones employed by Lenin and Trotsky. She tries to defend them, on one hand, on the extreme circumstances that the Bolsheviks had found in Russia, however, she considers them a necessary evil - and not a model to be adopted or be continued officially, as Lenin and Trotsky were promoting it. Luxemburg emphasizes that they are a product of the social conditions in Russia, and opposes Lenin and Trotsky, who were advocating their practices as a method to be employed and be used in political organization of Socialist (later Communist) parties and states. She concludes that the practises will only result in a dictatorship of an elite, and not in Socialism, which will only destroy the political life of the people, and that Democracy should be employed and freedom of the press, assembly, and speech, be permitted in Russia. Sadly, Luxemburg predicted the tragic era of the Soviet Union, in a period where everyone was disregarding her for her lack of support of the Bolshevik revolution. By today, her work remains unknown and little read. Her trend of Marxism, which focused on democracy and universal rights, is unfortunately, dead, as Marxism-Leninism or its sub-branches (Trotskyism, Stalinism) came to dominate the ideological trend of Communism. Reading Luxemburg today, however, is still important and interesting - she is an alternative that, in my opinion should not be simply put aside, even if she may be of mostly historical importance for now.The edition is very good, it is a standard paperback, which includes a brief biography of the writer."},{"Title":"The Russian Revolution, and Leninism or Marxism?","review":"An excellent book from a German Socialist and contemporary of Lenin and Trotsky. And in this she reflects some criticism against Lenin in comparison to Marxism and the question of censorship, the non-democratic take over of the Putsch and, the ideas of centralism verses opportunism and other activities.\\"Lenin has dispersed by force of arms a democratically elected Constituent Assembly, proclaiming instead a \\"Government of the Workers' and Soldiers Councils,\\" in actual fact, a government of his party.\\" p. 17 Rosa tried to oppose their breaking of democratic faith. She rejected the idea of dictatorship of the Proletariat endorsing a more democratic and extension of freedom to the widest possible number of people.

Well, he did.... and here's the book. Biggles fights both the Nazi's and the Russians, who are working together. Obviously written before Hitler kicked off Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union......Just to be clear, I'm not so much reviewing these Biggles books as providing a synopsis of the story, which Amazon completely lacks. Hope this helps you decide whether you want this particular Biggles book or not. For myself, I classify pretty much all the WW1 Biggles stories as 5 star as these are by far the most authentic and well written, the WW2 stories as 4 star and the remaining non-WW1/WW2 Biggles adventures as either 4 star or 3 star depending on the story. Hope it helps.First Published in August 1941 - 254 pagesThe Air Ministry have allowed Biggles, Algy, Ginger and Smyth to accompany a party of volunteers to help Finland in their struggle against Soviet aggression. Whilst on a reconnaissance flight, Biggles finds a dying Polish scientist called Petolski, who had been working on important experiments with metal alloys for aircraft. He had the results of seven years' labour in a portfolio with him and rather than let the research fall into German hands, (Poland having been invaded by Germany), he has hidden it. The portfolio has been hidden by the wreckage of the plane Petolski was in when it crashed just over the Russian border. Reporting the matter to Colonel Raymond, Biggles is instructed to recover the portfolio. Whilst searching for the plane wreckage, Ginger discovers a party of Russians and Erich von Stalhein is with them. An initial clash with them confirms that they to are after the portfolio. Von Stalhein is first to find the crash and the portfolio but it doesn't take long for Biggles to take the papers off him.Trying to take off from a frozen lake, Biggles hits an obstruction and their plane is put out of action. Russian parachutists drop and they are captured, but not before Biggles has a chance to hide the portfolio again. The prisoners are handed over to von Stalhein, who tells Biggles that unless the portfolio is handed over to him, he will have his friends shot. Biggles agrees to take von Stalhein to the papers and through a clever ruse manages to escape, steal the plane they went in and return to rescue Algy, Ginger and Smyth. Stealing a sledge, our heroes return to the lake where they crashed in order to get food from the supplies on board the aircraft. However, fate has a trick to play on them and they are all caught in an avalanche. Biggles is knocked unconscious and loses his jacket. Algy captures a Russian bomber and they fly back to Finland where Raymond is waiting for the papers. Biggles regains consciousness only to say that the portfolio was in his missing jacket! Biggles flies back alone to find the portfolio but a thaw has set in and his aircraft is unable to take off from the frozen lake due to the amount of water now on the surface of the ice.Ginger flies out (as prearranged) when Biggles fails to return and Biggles is able to pass the portfolio to him. Biggles then tries to walk back to Finland but has a dangerous encounter with a bear. He is saved by Ginger who has had his own problems and had to land. Biggles and Ginger now have to return to the lake to meet Algy who will be flying out when neither Biggles nor Ginger returns, (again as prearranged). Before they do, Ginger hides the portfolio in a hollow tree trunk. Arriving at the lake, Biggles is able to signal to Algy, but Algy is shot down before he can fly away. Algy is able to join the others and they all return to pick up the papers. However, now there is a Russian camp right on the site and whilst gathering wood for fires, the papers have been found and given back to von Stalhein! Biggles goes into von Stalhein's tent and relieves him of the portfolio at gunpoint. Our three heroes then escape and using a stolen boat hide out on a small island. Now desperate for food, Ginger raids a nearby large house and finds von Stalhein is using it as a base. Here, he sees a Swede named Olsen who is also flying with the Finns and realises that he is a traitor working for the other side. When Biggles is made aware of this he arranges to ambush Olsen, who is shot whilst trying to escape. Stealing a single-seater aircraft, Ginger is sent with the portfolio back to Finland. Ginger meets Smyth flying a flying boat and is able to lead him back to rescue Biggles and Algy in the nick of time."},{"Title":"A first Greek reader;","review":"I found the original scan of this excellent reader free online and wanted a bound reprint that would be easier to carry around. This newly printed book in hardcover is well bound on excellent paper and just the right ink tone. The problem, and it really discourages me, is that the text is nothing more than a photostatic scan of someone's old original book, complete with pencil marks smudges on many of the first 25 pages. And what really bugs me is that although the new book is larger than the old one, the photostatic copy of the text was not made larger (blown up, magnified) to fit. It wouldn't have been any more work for the publisher to do that, and it sure would've made the Greek text much more readable, especially the notes and dictionary, which were very small and blurry even in the original, and are now even more unreadable. It almost negates the advantage of having the bound version instead of the free print-from-the-web version.Good text otherwise, great for those who have completed a first year beginner's course, or for someone about halfway through a text such as John William White's First Greek Book.There are no English translations for the stories in this reader nor are there any grammar tables or rules. However in the back is a dictionary and several pages of notes for the stories (only half-way readable for normal eyes, unreadable for tired old eyes)."},{"Title":"Beginning MapServer: Open Source GIS Development (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"I purchased this book to help with developing a simple map-enabled web page running on a Windows computer. The book proved very difficult to use in that context. If you are planning on working on a windows computer, you should be aware of some potential shortcomings.In the spirit of full disclosure, I have considerable GIS experience, but little experience with web development.The book assumes that you are operating not only on a UNIX-based platform, but also that you will operate in a particular \\"development environment\\". The author does provide full instructions for building that development environment on a Unix machine, so if you are starting from scratch, everything will work as described.However....You can not readily build the same \\"development environment\\" on a Windows computer. I installed a version of MS4W (\\"Mapserver 4 Windows\\" on my computer. MS4W is a labor saving package that rapidly sets up a web server and installs most of the other open source software one would like to have available for using Mapsource effectively. Unfortunately, the installation differs from the \\"development environment\\" assumed by the book.As a result, there are MANY small but significant differences that crop up in developing the example applications given in the book. Many of these are simply differences in the way files are named or in the structure of the directory tree, but they are annoying and difficult to track down. it took me several DAYS of work and repeated searches for help on on-line MAPSERVER forums to figure things out and get the first several example applications running. I still have not managed to get about half of the examples up and running.That said, the book offers a nice introduction to many of the central concepts used in Mapserver. It has a good reference section that allows you to look up Mapserver commands, etc.Ultimately, I was able to develop the simple web-based applications I was after. This book contributed to that, but only after considerable frustration. Several Mapserver tutorials are available on-line. Some are specifically geared to Windows-based systems. They certainly offer a less tortuous, if sometimes less complete, path to getting Mapserver working on a Windows-based system."},{"Title":"Beginning MapServer: Open Source GIS Development (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"I've had this book for about a week, and so far my experience has been that not a single example works out of the box with the current version of mapscript.The worse news, is that most of the documentation on the mapscript website is totally out of date as well.If revised, then this book would be great, but it isn't just the book.The are some incongruities between mapscript itself and the API libs in other languages that suggest that the current development environment for mapserver is sufficiently busted, to invite taking a hard look at much more complex map engines.In a nutshell, I went with mapserver, because it support GDAL, Perl, and appeared to be well documented.It isn't well documented, the Perl API isn't servicable in the current version, and I haven't tested GDAL yet.Good Luck"},{"Title":"Beginning MapServer: Open Source GIS Development (Expert's Voice in Open Source)","review":"The book is written in a very clear way and goes to the point explaining mapserver thru examples, it should be a reference book for those, that are starting with mapserver, but it lacks a proper cover of raster layers and WCS.

My one and only quibble is that the recipes are hardly \\"updated\\" as described on the cover ... I went through it page by page comparing it to the original version, but the only changes I could find were to delete \\"water\\" as an ingredient, and to change \\"margarine\\" to \\"reduced-fat margarine\\" -- which hardly seems worth the cost of a new book; mine is going right back to Amazon. However, if you don't already own the original version, I highly recommend this book for uniquely delicious recipes (many of them kid-pleasing, and appealing to omnivores as well as vegetarians) designed to promote good health, with as little fat and sodium as possible without sacrificing flavor.

McMurtry is a wonderful author, he has a way of putting the reader into another life, the descriptions, and characters are so vivid that you forget that you are reading a book.The characters are very memorable, its been almost 6 months since my reading, but still today all of the characters are still etched in my mind. After finishing the book I felt, and still feel that they are my friends.The dialog is first class.If you haven't tried McMurtry I wouldn't hesitate. I will definitely be reading all of LM's work.Also, if you are in the mood for some wonderful Alternative Country music, check out Larry McMurtry's son James McMurtry. Lets just say the talent runs in the family.Happy reading, and listening!"},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"This is the best Larry McMurtry book. Don't be fooled by imitations! (So many of his new books pale in the shadow of his earlier works.) Try this wonderful novel. You'll be haunted by it long after you have finished it."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"At the time McMurtry started this novel, he had established himself as a regional writer of some talent. His first three novels were turned into screenplays, and two of them, &quot;Hud&quot; and &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; did quite well at the box office and with the critics. Perhaps to shed this regionalist mantle, McMurtry began writing what would be a series of &quot;urban&quot; novels centered on characters associated with the Houston area. After reading the first of his urban novels, I think that he should have stayed with the subject matter he knows best: the frontier areas of Texas. Very seldom have I encountered a novel that was so misconceived, overblown, and poorly written.It is as if McMurtry had two novels in mind when he began writing: one about rodeo and the other about graduate study at Rice University. That he tried to combine the two themes into one novel was foolhardy. The amalgam that resulted is a strange creation (almost embarrassing), imploying all the hackneyed tricks of pulp writers: the incongruous interconnection of characters, unbelievable crux moments, and titillation. Thus you have a world champion rodeo star, a Black Panther type, an English professor at Rice, graduate students, a cattle queen, a Hollywood screen writer, a rodeo clown, hippies and an overbearing Houston socialite all sharing each other's lives. Such unlikely relationships result in even more unlikely denouements.His main character is Patsy Carpenter, a sort of trust fund debutante with no visible means of support who spends her life worrying about what &quot;fetching&quot; or &quot;wild&quot; outfit to wear; how to furnish her new home (formerly owned, it just so happens, by the Rice English professor); taking care of her baby; giving orders to her maid; rescuing her drugged out sister from Haight-Ashbury (naturally); matching witicisms with her acquaintances; learning how to be an adultress; trying to decide to divorce her shiftless husband; reading all the important authors (boy, those Texans can read); and crying. In fact, she cries so much that she could easily replenish half the empty tanks in West Texas. No wonder Jim ran off to California with that red headed siren, Clara Clark (love those alliterations).But I think I might have been able to at least accept some of the improbabilities of the novel if it had been better written. McMurtry has talent and has a fine sense of place. When he writes about the Wagonner ranch, he brings the reader along. His descriptions of early morning at the ranch are wonderful. Everything he writes about becomes palpable, from sound to smell. Unfortunately, the ranch scenes represent an infintesimal proportion when compared to the rest of this huge, rambling book. More frequently, McMurtry is content with describing banalities and making very poor literary witicisms. These drove me to distraction and filled the novel. Just to give an example from the last chapter. He writes of &quot;motherly mouthings&quot; and &quot;being dogmatic about dogs.&quot; I'm sure the author felt that these would bring smiles to the faces of his readers. To me, they were like fingernails on a chalkboard.My biggest question was whether to give this book one or two stars. I tried to remember all the redeeming qualities of the book, trying to be judicious in my judgement (God, McMurtry is rubbing off on me!) but could only think of all the time wasted reading this book when I could have been enjoying other things. Sorry, Larry. Just like the flag of Texas: a lone star."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was in this book after having read &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. Unlike &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, &quot;Moving On&quot; was very slow and had many racist undertones. Unfortunately, the underlying racism is not surprising given the time period in which McMurtry wrote the novel (mid '60s) - off colored remarks were made in reference to African Americans and remarks about &quot;stinky Mexicans&quot; were made. I found this to be offensive and that combined with its extremely slow pace eventually caused me to put to book down."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"This is an early McMurtry novel, a long, rambling story with young Patsy Carpenter at the center of a large cast of characters that includes graduate students, ranchers, rodeo cowboys, a Hollywood writer, Haight-Ashbury hippies, and wealthy Texans - both new and old money. Written in the late 1960s, and published in 1970, \\"Moving On\\" is interesting for its attempt to capture the subtly shifting moods of its central characters instead of focusing on action and storyline. As page follows page, McMurtry describes his characters' feelings of self-assurance, annoyance, boredom, frustration, and sexual tension. And often moods degenerate into tears - Patsy's in particular.There's more than a bit of Henry Miller in much of the novel, as characters attempt to match up their levels of sexual passion, often finding that they are rarely feeling the same thing for each other at the same time. Seduction is often unsuccessful or unsatisfying, a rendezvous full of romantic promise may turn into an argument leaving both parties exhausted. A pass made after several drinks at a party or over a milk shake at a soda fountain may elicit an exchange of bitterness and barbed recriminations. A married couple talks openly of their infidelities. A wife accuses her husband of being neglectful, while she routinely meets a colleague of his for sex.For readers who like action and narrative development, this book will seem very slow going. For some, the many shifts of mood and ironies of thwarted intentions will make the story seem flat and the central characters unfocused. By contrast, the marginal characters, especially an old widowed rancher, a rodeo clown and his young barrel-racer girlfriend, and a teenage bronc rider spring from the page fully realized. A few scenes are pumped up with melodrama (a professor's wife breaks down in front of the girl her husband has tried to seduce; a champion rodeo cowboy refuses to accept that a ranch-owning woman he's been bedding is growing tired of him; a pregnant young woman is rescued from a drugged existence with a sinister boyfriend). But the most crisply vivid and emotionally honest scenes involve the death and burial of an old man in the nearly treeless prairie northwest of Dallas. They're simple and understated like the country folks who people these pages.McMurtry says that this novel emerged from an image of a young woman in a car eating a melted chocolate bar. What follows that image is one thing after another, until we reach the end almost 800 pages later, and that same woman, now divorcing her husband, feels a kind of independence that may never surrender itself to another man. Some readers will find this ending worth the trip; others may find themselves, like McMurtry's characters, in a somewhat different mood."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"To correct and amplify on some of the earlier reviews -- As Wagner's 'Ring' is a prologue followed by a trilogy, Larry McMurtry's Houston books are a trilogy followed by a epilogue -- in chronological order, 'Moving On', 'All My Friends Are Going to be Strangers', 'Terms of Endearment', and 'The Evening Star'. After McMurtry attended Texas Tech University, he went to graduate school in English at Rice University in Houston, where he lived and taught in the late '60s - early '70s. These novels are a perfect historical &amp; sociological mirror of the time &amp; place (I was there, too), but more than that they are stories of memorable, completely developed, fully complex characters lost between an old &amp; mythical Texas of ranches &amp; rodeos and the new urban Texas fueled by big money, real estate &amp; oil. Is there a more memorable character than Patsy Carpenter in contemporary American literature? She cries a lot -- oh, does she cry -- but she cries because she is lost, alone &amp; confused, and McMurtry never backs away from or softens his portrayal of her despair. We intimately know her family &amp; friends, their loves, affairs, betrayals and kindnesses, and they quickly become believable, fully human, and known. This is a long book and, in musical terms, stays mostly between mezzo-piano &amp; mezzo-forte -- short on dramatic plot development and cathartic climaxes. But 'Moving On' is a beautifully developed portrait of a group of almost-real people, and you will remember them for a long, long time."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"I am in the process of rereading Moving On and just checked Amazon for other readers' comments, which I found intriguing. I originally bought this book for two reasons: 1.)I'm a Larry McMurtry fan and 2.) I was interested in the rodeo aspects of the book. I was initially disappointed when Jim and Patsy left the rodeo circuit for the &quot;desperation of suburban Houston,&quot; but I finished the book anyway. When I picked it up again recently, I intended only to reread the rodeo-related passages, and now (deep into the Houston section)I find I can't stop reading. McMurtry's creation of Patsy Carpenter is a grand achievement. Her endless crying aside, she is one of the most completely realized characters in contemporary literature. I can't think of any other novel that chronicles with such convincing precision the moment by moment emotional life of a single character. There are times, certainly, when I find her annoying, but she is also endlessly compelling. The other characters (Pete, Eleanor, Sonny)are a great added treat in the novel, but it is ultimately Patsy who impresses, and it is for the creation of her that we should consider Moving On one of McMurtry's best works. (P.S. to the earlier reviewer who gave the book a &quot;lone star,&quot; what you say about the Waggoner ranch is very true. The descriptions are so beautiful that you want to move there (but then it functions as a kind of oasis in the book), and Roger is a touching character whose simple language belies great depth. McMurtry has created him with great affection.)"},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"Moving On was one of Larry McMurtry's first, and in my opinion, his best book. Its main character, Patsy, is an excellent portrait of an evolving personality. The incidental characters, both at the rodeo and back in Austin, are all well drawn. McMurtry also excells in capturing the culture, personality and humidity of the southwest.Despite my love of some of his other books (Horseman, Pass By and The Last Picture Show), Moving On is my favorite"},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"The first book (I think) in the trilogy that includes &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; and &quot;All my friends are going to be strangers&quot;. &quot;Moving On&quot; is excellent. McMurtry's description of small everyday tasks and oddball characters are beautiful. I read somewhere that McMurtry's women friends hated the book when it came out (one of whom supplied the title - McMurtry wanted to call it 'Patsy Carpenter') because the main character cries a lot. A LOT. But she is engaging and I wanted the book to go on and on and on."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"The premise is great- however, the book is just too long. Some things are simply redundant and needn't be repeated over and over. I started off loving Patsy,but as the book wore on I found myself getting mad at her- just leave Jim already! it would have been a 5 star book if it had just been a little shorter"},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"It's hard to describe Moving On. The book was not a success when it was released, sales weren't strong and the reviews were largely bad. And to a certain extent that's understandable, since it's a structural mess, with what might seem like too many stories going on, too many narrative side trips, an unfocused, erratic polt, and at times, honestly, it's boring.Yet something funny happens as you keep reading. It's not just that McMurtry has an eye and an ear for his characters--some of them eccentrics, some of them ordinary people, and many of them both at the same time--or for the places he puts them in. It's that one has a sense, more than just about any novel from its time, that one is reading about real people with real problems, not characters in an an artificial world created for aesthetic purposes. The story bursts out in all directions because the people are too true, and too interesting, to let go of. Patsy can seem incredibly frustrating. Whatever her husband does, whether he ignores her or adores her, is wrong and alienating to her. It takes her forever to realize what would be obvious from the start to an outsider: they simply shouldn't be married or have gotten married in the first place. She's the central embodiment of the struggle nearly everyone in the novel faces, some with success, some not, trying to make a life work that is essentially unworkable and unsatisfying.There are so many great characters here, fascinating, funny people most of whom you love, some you don't. There's Pete the rodeo clown and Boots his young wife, the barrel chaser. There Sonny Shanks the cruel alpha-male rodeo star and Eleanor Guthrie, the owner of a large cattle ranch, whom he hurts, uses and probably loves. There is dowdy Emma Horton and her funny, stressed out, horndog husband Flap. They are all people you feel you live with, people you don't want to stop reading about (even Sonny, who's cruel, selfish and dislikable). There's the silly rodeo kid, Pee Wee, and the old rancher Roger. Their victories are important, their losses are heartbreaking. Everything they do feels true. Almost everyone (but Emma and Roger) wants what they can't have and struggles to make the best out of demoralizing situations. Nearly everyone is struggling to make the best of what isn't good enough for them. They are all victims somehow, but there are no villains. They are often fools, bumping their heads against walls when they should have better sense. But that seems a fairly honest depiction of how most of us live. There's an honesty about the way McMurtry looks at these people and presents their lives that simply doesn't allow me to judge or feel superior to any of them. It one of the most humanistic books I've ever read.But more than anything, in a way I can't describe as accurately as I'd like, the book simply *confronts* me in a way no other book really has. I feel like I am looking at life itself when I read this book, and it somehow forces me to look at myself and my choices in a way no other novel ever has. To call it a \\"satisfying\\" book wouldn't be right. It's too pessimistic at times, too sad even when it's funny, to be accurately described as \\"satisfying.\\" But it feels so real, so true, that it gets to me as no other book I can name does."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"This big book is replete with McMurtry's usual supporting cast of strong and strange characters (the best is Sonny, the ex-Rodeo Champion of the World and a truly loose man). The main character, Patsy, who is a study in female contradictions and a pleasure to behold on paper, prances fitfully through the '60s and marriage, lust, motherhood, and a Haight-Ashbury family intervention. Joining her are best friend Emma Horton (prequel to &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;)and a comically engaging parade of academics, lovers, rivals, and barrel riders. The novel really captures the confusion and mindful wanderlust of the time and once again paints the reader's mind in the many hues of McMurtry's Texas. Savor it slowly and often while pondering your ideal cast for the Best Movie Which Never Got Made"},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"This is a big, wandering book -- but one whose length is justified by the in-depth exploration of its main character, the unforgettable Patsy Carpenter. Like a lot of McMurtry books, it's sad and funny and imbued with a deep sympathy for people's flaws and foibles and the situations they somehow get themselves into and then can't get out of. If you're in a relationship that's ended, is ending, or that might end soon, you'll find this book to be a bittersweet mirror. It won't help you figure out what to do, but boy will you recognize your own situation."},{"Title":"Moving On","review":"As has already been noted in the previous reviews, this novel takes place back in the sixties and was published in 1970--vintage Texan of my own generation in graduate school. That being said, I have to disagree with those critics who consider Patsy a lovable character. I consider her a boring frosted flake, a compulsive talker, somewhat of a histrionic personality, and completely self-absorbed. And to make a bad situation worse, she's married to a cold young man who is simply incapable of giving her the attention she is so desperately needy for, and the harder she tries, the more he withdraws. Enough already!Fortunately, in subsequent novels (Terms of Endearment and The Evening Star), Patsy grows up a great deal and becomes a helpful friend and family member to many, and a mature and more fully developed human being. Good for her. But based on this first novel about Patsy, I wouldn't want to know her. She's a total turn-off!Speaking as a fan of Larry McMurtry, this novel is certainly worth reading, but the title should, IMO, be changed from \\"Moving On\\" to \\"Stalled in Selfhood\\"."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"Dear Sir(s),I took a look at your dictionary called &quot;Collins Cobuild Learner's Dictionary&quot; yesterday night. To be honest, I was deeply horrified by the style used in the dictionary. If English is taken as a world - wide language, you are expected to teach it as it is, not with wrong comments. You are not a politician or you are not uneducated person. But you are a teacher of this language. So what you have to do is to teach English objectively. I want to give an example now. At the end of your dictionary, I mean the appendix, there is a list of countries, their adjective form, their noun form, etc. Let's look what is written for Turkey in your dictionary.Country : TurkeyAdjective Form : TurkishNoun Form : TurkLanguage : Turkish, Kurdish, Arabic. Maybe, you are unaware of the language used in Turkey. Let me teach you. In my country, our formal language is Turkish. There are no other languages used in Turkey. In fact, I have never heard of a formal language of Kurdish used in any part of the world. As far as I know, only provocators and spies from the western civilization learn and use this for what? To make a new Yugoslavia or to reach the petroleum easily or what else?A few years ago I was in Britain. In the towns of England, I had no communication problem. But in London, I had this problem because it is difficult to find an English. But in your dictionary, the language is written as 'English' for Britain.On the other side, it is well known that european countries have historical complex for Turkey. They always behave prejudicedly. As it is known, every country has its own glorious history. The history of your country may not be correct. But the history of my country may not be correct, either. Let's forget the past. Just look at what is what today. You know Greece was under the dominance of Ottoman Empire. But today they speek Greek. Could the Turkish originated Greeks speak Turkish in every part of Greece? I am not sure. Let's look at Zambia. What is their language? English. Have you ever looked at a world map? I have seen no relation with Britain and Zambia. Is it because of the colonist approach of Britain. Or what? Please, think about it. Please, also think and never forget that &quot;OUR HISTORY IS AS WHITE AS YOURS&quot; Wishing you be less prejudiced,Murat Savas,Civil Engineer, MSc.PS : This critique is for &quot;Collins Cobuild Learner's Dictionary&quot; published in 1996. I haven't seen the last version of this dictionary yet. If anyone who wants to see the shame of this dictionary, please let me know.

This dictionary is the first one to use the innovative &quot;natural&quot; approach to presenting the English language. Its definitions are not only easier to read and understand; more importantly, they are more precise because they portray the word in its actual contexts, with all of its slightest connotations and shades of meaning made obvious.

The greatest strength of this dictionary is the improved structure that facilitates retrieval of the target word.

I can bet my house at this claim!Key Features:- Example sentences are taken from real resources (magazines, newspapers, transcripts, etc). Too many examples for an each entry.- Clear definitions.Each definition is composed of one or two sentences. They are that long. One easly can grasp the meaning of a word without looking at its example sentences.- Very updated.You'll find countless phrases, expressions, idioms, slang and phrasal verbs alongside their clear and easy to grasp definitions and examples.- Frequency of words.Each word is rated by its frequency of usage by native spakers. Most frequent word starts from rating (*****) to the least one(*). This feature will demonstrate to English learners that which word is more important to learn or which is not. A very helpful option.- Each entry is defined by its nature like slang, informal, offensive, rude, very rude, medical, spoken, technical, written..etc. This feature will demonstrate how one can or can't use the word in certain situations.- This is basically an advanced dictionary. It'll be very helpful for those learners who have already cleared their high intermediate level and can read and understand simple English definitions and example sentences.In short, It's like a book.

The best of all, once you have located the target word, it is explained so that even those with very little prior knowledge of the English language can comprehend its meaning.

Get it!"},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"This dictionary is worth buying for at least three reasons. First, it contains simply-to-understand explanations of both words and expressions currently used in English speaking countries. Furthermore, it usually distinguish between a formal and an informal use of its entries, as well as among American, Australian, and British English. Finally, it provides English learners with some very clear examples of how to use every word and expression properly. Yet the Collins Cobuild has some blemish, too. For instance, I think the Editorial Team was in a hurry, when they decided the definition of &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;(Count noun.) You use 'in summary' to indicate that what you are about to say is a summary of what has just been said.&quot; The pointlessness of this definition is worsened by the references to &quot;summary&quot; contained elsewhere -- e.g., &quot;to recapitulate&quot;: &quot;(Verb.) ...You can say that you are going to 'recapitulate' the main points of an explanation ...when you want to draw attention to the fact that you are going to repeat the most important points as a summary.&quot; For this reason, in my opinion the Collins Cobuild Dictionary cannot be awarded five stars."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"This is a very nice dictionary especially suitable for ESL students.It has many examples,so users can quickly understand how to use the word.I enjoy it very much !"},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"I bought this dictionary expecting clarity in the definitions. In this area, I have no complaint.The feature I passionately dislike about this dictionary is the extra column with grammatical references. This \\"Unique extra column\\" is supposed to make information easy to find and easy to understand. It does neither of those things.These notations serve only to add an unnecessary degree of complexity to otherwise easily understandable entries. I do appreciate the need for an English learner to know precisely how each word is used, but nobody - least of all a non-native speaker - needs to be buried in these sorts of cryptic grammatical nuances. Surely there must be a better way to communicate this information with the same clarity as the definitions.In my view, it detracts from the overall purpose of this type of dictionary - to be easily understood and applied."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"Until now, I've found every single word, phrase or expresion, even the most difficult ones.

Also, the software installed from the CD-ROM features a popup window that can always effectively capture a word on the screen within an IE web browser window, as long as you put the cursor on that word - much more effectively than its counterparts, such as Longman, Oxford and Cambridge learner's dictionary."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"The Collins COBUILD Advanced (Learner's) Dictionary is now in its 6th edition from HarperCollins Publishers. Over the years, from the 1st to 6th edition, the number of references increased slightly from over 60,000 to 75,000+, and of examples - from 90,000 to 105,000. The definitions are full sentences very easy to understand and not just phrases. The words have phonetic transcriptions, except in the 6th edition, based on the most popular phonetic alphabet IPA. Plentiful example sentences show how to use the words.The 3rd edition of 2001 introduced a digital version on CD-ROM included with the book on paper.

I highly recommend it for both students and teachers. (Get the hardcover; you'll quickly wear out a paperback!)"},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"The Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner's English distinguishes itself from a multitude of generic and torturously difficult dictionaries. The conjugation is above the headwords, in bold, and unabbreviated. Sentence examples and additional conjugation are marked. Sentence examples are in italics and unabbreviated. The most common words in the English language are marked according to frequency. Headwords, numbers, and side notes are in blue. Special sections for phrases are lengthy. British English versus American English is highlighted. One refreshingly different and very useful feature is highlighted verb versus noun pronunciation. Usages - \\"can\\" as a verb versus \\"can\\" as a noun - are marked with boxed numbers. Usages within usages - the verb \\"can\\" meaning ability versus the verb \\"can\\" meaning permission - are marked by boxed numbers. The editors use what they call pragmatics labels in the side notes: approval, disapproval, emphasis, feelings, formula, politeness, vagueness.The introduction says of the side notes, \\"The information is coded for brevity, and every effort has been made to keep the coding clear and easily memorable. This edition makes the Extra Column even easier to use.\\" I dissent. Because the side notes are in a special column instead of buried within the definition, they are easier to FIND. But because they are coded, they are no easier to USE.\\"Perhaps the best advantage of this dictionary is that explanations are substituted for definitions. When one of my students asks me for help with an unfamiliar word, I don't quote a dictionary definition. I simply explain what the word means. Then I use the word in a sentence. Then I provide some insights through grammar and culture. That is the same strategy other teachers use, and that is the same strategy Collins/Cobuild uses.Collins/Cobuild uses it's Bank of English, a massive collection of material compiled from British and American culture since 1990. The Bank, as well as computer software, help lexicographers 1) determine the order in which words are listed, ie, in order of frequency use 2) explain what the words mean and how they are used 3) choose the best sentence examples.Most of the 75.000 sentence examples come from the Bank, which means they are direct quotes. When a student asks a teacher for help with vocabulary, the teacher doesn't have the advantage of being able to research and quote the literature of the day. They have to use, on the spot, their own knowledge of the English language. However extensive that knowledge might be, it is no match for an on-screen corpus combined with computer technology."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"The best dictionary I have ever had.

It has an extremely unique style and it tries hard to present the idiomatic language in a manner that is easily assimilable. While it may not please all the people all the time, on many occasions I've turned to it for a definition when my Webster's New World, American Heritage or Oxford Concise ran dry. The definitions include much description of the meaning, with very illustrative examples (not mere sentences). I don't use it as a primary dictionary, but for those hard-to-find definitions, it proves very handy."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"I bought this dictionary in May 1990 in Singapore.The way the content presented is the best I had ever seen. This dictionary is written in ordinary, everyday English that is easy to understand. It has an excellent Guide to the Use of the Dictionary. Every explanation comes with at least one example that is taken from actual texts wherever possible. The extra column in the dictionary, right beside the explanation of a word, creates a visual attraction to the reader. This extra column is used to give two different types of information: grammar notes and semantic relationships (similar or opposite) for the word that is being explained. I love it.CoBuild is the appreviation of Collins Birmingham University International Language Database. This dictionary was developed and compiled in the English Department at the University of Birmingham as part of a language research project commissioned by Collins Publishers.Currently, I am looking for its enriched and/or, if any, CD-ROM version.

It always helped me in all the stages of my learning. It won't matter how good your English get or if you're a seasoned English speaker, Cobuild will always have much to offer. Its down-to-earth explanations and rich examples give very precise definitions and understanding of the words and expressions. The pronunciation is easy to learn, and the differences between the major English variations are pointed out when necessary. It's so good to use this dictionary, that I get myself reading it for very long. Sometimes you just get it to take a look at one definition, and then you feel like exploring and reading on and on (which is great for who's learning; you learn even more!). Another important thing is that, once you get used to Cobuild's Dictionary, it'll be easier if you get other Cobuild publications, because their layout and structure are pretty the same. You won't be disappointed at all if you buy it. As another substitute for Cobuild I would also suggest the Longman Series for Learners. Both Longman and Cobuild, have unique features. Which one you're going to choose is up to you and it's a hard choice. To avoid having to choose do just like me and buy both."},{"Title":"Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary: Helping Learners with Real English","review":"PROS- Each word entry has an example.

The criteria for a definition getting into the dictionary is that it must be somewhat well represented in the database. This means that the dictionary omits a lot of definitions which, while being less common, are still in use. For this reason, while the COBUILD is an excellent primary dictionary, it is important to have a second, more comprehensive dictionary, such as the Websters or Funk & Wagnalls, etc. The COBUILD dictionary uses a methodology similar to that used in the great granddaddy of them all, the Oxford English Dictionary, in that it includes numerous sentences to illustrate the definitions it provides, but it is not as scholarly, and therefore would be much easier for many to use. Also, since the COBUILD dictionary is compiled strictly from contemporary usages, it eliminates the need to evaluate the senses for currency of usage. All its definitions are currently in use.

The various quotes preceding Objectives are a nice touch and the illustrations for the most part look like M&Ms;, making me wonder why this book was in the library and not in schools. It would be more effective in a psychology classroom, of which I had a taste in 1960 at Troy State College in Alabama.The two-page list of emotions was interesting and helpful. Emotions help to form relationships, experience growth, and evaluate our performance, as we move through the various stages of life. Emotions help us to understand ourselves and each other. Some potent ones are fear, guilt, loneliness, sadness, love, hate, distrust and shame.Everyone feels all the same emotions. It's what we do with them and how we perceive them which sets us apart. We need to balance emotion with logic. Instead of responding in a reactive manner, proactive is preferred to settle a conflict. We often mistake arrogance for pride.The goal of most power struggles is to win, at any cost! We feel threatened by the other person. We need to protect ourselves any way we can when we feel threatened. Thus, a power exchange occurs with both verbal and non-verbal ways. Silence (and withholding info, attention or affection) is the most effective communication tool of all. There must be emotional input in all conflicts.When forming new relationships with people, it is necessary to resolve any conflict to develop open paths of communication. Doing it is hard, but then it is easy for open, honest dialogue throughout the relationship. It is best at the beginning to make sure the relationship is important to you. Don't discount the other person's perspective.He says that \\"age, experience, maturity, and wisdom are all independent issues.\\" He used actual cases to demonstrate his ideas and advice. Erik Fisher is a psychologist; his co-author, Steven Sharp, is a freelance and technical writer. Together, they simplified the exercises promoted to help the reader to understand his emotions and change them, if needed. Power conflicts are not an ego thing but basic philosophy of life on all levels. It's something we need to learn how to handle.

This charming translation of a charming and important work in the history of science shows us that our ideas may not be quite as modern as we think they are.First published in 1686 (that's right, 1686), Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds discusses how the stars in the night sky are other solar systems, probably with planets and people of their own, and that we may visit them, or they us, one day. What makes the work so charming, and of lasting literary as well as scientific value, is that it is written as a dialogue between a philosopher and a lady as they spend several evenings walking together in the lady's garden. &quot;What if,&quot; asks the philosopher, the travelers from other worlds &quot;were skillful enough to navigate on the outer surface of our air, and from there, through their curiosity to see us, they angled for us like fish? Would that please you?&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; the lady replies, &quot;I'd put my myself into their nets of my own volition just to have the pleasure of seeing those who caught me.&quot;If you have any interest in the history of science, or science fiction, or astronomy and space travel, you will enjoy this volume."},{"Title":"Conversations on the plurality of worlds,","review":"_Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds_ is a translation of the work _Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes_, first published in 1686, by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle. Fontenelle (1657-1757) was a fascinating figure of the French Enlightenment, who was among the first to popularize scientific ideas. Fontenelle was critical of much of religion and superstition (for example, he wrote critically of people who lived in fear of comets). At the time Fontenelle wrote, religious conflicts existed between Protestants and Catholics; however, Fontenelle faced the possibility of censure in that he maintained that the earth was not the center of the universe. Fontenelle was heavily influenced by the \\"modern\\" philosophy of Descartes (particularly Descartes' theory of vortices), as well as the heliocentric astronomy of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler, and the ideas of Galileo (including Galileo's use of the scientific method and his use of the telescope for studying the night sky). Fontenelle also entertained more modern \\"enlightened\\" ideas regarding the place of women (he places a woman in a central position within these dialogues showing his belief that women could indeed be scholars). However, perhaps most interesting of all are Fontenelle's speculations concerning the plurality of worlds, life on other planets (and moons), and the possibility of other solar systems surrounding other stars (and life on them), as well as the interesting idea that man would someday learn to travel to other planets (or the Moon) by means of flight (far ahead of his time!). Ideas such as these influenced many subsequent writers and thinkers, including the early science-fiction of Jules Verne as well as subsequent utopian literature. Religiously, Fontenelle has proven difficult to pin down given his rejection of superstition and his hostility towards clericalism, leading some to suggest that he was in fact a \\"pagan\\". The _Conversations_ presented here were continually updated by Fontenelle throughout his life (and a sixth dialogue was added to the original five, though it does not appear in this edition). This edition features an Introduction by Nina Rattner Gelbart, which explains the context of this book and presents the life of Fontenelle. Further, there is a Translator's Preface by the translator H. A. Hargreaves, which discusses the life of Fontenelle as well as notes some of the peculiarities of the editions of this work and the difficulties in translating the work. This book has proven to be a difficult one to translate and some of that difficulty may be seen here.Fontenelle's book begins with a preface where he compares his situation in putting forth a book of popular philosophy to that of Cicero who wrote in his own tongue. Fontenelle also explains the characters who appear in his dialogues, including the Marquise (the female character in the dialogue), and why he has chosen to place a woman in the dialogue. In this preface, Fontenelle also considers the possible objection that the inhabitants of the Moon would not be sons of Adam (being that the sons of Adam would presumably have never made the journey from the Earth to the Moon). He concludes that the inhabitants of the Moon need not be like men in any way and that he cannot know what they would be like, and that further he is not being entirely serious in this book. Following this, Fontenelle addresses the book to a Monsieur L___, and then begins with the first dialogue which takes place on the first night. During the first evening, the Marquise and the philosopher appear and looking up at the night sky, the philosopher begins explaining the nature of the heavens to her. To begin, the philosopher explains the nature of Natural Philosophy (at that time including Physics and Astronomy within its purview), and notes how \\"nature has become mechanical\\" since the time of the ancients, comparing nature to a watch. The philosopher then notes the positions of the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, the planets, and the \\"fixed stars\\" in the night sky, and he explains how originally the Ptolemaic view held sway (with the Earth at the center of the universe) only to be replaced by the Copernican view (with the Sun at the center of the solar system and the Earth revolving around it). The philosopher explains how the Earth passes through each sign of the Zodiac as it turns around the Sun, and he answers several objections the Marquise has to this theory, explaining how the heliocentric theory is more parsimonious than the Ptolemaic system. The philosopher ends by making a comparison between Copernicus' views and those of Tycho Brahe and then they adjourn for the evening. The second evening finds the philosopher making the astonishing admission that the Moon is a world just like the Earth and that the Moon is likely inhabited. The philosopher reasons that since the Moon resembles the Earth it must be inhabited like the Earth in this respect. The philosopher goes on to explain various aspects of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth, and then goes on to explain how the inhabitants of the Moon are in a similar condition to the inhabitants of America and the New World before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. In answer to the question as to how the inhabitants of Earth would ever meet the inhabitants of the Moon, Fontenelle proposes this startling account: \\"We're beginning to fly a bit now; a number of different people have found the secret of strapping on wings that hold them up in the air, and making them move, and crossing over rivers or flying from one belfry to another. . . . The art of flying has only just been born; it will be perfected, and some day we'll go to the Moon.\\" Surely such prophetic remarks (written in 1686!) show that Fontenelle was far ahead of his time. The third evening has the philosopher take back his remarks about inhabitants on the Moon, only to be re-convinced by the Marquise. They also discuss the Sun and Venus. The fourth evening has the philosopher explain the inhabitants of other planets (making note of their different periods around the Sun), including Mercury and Jupiter (and making note of the moons of Jupiter as well), as well as explaining the theory of vortices. It is during the fifth evening however that the philosopher makes perhaps his boldest claim. He contends that the fixed stars are really suns, and that they may contain solar systems of planets just like our own Sun. From this he argues that these planets may each be inhabited. However, he cautions, \\"Well, if you grant a mathematician the least principle, he'll draw a conclusion from it that you must grant him too, and from that conclusion another, and in spite of yourself he'll lead you so far you'll have trouble believing it.\\" These thoughts disturb the Marquise, but the philosopher ends on a positive note by bringing up the fact of beauty (and her beauty).These conversations are an important part of the history of science. They offer the reader a unique glimpse into the mind of a true visionary who saw far ahead into the future. They have played a unique role in the development of scientific ideas (as well as the creation of science-fiction) and offer us hope that some day we may come into contact with other intelligent life in the universe."},{"Title":"Conversations on the plurality of worlds,","review":"This book was thrilling to me because of the conversational way it told 1600's scientific ideas of outer space. Besides that, the issue of what women are capable of learning was an underlying idea. To top it off, Elizabeth Gunning Plunkett was the translator. I was especially happy to see how she translated such a thought-provoking book. The bonus was that she was probably my ancestor. The book includes a page or more of her bio and a portrait drawing of her. She was considered to be the best of all prior translators of this book, according to the footnote writer.There is no romance in the book at all. Rather, it is everyday conversations between a man and a woman on the philosophy of living as humans related to the planets. It has no paragraph breaks nor quotation marks when changing from one speaker to another. That and a few words whose meanings I didn't know were the only things that made it difficult to read.I would recommend this book for ALL readers of all ages. It sparked many conversations between my husband and me about current scientific views of how the planets relate. Our God created a marvelous solar system.

The romance added in with the scientific discussions adds a wonderful touch, as do the insightful comments into the human experience and psyche."},{"Title":"Conversations on the plurality of worlds,","review":"The French scholar, Bernard Fontenelle, in the late 16th century wrote a scientific treatise of the people who inhabited the planets (i.e. Venus, and Mercury) within our Galaxy. In reference to the inhabitants of Venus he succinctly describes them as:\\"I can see what sort of people the inhabitants are. They are much like the Moors (i.e. Black people) of Granada. A little dark, sun-burnt people, scorched with the sun; full of wit and animation, always in love, always making verses, listening to music, having galas, dances and tournaments. Give me leave to tell you that you know but little of the inhabitants of the planet Venus.\\" [End Quote, \\"Conversations on The Plurality of Worlds\\", Page 86, 1688]In the above passage the inhabitants of planet Venus were described as \\"black midgets\\" who resembled the black Moors of Spain when they ruled half of Europe for 700 years. This description of our Venusian ancestors also correlates with the modern day research of the little TWA people of Central Africa. An African race of Pygmies who were the oldest recorded inhabitants of the Great Lakes region of central Africa and stand no more than approximately 2-5 feet tall.In reference to the inhabitants of the planet Mercury Bernard Fontenelle describes them as:\\"But what must the inhabitants of Mercury be? They must be also mad with vivacity like most of the negroes. They are without memory, never reflecting, acting by starts and at random. In short Mercury is the bedlam of the universe.\\" [End Quote, \\"Conversations on The Plurality of Worlds\\", Page 86, 1688]In the above passage Bernard Fontenelle knowingly associated the inhabitants of Mercury with the plight of the black race throughout Earth. In all their struggles for Civil Rights in an end to oppression black men and women of Earth \\"are without memory, never reflecting, acting by starts and at random\\" [End Quote]. Is it any wonder, then, why the black race of Earth is the only race of people who doesn't know their cultural heritage? They adopt other people's religion, nationality, and customs never understanding the totality of themselves as a people who reach \\"beyond the stars\\".What little is known of black history has been salvaged by numerous eurocentric and afrocentric scholars; but, even then the history is \\"incomplete\\". Therefore, when I say that the black race of Earth doesn't know their \\"cultural heritage\\" it is to say that the search for our \\"blackness\\" has been incomplete up until now.Bernard Fontenelle, then, goes on to describe the \\"skin color\\" of the inhabitants of the planet Mercury:\\"The sun appears there nine times larger than it does to us. The light they receive is so brilliant that our finest days would be but twilight in comparison to theirs. For scorched as they are with the fierceness of the sun.\\" [End Quote, \\"Conversations on The Plurality of Worlds\\", Page 86, 1688]Now, let me give an historical background on this ancient text (i.e. Conversations on The Plurality of Worlds):\\"It offered an explanation of the heliocentric model of the Universe. It is Bernard Fontenelle's most famous work and is considered to be one of the first major works of the Enlightenment Age. Bernard Fontenelle addresses female readers and suggests that the offered explanations should be easily understood even by those without scientific knowledge. This book written so long ago was a critical success as it explained the heliocentric model of the universe and also muses on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. At the same time, Bernard Fontenelle avoided challenging the Catholic Church and its view of the world. The book was very well received both in France and elsewhere, and was regularly published. In 1691, Bernard Fontenelle was elected to the French Academy.\\" [End Quote, [...]]The original language of Venusians, fortunately, hasn't been lost in its entirety. I speculate that maybe their language could have been quite similar to the TWA of Central Africa:\\"When the Hutu, a Bantu-speaking people, arrived in the region, they subjugated the Twa. Around the fifteenth century AD, the Tutsi, a cushite-speaking people, subsequently arrived and dominated both the Twa and the Hutu. The Twa speak the same language, Kinyarwanda, as the Hutu and Tutsi.\\" [End Quote, [...]]On the other hand, the little information that has been salvaged was preserved by Edgar R. Burroughs in his book \\"Pirates of Venus\\" published in 2001. He was able to re-create the Venusian alphabet supposedly used by the Venusians (i.e. or \\"Amtorians\\"- as \\"Amtor\\" is what the natives call their planet).

An improvement in the world around us inevitably follows.TestTo qualify as a philosophical theory, the practitioner of philosophy - the philosopher - must, therefore meet a few tests:1. To clearly define and enumerate the traits he seeks to enhance (or suppress) and to lucidly and unambiguously describe his ideal of the world2. Not to fail the tests of every scientific theory (internal and external consistency, falsifiability, possessed of explanatory and predictive powers, etc.)These are mutually exclusive demands. Reality - even merely the intersubjective sort - does not yield to value judgments. Ideals, by definition, are unreal. Consequently, philosophy uneasily treads the ever-thinning lines separating it, on the one hand, from physics and, on the other hand, from religion.The history of philosophy is the tale of attempts - mostly botched - to square this obstinate circle. In their desperate struggle to find meaning, philosophers resorted to increasingly arcane vocabularies and obscure systems of thought. It did nothing to endear it to the man (and reader) in the post-Socratic agora.Enter \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy (Third Edition)\\" by Jay Stevenson, Ph.D. (Alpha Books).It is a delightful and structured excursion into the terrain more convolutedly trodden by \\"Sophie's World\\". It is a vade mecum in the true sense of the word. It gently holds you by the hand and unflinchingly introduces you to the one intellectual giant after another.The author knows how intimidating philosophy can be. He, therefore, avoids professional jargon. He talks to the reader, rather than talk at him. The text is peppered with brief insets titled \\"philoso-facts\\", \\"wisdom at work\\" (how to apply what you have learned), \\"reality check\\" (where philosophers disagree with each other and with reality), and \\"lexicon\\". Two appendices comprise a glossary and further reading.The book is an amazing feat. It covers all the major schools of thoughts and philosophers in c. 350 eminently readable pages.

While appearing at first to be an introduction to the greater subject, it turns out to be a packaging of the author's own beliefs... heavily skewed and full of personal bias. Whole movements are passed over with little or nothing said, other than a dismissive comment from the author, who apparently does not think them worth mention because he does not agree. This is HARDLY proper for what is supposed to be an introduction to the subject. The novice reader is left with a lopsided, limited presentation that while written well enough, leaves him needing to go buy ANOTHER book so he can actually BE introduced to what this title led him to believe he would be -- the subject of philosophy in a wide ranging sense.In surfing Amazon tonight, I decided to look at the reviews for this book (&quot;Philosophy for Dummies&quot;). I was VERY glad to see that a number of people saw the same thing as I did in this.Pro-God or not, is not the point. The glory of philosophy is all the different views, and this is what an introduction should present. A book like this should be written with the intention of exposing the reader to the subject of philosophy itself, not just the author's step by step program of -- &quot;This is what I think, so I am going to show you why you should think this way too. Don't worry about the other stuff, it's just nonsense, so we won't say anything much about that.&quot;&quot;Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy&quot; is a much better choice if we were to compare the two. It presents a wide variety of thoughts and explanations, leaving each person to think for himself and later search out more of what he finds speaks to him. The layout is well organized, and the progression of ideas fit well together, allowing the novice reader to not only see the varying concepts, but how each stage of thought fed into the next, and how differing theories challenge one another. The reader is exposed to the ideas themselves, as presented by the given philosophers, not as packaged by a single author who is spending less time introducing and more time selling his own views. Concepts are not examined in great detail, but then again, that is not what this book is trying to do.While &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy&quot; is not the best introduction to the subject, it is a good, concise volume of work. As its intention was to be just that, it does its job well. There are better introductions available, but these are often much longer with ideas being developed in greater detail... something that while would be sought by a true student of the subject, might turn off those just looking for a surface exposure. The examinations are cursory at times, but this is again understandable considering the breadth of the subject in relation to the attempt to introduce as much as possible in a limited space, in simple terms.If you are choosing between the two...Buy &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy&quot; if you want an introduction to the subject.Buy &quot;Philosophy for Dummies&quot; if you want an introduction to Tom Morris.Actually... check out &quot;Thinking Through Philosophy&quot; - Horner and Westacott - Cambridge University Press. The format and organization of this book is different from the two spoken of above, feeling less &quot;rushed&quot; though still concise and accessible... and the style of introduction is good for both casual readers and those seeking to later move into a deeper study."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy (2nd Edition)","review":"A basic, no-frills introduction to the bottomless chasm of philosphy.

Therefore, in the search for self, I found this book and its principles to be most interesting. I acknowledge the other reviewers' points that the lives of philosophers relative to their individual beliefs are not adequately recorded, but I nonetheless strongly recommend this book for anyone who desires to learn of the many philosophies of others."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy (2nd Edition)","review":"I originally bought this book because I was supposed to supplement a creative writing class I was teaching with an occasional exploration of philosophy. I thought the book might present philosophy at a beginner's level that would make it interesting for my high school class. I never used it.This is a decent book though. I'm a little hesitant to applaud the author and recommend the book to just anyone. First, the author. Jay Stevenson does have a PhD, but not in philosophy. That worries me. Sure, he may know quite a bit about philosophy, I'm sure there are a lot of people without degrees in philosophy that know a lot about it, but why would The Complete Idiot's Guide people hire a non-PhD to write a book about philosophy when there are thousands of unemployed, professionally trained philosophers looking for work? Who knows. Maybe they thought Stevenson, whose credentials are in English, could do a better job getting his point across.Second, why I wouldn't recommend the book to just anyone. For two reasons. First, the writing is a little boring at times and for people that aren't interested in philosophy, this book probably won't suck you in and make you want to read it. Second, the philosophies are dumbed down almost to the point that it isn't really worth reading about them. The book turns into a nicely packaged dictionary with fun little explanations rather than a treatise on philosophy. But, what should we expect, right? This is, after all, The Complete Idiot's Guide. So, the book is boring and not a very detailed explanation of the philosophies that it attempts to discuss. However, for an introduction to someone that is interested but knows absolutely nothing, this book probably wouldn't be too bad a place to get ideas of where to look for more information.Overall, the book was semi-useful in exploring most philosophical perspectives but could have benefited from more depth in discussion of the philosophies and perhaps a history of philosophy (maybe even in some sort of graph-like form)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy (2nd Edition)","review":"Note that despite implications to the contrary, the Kindle version will not be the same as the paperback version sold through Amazon.

So I picked this one up at the airport with quite a lot of expectations, but was disappointed. None of the characters in the book has any real substance and do not feel like any real flesh-and-blood people and, consequently, I never got any real interest for them at all. The characters are more like rough outlines of characters and much to one-dimensional and simple to be credible. Compare with the characters in the E. Rawlin serie: \\"Mouse\\" is drawn with many complex and delicate features (just as a real person) and forms an actual person that you can actually can relate to, whereas Fearless Jones never feels like anything else but a rather crude scetch of a character in a novel and almost completely one-dimensional; you never get to know him at all.Further, Mosley's language is not at his best here either and far from his almost poetic and very intriguing language in books such as Devil in a blue dress. Lastly, the plot (which in my opinion never never have been Mosley's strongest side) is very complicated and does not really hold together logically either.So, all in all, skip this and read (or re-read) some of the earlier Easy Rawlin novels instead."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"This book is so well read by Don Cheadle, that plot and characters are secondary. I listen to mystery, crime or detective stories when I walk because they keep my attention and therefore keep me motivated. Mosely's stories blend just the right amount of intrigue with intelligence. This particular combination of narration and novel stuck the right balance."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"I'm still waiting for Walter Mosley to turn out a bad book. In this outing (Paris and Fearless's second) Mosley crafts a winding plot that keeps unfolding new surprises until the last few chapters. Paris Minton is an almost unique hero among the genre. He's an unmitigated coward. He's honorable and likeable, but fear often controls his life.FEAR ITSELF should please Mosley's legions of fans. Even the most ardent Easy fan should appreciate the characters and story here. A few characters from the Easy series make appearances here, or are mentioned.This wasn't Mosley's best work, but it is still one of the two or three best books I've read this year. I've read Lehane, Connelly, Leonard and more recently, but Mosley is clearly on top of the pile right now. He's on top of his game right now. The other stars of the genre are good, but Mosley is great. Probably the only guy that matches him is George Pelecanos."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"The return of Paris Minton and Fearless Jones is cause for rejoicing around this desk. Though it might be considered heresy in some circles, Minton is my favorite creation of Walter Mosley's. Yes, Easy Rawlins is certainly better known and more popular, and I will readily and happily concede that Rawlins deserves all the attention he gets. But...but...there are so many unique elements Minton possesses that he gets my nod. Maybe it's the fact that he's a short guy who likes to read...well, it's more than that, actually --- a lot more.FEAR ITSELF picks up where FEARLESS JONES left off, in the uneasy racial turbulence of Los Angeles in the 1950s. Minton has reopened his bookstore and, while not independently wealthy, is at least keeping his head above water. His life is quiet and he is content...at least until his friend Fearless Jones comes knocking. Jones, it soon develops, has inadvertently landed himself in trouble again, and he turns to his friend Minton for help. Minton and Jones make an unlikely but somehow realistic pair. Minton is well schooled and bookish, a veritable encyclopedia of unrelated but always useful facts. Jones is a graduate of the streets, an enigmatic individual with a quiet but stalwart courage and rumpled nobility that manifests itself in unusual but notable ways. Minton will go blocks out of his way to avoid trouble, but when Jones comes knocking he is unable to turn his friend away and soon finds himself involved in a set-to between two very different forces.The story starts off simply enough. An attractive woman, seemingly in distress, has asked Jones to find Kit Mitchell, a man who had briefly employed Jones for day labor and who is now missing. Jones starts making inquiries but soon finds himself to be the subject of some police inquiries. Jones, on the run, asks Minton to assist him in locating the man. It only takes a few hours, however, before a suspicious --- and dangerous-looking --- stranger is knocking on Minton's door, looking for Jones. Minton reluctantly becomes involved in Jones's inquiry and is soon caught between warring factions of two different worlds that are both jockeying for position in the lucrative gas station business in Los Angeles. Minton soon realizes that what was supposed to be a missing person matter now involves theft, kidnapping and murder --- and that he inadvertently possesses the key to resolving the situation.The plot of FEAR ITSELF is extremely challenging and complex; it is best to take this novel a bit at a time to avoid becoming lost in some of the machinations of the characters. The reading, however, is worth every minute. Mosley is quite simply at the top of his game here, contrasting two extremely interesting characters against the social and cultural backdrop of mid-20th century Los Angeles. And the ending, while extremely satisfying, has an element that will leave you who are blessed with hindsight groaning in sympathy for Minton and wanting to see more of him in future novels. This is one not to be missed.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"Walter Mosely is well-known and well-regarded for his prolific production of hard-boiled detective novels in the Raymond Chandler style depicting black L.A.. In this book, his narrator, Paris Minton and his friend Fearless Jones, take us on a plot-filled ride through Watts in the 1950's. The plot is a little too jammed and ridiculous --- Chandler would take twice as many pages for half as many twists --- but who cares. It keeps the pages turning, and wan't so much that I couldn't keep track. More importantly, the book had a couple of substantial virtues. First, the African-American perspective. That alone makes it worth the read. Mosely sets the ominous, everpresent undertone of oppression and danger--a lurking presence of racial memory and experience--with just the right touch, it seemed to this reader. It is a quiet buzz. There is joy and sadness, but the buzz is always there. Second, there is the division of traits between the two best-friend protagonists, who need each other and bring out each other's best. One is brave, the other fearful. One is generous, the other guarded,if not selfish. One plans and, as a result, has resources, the other not. One is bright and sees beyond the obvious, the other is simple. One relates to people, the other to knowledge. They are, really, competing sides of a single person, but Moseley's decision to divide them into two people allows closer inspection of the archetypes and where different aspects of our personality, motives, and actions reside. Very nicely done."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"This is another great Fearless Jones book -- Mosley shows here once again he is capable of creating some of the best characters in crime fiction."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"This works both as engrossing mystery with a pair of engaging characters.

A black man in LA, owner of a bookstore, he keeps to himself for the most part, unless he's tied up with his best friend Tristan \\"Fearless\\" Jones. One night Fearless knocks on his door, when Paris hears, the knock he hears trouble. Though his friend lives as his name says, Paris is a polar opposite. On this particular night, Fearless tells his Paris that a woman, Leora and her child Son need help finding her husband Kit Mitchell, the \\"watermelon man\\", whom Fearless has worked for. Fearless is a principled man and cannot say no to a woman with a crying child. He lets his friend know that he needs his help in finding this man. Little do either of them know that finding Kit Mitchell, will be the least of their worries. A little mentioned murder a woman named Minna Wexler becomes part of a string of murders that Paris and Fearless happen upon.Through police harassments, attempts on their lives, dealings with the white elite (Maestro Wexler), the black elite (Winifred Fine) and a series of lowlifes, crazies and down on their luck folks leads them in directions that they had not though of before. Both intelligent in seemingly different ways, the team of Fearless Jones and Paris Minton get way more than they bargain for but working together are able to get through an increasing difficult task.In this Fearless Jones mystery, Walter Moseley shows why he is one of the great writers of our time. The stories he tells of friendship and the trouble that comes with it are timeless. He shows us, in the case of Fearless and Paris that two heads are better than one."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"This is Walter Mosley's second Fearless Jones novel. Somehow I missed the first. The premise of the book is that the narrator is a bookstore owner from Watts named Paris Minton. Tristan \\"Fearless\\" Jones is his friend and sometime partner. The current book is set in mid-50s Los Angeles, the setting that made Mosley his reputation with the Easy Rawlins series. Fear Itself is apparently Mosley's path back to where he enjoys setting his stories the most: pre-Civil Rights movement LA.In Fear Itself, Paris is awakened in the middle of the night, first by Fearless, then by a mysterious man looking for Fearless. Paris is suspicious of white guys banging on his door at three in the morning, so he lies and says he doesn't know where Fearless is. Soon, the two men are on the hunt for various people among the black neighborhoods of LA, tripping over dead bodies of rich white people, and getting shot at by that mysterious fellow, who's apparently pretty homicidal.

Paris and Fearless are likable. There is a bit of charm mixed in with the wimp and the macho. Supporting characters are convincing but not especially vivid.Walter Mosley's tempo is even with a few points of anxiety. His sense of humor generates a smile here and there but not gut-laughs.The impact of the racial stuff is a personal thing. There's nothing new here but, for me, it is relevant and compelling.Don Cheadle is a good story teller.

It was very suspenseful with some interesting characters and a tense plot.

Fearless, aptly named, has a soft side for women in trouble, so when a woman asks him to find her husband, a man Fearless has been working for, he enlists Paris' help.Paris shudders at the thought, but his big friend brings out the courage in him - \\"being friends with him was like having one of God's second cousins as a pal\\" - and besides, a white man shows up looking for Fearless. \\"I needed to know if my friend's problems were going to spill over onto me.\\"Mosley writes a well-plotted mystery, full of twists and murders and double crossings, but within the mystery framework he explores nuances of character and the ways black people get by in the white people's world. Inarticulate, dangerous Fearless, living day-to-day, is a generous, principled man with an uncanny ability to read people, while Paris, the literate one, fights a craven, selfish streak. Paris is reflective though, and while not always proud of himself, he knows what he can live with.The plot takes us through the alleys and backstreets of LA, to bail bondsmen, aggressive cops and LA's wealthiest black businesswoman who has suffered a robbery so devastating she won't talk about it.

Before he knows it, he agrees to assist Fearless in his quest to help a damsel in distress. It does not take long for Paris to discover himself waist deep in drama and neck deep in trouble.

Add murder, lies and deceit to the plot and you have a delightfully exciting story.Walter Mosley did not disappoint. I found this book to be exciting and outfitted with several unexpected turns of events throughout the plot. I did, however, find Paris' personality a bit distracting. For instance, Paris consistently referred to himself as a coward, yet he knowingly jumped head first into danger throughout the book. Although this proved a bit distracting, it was not overly so. I found the book to be paced well and the characters interesting.If you're looking for an exciting mystery, pick up a copy of &quot;Fear Itself.&quot; Mosley does not disappoint.T.

Fearless always brings trouble and this time is no exception. Fearless is looking for the father of a little boy--but the search soon turns up murder. Even more dangerous for an African-American in 1950s Watts, the murdered people are white.As Paris and Fearless investigate, it seems that everyone wants to give Paris money. He's not opposed to money, but he's wise enough to know that money comes with strings attached--enough string to hang him.Author Walter Mosley provides a telling look into the racism and fear that constituted Los Angeles in the 1950s and that still prevades much of society. Paris, the narrator, makes a convincing character. He is fearful, small, and greedy. Fearless, in contrast, is, uh, fearless. Paris likes to think of himself as much smarter than Fearless, but his smarts lands him in trouble while Fearless's inate honesty keeps him (mostly) safe. Of course it doesn't hurt either of them that Fearless is fast with his hands and can't remember losing a fight.FEAR ITSELF has something of a film-noire quality. There are enough characters and suspects that it's easy to get confused but the strong narrative and stronger characters kept me entranced. FEAR is a sequel to FEARLESS JONES but stands completely separate and can be read independently. This is a highly professional and enjoyable work. Mosley's writing is compelling and smooth.

He spins these tales with style and never ever makes a mistake with the time period. From language to cars to clothes he makes sure the time period is represented to the fullest.

I wish Mr. Mosley put out 4 books a year."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"This book makes you want to take a time machine so you can taste black Los Angeles in the 1950s. It makes you crave the moldy smell of fine second hand books, and envy the life of Paris, a bookstore-owning man who spends a great deal of time studying his own wares. Paris Minton, short on physical courage, long on curiosity, is half of the mystery solving duo -- Fearless Jones, as good hearted as Mosley's other brave character Mouse is bad, is the other half. Both are drawn into a puzzle, replete with Black and white dead bodies. The characters of Mosley's books people historic Los Angeles with sound and fury.Here's a bit of what I like about this book. Paris is inclined to take fright and flight. In the midst of the mystery, in the early morning hours, he hears a knock at his door, and unlike Mosley's other protagonists, Easy, Mouse or Fearless he instinctively runs out his backdoor \\"like a six-year-old.\\" He is convinced that \\"who but Trouble could be knocking at my door that early in the morning?

In 1955, things are still quiet, although the inhabitants of this Los Angeles suburb are cautious in the extreme in any encounters with the white man. The people of Watts understand that there are severe consequences for every action, generally circumspect in public behavior, avoiding unnecessary conflict with those in authority. Every Sunday, the churches ring with song when parishioners sing of deliverance and redemption.Enter Paris Minton, a used bookstore owner and admitted coward, mostly content to remain ensconced within his world of words. When Fearless Jones coming knocking one night, asking for help in tracking down Kit Mitchell, Paris happily agrees. He has his reasons. For one thing, the usually timid Paris is imbued with a sense of empowerment in the presence of Fearless, an ex-soldier capable of expedient violence, but restrained by common sense and integrity. Fearless' physical prowess ensures Paris' safety, having come in handy on more than one occasion. Something about his friend allows the usually timid Paris to stand a little taller, a bit more of a man.The police have Fearless in their sights, for &quot;questioning&quot;, so Paris does the footwork necessary to unravel the mystery, secure in the knowledge that Fearless is close behind. As their search for Mitchell progresses, Paris' personal danger increases and dead bodies cause unwanted complications in unraveling the mystery. At the heart of it all: a stolen heirloom, a priceless slave journal and enough money to attract crooks from miles around.Mosley's multi-layered plot abounds with unpredictable twists and turns. The author's particular appeal lies in the lively dialog of a fabulous assortment of eccentric characters. Paris' literate approach balances perfectly with Fearless' street-wise charm, allowing the well-educated Paris an adventurous romp on the dark side of the street. The inspired pairing of the intrepid Fearless Jones and the refined demeanor of Paris Minton, will doubtless garner even more Mosley fans, as they anticipate the next adventure of the unlikely duo. Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"Fear Itself wonderfully lives up to the superb quality of Fearless Jones, which began this series. If you haven't read Fearless Jones, I recommend reading that book first.Fearless Jones is the finest new mystery I have read in decades. Its qualities place it alongside classics like The Maltese Falcon, while its deep exploration of human nature causes it to transcend the mystery genre. The story's subtle psychology reminds me of an ancient Greek drama. This book represents a new peak in the imagination and the writing of the immensely talented Mr. Walter Mosley. You have a rare treat in store. Start this book early in the day. You probably won't want to put it down.Like the frozen expressions on Greek tragedians' masks, Fearless Jones considers three kinds of human motivation: The self-interested satisfaction of the senses; the rational mind assembling the pieces of a puzzle; and good character that comes the heart. The narration builds from the rational mind and conveys all of the classic elements of the best noir mysteries. Mosley's point is that good character will naturally triumph because of the finer emotions and responses it will evoke in others. I suspect that you will agree with him, and feel uplifted by this tale despite the plot's pathway through many dark alleys of depravity.Few writers can take you inside the mind and body of the characters like Mr. Mosley. In both Fearless Jones and Fear Itself, you will think and feel along with Paris Minton, the owner of a used bookstore in Watts in the mid-1950s. Minton is a largely self-educated black man from Louisiana who came to California to find libraries that were open to all. His store's books are discards from local libraries. He has achieved a fragile kind of peaceful life, living and working in his bookstore (and reading when there are no customers, which is often).His friend, Fearless Jones, is the archetype of the medieval knight errant . . . always looking to do a good deed. In Fear Itself, Fearless (Tristan) Jones wakes Paris up in the middle of the night because Fearless has promised to help a woman Fearless had never met before, Leora Hartman, who was holding the hand of a three year-old who was crying his eyes out. A World War II hero, the two met when Minton spontaneously bought Jones a drink during the post-war celebration. \\"He appreciated my generosity and gave me a lifetime of friendship for a single shot of scotch.\\" As you can see, Mr. Mosley writes like an angel.The book revolves around a missing farmer from Wayne, Texas, Kit Mitchell, who has been hiring Fearless to distribute his watermelons. The mystery soon adds more missing people and items, and other people who want to pay Paris and Fearless to find whatever is missing. However, people are more willing to pay than to describe what they are supposed to be looking for. Whatever it is, it's dynamite!The story reminds me The Big Sleep in a positive way.No review of this book would be complete without observing that Mr. Mosley again demonstrates an unbelievable ability for capturing the black experience in Southern California in the post-war period. He has an equally uncanny skill for weaving a personalized view of that vulnerable, hopeful footing into the fabric of the overall society during those years. I think that Fear Itself is his most imaginative work in this regard. He adds richness to black heritage in an unforgettable and intriguing way. As much as I enjoyed the story, these heritage elements overshadowed the mystery completely.After you finish reading the book, I suggest that think back to the many moments of spontaneous kindness in the story. How did you feel when you read them? How would you feel if someone behaved in this way towards you? When was the last time that you offered the fullness of your heart's purest motives to a stranger or near-stranger? How would you feel if you did so more often? Who are you? Who could you be? Who do you want to be?Live beyond your fears and your desires . . . and be free!"},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"In 1955 Los Angeles, Leora Hartman hires Fearless Jones to find Kit Mitchell, the father of her son, who simply vanished. Though the case seems quite simple, finding someone who appears to have just moved on, Fearless quickly concludes he needs some intellectual help and who better than a book lover would suffice? So he enlists his friend, book seller Paris Minton to help him.However, the easy queries that his mousy friend makes soon prove perilous as everyone including the client lie and are willing to use, even perhaps kill, Fearless and Paris. Others have vanished too with the sleuthing duo learning they, including Kit, are probably all dead. The dynamic pair (at least one dynamo and one passive) soon finds themselves as part of the focus of a war between local VIPs, a cosmetics queen and a developer, which also makes Fearless and Paris important to LAPD.Have no fear, FEAR ITSELF is a great historical mystery that not only brings to life pre- Dodger LA, but does so inside an exciting who-done-it. Though perhaps the novel has too much subterfuge (and consequently subplots), the keys to this terrific tale are the lead detectives. Fearless lives up to his name, as he is somewhat like many of the genre's hard boiled types. However, Paris brings freshness by not being a superhero preparing to break steel with his teeth. Instead he is an intelligent individual so frightened with the threats to his well being and from what he has learned about the affluent, fans including those in Brooklyn, will feel at home with him even if Johnny Padres is winning the subway series a continent away.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fear Itself: A Fearless Jones Novel","review":"Los Angeles, 1955. Paris Minton is a retiring and none too courageous owner of a tiny bookstore. Fearless Jones is his best friend, but whenever he appears trouble is sure to follow. Milo Sweet is a conniving, double-dealing bail bondsman and disbarred lawyer. Kit Mitchell is missing. That's where the trouble starts, for it seems everyone is looking for Kit, and looking for him turns out to be extremely dangerous. And there are many, many more characters--the eccentric, the mad, the wealthy, the warm-hearted, the wicked.Things go from strange to dangerous to deadly as Paris and Fearless navigate the web of deceit and double-crossing spun by the characters. So, what is the big secret everyone's looking for? Who is Kit Mitchell and why does everyone want to find him? Will Paris, the fearful book-lover, survive this dangerous web of intrigue?Author Walter Mosley is a brilliant writer with a unique African-American voice. If the story doesn't make complete sense, if the plot doesn't quite hang together, if the characters are hard to keep track of, well, who cares? You can just listen to this book as if you were listening to jazz. It just rolls right along from one outrageous complication to another. The sentences, the words, the scenes, the dialogue--unbelievably good. I recommend this book, but, don't try to hard to follow the plot. Just listen to it! Reviewed by Louis N.

I purchased this book on unabridged audio while on a business trip, and soon lost all bearings on the road. Don Cheadle is a masterful reader, combining the many voices seamlessly on CD. The audio quality is superb. We are taken through many eccentric characters, including Paris Minton, the first. Fearless Jones, his best friend and co-conspirator in his adventures, is a man expertly skilled in the art of survival in racist Los Angeles in 1955. I won't divulge the plot, but their adventures take them into the world of black wealth and white criminals. It is Mr. Moseley's mix of humor-Paris's self-professed weaknesses-with a labyrinthine plot that kept me listening for the many hours required. In the couple of months since I purchased the book I have listened to it again, simply for the pleasure of Mr. Cheadle's voice.

Wanting to help his friend Fearless initially motivates Paris, but finding that a voice of the past is more important to the future than money, he is determined to follow this odyssey to the end.The characters are well structured and realistic; and the attitudes towards race in the early fifties is right on.

I've always been fond of this writers' talent and gift but the reciting presented by Mr. D. Cheadle made it that much more thrilling.

It makes you crave the moldy smell of fine second hand books, and envy the life of Paris, a bookstore-owning man who spends a great deal of time studying his own wares. Paris Minton, short on physical courage, long on curiosity, is half of the mystery solving duo -- Fearless Jones, as good hearted as Mosley's other brave character Mouse is bad, is the other half. Both are drawn into a puzzle, replete with Black and white dead bodies. The characters of Mosley's books people historic Los Angeles with sound and fury.Here's a bit of what I like about this book. Paris is inclined to take fright and flight. In the midst of the mystery, in the early morning hours, he hears a knock at his door, and unlike Mosley's other protagonists, Easy, Mouse or Fearless he instinctively runs out his backdoor \\"like a six-year-old.\\" He is convinced that \\"who but Trouble could be knocking at my door that early in the morning?

He has met a woman who is in search of her missing husband and the father of her son. Because he feels sorry for the mother and child Fearless begs Paris to work on the case with him.

In this, the second book in the series, he comes off as a whiney, frightened, and weak individual. I lost interest in the book (and the mystery) about half-way through. The character of Fearless Jones is one of those confident, self-assured, but marginalized main characters that appears as \\"mean,\\" \\"threatening,\\" and a \\"killer\\" when in fact he's gentle, kind, bright, and giving. I thought the mystery was convoluted and to be honest, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. I also had problems with the structure and execution of the story. For example, I didn't believe for a minute that Paris just \\"happens\\" to find that manuscript where and when he did. It seemed like a cheap plot device. That said, I did enjoy the passages from that manuscript. THAT would have made a better story.Perhaps I'm not that bright, but when it was over I kept asking myself: \\"The point of this was...?

Paris Minton is a riff on the 'Jackson Blue'(?), genius, cowardly, burglar who stole Jesus's savings character from Easy Rawlin's with a dash of Mosley himself.I think the author needs to decide, which series to go forward with.

At the home she meets a handsome imposing guy who involves her and several new friends in recreating pagan rituals rumored to have taken place on the grounds centuries ago.

Harold demands secrecy from Amos because he fears that he won't regain the stolen item if the loss becomes public. Amos agrees to remain silent though he knew about the robbery from hearing about it on the streets. On Christmas Eve, Harold left the valuable pages inside a locked cabinet. By the next morning, someone stole the nine-page document. The criminal returned one page accompanied by a ransom demand for one-hundred thousand dollars with the swap to occur in a local porno theater.In the theater, Harold waits for the appointment in the front row while Amos sits a few rows behind him. All hell breaks loose around Amos. By the time things calm down, Harold and the cash are missing. The case already was personal due to the identify of the prime suspect, but now Amos' honor requires he continue with inquiries that will lead him into the ugly side of professional world of art.Though his thirteenth tale, Amos Walker remains one of the more intelligent and vigorous private detective series on the market today. Amos continues to excel as a throwback to the hard boiled detectives of the Golden Age, who valued honor above all else. The support cast augments the entertaining story line of THE HOURS OF THE VIRGIN by bringing Detroit alive through their eccentric personalities. The story line never eases off the accelerator as Loren D. Estleman continues to pay homage to the Motor City with this pleasurable novel that will bring new fans seeking his old novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hours of the Virgin (The Amos Walker Series #14)","review":"One wonders what the city fathers of Detroit think about Loren D. Estleman. His vision of the city, as seen through the jaundiced eye of Amos Walker, private investigator, is nearly uniformly morose, a city on the greased skids to palookaville, a one-hit wonder whose 15 minutes has been over for an hour and a half.But like the city, the Motor City investigator keeps on trucking in the 13th novel of this highly praised series. Walker agrees to help a curator at the Detroit Institute of Arts to help recover a recently stolen medieval illuminated manuscript. But the meeting at a rundown porn theater is interrupted when Walker is distractedby a young woman, then shot at. When the smoke clears, the woman, the manuscript and the curator have all disappeared.While tracking down the leads, Walker is also following a trail into his past. Twenty years ago, Dale Leopard, his boss and mentor, was found dead while on a case, and Earl North, the man who beat the charge, has reappeared, seeking the manuscript. Is there a connection between the murder and the Hours? Did North really kill Leopard?Estleman writes like an aria; his prose sings with metaphors and observations that strike just the right note. He's been around long enough so that comparing him to Dashielle Hammett and Raymond Chandler isn't an original thought, but it's true and it'll have to do. He gives Detroit its unique identity of a crumbling and crooked but proud city trying to find itself."},{"Title":"The Hours of the Virgin (The Amos Walker Series #14)","review":"As usual, Mr. Estelman does not disapoint. I turned to this book after a real stinker and I was well rewarded. Mr. Estlemen is a great mystery writer for a number of reasons. He's a master with the hardboiled writing. He's prolific (at least one mystery per year). He's good. The last mystery I had read, by another author, I figured out in chapter three. This one held me to the end and it also made me laugh. I think this is an excellent read for mysteryphiles and non-mysteryphiles alike. His writing is pure poetry."},{"Title":"The Hours of the Virgin (The Amos Walker Series #14)","review":"This is the 13th Amos Walker mystery. Walker, a private eye in Detroit, is a throw-back to the 1930's - complete with fedora, cigarettes and whiskey - and reminiscent of both Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade - hard working, keen observer, perpetual smart-ass and bound to his own morality. The Walker books also resemble Chandler's and Hammett's works in that they are multi-layered mysteries - the original case becoming secondary by the conclusion. That being said the series is much more than a cheap knock-off or imitation, the books stand on their own and are well-written and engaging.The Hours of the Virgin is all of this with a plot-line very similar to The Maltese Falcon. Amos is hired by an art curator to find a stolen religious manuscript and before the reader can say, \\"... the stuff dreams are made of\\", Walker finds himself embroiled in blackmail, adultery, the porn industry and the unsolved 20-year old murder of his former partner. Battling the flu, an attempt on his life and a multitude of lies, Amos forges ahead until he gets to the bottom of the case he was hired for - even if it isn't what he expected.If you are a fan of hard-boiled PI mysteries, complex plots, great characters and witty and sarcastic protagonists - you won't be disappointed with this book or series. No need to read them in chronological order."},{"Title":"The Hours of the Virgin (The Amos Walker Series #14)","review":"For a dozen previous novels, P.I. Amos Walker would occasionally mention the death of his former partner and mentor, who was killed during a stakeout of an adulterous husband. But not until &quot;The Hours of the Virgin,&quot; do we find out just how much that tragic event affected him. Walker is investigating a case involving a missing fifteenth century manuscript when he is double crossed and disciovers that his partner's murderer is involved. Along the way, Walker learns much about his partner's death, and life, that he never knew. All of this leads to a satisfying climax in which Walker finally confronts some of his own inner demons.Estlemen's Walker P.I. series is one of the best currently going. Unlike a lot of the fluff that passes for hard boiled detective novels these days, Walker is the real deal. All of his novels have the kind of downcast loneliness that is vital to the genre. The spirit of Phillip Marlowe lives on in Amos Walker."},{"Title":"The Hours of the Virgin (The Amos Walker Series #14)","review":"Amos Walker, an alcohol-guzzling embittered Detroit Private investigator has a new case: protect a man who is paying ransom for the retrieval of a valuable illuminated text called: Hours of the Virgin.

In this 'episode,' Amos must confront some ghosts from his past, and make some hard choices.While I like the Amos Walker series, I keep hoping for Amos to have some FURTHER character development. Sometimes his inability to find a woman, and his habits (alcohol and cigarettes), are a little over-done. Must Amos attempt to smoke in every possible unacceptable place? I.E.: The art institute, the library, the massage parlor, and the Green House? And do we really need this to be described /Every/ time?

No love, just self-affirmation and a perpetuation of the feeling of entitlement that this &quot;lost&quot; generation is so often encouraged to foster.The book does have some valuable, useful information, but it is in many ways in a vacuum... peppered with photos of pop icons does not make this a warm, fuzzy guide and it can be coma-inducing if you try to read it cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"&quot;The Royals&quot; is not the fascinating read it could have been.

For good or ill (and frankly, I'd put the Royal lot against a wall and aim....) they are not kings of England,and haven't been since 1707, they are kings of Britain, and that includes Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.Although the Windsors should take note that Scotland and Wales recently opted for devolution, so the future of the British crown is hopefully a little shakier.And it's not just royal garbage rakers who make this mistake - it's really commonplace,even in heavy-weight academic work. So please, remember, we aren't all English.Oh, and incidentally, the Georges all spoke English. They abandoned German fairly quickly. Even the George who was preparing to flee from Bonnie Price Charlie. Who was a Scot. Shouldn't someone have taught Kitty a little more history ?"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I can not understand the english people putting up with these royals. They are sleazy humiliating and rotton acting people with little sense. No wonder so many english people came to america. How much of the book is true who really cares. It was fun reading a book where the royals got smashed but good"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and it's look at the British Royal Family. I love the way that Kelley did this book and extremely enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"To anyone with a serious interest in recent British history, absolutely avoid this book like the plague. The author lost me in the first chapter when she depicts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on their famous and important visit to Washington DC in June of 1939, as living a life of lavish abandon while their subjects suffered wartime privation at home.Too bad the war didn't start till September, Ms. Kelley!After this outright lie, written for no other reason than to blacken the characters involved and tell an \\"interesting\\" story, needless to say, it was impossible to take anything else the author had to say very seriously. This book is meant for the readers of \\"the National Enquirer\\", and anyone else to whom such trivial things as dates and correct chronology of events are not important. Is it any wonder that publication was banned in the United Kingdom and this rag is to be found on the twenty five cent reject shelf?Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kelley's style is absolutely tabloid-esque but if what she's saying is true, then it's true. I don't get the whole cult of royal worship and never have. The peoples of the United Kingdom financially support the Queen so she can supposedly be better than they are? What's that about? In HM's defense, even under Kelley's scathing microscope, she comes across as a morally honest person who does the duty into which she was born. If only those around her were as circumspect, then there might be kinder things to say about the family some bitingly refer to as Britain's richest welfare-recipients. My favorite bit of gossip--and mean-spirited gossip IS pretty much all this alleged tell-all offers--was the little ditty about how Princess Elizabeth, currently Her Majesty the Queen, had to have her dresses let out several times during WWII due to her pudginess, even though the Times daily reported the menus of meals at Buckingham Palace that would have loyal Englishmen believe the royals were suffering right along with their countrymen on cabbage soup and other such rationed wartime fare.Oh, please!The royal family of Great Britain are human beings and no more or less perfect at heart than anyone else. I read nothing here to make me think they are immoral and nothing to make me think for even one fleeting second that they are in any way superior to the average man or woman on the street.As for Kitty Kelley, don't you ever say anything nice about the subjects of your mean-spirited books? I wonder how your life would read if given the dumpster diving reveal-your-secrets treatment you give others?"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This book starts out as a sort of 'Hollywood Babylon' of the Royal Family, with some of the grubbier details of their pre-war family life being revealed. For example, she claims that the Queen Mother was artificially inseminated, and that Prince Philip - or Phil the Greek, to his loyal subjects - ran a string of mistresses. It's all highly entertaining, and very revealing of the selfish, narcissistic mindset of the Royals - even if a few of the details are a bit shaky, the way they act seems to ring true. It's no surprise that they took out a court order to stop this book being published in the UK.Unfortunately the second half of the book is taken over by the twin marital disasters of Princesses Diana and Sarah Ferguson, and rather declines into recycled tabloid stories and below-stairs gossip. Still, it is nice to see these collcted into one sort-of coherent narrative.It is a pity that Kelley doesn't seem interested in delving into the stories a bit more deeply. For instance, we are told that a gentleman with a radio scanner just happened to chance upon, and record, intimate conversations between Princess Diana and one of her paramours - is this really credible, or were her telephone conversations being monitored (probably either by the police Special Branch or MI5) as she claimed? Don't forget the same thing happened to Prince Charles - UK citizens will remember the Squidgygate tapes with affection! Random chance, or something more sinister?It's also a pity that she doesn't deal with Prince Edward having to resign from the Royal Marines after a few weeks, or his less than glorious career with Andrew Lloyd Webber's production company - now we'll never know if he progressed beyond being the office tea-boy! I suppose, though, that the American audience this book is primarily aimed at wouldn't have been very interested in this relatively minor Royal.All in all, this is a long way from being a serious history of the Royal Family. That doesn't mean it's a bad book, however. While undeniably trashy, it's just the thing if you fancy a good dose of schadenfreude, or an insight into the decline of the public's esteem and respect for the Windsors.For those UK readers who don't have access to the US edition through a helpful friend or relative, try eBay or ABEbooks. eBay worked for me..."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kitty Kelley's books are pretty much all the same--gossipy, tabloid-style writing--but they are fun to read. Some of the theories that she puts across in the book are so outlandish that you wonder if you're not *really* reading one of the tabloids! If you like reading about the Royal Family, and aren't too serious, you'll probably enjoy it. As for the authenticity of what she writes...well, I'll leave that for you to decide!"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"While one should grieve Lady Diana's death, her death is no more catastrophic than that of the thousands of people whose vibrant lives are abruptly cut short in road accidents every year. While one should sympathize with her sons and her family, nobility and royalty do not make the loss of a loved one any greater than that felt by any other family who experience similar tragedy. And to those who would lead us to believe that the Royal Family have suffered enough, I say that they have been the primary source of their own problems and were, in many cases, those of Diana, Princess of Wales. As for stricter libel laws, I beg to differ; for the tabloid press would not be quite so prolific in the UK were libel laws so much tougher than American ones. Finally, Ms. Kelly is quite far from Jane Austen in style and finesse (as are most American writers), yet to scream &quot;bloody boycott&quot; out of respect for people whom one will never meet, and who, I might add, do not give the slightest &quot;hoot&quot; about any American commoner, is just as &quot;bombastically ludicrous&quot; as Ms Kelly's style. A more valid reason for not reading her book would be that she lacks style or that it is just plain drivel. I, for one, intend - despite Ms Kelly's simple, puerile, very Amercian &quot;tabloidesque&quot; style and despite the undignified nature of the book - to keep a copy on hand in my WC for myself and for all those who may come calling. Good drivel can be relaxing and most humorous"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I adore this book. I love that much of its contents has been so obviously made-up. I particularly love that Kelley invents conversations between people (eg. the Queen (age 6) discussing affairs of state with an even more juvenile Princess Margaret - I mean, give me a break!). I love the little anecdotes that just make you smile (the Queen Mum being inseminated by a turkey baster is my personal favourite).Does this give you a taster for the most celebrated piece of Faction of the 1990s? I read this during my lunch-break when my day gets a little too boring and I need to day-dream... catch my drift?"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kitty Kelley would make a great gossip columnist, but as a biographer or historian she is absolutely awful.She seems unaware that when King George IV and his wife Elizabeth visited North America World War II had not yet started. She also seems confused about when Churchill became Prime Minister. If she fails with these basic facts that can be found in any history book, how reliable can the rest of her information be?"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I can't review this book because in the UK I cannot buy it. I don't know what's supposed to be so special about it to merit such treatment. No doubt it contains it's share of errors.I just want to appeal to Americans in particular to please stop complimenting us British on our monarchy. The monarchy is not cute and it's not quaint. It is archaic, oppressive and suppressive of our development as a modern democratic nation. You are proud of your republic and would never tolerate a monarchy in your own country, nor would you tolerate the suppression of books which are critical of your President.Many of us here in the UK wish to have a modern republican form of government, as other countries in Europe already have. We need it desperately. Please give us your support. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I looked at the thickness of this book and hesitated to start reading it because I am a slow reader. But I was unable to put it down once I did start to read it. I was enthralled by Kitty Kelley's method of putting words together and making them exciting. It is truly a page-turner. I finished reading it in three days. Kitty's writing is riveting and she doesn't tease - she digs deep to tell the whole story. I love her writing and just ordered two more of her biographies. If you are interested in the subjects she writes about, you won't be disappointed with this book.JoAnn S. Evans"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kitty Kelley writes a fun and readable book. Don't know how much is true and how much is exaggerated, but I give her credit, she does seem to have a great many references. I have read several of her books and always find them well written and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"In her usual fashion, Kitty Kelley has skewered another target. Kitty is at her bitchy best since the Nancy Reagan book. Truths, Half-truths, innuendo or \\"urban legend\\", the book is a dishy smorgasbord on the Royal Family. Some fare better than others, but a few like the \\"Queen Mum\\" get a pretty good flogging. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor story essentially revealed nothing new, and stories of Prince Philip's and Princess Margaret's peccadillos are already well known. I won't reveal any of the more juicy parts as spoilers, but suffice it to say it's all here, from sexual ambiguities to questionable parentages and politics. An epilogue and afterword since Princess Diana's death are included. It's easy to see why it is \\"Banned in Britain\\". I give it \\"Two Thumbs Up\\"."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"supplies little known facts about one of the most famous families in history and I can see why England did nnot want it sold in the country."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I read this book because I like gossip about people I don't really have to feel that sorry for - and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for the Royal Family of England (with exception of Princess Di who didn't deserve what she signed on for).This book succeeds because while it gives all the gossip that one could ask for, it's never salacious and tawdry - even when describing tawdry events. Kitty Kelley's strength is she plays it pretty straight, and sticks to newspaper accounts and descriptions from interviews. So it's not like an over-the-top National Enquirer account.There is no question that there are factual errors or deliberate untruths in the book - probably not deliberate from Kelley, but from those she talked to. Without question, sources are burning off grudges and telling stories that cannot truly be confirmed. So you can't read this and assume every word is absolutely true. I couldn't point to any story that strikes me as simply unbelievable, but I take a lot of the anonymous accounts with a grain of salt.But so what? You're not reading this because you want a doctorate in English studies. You want gossip and a lot of it, and this provides plenty.I think it helps the book that it was written before Di's tragic death. Since that event does not loom over the narrative, it never seems too cruel, nor does it need to foreshadow. Really, it describes the Royal Family at their lowest, most unsympathetic point, but the reader knows that they will manage to redeem themselves in the years ahead. So it's rare to get a nonfiction account that actually stops right before the most significant event - meaning we can focus on the minutia without worrying whether it 'matters' or not. Kelley worked with what she had - which was a family of cretins in a lot of ways, who had yet to suffer their worst days.I liked it. It's actually a little too dry at times, but that's to Kelley's credit as a very businesslike author, not a melodramatic scold. It took me longer to read than most books because of all the different sources and recollections but it was also easy to follow and I was never confused.Historical fact? No. But it is a look behind the curtains, with enough legitimacy so a reader knows that some version of all these events probably did happen, even if it's not truly 100 percent accurate on these pages."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Well written. Fascinating content. As usual, Kitty Kelly delivers.An easily read book containing a good background in history, but well written as a novel."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This is s great gossip book sprinkled with truths about the royals. We the public will never really know what went on in the royal family but this is close enough. I was surprised about their lack of education but who needs it when you've got millions of dollars and a well respected name or royal name. The writing lacks a certain inspiring fervor but the juicy tidbits replace that. Aside from some inbreeding, a monster gene, alcoholism, infidelity, low intelligence, they are much like many families already on the planet.The Royals get the most fanfare in Great Britain but this could change too. I can't see them storming Buckingham Palace like the Bastille but it is a thought maybe around 2110. However for now it will give a lot of background on the recent royal family and why Prince Charles will never be King."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"It's a good read, but it's obvious that Ms. Kelley has bought into the woe-is-me victimization ploy used by the former Princess of Wales that nearly brought down the British monarchy. Being an American, I admit to a certain curiosity and wonder when thinking of the Royals. I was almost seventeen when the former Princess of Wales was killed in Paris and while I was sad for the humanitarian and mother who had been in over her head with the royal establishment, I boasted no particular affinity for a woman whose face had saturated every tabloid paper for nearly a decade before that.Ms. Kelley has a style of writing that's very easy to get through, but once I got through it (having thoroughly enjoyed the experience as well), I found myself with questions as to sources. Ms. Kelley is obviously no fan of the Royal Family, aside from the afore-mentioned Princess of Wales and though she did occasionally refer to Diana's dark side (her continuing vindictiveness toward her ex-husband, her blatant ploys to turn her sons against their father, insinuating that Prince Charles is not fit to be King, her behavior to anyone who dared to call her out on her attention-whoring ways, her treatment of her stepmother following her father's death), she never once deviated from the erroneous supposition that the Princess of Wales was somehow \\"driven\\" to that level of vindictiveness in her private life.It was a very well-done, very enjoyable piece of historical fiction, emphasis on the fiction."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kitty Kelly collected anecdotes about the Windsors, drawing on everyone who hated them. I bet she got most of the info from the guys who created the \\"Spitting Image\\" series.Kitty Kelly's books are great if you like cheap gossip at the National Inquirer level, and are a little too smart for the Weakly World News. Read this if you're stuck in an airport during a snowstorm."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"If you ever wondered about how human the \\"Monarchy\\" of the U.K. is, here's a great answer. Imagine letting your close cousins die because of the inconvenience, changing your family name to avoid prejudice, and redefining what \\"integrity\\" means with \\"Because I said so.\\"Wow- so good to be a mortal in the world and not a figurehead. Perhaps King William, if U.K. survives, will prove to be enlightened and not end up a social/party figure like so many descendants of the former European Royal Families."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This is fun and gossipy.

The stories are probably all true. I'm glad my tax dollars don't support them. The royals are rude, arrogant and out of touch with real life and real people. They need to cut their lifestyle in 1/2 and remember they're &quot;for the people&quot; and start working for their privileges (maybe we Americans are still revolutionists at heart?). Of course they don't want it published in Britain. It would bring force them to answer for their actions. A definite read for anyone who loves the royals or stories of the rich."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This book is not a biography but a book-length tabloid of the House of Windsor. The Windsors may be all the negatives that Kitty Kelley reports them to be but people, even royals, are rarely without positive attributes. Tabloid writers aren't interested in the positives or in accuracy, and neither is Kitty Kelley. Ms. Kelley is neither a scholar nor a biographer. Her book is tabloid journalism--full of innuendo and mistakes. Still, one can say this book is a good overview of the worst there is to know about the Windsors. I'd only hope that readers of this book would go on to read other books for a more balanced, and possibly more accurate, view."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I loved this book. Such a great read. I recommend it to anyone who cares about exclusive info, dishy interviews, by and about the british royal family. The author actually interviewed the Queen's butler and she didn't pay for the info, or so she says. But I believe her. I believe every word she wrote. She's the one who told all about Frank Sinatra, Jackie Onassis and Nancy Reagan. Good track record."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"&quot;The Royals&quot; is a book every monarchist and republican should read. If the monarchy is to survive, this is the book that clearly states what its faults are and how the monarchy can become more human. Republicans will find plenty of arguments for their point of view as well. The book's most important aspect, I think, is that it makes the Windsors appear remarkably human. Here is King Edward VIII, whose love cost him the throne; the unsure George VI; the cold and aloof Elizabeth II; the brave and tragic Princess Diana; and many other people. The reason why Kitty Kelley is so reviled in some circles is because she paints people as they are, not the way the official version makes it out to be. I think that the book's biggest argument is that the old ceremonies and etiquette need to be updated before they bring down the monarchy. The book is very detailed, giving a good look at the humans behind the glamour."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Having previously enjoyed books by Kitty Kelley about Frank Sinatra,Nancy Raegan and the Bush Family, I was excited to come acrossthe taped version of a book she wrote in 1997: THE ROYALS . . . itcontinues in the tradition of her other works; i.e., being verygossipy . . . I'm not sure how much of this was the truth, but Inevertheless had fun in a guilty pleasure way reading how PrinceCharles snatched one last rendezvous with Camilla Parker-Bowleson the eve of his marriage to Diana Spencer . . . how both Charlesand Diana were unfaithful during their marriage . . . how Diana usedbulimia to keep her shape, etc.Others member of the Royal Family are likewise covered, thoughin not quite so much detail . . . you'll \\"learn\\" all you wanted to know(and some you probably didn't) about such other notables as theQueen Mother, Andy and Fergie, Prince Philip, and Prince Edward.Kelley's narration added to my enjoyment of THE ROYALS."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Yes, it is occassionally inaccurate, but it doesn't pretend toward seriousness at all. It is an exercize in intellectual slumming: a trashy, fabulous romp through all the sleazy and impossible-seeming rumours about the House of Windsor from its beginnings. It is an encyclopedia of faux-pas, diplomatic catastrophes and witty insults: totally unfair, no doubt, to the royals themselves, but killingly funny to anyone else. Enjoy a lost weekend with bitchy courtiers and too-observant servants: an impious treat for royal-watchers everywhere!"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Much of what is stated through Kelley's unnamed sources is verified through other more scholarly works on the Monarchy. There is a fair amount of information that is interesting but I'm not certain that I need to know it. There is other information that we all do need to know. This especially concerns the performance of the Queen and Philip in their official roles. Because this book is banned in Britian, the Royals must be afraid of its content. I would recommend that this book be read in conjunction with some other books on the same topic. Kelley's style is very readable, and I do believe that she did a lot of research and used the best resources that she could. Overall, she did a very good job."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"In order to give someone an idea of where this book fits in on the historically accurate scale I'd have to compare Kitty's book to the E! cable channel while the more seriously written and researched books about the Royals can compare to the A&amp;E cable channel.This book is worth reading mainly because in certain parts it's humorous. I actually had a good laugh over some of the stuff Kitty reported, especially about Fergie and also Princess Margaret's reported obsession with porno movies!"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This is the funniest, most dizzingly crass piece of prose in a long time. But it is an absolute hoot - there are some passages that you have to bore everyone in your vicinity with by reading out loud.Accept it for what it is - gossipy, pacy, replete with errors and inaccuracies (I think there are 2 references to matters Australian, and they are both wrong).It is worth it alone for the alleged comments of the queen,(or was it the queen mum?) after the Di and Fergie debacles, that this is all the thanks one gets for taking in poor gels from broken homes!!Would make a marvellous soap opera.Borrow it or ask someone for it as a present - don't waste your money buying it, but read it if you love a good laugh (it helps if you're not gullible, and apologies to American readers, you really do have to have grown up with the outrageousness of royalty, and been there witnessing their fall from grace all along the way. A passing aquaintance with the work of the sycophant! ic Royal-watching press of the UK would help too!)"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I have followed the goings-on of Diana and her death quite avidly. I found her beauty and sincerity compelling and charming, her works of mercy a worthy focus toward which to swing the paparrazzi lens. So I read The Royals with interest. It is a fast read, and even for a Diana watcher (but otherwise not to avid follower of the monarchy), most of it was new to me. I was incredibly saddened by the lack of feeling of the main character, the callousness with which affairs were undetaken, the lack of class and sophistication, and the way the institution was put so ahead of individuals. I hope it was not all true, but unlike some of the official reviewers I've read, the anecdotes seem plausible, and in general well researched. If anyone is searching for an overview of the last 2 1/2 generations of the Windsors, wants a relaxing read, and is ready to be depressed by the lack of royal character exibited by the main characters, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"The book filled in a lot of misconceptions I had of the monarchy, and also filled in a lot of historical perspectives that I had not known.

While gossipy, it was a great read!"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"You will like this book or dislike those in it. I am a royalist so try to see it from another view. I have to say that I loved it. I read a great deal while traveling but only write review that are five stars as I don't have time for anythingless. This book I found to be very well put together, and researched, there might have been a few bumps or places I might have said maybe, but in general and as a whole, I love it and will recommend it to others. I am a member of the Aspen Book Club in Colorado, the Brooklyn Hatters Book Club, \\"The Manhattan Book club\\" the European book club and the Linnenbach Readers (Book) club.

They do sell a lot of stuff & are suppose to exemplify solid family virtues which up until Charles & Diana were made to appear so for public morale & consumption.I think the class system it perpetuates is very wrong but obviously if the masses didn't want them they would just die out. I also think William & Catherine will bring a more down to earth modernizaiton of \\"royalty\\". I wonder if in a generation or so it will even exist or be more like cafe society. Anne's children have married a rugby player & some nice girl from either Scotland or wherever. Camilla is hardly \\"royal\\"...isn't her family wealth from supermarkets?The queen seems like a very conscientious person but isolated a great deal from day to day life of her subjects. Charles is the product of both an indulged & neglected childhood. Certainly not a serious work on the British monarchy!."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"For someone who can finish a book in two days, the length of this one is awesome.

Very good book."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"A friend suggested I read it. I thought it would be another trashy book but I must say I am totally fascinated and look forward to the time of day when i can sit down and read it."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"We all know what Kitty Kelly is like-and that's why we buy her books and that's what makes tabloids stay in business. I kept coming back to it whenever I had a moment. Nothing terribly new but written all in one place and the parts about Fergie were interesting because we didn't get too much press on her in the U.S. I am a pretty fast reader, and for 7.99 I it's not too bad of a price. (Even though it was very outdated, at least there were a lot of pages). That being said, the editing was horrid! And K.K.'s writing isn't consistent-In one section she says \\"Charles told his parents that he wanted to go to \\"Papa's School\\" and then on the next page she says\\" Charles finally consented and chose his father's school\\" (which apparently, he hated). Little things like that. And my biggest gripe was the photos. Instead of adding 20 photos of Di to the 247,092,036 pictures of Diana that we have already seen, I would have liked to see a lot more photos of the other royals-the pathetic 2 they have of Princess Margaret, for example. One is a really bad shot, and one she looks like a harridan. She was actually quite beautiful. Other than that, if you like gossipy reading, this is worth it, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Author Kitty Kelly must have sucked in her breath in the early morning hours of August 31, 1997. That was the night that Diana, Princess of Wales died in Paris following a spectacular auto crash. Kelly had just published her stinging biography of the Windsor family, with a particular eye to the peccadilloes of Princess Di and her philandering husband, Prince Charles, just six months earlier.But, truthfully, that is the great beauty of this book. Everything written since the death of Princess Di has been toned down with a certain level of deference to her children, princes William and Harry. But here, we get to hear all the facts right up to the point of her romance with Egyptian multi-millionaire Dodi Fayed (Fayed is never mentioned in this book).The work begins with the reign of Queen Victoria and takes the reader through WW I, WW II, and on through the most turbulent years of the Windsor family Monarchy, the 1990s, albeit there were many large potholes in the Royal road even before that late era. Quite a lot of time is spent in discussion of the ultra-controversial abdication of King Edward VIII (The Duke of Windsor) following his marriage to the twice-divorced American Wallace Warfield Simpson.The Windsor name is a made-up one, announced by King George V in 1917 to disguise his family's German roots. After his son, Edward VIII abdicated, the stammering George VI (who had married Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, ultimately Elizabeth I, and later \\"The Queen Mother\\"), reigned as king until 1952 when he died and his oldest daughter became the Monarch, Elizabeth II. She had married Prince Philip (formerly a Prince of Greece and who had changed his name to Mountbatten) and he became the Duke of Edinburgh -- the two are still living and Elizabeth II reigns to this very day.Of course Elizabeth II had siblings and children and they are all discussed herein, including her neurotic, alcoholic, anti-Semitic sister, Princess Margaret. Her four children, Charles (the heir apparent), Anne, Andrew, and Edward all additionally became figures of controversy, especially Charles (who married Diana Spencer) and Andrew, who married the somewhat infamous \\"Fergie\\". Those marriages both ended in the 1990s, not all that long after they began. Still, Charles and Diana produced the two sons, princes William and Harry, the former of which will, in all likelihood, reign as the King of England after his father, or perhaps a generation will be skipped and he'll rule directly following the death of his grandmother, Elizabeth II.I found Kelly's book to be hard-hitting and yet still tastefully articulated. Here's a quotation from the text:\\"Although the bride [Diana] was bulimic and the bridegroom a bounder, they looked like an ideal couple. The public had been entranced by their romance: the Prince had finally [emphasis] found his Princess, and after their wedding on July 29, 1981, they would live happily ever after. Abracadabra and bippitty boppetty boo. Most Britons needed to believe in this fairy tale to distract themselves from the awful reality of inner-city riots, IRA bombings, and widespread unemployment.\\" (Pages 284-5)And while some of the topics themselves might be less tasteful, Kelly still yields them up in a palatable and comprehensible manner:\\"The Queen Mother deflected scrutiny of her lineage to hide her family's hereditary defects. For generations the Strathmores had been haunted by the Beast of Glamis, which according to legend was the misshapen creature born to her grandfather's brother. Shaped like an egg with twisted spindly legs, this baby boy supposedly grew into a grotesque monster covered with long black hair. He was locked away in the castle for decades, his existence known only to his brother and three other people. The family covered their shame with secrecy.\\" (Page 28)Yet another positive feature of the book springboards from the fact that the author is an American and, thus, when she began her research she had the very same questions about the Monarchy as would most other Americans. This is complicated business and Kelly does a phenomenal job in explaining the intricacies. For example, Elizabeth (daughter of The Queen Mother) was \\"the heir presumptive\\" -- had she been a male, (infinitely preferable in the eyes of the Monarchy), she would have been \\"the heir apparent.\\"To summarize, this 547 page, nicely hardbound biography (which includes the bibliography and index) is one of the most compelling nonfiction books that I've read over the years. On both the inside covers, front and back, the reader will find a nice genealogy of the Windsors. If you have even a passing interest in England's Monarchy of the past 100 years or so, you'll find this work to be a terrific read. I will add that if you wish to know the factual details of the tragedy of the Princess Di car crash, I can very much recommendThe Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor. See my full review of that fine work.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"There are only a few things to say about this book, and they are that this is definitely not a real biography, but mostly sprinkled with gossip and tabloid-ish 'facts'. However, even though there's barely any real history, it's still a good read, and easy to get engrossed in."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I found the book interesting and believed most of it. The foibles of the Windsors were not a problem to me, as a Brit living in the USA what bothered me was the supreme arrogance of many members of the family, especially Margaret, and the assumption of some that the country owed them a luxurious living merely through accident of birth. I was surprised by factual errors that hadn't been edited out by the publisher, particularly, (1) &quot;Peers Gaveston&quot; society at Oxford, this is infact &quot;Piers Gaveston&quot; (2) &quot;Royal Highland Fuseliers&quot;, whose correct title is &quot;Royal Highland Fusiliers&quot;. Having been a student at Oxford and served with that regiment I should know although I,d never have gone near that dining society."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This is the kind of book you read in the summertime when you don't want something too deep or intricate. Just something to unwind with. It's a quick read, but the truth is, most of the information is not new. It's rehashed and restated, but nothing that would truly shock. We all know by now that the royals are not the warmest folks in the world. And don't we all have skeletons in our closets? It's not worth the amount of money one has to dish out to buy it. Borrow it from a friend next time you're heading to the beach."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"The first part of this book is the most interesting, detailing the German heritage of the Royal family. One starts to feel sorry for the nomadic Prince Philip. No wonder they don't let the Brits read it - I'll be off to Marienburg Castle near Hannover to get the real story on Prince Philip's 4 sisters.The second half of the book is condensed tabloid material and much less interesting."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"For the hipe surrounding this book, I found that it did not live up to all the fuss. I have read almost all the books about Diana, Princess of Wales, and there was nothing new in this one. Most of the &quot;insider accounts&quot; were stories I had read before. If it 's release didn't coincide with Diana's death I do not think that so much attention would have been paid to it. Nothing against Ms. Kelley, who is a fine author, but I was disappointed to have purchased the book"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"If you've never read anything about the Windsors dont start with this book. It should not be called nonfiction but more like historical fiction. It is light and airy and an easy read but take it all with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kelley's book is unadulterated crap, trash journalism of the lowest rank. She condemns Charles for being too aloof, Sarah for being too forward, the Queen Mother as ice in velvet, the Queen as velvet in ice. No movement of the House of Windsor, whatever it is, escapes her poison pen. Does no one please this truly disagreeable author? Still, I have to admit . . . I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"One of the more sensationalist inaccurate inflammatory and very likely libelous pieces of garbage it has ever been my misfortune to read.I *had* to read it, to give a decent review of it, (as part of my job) but for you whose pay cheque doesn't depend on it...Avoid like the plague.If you like works of pure fiction (which this certainly is) you'd be better off sticking with the National Enquirer or Weekly World News.

A waste of time spent in reading it"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Anyone with any sense of decency and moral fibre will not buy this book. The vast majority of allegations made therein are not only highly dubious, but also not especially horrendous. The two most &quot;shocking&quot; of the revelations seem to be, firstly that the Queen Mother was concieved out of wedlock, and secondly that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth was concieved by artificial insemenation. Are we therefore to assume that the trite Ms Kelley is such a moral zealot and medieval Christian fundementalist that she believes it is in some way evil to concieve a child out of wedlock? Apart from this, the Queen mother was one of many children, and was not the eldest. Are we threfore to assume that her older siblings too were born out of wedlock, and that this has gone unnoticed? As to the second assertion, aside from the fact that artificial insemination was not practiced until a decade after the birth of Her Majesty, whoever said that it was in any way morally wrong? One assumes that the &quot;author&quot; is making some sort of lurid suggestion about the identity of Her Majesty's father. Perhaps Ms Kelley and all of her ilk who have enjoyed this foul tome should compare pictures of Prince Albert, Edward VII, Geroge V, Edward VIII and George VI to current members of the royal family. The resemblance is so blindingly obvious that only so stupid a muck-raking pseudo-journalist as Ms Kelley would believe that they were anything other than closely related. Redaing this book has done nothing but strngthen my faith in the monarchy, and sympathise with the royal family as individuals that they have to put up with such harrassment from so-called reputable journalists."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Miss Kelley's style goes down easily enough. But she mistakes chatting with ill-informed bystanders for research. You don't have to know much about the British royal family to realise that Kelley knows next-to-nothing. The greatest offence is that the book is presented as a piece of serious scholarship. Awful."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"As a royals expert who has read dozens of books on the House of Windsor, I find Kitty Kelley's latest tome much ado of nothing new.First, she is mostly sympathetic toward Diana in the book. Ms. Kelley has stated a number of times that the release of &quot;The Royals&quot; was at a bad time in light of the death of Diana.What I find most annoying about the book is that the so-called revelations that Ms. Kelley makes are old news. They have been written about (and with greater expertise) in other books. For instance, it is common knowledge that the Earl of Strathmore submitted the paperwork late on the birth of his daugher, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. How Ms. Kelley deduced from this piece of information that the Queen Mother was illegimate is a mystery.She fails to mention that the Earl and Lady Strathmore had one more child 2 years later. Also, Lady Elizbeth had a striking resemblance to her older sister, Mary.How on earth does Ms. Kelley decide that Princess Margaret is anti-semetic because she supposidly walked out of the movie, &quot;Schlindler's List&quot;? Where did she get this information?A lot of the tidbits of so-called information on the royals is just plain uninteresting and mean-spirited.I recommend this book to royal watchers just to count up the number of errors and a priori facts that abound in this rather dreary so-called literary creation.If readers are interested in well-researched and entertaining books about the Royals, considerLady Elizabeth Longford's book on the House of Windsor or any of the excellent royal biographies by Robert Lacey, Stanley Weintraub or Theo Aronson."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"FANTASTIC!

Personally, I am an Anglophile and am one of those Yanks who go ga-ga over royalty (especially British Royalty). Ms. Kelley does her best to tarnish my vision of them - but then she polishes it a bit - then tarnishes some more. Great fun really. She actually takes you on a roller coaster ride as your feelings about the Windsors go up and down and over and out. But then...what family doesn't have its up and downs - its bad apples? Don't we all have moments when we're less than kind to people? Fortunately, no one is looking over our shoulder writing down every little faux pas. Ms. Kelley makes the Royals human - which is a blast! I love it when the Queen uses four-letter words. You don't want to miss the joke Kitty tells about the Queen in her Rolls with her lady-in-waiting regarding Princess Margaret (may she rest in peace). I was in hysterics!

Not only is this the worst trash, even worse than those tabloid papers you get at convenience stores, I'd say that a twelve year old could do better, but this is replete with major errors as has been reported in other reviews and she just spews out the same old stuff that has been known for decades.

My Quebec-born father always abhorred seeing these people depicted on our currency, stamps and even a portrait displayed in a hockey arena and always had some sarcastic comment about them. I wish he was alive to give this a read. This book is packed with the most humourous tidbits that actually make the royals look human. The story about the Duke of Edenburgh smacking the secret service agent with a newspaper during a motorcade and the joke about the Queen, Princess Margaret, the hijackers and the Rolls Royce made me roar with raucious laughter, as did the joke about the cinematographer on page 304. I only wish it had 1000 pages so I could savour it longer. This is the best book I have read since Elroy's American Tabloid! I enthusiastically recommend it!

The Queen Mum had to be impregnated by turkey baser to have Elizabeth and Margret3. Princess Margret was an anti-Semite because she walked out of Schindler's List4. Prince Harry is not Prince Charles' son- so not true.

It goes off into these rambling, resentful diatribes of what the Royal family has or owns. Even how she thinks the English citizens were cheated over how much sugar was used in the wedding cake of Princess Elizabeth's wedding.If you want to read a fantastic, attention keeping book about the Royal family, read Donald Spotos book on the Windsors.

It doesn't matter if this book is good or bad (it is so bad it's good), accurate or inaccurate (inaccurate). The fact that the royal family has enough clout to stop the sale of a blockbuster best seller in a supposedly free society is impressive. The stories in this book are so outrageous & funny they can't be true. Where did Ms Kelley get this stuff? Anyway the Royals felt threatened enough to stop it's sale in the UK. Reason enough I'd say to read it."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This tome can only satisfy those who have been living under rocks. I'm glad I paid only $13 for it at a warehouse discounter -- but even that was too much. I must admit to having borrowed many books from the library about the &quot;royal&quot; soap opera in recent years, with the result that, for me, Kitty Kelley offered nothing new whatsoever. In fact, I wouldn't be totally surprised to hear sooner rather than later that she's being sued for plagiarism. Not only do I object to its lack of original material, but to its style and language. It reads like People Magazine, and one need only the vocabulary of a 12-year-old to comprehend it. For a really good read on that family, I would recommend a book published three to four years ago entitled, &quot;The Queen Was Not Amused.&quot; It is a serious work of non-fiction, truly absorbing with much original material."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"So who cares if the Queen Mum had A.I. seventy-some years ago? And, mind you, this is the most exciting thing Kelley has managed to dig up on the House of Windsor. And one should emphasize dug up--because the whole book smells like an old bone, well-gnawed upon and not very appetizing. Save your money! Don't buy. In fact, boycott as if just a tabloid paper between hard-covers"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This is the first Kitty Kelley book I've ever read (I saw it on a family member's bookshelf and I felt like slumming), and it will be the last. This woman is not a biographer: she is a human garbage recycler. And a lousy writer at that.I hold no brief for the British royal family, although I do not object to the institution and find it an interesting if quaint relic of yesteryear. But this disorganized, poorly-written collection of gossip, innuendo, and previously-reported/disclosed information is pretty trashy stuff. There is nothing positive in this portrayal of the Royal Family, only a highly selective collection of slurs. Kelley obviously operates on the principle of, \\"If you can't say anything nasty, don't say anything at all.\\" She certainly does not hold herself to any journalistic standard of verifying sources.Kelley is obsessed with sex: who is sleeping with whom, who is gay, who likes to watch porn. And sex is the entire focus of this book. About the institution of the British monarchy itself - a fascinating and complex subject - the reader learns little; Kelley is more interested, for example, in the sexual preferences of the Queen Mother's staff than she is in the Queen Mother herself.The writing is atrocious. Kelley repeats herself frequently - we get the same information about Phillip's extramarital exploits in at least three different places - and the book's lack of organization muddles the chronology of events. The author's use of similes is trite (a situation \\"smelled worse than a dead possum under the porch\\") and her syntax is careless. Worst of all, little of the sensational information we are treated to comes from the author's own investigation; she relies heavily on other published sources and the narrative is replete with thrice-told tales. The entire book gives the impression of being thrown together in a hurry and with little care.I felt slightly soiled after I finished this prurient tabloid hit-piece. The only thing that kept me going was the same impulse that makes one rubberneck at a bad traffic accident. Only recommended to those with a strong stomach and limited intelligence."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"What a waste of trees.Kitty Kelley's book contains more mistakes, more unproven (and unlikely) innuendo, and less real information than any book on the Royals I've ever read. If you believe Kelley, you'll believe anything. Want to buy some land in Florida?The Royals reads as if it were originally a biography of Prince Philip, amended and expanded to include dirt about Sarah and Diana in order to boost sales. But the dirt is ludicrous! To give an example, Kelley implies that Prince Harry is really James Hewitt's son, pointing out the supposed 'similarity' between them. Of course, other than the red hair (which is also a Spencer characteristic), Harry looks nothing like Hewitt, but how many readers are going to check?What makes the innuendo impossible to believe are the unbelievable number of factual errors. Kelley apparently believes Piltdown Man is some kind of mystery, not a hoax (as has been known for decades); she doesn't know the difference between Denmark and Germany, calling Philip's ancestors &quot;German-Danish&quot;, whatever that means; she doesn't know the difference between England and Britain, which is inexcusable in an author writing about the British royal family; she believes that George II, George III, George IV, William IV, Victoria and Edward VII didn't speak English (of course they all did); and she doesn't know when Prince Philip's grandmother died (well, she was only off by a few decades). And there are dozens and dozens and dozens more! Dates, events, proper names, locations -- if she can't even get the most easily checked facts right, why should the reader believe even one syllable of her unsubstantiated gossip?It's astounding. I would be shocked at all the positive reviews of this book if I didn't know how many people love trash even if it's garbage.This book wasn't even worth the energy expended in carrying it home from the library."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I love reading about the royal family and I just loved this book! I have read several books about Diana so I knew the history there but I never knew what an awful mother the Queen is! And I didn't realize how everything has to be approved by her! Nor did I realize what a womanizer Price Philip was and all the mistresses he had over the years!Would highly recommend if you like reading about the Windsor Family."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Those who compare this book to tabloid journalism are somewhat mistaken. Yes this book has its fair share of errors, and yes it is as sensationalistic as tabloid trash, but this book certainly shows enough research and gives enough credible sources to more or less accurately portray the scandals and &quot;misbehavior&quot; in the book. There are those who revere the Royals and don't want this stuff to be true because they want to look up to the Royal Family as the paradigm of family values and correct behavior, but I think with so many scandals and less-than-flattering revelations about the Royals' private lives through the years, most people I'm sure have become disillusioned with and cynical about them. Really, these bluebloods are just as flawed and ordinary as the rest of us, only difference being that they were born into the House of Windsor. What's their use? Well, they're good theatre. Also, they help out charities and other good causes, which is nice.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This book is entertaining for those who enjoy gossip without taking it as fact. Much is not solidly substantiated, but is interwoven with just enough clear fact to make it overly believable. The string of anonymous sources is a caveat to those who would take this for history or biography rather than the equivalent of tabloid headlines.Kitty Kelley makes various references which make it clear that she rather glories in the &quot;American&quot; approach of having no respect for royalty or for privacy. The implication is that she was able to uncover stories which those having such respect would not reveal, or that refusal to discuss a matter means the story is known to be accurate.Though a &quot;fun read&quot; if taken as the equivalent of a gossip column, there is little here that would be useful to anyone genuinely interested in either the &quot;cast of characters&quot; or in history. If one knows anything much about the royal family, this book appears to be intended solely to discredit their characters - both in the uncorroborated stories it includes and the many noble facts it omits."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I am British and therefore have not read Ms Kelley's much talked of book. I cannot understand why we are not allowed to read it, but we ARE allowed to read the new book about Princess Diana, they haven't stopped that have they? I wonder why? Censuring us is only going to decrease public support and frankly the Royals need that more than ever. However, with Phillip in tow I suppose the Queen has enough on her plate trying to keep him from embarassing the monarchy.To any Americans who CAN read the offending book may I say enjoy it, if nothing else I hope it will entertain, accurate or not.And one final thought. Please don't believe everything you read especially about the royal family, and if you do please don't think they are a representation of us. We are much more interesting."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I just finished reading The Royals by Kitty Kelley. In view of the on-going media hype surrounding it, I am alarmed by how poorly written and researched this book was. I was led to believe that Kitty Kelley was a journalist who was writing a &quot;history&quot; of the House of Windsor. But this book is a waste of money and any time spent reading it would be wasted. Even if you are only interested in gossip, rumor and innuendo, there is nothing new here. Everything she has written was printed elsewhere. And to top it off, the publisher should be scolded for not proof-reading the text --- apparently if Kitty Kelley likes a particular sentence she'll use it over and over again throughout the book. Don't make the mistake I made by buying this book"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"What is it about this book of Kitty Kelley's that does not ring true? It is not just that, having been released in 1997, it is dated. No one could have foretold the then-imminent death of Diana, and some of the book's predictions are admirably prescient, if not original. (One example: the outpouring of nostalgic affection that would arise upon the death of the Queen Mother.)The book is at worst, readable, and at best, informative. But it is extravagantly overblown. A minimalist Kelley is not. One reason her book is short on credibility is because it lacks a consistent voice. Any biography must draw on a variety of sources, but the reader gets the feeling that not only is this not Kitty Kelley speaking, it is not even Kitty Kelley paraphrasing. There are long passages, not in quotation marks, that appear to be either lifted holus bolus from another (British) source or crudely edited, possibly by a British assistant.Kelley is an American, but she could have pulled this off if she had maintained a genuinely American point of view: after all, Americans seem to be the target audience for her book. As well, while her book contains a vast scattershot of information, she does not connect the dots. Her bibliography is lengthy but her chapter notes are brief and vague.Even if much of the book is true, it is hard to lend it serious credence due to some obvious anachronistic errors.She berates the Queen Mother, at the time Queen Consort to King George VI, for the vast wardrobe for her visit to Canada and the United States in the summer of 1939. She implies that despite their claims of acceding to hardship and wartime deprivation, the monarchs travelled in extravagant style with no concern for the strict limits of spending coupons that were the lot of ordinary Britons. Yet the royal couple toured in the summer of 1939; however much they spent, the King and Queen's trip was completed in advance of World War II with its subsequent rationing. (War was declared by England on September 3rd, after Germany invaded Poland.) This type of error should be dealt with in Biography 101 and failing that, picked up by a moderately astute copy editor.Later Kelley comments on how the Princess of Wales, estranged from her husband, made herself out to be all alone one Christmas when in fact she had a mother, a brother, and twin sisters to call upon. Diana's sisters, Sarah and Jane, are not twins and nowhere else in the book is this implied. Was it a simple typo of \\"two\\" that the spell-check picked up and suggested \\"twin\\"? Regardless, the error should have been corrected in proofreading.These lapses are puzzling, even in the most informal of narratives. Moreover, the statement about the Princess's family resources belies Kelley's constant earlier allusions to the dysfunction already rampant in the Spencer clan.The wicked vignettes peppered throughout the book make compelling reading, but they should be taken with several grains of salt."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kelley, at her best (The Nancy Reagan bio), can write a good overview of a celebrity and make a convincing case for her final assessment of an individual. In this book, she utterly failed. After years spent on the project, Kelley was unable to present any new information. What she has done is rehash every tabloid story and cut and paste it all together. This reads like a quilt badly sewn together. Yes, the Royals are probably ignorant, uneducated, immoral, boring dolts. We have all heard all of these stories before. I got the impression that even Kelley became bored of her subject but had a contract to fulfill. This time, however, she aimed too high. Without anyone significant willing to speak to her (we are talking about a politically important institution here, not some hollywood celebrity), without any new revelations, this is little more than a collection of gossip with little insight. Buy it only for that cruise you are taking. It is light, mindless, and it won't make much of a difference if you never finish it."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I know this book is filled with gossip, questionable resources, etc., but I still really enjoyed it. It is long - which I like, I hate to really get into a book and then it ends too quickly. I don't know, but it seems pretty realistic - just like real people act. It certainly puts no one on a pedestal; everyone is human. Its full of lots of interesting stories - some made me laugh out loud (the Queen and the King of Nigeria riding in the carriage). Anyway, a lot of book for the money; I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about royalty/history."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Kitty Kelley puts Buckingham Palace in her bomb sites, yielding direct and collateral damage. The direct hits include her inciteful portrayal of the Queen Mother &amp; Prince Phillip. We know more about their real personas and motives. Kelley also demonstrates much of Princess Di is the product of a publicity machine. I look forward to a genuine account of her in the future . . . at least before she's cannonized.Kelley is off target on the essence of The Royals, their importance to British self-esteem and their financial importance to the GB economy. She reports her subjects like a 70's soap opera, not in the spirit of the 1,000 year legacy. It's too distant . . . too American.The most disappointing aspect is the thin depth Kelley achieves in finding the soul of Queen Elizabeth. We never discover her motives. Some will argue that Kelley could never get that close. That's the danger of a bomb run over the palace. You can drop them from thousands of feet, but you're too high to gauge the results."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Great Read;.Descriptions were verifiable and definitely provocative. Creates all that I expected. good history and fun to study. Good Author"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"It's makes for riveting reading, but a lot of what Kelley has written is distorted or resorts to unsubstantiated gossip. Also, many of her sources were dead before she wrote the book, and many others never came forward. No wonder this book couldn't be published in Britain. She was subject to too many libel laws."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"I tried to purchase this book through Amazon, but I was told that it could not be shipped to UK addresses. This is apparently due to an official ban imposed by the British Government. By chance, I then found a copy when browsing in a local 'bargain' bookshop; the book cannot be obtained from large bookstore chains in the UK such as Waterstones etc. I found it to be reasonably well researched, and far more intelligently written than articles one might read about 'the royals' in the British tabloids. Ms Kelley rightly indicates throughout her book the huge amounts of money that the various post- war debacles of the Mountbatten- Windsor family have cost the British people. How ironic, then, that we are the only people in the world who are officially not allowed to read this book! What do the international community think about this? Opinions please!"},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Having read this book I feel that it has been unfairly maligned. It is neither a trashing of the individuals in the house of Windsor nor is it a tabloid-esque scandal sheet. Ms. Kelly paints a complex psychological portrait of the members of the royal family in a way that does not excuse their well documented ill-behavior but rather allows the reader to have insight into their personal motivations. In a way the royal family of Britain are painted as very real and human characters with flaws and many emotional injuries. I wonder if the negative reaction to this book is due to the timing of its release and the fact that the narrative humanizes characters that Britain, for the sake of its history and system of governance, needs to be more that human. And for the rest of the world to serve as a mirror for our fantasies. For me this book elicited pathos for this family--the queen's coldness and inhumanity caused by the early death of her father and the trauma of the second world war with all of the incipient pressures that would befall her. (what a potentially terrifying childhood knowing that your destiny may require you to \\"save the nation\\" though the strength of your character). As for Charles (for whom I personally had a storng antipathy towards prior to reading this book) the childhood he had left him quite incapable of being a loving sympathetic man despite the fact that he apparently has a tremendous need to be so. Diana was bound to be crushed by the institution of royalty and the monarchy. Her \\"loony' behavior makes perfect sense when you consider that she as a 19 year old girl had just steeped though the looking glass and into a world with no allies. Also, don't kid yourself, while there some epistemological problems and some quotes must clearly be fabricated, a technique of historians going back to Herodotous, this is an exceedingly well crafted book."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"The outraged royalists crying &quot;shame&quot; on Kitty should take a reality check- particularly the reviewer from Dublin who expressed such contempt for Miss Kelly. Is Princess Margaret to be defended after issuing such public statements as &quot;The Irish are all pigs?&quot; Yes, this book was a cold, hard slap in the face of the house of Windsor- and this reader has no sympathy. I felt that Miss Kelly's book showed the house of Windsor to be what it is- a crumbling institution that serves no purpose, except for the amusement of the tabloids. Miss Kelly presented a portrait of self serving parasites out of touch with their land and people, and she did it with skill. It was a fast paced, entertaining read, not always unsympathetic, but always fascinating. A revealing portrait of those who consider themselves our &quot;betters,&quot; but, sadly and obviously, are not."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"Every book must be judged on its own terms. Having just read Ms. Kelley's book, I accept it for what the author obviously intended it to be - tabloid gossip (which has its place in our society) wrapped it the aura of solid historical research. The book succeeds well as an exhaustive collection of passed down whispers and carefully extracted negative opinions and mean-spirited, flip comments from dozens of interview subjects. However, it fails very seriously as any kind of reliable or astute presentation of historical facts - let alone a fair or reliable interpretation of these events. It's rather distressing to read so many comments here on Amazon from people who think they have received an education in historical fact from Ms. Kelley's book.My name is Michael John Sullivan and I am a scholar of royal history. My latest book, &quot;A FATAL PASSION - The Story of the Uncrowned Last Empress of Russia&quot;, covers much the same territory as Kelley's. But it doesn't take a specialist to find the many factual errors Kelley has made. A trip to the history department of any local community college could have set matters correct on a number of issues. It's really astonishing that with all the resourses Ms. Kelley had at her disposal and all the assistance and money she received that a simple check of facts could not have been conducted.To detail everything incorrect would take far too much space here, but let's just take the first page of her beginning chapter (2) after the introduction - and the very first point that she attempts to make in the book. Kelley writes on page 5 that until l9l7 &quot;many English kings never spoke the King's English. They spoke only German . . .This is utterly absurd! George I spoke German when the House of Hanover was imported to England at the beginning of the l8th Century, but his son learned English, and his grandson George III by the time of the American Revolution was a thorough Englishman. The monarchs of England may have kept marrying German spouses, but the children were brought up intensely British and spoke English as their first and foremost tongue. George IV was as English as Nigel Bruce, and Queen Victoria was obviously not a German-speaking monarch, nor her son, the very British Edward VII.How on earth Kelley can begin her book with such a ludicrous and false premise is beyond credibility. She obviously wants to impress the importance of the changing of the Royal Family's name from a German one in l9l7 to a created English one - but in so doing she totally fabricates and distorts and starts the reader off with a completely false sense of English Royal history. Her tendency to dispense with facts continues throughout the book as gossip is championed at the expense of simple, logical explanation - should the proper facts not be ignored. Dates, names, and relationships time and again are incorrectly stated.What a shame. When a small press tightly budgets a minor book, such oversights can be explained away. But what is the excuse of a multi-million dollar project such as this that had everyone from the CEO of Time-Warner on down being credited by Kelley in her introduction as having been deeply involved. History can be both fascinating AND correct, and it was sad that Kelley couldn't achieve both."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"What a fun book and that's all it is. There is nothing new in this book, well maybe a few things, but nothing that is going to make you drop open your mouth in shock. I've read other reviews here, and I'm finding people are taking this book much too seriously. It's just fun, Everyone loves a little gossip and that's all this is. Read it and have fun with it, don't start harping on what is real and what isn't. Just read, laugh and enjoy. Nothing in here is really nasty...to anyone. The only reason it was banned in the UK is because it would be real easy for the ROYALS to sue Ms. Kelly. I have to give this book five stars, it's just too rich...and really some fun reading. By the way the cover is GREAT! Pick it up, have a cup of tea, and enjoy. It's worth it!!! Trust me."},{"Title":"The Royals","review":"This book was definitely a page turner.

Joseph Tate intellectually analyzes the audio/visual metaphors Radiohead presents regularly with the unwavering devotion and curiosity of a chemist in pursuit of truth. The book is well-written and an overall fantastic attempt to further understand the enigmatic peculiarity that is Radiohead.P.S. I enjoyed your listmania entry Sr. Tate"},{"Title":"The Music and Art of Radiohead (Ashgate Popular and Folk Music Series)","review":"Alex Ross's fascinating Radiohead profile (The New Yorker, 2001) quotes drummer Phil Selway as saying, \\"Really, we don't want people twiddling their goatees over our stuff,\\" and yet goatee-twiddling is exactly what you get in this anthology of academic essays on the band's music and art. Bottom line: if you are an academic and you genuinely enjoy reading academic writing, you might enjoy this volume; if not, you are not likely to.As a Radiohead fan and someone with a background in music performance and musicology, I'm delighted that \\"serious writing\\" about Radiohead exists, but I'm also disappointed that I didn't get to learn more cool stuff about my all-time favorite rock group. While each essay's thesis is intriguing, most of the supportive material (the bulk of the book) is dry and pedantic. Few paragraphs are without obligatory references to the usual suspects (Kant, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, Foucault, and Barthes--is that all academics do? state something sort of interesting and then \\"prove\\" it by citing marginally related works by established academics?), hackneyed expressions like \\"What is at stake is ...,\\" and not-really-real words like \\"invagination\\" and \\"vocalic.\\" (Yes, I know they're in the dictionary, but would you use them?)That being said there are definitely a few standouts. \\"Kid Adorno\\" by Curtis White starts out in a deadpan academic voice complete with discussions of Adorno's aesthetic theories only to break out into a completely subjective screed as it takes on Nick Hornby's notoriously negative review of the Radiohead album Kid A (The New Yorker, 2000). I actually laughed out loud throughout the second half of this piece. In breaking out of the academic-writing mode, White's piece functions equally as a defense of Kid A and a critique of academic writing. I would love to read more pieces like this one. I also enjoyed Paul Lansky's \\"My Radiohead Adventure\\" because it's the composer's first-person memoir of writing a piece of electronic art music (sampled 30 years later in Radiohead's \\"Idioteque\\") and a description of how Radiohead came to use Lanksy's piece and how they composed \\"Idioteque.\\" This is the type of content I was hoping to find more of. I admit it; I was looking for something more journalistic, like Alex Ross's New Yorker piece.In summary, this book does what it sets out to do. I like the way it discusses the band's videos and album art as well as its music. It's just that the writing is dully academic in its style and approach. And if you've already done any amount of serious thinking about Radiohead, you've probably already figured most of this stuff out for yourself."},{"Title":"Caribbean Holiday","review":"A fast paced story, \\"Caribbean Holiday\\" has all the ingredients of a perfect suspense thriller. Wealthy Arabs employ Sextus Durkin to kidnap Augustus Bishop, a rich, enterprising individual, who controls a large uranium mine. Bishop only sells to contractors erecting or maintaining power plants, not to anyone interested in developing weapons. However, many Arab nations are interested in the uranium in order to develop weapons grade atomic material. To complicate matters further, Bishop and Sextus are half-brothers by their father.A lion and gorilla are involved in Sextus' risky power game. Neurosurgeons working in Bishop's South African Medical Laboratory implanted a twelve-month dry chip in the cerebrum of each animal. Because of the chips, both beasts follow voice commands and are traceable. Sextus' women add intrigue and mystery to the story. Moore packs his novel full of adventure, including a thrilling journey in Bishop's yacht and submarine and also escapades on St. Kitts Island. During these aquatic quests, the peculiar behavior of dolphins and sharks is noticed and becomes central to the plot. Conspiracy, casinos, brutal murders, and suspense, this thrilling novel is sure to keep its readers on the edge of their seat from the first to the last word."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Early last year I read a British publication of this book and found it one of the best Inspector Rebus novels yet. Inspector Rebus himself, is such a fascinating charachter that his inner conflicts, history of broken relationships, addiction to good Scottish whiskey and love of his extensive and eclectic music collection make him as much of a mystery as the series of mysterious murders he investigates. Sometimes, as he has done here, Ian Rankin introduces other similarly intriguing by players, some of whom have previous and again mysterious histories with Rebus. The interaction between Rebus, other charachters and the history and surroundings of Edinborough itself paint such a vivid, moody and tense atmosphere that often the obligatory murder or two seem almost superfluos. The murder/s however, are in fact never too much. Each is different, unexpected and initially seemingly unsolveable and, as in this book, the answers and Rebus' manner of finding them lead the reader through an entirely unexpected journey that, as the plot developes, twists like Rebus' mind and Edinborough's ancient streets and alleyways.To be more specific as to the who's, what's and where's involved in this tales' journey would ruin the prospective delight of any new readers reactions and absorbsion of those details. It's a fine book by an accomplished Master of Mystery and Creator of Charachter. Rankin is so much more than those two phrases infer .... he is a true and fascinating Novelist."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Rankin lives up to expectations with this his fifth full length Rebus novel. The plot leads the reader on a chase around Scotland for the truth behind a hotel fire five years ago and a series of more contemporary crimes and misdemeanors. With more twists and turns than the Hampton Court Maze, this book is sure to delight anyone who likes to be taken up numerous garden paths and back again. From the first page to the last your sure to find plenty of suprises in this novel. Definitly one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Ian Rankin must now hold the position as one of the UK's finest crime writers with his 5th &quot;Inspector Rebus novel&quot;, The BlackBook. Set in the depths of Edinburgh's criminal fraternity, Rankin captures the persona of a hard-nosed Scottish policeman,(John Rebus) as he attempts to solve a five-year old case. Notes about it are hidden in a black book kept by his colleague,Brian Holmes, the victim of a brutal assault. The scene is the Central Hotel, a paradise for the degeneracy and squalor whichbreed within its walls until it is razed to the ground; the eventual investigation yields one dead body but no clues. Five years on and Morris Gerald Cafferty (one of Edinburgh's most notorious criminals) is under surveillance for his role in a gang of loan sharks. In the course of this Rebus is blighted by personal problems and eventual suspension from the police force whilst trying to link the fire at Central Hotel to Cafferty's own illegal dealings. Amidst the lies and intrigue there lies a terrifying link that, if exposed, could result in vicious reprisals for many other people. With all detective novels it is difficult to fully explain a plot without revealing the conclusion but with Rankin, nothing is certain until the final page. This is a stunning piece of work; particularly striking is the originality of the characters and plot that culminates in an energetic yet decisive result. If you read no other crime thriller this year then read Ian Rankin's work, impressive and highly elegant."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Rankin's Edinburgh police Inspector John Rebus forges a narrow path through office politics, his shambles of a life, and the mean streets of his city in this 1994 novel.The title refers to a notebook found on one of Rebus's men, ambushed outside a favorite nightspot and remaining unconscious in the hospital.Determined to find out who wanted to silence the policeman, Rebus deciphers the notes and finds himself pursuing a five-year-old arson and murder case while maintaining a pointless surveillance on a bookie insisted upon by his superiors.Rankin's writing is as gritty and moody as his put-upon hero, with his shambles of a personal life. Steeped in an atmosphere of Edinburgh's shadowy and unsavory corners, \\"The Black Book\\" is a taut, suspenseful tale."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"In The Black Book inspector Rebus continues to be the dogged pursuer of murder cases, a questionable boss, and a tough (as in difficult) lover to his girlfriend. This time the murder has to do with the discovery of a dead body in a 5 year old blaze. Inevitably Rebus and his team resolve the case and tie many loose ends. Big Ger, the recurring nemesis, appears again and gets many a \\"hit\\" from the inspector.This is a decent thriller but the book was a bit difficult to follow due to the many characters involved. I had to keep flipping back to see who a particular character was. As is typical in Rankin's books the reader continues to learn about Scotland and its particular ways."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Ian Rankin's \\"The Black Book\\" is the 5th of his Inspector John Rebus series set in Edinburgh; this is the first of his novels I've read. Although in his early thirties when he wrote this tale, Rankin shapes Rebus with a world-weary cast, delivering a startlingly interior view of his middle-aged detective. Rebus isn't a 20s-something swashbuckler; nor has his passion died -- instead, it smoulders, burning red hot when correctly fanned, flicking encrusted ash skyward contemptuously.In this outing, Rebus has to deal with his girl-friend who's had enough of him, his returning brother (an ex-con) with no where else to stay except with John, a flat full of late teenage university students on their own for the first time (and sharing his flat he's been forced to return to). And that's just his personal life. On the job, he becomes engulfed by a five year old murder, pursuing the investigation \\"on his own time\\" (and literally, too, as he is suspended at one point from the force), which leads to a gay bar / Elvis themed restaurant and ongoing encounters with ghosts from the arson of the Central Hotel where the body was found ... with links to organised crime in the present day. As the story threads come together, Rebus's personal and professional life become entirely entangled as a key piece of evidence to the old murder lands in his hands. And that's just the start of his troubles.Rankin shifts between a third person narrative focussed on Rebus to the other characters as they uncover their own motives in the moment and on to richly detailed commentary about life and surroundings in the chief setting of Edinburgh. Dialects pop up; the Edinburgh lilt can be heard vividly; and local words are sprinkled into dialogue as a chef adds secret sauce to a favourite dish. Somehow, Rankin manages the verbal sleight-of-hand to conjure this Scottish setting in a way that seems entirely familiar, like ones own home town -- but wait, that's not true is it? And his winning character, Rebus, worms his way off the page like the best of the hard-boiled detectives, utterly convincing and sympathetic but no one's ideal of the perfect husband for your daughter. No wonder the series is occasionally dubbed \\"Tartan Noir\\"!I read the Kindle edition so I can't say it was a page turner. I can say I enjoyed, and enjoyed savouring, every e-inked turn of phrase as it flashed by, reading much further into the night on multiple occasions than is good for me. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Detective Inspector John Rebus of the Lothian & Borders CID, and the occasional terror of both the Edinburgh underworld and his own departmental superiors, is a good man to have on your side and a bad one if he's after your head. At the moment he's involved in yet another operation to try to snare Big Ger Cafferty, a Very Bad Guy who has his finger in everything and who pulls a lot of strings among the city's powerful. They've never been able to make anything stick and Rebus has no hopes this time, either, but orders is orders. Then he gradually becomes involved in re-studying the files from the five-year-old arson at the Central Hotel, where a dead body was found in the debris -- dead from a bullet in the head. And his sergeant, Brian Holmes, has just been waylaid and bashed in the head with sufficient force to put in a coma. Brian may have come across a clue to the fire, as recorded in his personal notebook, which Rebus now has. Was the attack a warning to back off? Then his brother, Michael, whom he had helped put in prison for drug trafficking, but who is now free again, turns up needing a place to stay. Only Rebus has been chucked out by his girlfriend and is himself sleeping on the couch in his own apartment, because he's already rented the place out to a group of students. Yes, it's complicated, to Rebus as much as to the reader. But things are going to get worse, with additional threats to both John and his brother. And Cafferty's hand seems to be everywhere Rebus looks.This is the fifth book in this series and it's pretty good. Rebus is the sort of problematic cop who doesn't hesitate to bend the law himself, not to mention setting people up, in order to obtain the results he wants, but that attitude is common enough in real life. And he's also something of a softie when it comes to those he regards as genuinely innocent. Not always a pleasant person, that is to say, but always an interesting one."},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"This novel is the fifth in the Inspector John Rebus collection, and is another fine addition to the series. The novel's premise concerns a hotel fire which occurred five years earlier, and the cause and reason have yet to be determined.

A local crime boss with connections to loan sharking, the protection rackets, and illegal gambling is the odds on favorite as the culprit, and Inspector Rebus explicates and develops the case in his inexorable fashion.

However, for some reason or another, it didn't capture my attention as some of his earlier mysteries did. A.M. Seidler"},{"Title":"The Black Book","review":"Ian Rankin's series of books about Inspector Rebus are often considered mysteries. Like most of the books, this one is clever and entertaining, but it's also less twisty than others I've read. They're also mysteries with a heavy dose of police procedural (all the more interesting because they take place in Edinburgh). I'm not sure where this lands in a John Rebus timeline, but his nemesis Cafferty seems less developed here. As an ebook reissue, this is well worth your money and you can have a good read, maybe with Irish whiskey instead of that smokey old Scotch.This book also has a wee bit of thriller in it. By this I mean that the reader knows a few things that go on that Rebus doesn't know. Writing in third person allows this. I'm not sure I'd want Rebus in first person. In his point-of-view, even in third person, one discovers a flawed character. We learn more about him and his family in this book than in some others. Siobhan is less developed too but grows satisfactorily as a character.The main story is the mystery surrounding a fire that burned down a local hotel, figuring out what name belongs to the corpse found there afterwards, and the people at different levels of Edinburgh society involved with that fire. Taut plotting, great characters, and some action in a series not known for its action. I enjoyed it. You will too.

The real problem for me was all the seemingly non related events that came together during the book were impossible for the reader to piece together, so the author throws all of this up in the air and only Det.
