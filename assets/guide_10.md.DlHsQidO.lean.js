But after a string of books that seemed designed solely to put Spenser and Hawk into interesting locales and give them every opportunity to exchange witticisms, Small Vices is the real thing. Spenser has me hooked again. He's a little older and maybe a little wiser than the Spenser who first faced his own mortality in Valediction, but he hasn't lost that sense of honor and the need for justice that's always driven him. What he has finally shed is another layer of his stubborn autonomy, as his brush with death makes him dependent on his friends.

I'm glad the &quot;alleged&quot; perpetrator of the crime doesn't do a swift turnaround at the end and become a somewhat tarnished good guy.

This book, which will primarily be used in intermediate-advanced Spanish literature courses in college, especially in introductory courses in Hispanic literature, will give the reader an overview to the most important works by Hispanic writers starting with Nahuatl literature (the indigenous pre-Columbian peoples of the Americas), covering all of the major literary artistic periods to today.Please note that the book is entirely in Spanish and is not meant for beginners. As a future high school Spanish teacher, I feel it to be appropriate reading for advanced high school students (AP and native speakers) and up, though one would be hard pressed to find it in use in any high school.The book is an anthology, and therefore only selected parts of the literary works are presented.It is a definite must for college Spanish majors, especially those readers whose roots are planted in the Americas, and, quite frankly, anyone wishing to read for themselves the history of the Americas from the vantage point of the participants,.I can personally attest to the powerful stories contained therein. I was especially moved by the Nahuatl poetry which described the atrocities committed by the conquistadors. Though do not let that detract you or skew your view of the Spanish; all throughout history different peoples have waged wars against each other, killed \\"in the name of God,\\" and the like.

The explanation and back-up statistics were detailed and easy-to-understand.Then, when it started to get into more interesting topics such as love and the stock market, there was much less statistical back-up. In most cases the explanation was along the lines as follows: \\"Important people doing complicated research have said you should date 45 people before you find your soulmate.\\" While that is an interesting factoid, I purchased a book on chance to see the statistics and math behind the numbers, not just for cocktail reception fodder.The book felt organizationally incoherent and quickly jumped from topic to topic with little introduction leading into or conclusion smoothly summarizing individual \\"lessons\\"."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"Amir D.

It will provide a great deal of information to those unfamiliar with statistics or statistical reasoning. However, because of the brevity of the explanations, the reader often does not have adequate information to evaluate the hypotheses put forward in the text. This is particularly the case in the section on selecting a mate, in which a number is given based on \\"e\\" without any real explanation, and the section on Bayes's theorem, which does not provide enough detail to allow for adequate understanding or evaluation. The book also has some factual errors, such as the presentation of a poker hand in which one player is trying to draw to a flush in order to \\"beat\\" another player who already has a full house. I also think that some of the problems presented at the end of the book were not explained clearly.This book may be a good place to start for someone interested in the application of statistics to daily life but it will leave the interested reader thirsting for more details and explanation. If that was the goal of the author, he certainly succeeded. Perhaps he or other authors will write a book which addresses this need in the near future."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"In \\"Chance,\\" Dr. Aczel had a wonderful idea: Present the basic ideas of probability in a context that lay-people can understand. He engages the reader's imagination through real-life examples. Given the role that probability and statistics play in political reporting (through polls), the recent poker craze and investing, this book seems an ideal gift for just about anyone who doesn't already know anything about probability theory.Unfortunately, the execution of the book is severely flawed. The book is very poorly edited. In particular, many of the formulas contain significant errors. A probability theory novice will certainly get lost in this.In addition, in the section about 6 degrees of separation, he makes no mention of James Milgram's experiment. One can probably safely assume he is aware of this experiment, and I think that making no mention of it (especially as it brings sociology so nicely into the picture) was a mistake.Finally, the book is simply too short. The real text is only about 120 pages, with a large font and small pages. I was originally considering giving this book to my Computer Algorithms students as a helpful introduction to probability. Dr. Aczel does not, however, provide enough formulas and examples to make this useful.I highly recommend this book as a gift for those people who have never had a probability course. It will help acquaint them with some of the counter-intuitive effects that probability theory has on every-day life. Serious fans of math, however, should steer clear."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"The basic ideas are clearly and cleverly presented. However, it is little more than a very short text with a few examples. It is distracting to find the equations clumsily presented, and there are errors of content in addition to typos. It needed a knowledgable and diligent editor."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"Everyone knows that chance plays a huge role in our lives, in weather, auto accidents, and coincidental meetings, as well as in lotteries and other games. \\"What are the odds?\\" is a question we are faced with so many times a day that we probably don't even think about how many unconscious calculations we make trying to predict the future. Probability theory helps us do this; it is \\"humanity's attempt to use pure mathematics to understand the un-understandable.\\" So writes Amir D. Aczel in _Chance: A Guide to Gambling, Love, the Stock Market, & Just About Everything Else_ (Thunder's Mouth Press). It is a book of mathematics, but it is not intimidating. It is accessible and small, readable in an evening (but readers may spend much more time working on the sample problems), and may present few surprises to those familiar with the subject. The presentation, however, is brisk and clear, and serves very well as a primer to this branch of mathematics.The pretty red and white cover of the book simulates the back of a playing card, and games of chance are a big part of the subject. Not only do the games themselves get examined, but dice and cards give good examples of how probability may be calculated. But more complex life examples are given. As the title insists, probability theory can help you find love (or, for that matter, a good apartment or a companionable puppy). Let's say you are entering a computer dating service, and you expect as many as a hundred relationships, each of which you will experience and then keep that mate or move on. If you just stop at the first prospect, there is a one in a hundred chance that it is the best match for you; similarly, if you get through all 99, the hundredth prospect has a one in a hundred chance of being the best match for you. Neither of those odds is very good. The mathematically best strategy is to date the first 37 matches, and settle on none of them. This enables you to learn about what you are doing and how well the population measures up to what you want. And then, starting with the 38th one, take the candidate that is better than any so far. There's a chance you won't find any such candidate, because the best match was in the first 37 you sampled; but as firm as the mathematics is, nothing in love is certain. As Aczel jokes, \\"Now, don't you wish your mother would give you advice like that?\\"There is gambling advice. If you wish to avoid losing money at the casinos, don't gamble. Don't make the mistake that if the die just rolled a two, it is less likely to roll a two next time; dice, or roulette wheels, or all the rest, have no memory. If you have to gamble, and you have a big wad of money to blow, play it all on one big play; if you apportion the money in a series of bets, the money will only be chipped away by the odds that always favor the house. You can get advice on shuffling; a deck riffle shuffled five times still has pockets of order, but seven times will produce randomness. But mostly, this smart little book shows how probability makes a difference in our lives and in the way we think about things. Here you will find the answer to the problem about whether those monkeys on typewriters would ever really produce _Hamlet_, why it always seems as if you get to the bus stop just after the bus has already gone rather than just before it comes, why good things seem to come in threes, and why you should expect in a room of 23 people that two of them ought to have the same birthday. It's an entertaining brief overview of a classic subject."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"'Chance' by Amir Aczel is lucid in language. It covers the fundamentals of probability theory and relates the mathematics to interesting real-life scenarios. The explanation of Bayes' Theorem is especially good.However, from the perspective of a lay reader, the book is confusing at some places. For example, in Ch. 2 it refers to 'outcome' and 'event' but the word 'outcome' is seldom, if ever, used in the rest of the book. The distinction between these two is not clear from the book. In Ch.7,it mentions that the feeling (that there should be equal number of heads and tails at any given point on tossing a fair coin) is 'indeed true- but only over the long term'. However, in Ch. 11, it mentions that 'as the number of trials (tosses of the coin) increases, the probability of an even split becomes smaller!'. These two statements are conflicting.There seem to be some issue with printing the formulas on pp.48, 49. And, the book suddenly jumps into a discussion on probability distributions in Ch.17 without any explanation of what a distribution is about.While the answer given for problem #22 is correct, the formula shown in the answer is wrong.A book attempting to popularize and de-mystify the mathematics, I believe, should explain the apparent contradictions and misconceptions and stimulate the reader to go beyond the book. I do not think the book really stimulates any further reading.Not withstanding these blemishes, the book is worth reading once, but is it worth keeping in a personal library? I am not sure."},{"Title":"Chance","review":"This tiny book leaves one with the impression it was knocked off over a weekend. The topics chosen in the book are intriguing but are only mentioned in summary and nothing is dicussed in depth; most results are simply stated without adequate justification or proof.

He is not a statistician. As a statistician reviewing this book I find his coverage of discrete probability to be very good. He explains subjects he understand in an excellent and very comprehensible way for the layperson. That is why his book on the story of Andrew Wiles journey to proving Fermat's Last Theorem is so good. When he is talking about the famous paradoxes in probability he shines. Much of the book is deserving of five stars. Where he falls short however is when he ventures into the less comfortable area of statistical inference. He talks about Bayes' Theorem as though it is controverial. Bayes Theorem is a simple mathematical law.But Bayesian analysis is an entirely different thing. It is controversial because it is used in the context of models involving unknown parameters and the use of data to draw inference about the parameters. In the classical statistical approach long run frequency and likelihood functions are the keys to drawing inferences. In Bayesian Statistics the unknown parameters are treated as random quantities. The idea is that we conceptualize on uncertainty in the value of a parameter (which is a fixed quantity) as though it were a random variable with a probability associated with it. That probability distribution is called a prior distribution because it is established prior to the collection of the data. The Bayesians use the prior distribution and the likeihood and multiply them together to update the distribution for the parameter after analyzing the data. So this updated distribution is called the posterior distribution. In Bayesian statistics inference is drawn based on the posterior distribution. I classical statistics it is purely the likehood function that is used and it is the frequency notion of sampling distributions that governs inference surrounding these estimates of the unknown parameters. The frequentists or classical statisticians never need a prior distrbution for the parameter. They use sampling distributions to compute confidence intervals or test hypotheses about the parameters.All of this is completely ignored by Aczel. He does a great job in explaining Bayes theorem which when stated asP(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B)/ (P(A|B)P(B)+ P(A|not B) P(not B)} is a simple non-controversial result. He presents and explains paradoxes that come from this formula. But these paradoxes have nothing to do with the controversy between frequentists and Bayesian. This application of Bayes theorem is simple probability theory that both frequentists and Bayesians agree on. So Aczel misleads you when he presents these problems as though they fall in the realm of Bayesian statistics. They do not. So for me that knocks my rating of the book down a notch. But I would give him five stars for his presentation of famous paradoxes in probability such as the waiting time paradox, the marriage problem, the Monte Hall problem and others. Game theory is another area where his presntation shines.He falls down again when describing the inferences that are made out of election polls. the correct way to look at it is a discrete estimation of a proportion which has a binomial distribution. The normal distribution only enters via the DeMoivre-LaPlace version of the central limit theorem. But when discussing election results Aczel makes a jump where it appear to the reader that he is saying that the proportion has a normal distribution rather than that the normal distribution is a good large sample approximation to the Binomial distribution for the number of successes related to the success proportion. Aczel seems to be consciencely avoiding the central limit theory as he doesn't even mention the theorem or the Binomial!So if I were to rate this book chapter by chapter, I would give 5 stars to chapter 1-15. Chapter 16 would only get 3 stars and chapters 17 and 18 only 2 stars. So the weakness in the last three chapters drops my overall ranking to 4."},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Roses","review":"I adore roses and when I first purchased my house, I got several books on the topic and planted several roses in my front entry.

Its not thrilling necessarily, but it was still good. Better than satisfactory. Archer is a man with a past who just wanted to make a clear start in Arkansas, rebuilding a house of a friend. But he soon saw the lovely Rita, a woman with a passion for gypsy earrings. They soon found each other, and then found themselves embroiled in a mystery in their strange neighborhood. Not only Archer was interested in the lovely Rita. Both characters were characters with a past, but they still found love with each other and believably still tried to fight it. Rita stood by Archer through some very hard times, and Archer couldn't seem to stay away from Rita even though he told himself to. The characters were likeable for the most part, but I sometimes felt the whole thing was moving too fast, which seemed OUT of character in how they were introduced. I also found the ending a bit too contrived and convenient, like the author had read one too many Agatha Christie novels and tried to be different, but made it too pat for my taste. But i still recommend this book."},{"Title":"BECK:Mongolian Chop Squad Volume 1 (Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad (Tokyopop))","review":"Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad is a must read for all Manga or Music lovers. I must warn you though the first 4 or 5 volumes are progress quite slowly but after that the series becomes highly addictive. I pulled an all nighter just to read the first 19 volumes.The series is still on going in Japan. The 23rd volume will released in Japan in July. Harold Sakuishi is a brilliant storyteller and he throws in tons of real life refrences in the series, like the osbournes in one the pages in the series.I know Tokyopop did a good job with bringing it over to North America becuase they hired the translator who were doing the scanlations of Beck. For those of you who do not know what scanlation is, It is when people scan the japanese manga and translate it into another language and release it for people to read. I could go on and on about how good the series is but you have to read it in order to believe it."},{"Title":"BECK:Mongolian Chop Squad Volume 1 (Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad (Tokyopop))","review":"It was AWESOME!!! It was so original, for manga. Most mangas are about some japanese super-hero who falls in love with a girl... blah, blah, blah... or else theyre about teens in school... Wh00t! come on ppl we go to school everyday! Beck, however, showed the life of an average kid, not a, super-hero or a perfect-bodied high-school kid. No, Beck is about the music BEHIND those perfect-bodied people. IT'S ABOUT ROCK AND ROLL!!! WOOHOOO!!!!Watever. i love manga, so im probably prejudice. Beck was great and i cant wait for the second one. YOU'LL LOVE IT!!! in fact im gonna go read it again... hmmm... :)"},{"Title":"Under Copp's Hill (American Girl History Mysteries)","review":"This book is spirited, only the &quot;ghosts&quot; here have real legs, and they walk right into today's world, as our own foremothers. The writer is talented enough to make the emotions real, without sugar-coating or preaching. Her sense of place is as good as her sense of people. The immigrant girls clash with the expectations of their own families about them, and find themselves in conflict with the granite-like solidity, self-assurance, and at times denseness of high-principled Yankee settlement workers (who cannot quite trust them). There is a mysterious theft which brings out the economic differences cruelly. Based on an historic settlement house in Boston's North End, where teenaged immigrants from Italy and Russia produced pottery that has now great collector value (Paul Revere Pottery's Saturday Evening Girls, in the Arts and Crafts style), eventual triumph is hidden in portents of disaster. In this story, understanding between the girls themselves foreshadows the eventual detente between different ethnic factions in later years, and celebrates the capacity of a great city, Boston, to nurture generations of new Americans. Those of us whose families partake of some (or in my case all) of the ethnic streams mentioned, can take an especially delicious satisfaction in sensing how but for some amazing grace, it wouldn't have turned out so well. I know Boston well enough to know how good this story is. It makes me want to read the others to connect with the history of other places. If this is where American Girl stories are going, it's a fine trend."},{"Title":"Under Copp's Hill (American Girl History Mysteries)","review":"That's the key question in this &quot;history mystery&quot;. The setting is Boston's North End in 1908. Innocenza &quot;Innie&quot; Moretti, an eleven-year-old girl, lives in a tenement with her Uncle Giovanni's family and her grandmother. Her parents were killed in a fire when she was only two. She loves the club for girls from immigrant families at the new settlement house in her neighborhood. Here she can listen to stories, borrow books, and make new friends. But when things begin disappearing from the settlement house, and other things turn up in odd places, suspicion fastens on Innie. Helped by her new friend, a Jewish girl from Russia named Matela, Innie must find out what is going on. Is there a thief, or is the house haunted?Readers of &quot;Under Copp's Hill&quot; experience late night vigils in an old cemetery and explore a dank old tunnel. The plot is not complicated, but there is plenty of tension for pre-teens as Innie tries to solve the mystery before she is kicked out of the club. Beyond that, the story also has something to say about the difficulties faced by immigrants in America in the early 1900's, and about how people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds could put their old-world differences behind them. All in all, this is another fine entry in the &quot;history mystery&quot; series. My daughter now ranks &quot;Under Copp's Hill&quot; as her second favorite of the nine we've read so far, behind only &quot;The Smuggler's Treasure&quot;. I recommend the entire series to young readers and their parents."},{"Title":"Under Copp's Hill (American Girl History Mysteries)","review":"Every since her Italian immigrant parents died in a fire when she was just two, Innie Moretti has lived with her grandmother in a tenament in Boston's North End. The year is 1908, and Innie is now twelve. When a settlement house for girls opens in her neighborhood, Innie is eager to attend, and join the library club. However, soon things start to dissapear from the house. Because she is thought of as a troublemaker due to several incidents that were not really her fault, Innie immediatley falls under suspicion for the thefts. If she doesn't prove that she is innocent, Innie will no longer be able to attend the library club, and reading is one of the few joys in her dreary, tedious, and difficult life.

As Innie and her cousins grow up surrounded by Italians from the old country they strive to become Americanized.

The settlement house these girls attended had a library club.When money and things go missing a thief is suspected. Innie is thought to be the guilty party, because of her reputation as a troublemaker. The mystery has no wild surprises or a red herring, but the story is well written. Ayers ascribes each character with a personality and the reader knows what to expect from them. The descriptions of the tenement houses and settlement house show readers what the era was like.Reading the book for enjoyment the reader will not be disappointed.

First published in 1926 when this new science of biology (that we all now take for granted) was the thing of wonder and mystery Kruif writes a timeless classic about the first explorers of the microbe universe.The writing is a bit heavy and the story is told in a dramatized fashion. Still, though, the book is a great read and very inspiring. A fascinating look into the world of science and discovery."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"This book is very out of date. Written in 1926 about pioneers in microbiology, it covers only the earliest achievements in the field. At the time of writing, penicillin was still two years away from being discovered by Alexander Fleming. The diphtheria vaccine had just been invented. But as a history book about the early days of microbiology, this book has yet to be surpassed. And this is why this book is so great. These diseases are scary when you read about the symptoms and perhaps people have forgotten how scary they are, resulting in the vaccine avoidance we unfortunately see today. The book was very thoroughly researched and written in very plain, very understandable language. Sometimes the author Paul de Kruif would put words into the microbiologists' mouths, such as stating what they must have been thinking at a certain time. But this just added to the fabric of the story. Unfortunately, some wording is now considered racist, but this was very minor given the context of the book. I strongly recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I am in the middle of this book, and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in science history. While the language and racial terms may be insulting to some(although that was how they spoke then) I like how he describes the passion those early scientists had, how they knew what they wanted and would do what they wanted to get it, risking their own health to do so.

If you buy this book for your budding scientist, however, be aware that the author shares the racial and social biases of his time and class (mid 1920's). As a result, the many chapters set in Africa are marred by language and attitudes towards Africans that most contemporary Americans would find very offensive.

If it were required reading, students would be pounding down the doors for the chance at a medical or scientific career. I was electrified at the discoveries and sacrifices made by these brave souls to learn the mysteries of disease. Some of the researchers used themselves as guinea pigs to discover causes and cures for the most devastating diseases of their times and died for their work. Transmission of malaria by mosquitoes; discovering germs; isolating various types of bacteria - these are the building blocks of modern medicine. If you know anyone going interested in the medical field or biology, this will give them a solid background in their careers."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I read it when I was a teenager. I still find it perhaps the best account on the early microbe discoverers. Chapters on Van Leeuwenhoek (first thing I did when I arrived in Holland was to look for his house, in Delft...), Spallanzani and Pasteur are masterpieces in itself. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I believe I would have chosen to pursue an education and career in microbiology whether I had read this book or not. Nevertheless, I'll always remember how scientifically inspiring it was for me to read Microbe Hunters for the first time (and many years have passed since then). De Kruif has a talent for dramatizing the actions, thoughts and discoveries of the scientists, making them think out loud on the pages, and giving the book a feel that is more like entertaining fiction than the history of science.Although I loved reading this book, I agree with the previous reviewer who advises that we should \\"...be aware that the author shares the racial and social biases of his time and class (mid 1920's)\\" as the book is marred by some passages that are (to say the least) objectionable in this respect, and highly distasteful by today's standards. This is a real shame, because were it not for such racial slurs this book would otherwise have been well suited to young people with an interest in science. Because of these issues, I don't recommend this as a book for kids. If you are among those who can overlook these shortcomings (at least temporarily, while reading the book), and take the book for what it is (i.e. a product of the very different times in which it was written), you will likely enjoy the spirited writing style that de Kruif uses so adeptly in portraying the history of microbiology.This book has been in print for an impressive length of time, especially considering the fact that the topic is science. I believe that major reasons for its longstanding popularity include that de Kruif used great storytelling techniques which allowed him to engage a broad audience of scientists and non-scientists alike in reading and enjoying Microbe Hunters. Despite the troubling aspects of the book mentioned above, I enjoyed it far too much to give it anything less than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I am a retired OB/GYN and this book started me on the course that led to about 4000 deliveries.

What you may not know is that the author was a first-rate scientist himself at the Rockefeller Institute who abandoned the lab to write.

I had read Microbe Hunters and so knew the effects of chemical drugs on the human body were usually disasterous. They dont work for long and they have horrendous side effects. I had to return to the hospital because getting into my own bed didnt have the therapudic effect I had hoped.I did get better in the hospital. I went home and back to work in two weeks. The doctors were astounded. They believed lithium had saved a person from a life of insanity.In 18 moths I had to stop taking lithium. I had mind blowing abdominal pain and uncontrolable bowel movements from it. My doctir insisted if I stopped taking it my mania would return full blown. Plus I would have withdrawl symptoms. In short he said i would lose my mind and they wouldnt be able to get me back.The lithium would have killed me so after a few months I secretly stopped taking it. My symptoms didnt come back. I didnt have withdrawl problems.Lithium had nothing to do with my recovery. My psychosis was triggerd by losing 30 pounds in a month. That wasnt on psychiatrys radar screen. I gained the weight back and the problem NEVER RETURNED. I was told I would never work again and the episodes would recur one or twice a year for the rest of my life.They didnt.Schizophrenia runs in my family.

It also includes some racial slurs that pop up out of nowhere--standard for the time, I'm sure, but startling and offensive nonetheless.Despite this, the book is a fast and interesting read, and provides a good deal of color for scientists whom most of us previously regarded as dry and distinguished. I don't know how much liberty he takes in building these characters, but I will now never forget Leeuwenhoek.The book ends with Paul Ehrlich in the early 20th century, so the past hundred years of infectious disease research obviously isn't covered. It's definitely a fun look at the history of science and disease, however, and I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I am amazed at the positive reviews. I purchased this book for a \\"nostalgia trip,\\" recalling that it was one of my favorite books in early adolescence, in a small, rural town, a high school with a marginal library, and few books in the science section. Upon reading it again, I was appalled at the poor quality of writing. No only is it clearly prejudiced, it is inexcusably so, even for 1926. That de Kurif did not later revise it to reflect a more objective perspective and a more lucid treatment seems inexcusable. Certainly, underneath the awkward prose and inexcusably obscure vocabulary there lies interesting recounts of scientific exploration, but for such a \\"classic,\\" a revision would have certainly been in order. Though I struggled through it, I am sure that in my youth I found it even more frustrating, underlying content notwithstanding. As a retired teacher, I would never suggest it to any young reader."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"Because so many eminent researchers point to this book as an inspiration, I was excited to read it. I was quite disappointed that the author is more than just a little racist. In the text, the noble white man saves the ignorant black, brown and yellow man described by the most vulgar of epithets. De Kruif may be a man of his time, but the attitude is nonetheless disturbing.

But come on, these scientists risked their lives and very often died trying to cure the sick in Africa. So can we can cut them a little slack for not being as gloriously enlightened as us, even if they were infintely braver ?People familiar with biethics or medicine will see a world where many ethical questions that had not been defined.

Part of our reading materials were The Hot Zone, Demon In The Freezer, and this wonderful book I've just finished, Microbe Hunters.Never have I read such wonderful books one right after the other. After I finished each one, I thought that one was the best book on microbes. They are all wonderful in their own ways, but this book on how it all started is endearing in that it was written so long ago (1926). When the author speaks of something happening in the 1890's, that's over a hundred years ago to us, but was just yesterday to the author.Today, we think of ourselves as medically advanced and very knowledgeable in science. However, one hundred years from now they will look at our methods and shake their heads in wonder at how we could have done such silly things. Likewise, we wonder about microbe hunters of 100 years ago. But we would be wise to understand the baby steps they all had to take to get us where we are today.This is truly a remarkable book on the history of how we got to where we are today. If only De Kruif could have written a similar book that takes us from 1926 until today. Alas, he died in 1971, having left us with a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"&quot;The Microbe Hunters&quot; charts the amazing shift in medical knowledge from both the historical and philisophical viewpoints. Dr. de Kruif's genius lies in the fact that he can transform the highly technical jargon of medicine into a compelling story of men versus nature. It is very readable!He maps the course that men such as Pasture and Koch blazed into the realm of scientific methodology that is still revered today. You will feel the heat of the battle as the individuals depicted herein challenged the conventional wisdom of their day and transformed medicine from superstition to a healing art.I was first introduced to the book in a class on microbiology, but obtained a true education in how curiosity, dedication and perserverance on the part of a few pioneers changed our view of nature forever. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to undrstand numan nature or the strange and wonderful word of pathogens. As a college professor I recomend this book to anyone who wants to find the inspiration for education in one book."},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"I read this book as a child and it was fascinating reading. Some of what is described is still current (Pasteur's rabies vaccine) while some treatments are long out of use (Ehrlich's \\"magic bullet\\" for syphillis was actually derived from arsenic and had a fair amount of side effects-an accurate cure would not be developed until the discovery of Penicillin). Also some of the attitudes taken by the writer are racist such as the quip along the lines that \\"you couldn't tell the Africans with sleeping sickness apart from the healthy ones because they were all lazy\\". This should remind people of the dichotomy that existed in society then. Also biology then was like a manic gold rush. There were no restrictions on testing medicenes so that famous scientific figures would test the treatments on friends, family or if they were brave, themselves. One thing that was strongly prevalent then was the optimism of a cure for the various diseases. There was no sense of a pharmeceutical industry trying to quickly bring to market a highly profitable drug, whether or not it was safe or effective or even more than slightly different from other medications. There was no sense of cynicism then. Once the germ theory was developed, people realized what lived amidst their world and sought to find ways to have people live better and healthier lives. So you can dismiss some of the outdated attitudes and ideology and see this book as specimen on a microscope slide, frozen in time, to be examined from a new perspective"},{"Title":"Microbe hunters","review":"We already owned one copy of Microbe Hunters but lent it out to a friend of ours who teaches high school science -- so we needed another copy. Microbe Hunters was recommended to me when I was interviewing a girl for a job at Borders bookstore. I asked her to tell me about her favorite book and she talked about Microbe Hunters with such passion that I HAD to find a copy.This is a great book to give to students of all ages who express a great deal of interest in biology, microbiology, medicine, or general history. The individual biographies are engaging and exciting as we travel with scientists through the breakthroughs in exploration of some of the smallest of our Earth's inhabitants.It should be noted to modern readers, and this is covered in the book's forward, that De Kruif uses some language and stereotypes that are unacceptable in modern society. In one of the last chapters in particular, De Kruif describes free black men as \\"negroes\\" and refers to them as belonging to someone else. He also describes black people as lazy. This only occurs briefly, but can still be a jarring while reading. With a concerted effort to understand (but not excuse) the author's social misunderstanding while not discounting the otherwise observant narrative, the racial issues do not ruin or overly detract from the amazing book.I highly recommend Microbe Hunters."},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"Schuyler Kaufman writes in a way that makes me feel like I was a part of each scene. I felt as if I was actually there, watching and listening to everything that was happening (from being on the movie set with everyone to being alone with only his letters to his daughter for company). Many of the scenes seemed quite familiar to me. For example, in the hospital room when the three women trash one of Matt's old movies and Matt walks in on it, I laughed and laughed as this is the type of thing I love to do with my best friend.In addition, the way she writes dialogue, I could easily hear the differences between different people's speech. For instance, when Pike, who is retired from NYPD, works with Quin, a local inspector, the clash of dialects makes their conversations that much more interesting and fun to read. Not to mention Kaufman's dry sense of humor, which worms its way even into the darkest scenes.When I read the book, I felt as if I were in Matt's head. Kaufman gives him his own individual expressions and ways of speaking. I love the way he exaggerates. For example, in the police interrogation scene he says, \\"The questions went on for several millennia;\\" or when the director complains that Matt doesn't act enough like a star, Matt replies, \\"Geez. I thought you wanted an actor, not a media event.\\"Another thing that I really like about the book is its realism. Coming from a family that has suffered divorces, I found the way Kaufman portrayed the children to be right on target. In addition, it was refreshing to become familiar with a caring and loving father who is not a \\"deadbeat dad.\\"The events and circumstances kept the mysteries lively, and kept me guessing throughout the book. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who likes a good mystery with terrific characters. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"I admit that I am a biased reader. Schuyler Kaufman asked me to read her manuscript before it was published, because she knew that my favorite pastime reading is mystery novels. I did not expect this manuscript to be so absorbing. With perhaps a little leaning toward the violent side, Dear Mouse is a well-crafted, traditional \\"cozy,\\" without the excessive sex, violence, and darkness that pervades much modern literature. The lead character, Matt Logan, is multidimensional; the dialogue portrays the characters vividly; the plot is intriguing; and the setting (the making of a movie) was fun to learn about. Now I'm eagerly awaiting the next Kaufman novel. (I hope I get a preview again.)"},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"This book was amazing. Lately I haven't been reading that much on the fiction scale, but it caught my attention. Dear Mouse, has special meaning to me. Not only was it a so-called Christmas present, but one of the caractors takes on my name. I was able to connect with this book. Recently I lost my son so the emotions were there that were triggered by this mans loss. It was always my feelings that I could still write notes to him even though he couldnt read. I was also enchanted by the way Schuyler was able to give each caractor their own personality. It made the book that much more interesting. Usually I guess what is going to happen in a book, then when I find out I was right,I dont want to read anymore. Towards the end when I find out what is going on, I couldnt put it down. I HAD to find out what happened to that adorable little girl. It was a great book. There are now about four people waiting in line to read my copy. They are all itching to find out what happens. I would recomend this book to anyone looking for a little mystery that isnt too gory. Great reading material.

How soon?"},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"Had the tag trailing the title for this mystery novel indicated moviemaking in glitzy Hollywood rather than in the Carolina mountains, I would have had no interest. But the contributions of an Appalachian environment on actors and actresses is another matter. Put another way, the industry there is not so big that it can keep out unwanted influences. And so the Bellers, a familiar family name, are everywhere; and although they could show up in many forms, in this story they appear frequently as \\"trash-Bellers.\\" One of these, Crystal Beller, is the first to be murdered, and she is of immediate interest because others say of her that she can become anyone in her desire to be a starlet. Of course, such a statement is really doubly interesting, in addition to being a nice device to spread the mystery, because it suggests that those saying it may be capable of the same subterfuge. Written in the form of an epistolary novel, letters from a recovering alcoholic father/leading man to his young daughter, this novel introduces numerous characters in order to confound the deductive reader, and each succeeds in the mission if the reader lends to it his or her own contribution of subtle thinking. At the same time, the form often denies the extended description of a character here or there-you wouldn't expect Matt Logan to fully detail someone to his little girl. It also denies the more evocative descriptions of the beautiful Carolina mountains and that, perhaps, is a fault. But overall, the story runs true from beginning to end and was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"Her professional background in &quot;The Winter People&quot; gives Kaufman authenticity. She has a refreshing voice and is able to present an intriguing picture of what goes on in the filming of a movie. Kaufman's hero, Matt Logan draws your sympathy, but not your pity.

It would be hard to feel much sympathy for this guy if his love for his child, whom he has nicknamed Mouse, didn't shine through everything he tells us. We experience all of Matt's trials in the pages of a journal he is keeping, addressed to his daughter. The story follows Matt through his recovery from his injuries, his fight against alcohol and his movie comeback as a rakish, scar-faced villain in a low-budget &quot;horror romance,&quot; being filmed in the mountains of North Carolina. It is here that all his problems finally come together, for better or for worse, culminating in a gut-wrenching struggle for the future of a child.The dialogue is brisk and filled with dry humor, the action sometimes brutal, unsparing of the weak-kneed among us, but always, there is that thread of tenderness.

He is not allowed to see his little girl whose ten-years-old, and so he journals, and the book is his journal. I got two or three pages in the book when I was cheering to get Matt Logan, the movie star back with his daughter called Mouse, even if he is an alchoholic (but he is sobered up in the book.)The characters are like people you might know. One of the things about \\"Dear Mouse\\" that I liked best was the conversations. They all talk in slightly different ways, so that you know whose talking, even without seeing \\"He said\\". Another thing is that since the book is Matt's journal we get to know what he is thinking. Sometimes he adds things up wrong, and you can see that he is making a mistake.Another thing I liked about \\"Dear Mouse\\" is, that it reads fast and easy. Schulyer Kaufman writes like real people talk, so its like you can hear them talking even while you are reading.I have to say that I guessed who the killer was before the last chapter, but the reason why the murder was done is a real shocker. When the killer finally gets it, I cheered out loud. And the ending was not your typical Hollywood happy-happy-joy-joy ending, it was real. After I finished the book I wanted to read the next one, to see what happens next.So I want to say to Schulyer Kaufman: \\"More more more!\\""},{"Title":"Dear Mouse: A Tale of Love, Murder and Movie-Making in the Carolina Mountains","review":"Matt Logan, a famous movie actor, has just been released from the hospital after surgery to reconstruct his face after a drunk-driving accident. His 7-year-old daughter was sitting alongside him. He is about to begin a year of community service and rehab, and he wants to see his daughter, who was unhurt in the crash, even though his estranged wife has attained a restraining order against him. As he waits outside her school, his wife's lawyer comes up behind him and reminds him that he is in contempt of court. He only gets to watch her from 500 feet away.As the novel progresses, Matt begins to put his life back together, going to AA meetings and working on a new movie in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains. It is here that a whole new set of problems arises for him.For fans of the genre, Schuyler Kaufman's first novel, Dear Mouse... will satisfy more than just the desire for a \\"whodunit.\\" Besides being a murder-mystery, Ms. Kaufman's novel, written from Matt's perspective as a series of journal entries in the form of letters to his daughter, who he refers to as Mouse, is about a recovering alcoholic father trying to reconstruct his life and reunite with his daughter, while both working on a movie and being suspected for the murder of a young wannabe starlet who once tried to seduce him.Ms. Kaufman provides an unsentimental view of a recovering alcoholic while weaving a subtle mystery into an interlocking tale of love, lies, and redemption. In developing her characters, she allows them to be seen as real people with vulnerabilities and fears, who don't always speak in polished sentences or behave in the most elegant manner. For this she is to be praised, and for the sarcastic wit that sometimes shines through in her prose.For example, there is a scene in which the seductive starlet tries to blackmail Matt and the movie's director into giving her a role by threatening them with accusations of rape. The director calmly points toward a video camera in the corner of the room with the red light blinking that recorded the whole affair. After she storms off, embarrassed and angry, Matt worries that she will sell her story to the tabloids, but the director says to him, \\"She won't go near it. Stupid people can't stand being laughed at.\\"In another scene of equally sarcastic ridicule, Matt approaches a receptionist at the tabloid newspaper office to diffuse an embarrassing story about himself that has just been printed. Ms. Kaufman's receptionist ignores his request completely and begins to rattle off her favorite things about his previous movies, \\"with a true fan's disregard for time or convenience.\\"There is one other instance where Ms. Kaufman's dry humor particularly stands out. In two sentences she caricaturizes the five major American news channels and their typical tongue-in-cheek positions. As Matt hears the news from the front desk clerk at the hotel where the cast is staying, we read, \\"NBC says you did it, CBS says you'll get off because you're famous, ABC says you'll get nailed because you're famous. Fox says you're innocent. CNN won't say.\\" At points like this Ms. Kaufman is at her most entertaining.However, such scenes are sometimes interspersed with awkward phrases like \\"Ah, geez\\" and convoluted constructions with questionable word choices like \\"Coffee was created, \\" which even in context is difficult to read. These slips hinder the reader's concentration. Ms. Kaufman's attempts at making her characters seem real often fails when she uses such terms and constructions. Also, there is a sublte desire for the novel to seem deep when it really isn't.There is a darker side to this novel, one that reveals a shadowy undertone in Ms. Kaufman's storytelling. We learn of a young girl, about the same age as Matt Logan's daughter, who, having heard about his separation from his own daughter, writes letters to him and sort of adopts him as a surrogate father. Her own father molests her, and she uses her letters to Matt as a mental escape. Matt comes to look on her letters as an inlet into his own daughter's life, which he is not allowed to be a part of. His sympathy and sense of helplessness to rescue her is as genuine and wrenching as if she were his own.In all, Ms. Kaufman has written a subtly dark mystery with a disturbing yet hopeful surprise ending. The local flavor she supplies with her references to known landmarks and her use of colloquialisms makes this book a fairly enjoyable and quick read for mystery enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 17, Job 1-20 (clines), 617pp","review":"Don't take my word for it--you will find this commentary rightly and highly praised elsewhere, for example,Old Testament Commentary Survey.In keeping with the WBC format, Clines engages a vast literature on the subject very thoroughly and helpfully. But you won't be reading this simply for the guidance it gives on the literature-to-date. You'll be struck by the compelling way Clines introduces us to the character of Job and his friends, by highlighting the nodal verses and hence, the tone of each passage. You will appreciate as a result that the friends are not simply two-dimensional foils for Job's speeches, but us--us insofar as the problem of suffering is not only the problem of the innocent sufferer, but the problem of how to respond to innocent suffering. What would you have said to Job--especially if you thought he was fatally wrong?Your eyes will pop out of your head when you realize that Clines is quite right that Job is not grieving for his losses--not even the loss of his children, not even for his own physical suffering. He is by turns undone, outraged, flabbergasted, and furious that life itself makes no sense. This fact, which we-as-the-friends quite predictably miss, leads to sufferer and would-be comforters talking at cross-purposes, as so often happens in the midst of despair.The only problem with Clines, of course, is that it took forever for him to get around to Part 2 (Job 21-37 (Word Biblical Commentary))--which still leaves us waiting with the persistence of Job ('patience' is a mistranslation) for the final chapter."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 17, Job 1-20 (clines), 617pp","review":"Clines commentary will prove very helpful in a study of Job. It is a detailed, verse by verse exposition, offering concluding section summaries at the end of each discourse as well.He generally presents the most common interpretations of a passage and references those who hold to various positions. This commentary is worth picking up if even just for that purpose: He shows a good knowledge of the work that precedes his on Job. Often however, his descriptions of these positions, especially when he disagrees with them, becomes muddled and summarized to the point of becoming a strawman. Nevertheless, he references well, so it is easy to find a fair description of dissenting views.The following are concerns that I have of Clines' exegesis: Clines' position on the time of Job's writing is in the 7th-2nd centuries BC. So he takes what is commonly viewed as a citation of Job in other OT writings, to be Job's author quoting other biblical authors. Although I have had a tough time finding clear indication of what Clines thinks of Job's belief in the afterlife, it seems to be consistent that he portrays Job as not believing His day before God would really ever occur (i.e. no afterlife). Furthermore, he takes 19:25 \\"I know that my Redeemer lives\\" and other passages traditonally ascribed to Job's wavering but existent faith in God's faithfulness and justice (and prophetic of Christ) as Job's expression of hope in himself and his cause.Despite these significant concerns, I still recommend that you purchase this commentary for any serious study of Job. It is thorough, well documented, and offers good explanation of the commentators reasoning on the meaning of various passages."},{"Title":"Latino Sun, Rising: Our Spanish-Speaking U.S. World","review":"I received this book still in the plastic and was very satisfied with my purchase."},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"Great reference books, lots of misspelling for italian words/recipes.

Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not \\"food traditions\\" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts. All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.4. The \\"pie floater\\" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing. Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.7. In New Zealand, food is not \\"simple\\" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration. In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes.

Sidebars highlight countries and particularly important topics like sauces. There aren't a lot of photos, but the text is well written and crystal clear.There is no throwaway content. In true encyclopedia format, it starts immediately with the \\"A\\" entries and proceeds through \\"Z\\" - no prefaces, introductions, etc. There are two indexes, a general index which usefully ties related entries together (think about it - you don't need an A-Z index for the entries themselves), and a recipe index. Both are brief and to the point. Although this is a huge volume of approximately 1,300 pages, it lies flat when opened. This is a reference volume meant for quick and easy use.Larousse has been in print since 1938. The professionals who endorse it read like a who's who in cooking, starting with the quote from Jacques Pepin on the inside of the dust jacket: \\"The Larousse is the first place I look when I need to clarify a cooking question. The greatest reference book.\\"Essential."},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"I have an older copy, one from the 1960s, but this book is absolutely essential to serious cooking.

It does this task masterfully with clear language and a complete list of all that is valuable. There are some modern updates and references that include some American and Asian terms, but outside of France and Europe the information is less detailed and accurate.

The stiffness inherent in translation shows; among other things, Larousse uses the wonderfully awkward term &quot;cookery correspondent&quot; to mean a food writer. Try looking up common American edibles--the martini, say, or meatloaf--and you'll get nowhere. French toast is listed as a dessert, not a breakfast.If you can put up with occasional snootiness, though, you're in for a treat. This is good enough to be read, paged through, nibbled at like a fine cheese, as it's as much a history book as a reference.

If the book is heavy, it's because it's the foundation of every other cookbook you could own. Certianly &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; is also remarkable in this respect, but if you want to rise about just being good, Larousse will teach you. Yes it is Franco-centric but deservedly, the French have a culinary legacy second to none in the world and the techniques you learn in Larousse will serve you well no matter if cooking Chinese, Italian, or even New American.The four foundations the book synthesizes are: Technique, Tools, Ingredients, and Creativity. Ever wanted to know the essence of celery? Just how an egg does all the things that it does? Larousse will tell you. Similary, with tools, Larousse is an illumination. If Williams Sonoma ever seemed superfluous, Larousse will shock you into realizing there are advantages to owning copper pots, balanced wisks, and a bombe mould or two. Correct tools are essential to exemplary results.Larousse is not a dead book of &quot;ancient regime&quot; heavy sauces (though they are included), but rather a living book, inspirational in its depth. If it can be accused of being stodgy, and it has, it's because it wants to emphasize the basics of cooking and, once that is mastered, leaves you free to go out on your own. Once the four foundations have been mastered it's up to you to excel. That's not to say there aren't complex and difficult recipes, there are; but they tend to be more traditional though make no mistake, the top chefs of France have contributed recipes to Larousse.There are shortfalls. As noted before it does not cover the other grande cuisines of the world (namely Chinese and Italian) with anything remotely resembling a catholic perspective, but then it doesn't purport to be an all-encompassing cookbook. As a book it is dry and its emphasis on exact, rigid technique seems rather imperious. While the haughty tone may seem to be a fault, it's actually worded so as to express the exact requirement of a task in the clearest terms. When you get to the highest levels of cooking techniques there is no room for error. You're dealing with physical and chemical properties that require exact processes to succeed. Pull them off and you'll amaze yourself.If you learn to cook using Larousse Gastronomique and follow it faithfully, there won't be a cuisine in the world you can't tackle or a cooking task you won't perform without confidence. I can't say that about any other cookbook."},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"I just bought the 1969 first edition for $45 at a used shop. I hadn't noticed that the modern version reviewed here was actually on remainder for 5 bucks less -- the cashier pointed this out to me, and I went back to compare. There was a note in the old edition saying \\"This (better) ed OP\\". I trust my local bookshop, so I put them side by side, and was shocked to find that a *large* number of recipes have been excised from the original edition. In some cases it's merely the omission of a few variations under a heading [see \\"achar\\" -- from 3 recipes to 1 in the new], but in many cases it's a wholesale excision [see \\"ketchup\\" -- no recipe in current version AFAICT].I believe very much in cookbooks that do one thing and do it right -- ethnic cookbooks dedicated solely to their particular cuisines. A grand unified cookbook is a noble undertaking, but in this edition it appears that depth has been sacrificed to include a broader range of items in less-than-ideal detail.I have been saddened in recent years to see the great cookbooks watered down or losing focus -- the new Joy of Cooking feels much the same to me when compared to my mother's version.Bottom line: Larousse had a great vision -- an encyclopaedia of *French* Cuisine. The addition of other cuisines by the editors should not have been undertaken without the same attention to detail. The end result is still a massive and relevant book, but lacks the focus and truly stunning depth of the original.If they decide to compile a 10,000-page multivolume compendium, then we'll be talking. Until then, I'm sticking with the older editions."},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"This weighty, 1200 page volume is a reliable gold standard among culinary works. It should not surprise that it is originally a work published in French (Larousse is a major French publisher that specializes in encyclopedic volumes on many subjects). The inevitability of the volume is based on the premier place of French cuisine on the world stage and on the very European tradition of publishing great omnibus works on just about every subject imaginable. It was Diderot in 17th century France who invented the encyclopedia and great references in most subjects are available in French or German or even Italian long before they are available in English.The blurb on the front of my edition states that the Larousse Gastronomique is the \`World's Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia'. I cannot judge this statement for volumes available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Hindi, or Arabic. But, in English, this is undoubtedly true. This statement is true not only for the size of the volume, but for the great range of subjects the editors have chosen to include. The entries cover all the obvious things such as vegetables, meats, fish, shellfish, herbs, spices, fruits, and spice mixtures.On these subjects, the writers do not limit themselves to a simple description of appearance, taste, seasonality, geographic distribution, and a statement of culinary uses. It includes representative recipes for almost all basic foodstuffs, the number depending on the relative importance of the food. The entry for aubergines (eggplant) includes a general recipe for the preparation of the vegetable plus eight recipes within the article itself plus references to eight other recipes under other articles. The drawings or photographs accompanying articles on major foodstuffs like aubergines are truly first rate. I am pleased, but not surprised at this, as I have come to expect European editors to do as good or better job of illustrating books than American publishers, especially where these illustrations are an important aspect of the work. Regarding the illustrations in general, the genius of the editors is in the great variety of media used in the pictures. Where technical detail is important, color drawings are used to focus on the important and hide the incidental in pictures of raw ingredients, for example. Where a prepared dish is pictured, photographs are typically used. Where the subject is a geographical or historical subject, the first choice is usually an historical engraving, painting, or cartoon.If the book covered no more than these foods, it would be a valuable work indeed, but it also covers such diverse subjects as geographical regions of culinary interest such as Provence, both common and rare kitchen tools such as the autoclave and the bain marie, culinary songs such as chants used by street vendors in Paris, types of eating establishments such as caf&eacute;, bistro, and restaurant. One of my favorite things is to be looking for a particular entry and run across some other totally appropriate, yet totally unexpected entry. My most recent find is an article on the traditional fraternal orders and associations of culinary professionals in place in France, some since the Middle Ages. This relatively long article is accompanied by full color pictures of the robes worn by members of these orders.The range of subjects covered by the book is quite international, but there is a clear emphasis on French techniques, history, produce, and dishes. The coverage of wine and cheese around the world is extensive, as these products are so important to French gastronomy. Some subjects that are very important to Asian cuisines get relatively little attention. Soy gets a half page article, and miso gets no more than a paragraph. Lemons get a page and a half, yet lemongrass has no article at all. On the other hand, techniques for butchering a chicken get two full pages.I do not often refer to the Larousse Gastronomique for recipes, but it is always my reference of last resort when all other sources fail. The only culinary question on which it is mute is on substitutions. A replacement for buttermilk can be found in any number of lesser references, yet the Gastronomique simply does not cover this.The Larousse Gastronomique is simply the essential reference to French technique, ingredients, culinary history, and geography. Get this before you get your Julia Child and your Jaques Pepin and your Patricia Wells. I seriously doubt if the latest editions have any significant improvements over used editions of thirty or even fifty years ago. Just be sure to get one in good condition. You will refer to it often.Essential."},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"I kept 3 editions of this important title. No doubt on its authoritativeness. This new 2001 edition caught my immediate attention when I first saw it. I browsed thru it nearly from cover to cover. There are some newer entries not listed before (the 1984 ed), e.g., tiramisu. However, information on other cuisines is brief, e.g., only 2 pages on Spanish cuisine.

The recipient is happy, but I'm a bit disapointed. Though the new scheme makes distinguishing recipies a snap (red titles), the typeface is steril and the number and interest of photographs has declined substantially, largely consisting of full-page stock photo stuff.Nevertheless, a great book, but one that has lost some of its beauty.

I still have many topics to go, it will probably take me all year to complete this book.Often I have used this book as a dictionary to find out about a type of food and it has been the topic of many a conversation with friends.This book is not a recipe book nor for the faint hearted and a sound knowledge of the French language is a definate advantage since so many culinary terms are in French and not translated (and often not even translatable), this book assumes that you already have the basic cullinary language before you start.This is not a book that I would take a chance on buying as a gift for anyone unless they had specified an interest.A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Larousse Gastronomique: The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine & Cookery","review":"This book is not what I thought it would be after reading the reviews here, and, had I looked at in a store, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

If you like just learning about different kinds of food and regions, this book will provide you endless amounts of reading time. It is, without a doubt, an \\"interesting\\" book on my shelf, and I turn to it if I'm looking for ideas for a particular ingredient I'm not familiar with. Then, once I have an idea of what I can do with it, I turn to my other cookbooks and the internet for detailed recipes.All that said, if you are trying to develop some basic cooking skills, this is not the book to shell out $$$ for.

The author is a military man of action, and the military training is evident in his spare, lean and incisive style of writing. Both his understanding and explanation of the complexities of U.S. military history are distilled into easily comprehensible prose which reads more like a tale of high adventure than an olive drab historical account. The delightful and refreshing aspect of this particular book lies in the manner in which the author intertwines his own lengthy and personal travels to a deeper faith and belief in God with his understanding and perception of American history. His observations of the actions of the hand of God at critical times in our nation's history are supported with impeccable research from disparate and unlikely sources which adds significantly to the credibility of his writing. It is just a remarkable book, and should be quite well-received in these turbulent times."},{"Title":"God in the Trenches: A History of How God Defends Freedom When America Is At War","review":"The author presents a timely and compelling account of a real God changing the lives of real people in a real world. Many who live in our post-modern culture know little or nothing about the recorded history of God's redemptive acts which have been directed toward man for at least 4,000 years. The author fills this void. As a marine, Mr. Spivey apparently served his country well. As an author, he has served his God well. Many are saying that the tragic events of September 11 are a wake-up call for America.

While it might be easy to dismiss this as pure conjecture, those who are open to the possibility of God's influence in the course of our military history will find this fascinating reading.

The whole concept is counter Biblical and bad doctrine."},{"Title":"St. Hubert's Stag","review":"John Lindermuth's second novel carries a little more emotional weight than did his first. This is the main reason I give St. Hubert's Stag five stars to Schlussel's Woman's four. Both of Mr. Lindermuth's novels display a very professional, mature writing style that showcases both the author's vocabulary and his attention to regional dialect. There are a few too many proofreading errors, and the cover does not present an accurate picture of the subject matter. However, St. Hubert's Stag manages to squeak by with five stars hanging from its antlers based on the detailed accuracy of its small-town Americana surrounding poignant family relationships.The storyline has been discussed enough elsewhere on this page. The plot surrounds a family of traditional deer hunters who variously harbor and share secrets that are key to the feelings expressed among the family members and other townspeople close to them. St. Hubert's Stag takes its title from the religious legend of a great, black stag that roams the nearby countryside unseen by most of the local hunters. Like the movie Ordinary People, or the more modern American Beauty, Lindermuth's novel is a quiet, mature little book for quiet, mature readers. The action in the plot is rarely on the surface, but boiling underneath. Coming from just such a small town where deer hunting was a passion for most men, I could easily identify with the storyline. St. Hubert's Stag brings back lost recollections of my dad, and that's what it does best."},{"Title":"St. Hubert's Stag","review":"All families have problems, concerns, and/or events that cause ripples through all time for generations. These events can destroy or strengthen.There is a lot going on that the reader doesn't know right away. We're given the questions and while enjoying John Lindermuth's rich descriptive text, we find out.Can this family and their friends survive the truths brought out by one old, sick man's last hunting trip; the strain of the truth, guilt from the past, and an empty place at the table?Reviewed by Wanda C. Keesey"},{"Title":"St. Hubert's Stag","review":"Have you ever read a story by a natural-born storyteller and gone back to a time to meet characters you had never known, yet come away with a feeling of having gone home? That's how St. Hubert's Stag will make you feel if you enjoy visiting small-town folks who live ordinary lives, but are very interesting people.Jake Keller is an ailing, aging man determined to have one last hunt in his beloved woods, the place that has always felt like his real home. Nothing, anyone can say will make him change his mind. The desire is like a fever in his blood and must run its course. And, while hunting, he is forced to confront his mortality.The very talented John Richard Lindermuth has taken a patch of woods, a very small town, and peopled them with characters you will miss when you close this book with a satisfied sigh and wish it had been longer. You'll get to meet Jake's son, Andy, who keeps a small store, his wife Janet and their son Nipper. In the background lurk a wonderful assortment of people who come to life on these pages and make the story move.Highly recommended as a pleasant way to spend some time. This is a tale you can read again and learn something new about the characters. A keeper. Enjoy. I sure did."},{"Title":"Build Your Vocabulary Skills! A Quick And Easy Method","review":"I've been using this system for three months and I've thoroughly learned the basic definitions of the 400+ words that I didn't know before. I've found that in many cases after repeated drills I can jump over the &quot;key&quot; and &quot;link sentences&quot; and just instantly recall the definitions. The book didn't point that out. They emphasized that you should go step-by-step. But after a while I can dispense with the steps.

It certainly isn't a balanced perspective of anyone. All of us have challenges and if you are a fan of John Denver, you are aware of his. Out of respect for his family, his children and Annie, it's not necessary to give voice to every indiscretion. Rather, let's realize that none of us look well under a microscope and focus on the good his work is accomplishing and the joy and insight his music brought us all. &quot;Take Me Home,&quot;John's own autobiography, is a good place to start. If I could rate this woman's book any lower I would."},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"As a family member I was shocked. The author is just trying to capitalize on a one-night-stand.

Anyone who respects John, as she claims to, would never had written such a thing. I am sure it would not have been written if he were still alive. I am sure he would not be happy to know that this is out there available for anyone to read. It would have been better left unsaid. A one night stand with a celebrity is not love. It comes off sounding like something written by some giddy school girl, not by a grown woman at least in her 40's. This is a warning to any true John Denver fan. Do not buy this book. Donate the money to some worthy cause instead."},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"This book was apsolute trash. Don't buy it. It's hardly about John Denver.

Hey, sex with a star-far-from-home isn't love."},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"John Denver fans, PLEASE, PLEASE, take the money you would have spent on this book and donate it to one of John's many foundations. This book is total exploitation at it's best with no regard to John's fans or family.

It is obvious that she wanted to use John to try and give herself a career. To this day, i have never heard of this woman and I probably never will. Most of the book is about St. Marie herself. There is only around one chapter that focuses on John at all.If it were me, and i had \\"relations\\" with a star I would be quite embarrased and I certainly would not want the world to know about it.So, if you want to read about a flight attendent who worked on airlines back in the 1970's this book is for you!but, if you want to read about John Denver... This is not for you!!"},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"As a John Denver fan and an avid reader, I found this book to be nonsense.The writer(?)made her indiscretions and New Age beliefs sound as if she were destined to have a night of hot sex with a lonely musician/songwriter.The more ridiculous this story became, the faster I skimmed, looking for some redeeming value.

He had enormous talent and charisma. &quot;John Denver and Me&quot; captures all of it. It's a well written book that COULD have been a trashy &quot;tell all&quot; but clearly this author had enormous respect for the man and his talent and went to the trouble to painstakingly research his life.

The author had the rare opportunity to know John when he was at the height of his career, and shares the events leading up to their spiritual encounter. I truly enjoyed the book. It's classy."},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"Yes, I found the book very interesting, but then, I always find \\"anything\\" very interesting (good or bad) if it's about John Denver. I have heard and read that a few of his fans weren't too excited about this book. Maybe it's because they are mostly women and they were a bit jealous. I've yet to meet a female JD fan who wouldn't have loved to have been in Jeannie's shoes that night. As a JD male fan, I must admit I've had a bit of a crush on Annie and I would have loved (and still would love)to have the chance to get to know her. It could happen! You never know.On the \\"reminder\\" side of this summary, I love to be reminded why we all love this man and his music so much. Jeannie did a good job of summing that all up and there's nothing more that I can add to that. But I will forever love to be reminded. And I am, each and every day, as I listen to his music to and from work in my car. At lunch time and while doing yard work, I liten to him on my iPod.

Sure it might be cool for your friends to know that you were intimate with John but was it really worth a few bucks to share what he probably thought was between you two. I guess I just see things different. Why now? What do you think Johns mother or any of his three children would think about reading your book, how would they feel.

She leaves out the names of people involved in her life and is very vague about dates. I give it one star only because, as a previous review stated, it does satisfy some of the curiosity that some people may have about what it would be like to be alone with John.

John was a human being with faults - he was single & lonely, she was waiving it in his face...so he did what any red-blooded unattached male would do.

The story is interesting, and her events of meeting her &quot;idol&quot; was intriquing and heartwarming. She backs up her book with musical background of the artist and a short bio on the man.She does a bit of jumping around with dates throughout her chapters which makes the reading sometimes a bit hard to read, but otherwise it is an easy and simple read that is entertaining.

And most of the composers and musicians of our time will be forgotten. Yet millions of people will still listen to the music and the voice of John Denver with the same reverence and passion that our generation holds for the classical composers such as Beethoven and Mozart. Here is a book which evokes those passions because it is such an intimate look at a musical and a humanitarian force in our lifetime who has touched the lives and emotions of so many. This book offers a very personal insight to John Denver's capacity for opening his heart to others, to his boundless energy to give and receive love, to his unique ability to provoke deep-seated feelings with his music and to his leadership in arousing generosity in others by the way he led his life. And what a fantasy come to life this book tells. Imagine being infatuated with your idol whose music has seen you through so many episodes in your life and then meeting that person and having an intense, albeit brief, relationship with them - like a dream come true. Some people have a companion for 20 years and do not have the kind of intimacy and connection that the author had with John Denver both from being with him and from afar. No doubt this book will inspire feelings of jealousy and indignity for those who regard John Denver as practically a god and who believe that we mortals are not entitled to know him on such a personal level. But the truth is, John Denver was a man -- with a rare and special gift of creating music and delivering it in a way that makes our lives richer. We can be grateful for a book that not only gives us a very personal look at John Denver but also provides a close look into what inspired such timeless music that will be ours to relish for generations to come."},{"Title":"John Denver and Me","review":"Jeannie St. Marie worked hard to accomplish many of her goals.

Set in 1950s Kansas City, the authorial narrator recreates his own childhood when he competed for the affection and attention of his father with his brother, Ned Jumper. The catch is that Ned is a fictional, Tom Swift-type boy adventurer who the narrator's father spends most of his time creating. Both Ned and the narrator are troubled by their own troubled sense of reality and identity. This entertaining and utterly compelling novel follows both of their adventures as the struggle to find themselves and a suitable world in which to live. In a third narrative thread we follow the adventures of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone and the ghost of nineteenth century naturalist John Burroughs as they caravan touring Buicks on a tour of the Mid-West.\\" With hilarious synchronicity, the three threads are ingeniously brought together with a surprising explosion of reality-blending, ontological fireworks in one of the most original fantasies I've read since Jorge Luis Borges or Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams. Filled with wit and wisdom, it is a novel that is not afraid to be intelligent as it dances playfully along the border of literature and popular escapist fiction. After a long (twentieth) century of angst-ridden fiction about dysfunctional people, it's good to read a serious and thought-provoking work of literature that is essentially joyful and happy.Thomas Beltzer, author of Parcheesi Blues"},{"Title":"Riding with the Magi","review":"This book closes like my childhood bedroom door did occasionally, on a party full of people, releasing their joys and sorrows, all together.

It's always appreciated."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I snagged this book off the shelf before my son was born. THe name and cover brought back old Boy Scout nostalgia, I flipped thought it and decided to buy it.It's is the best book of rnew dads I have come across. It doesn't cover everything, but it's a bunch of practical suggestions and observations.THe biggest thing this book does is make you want to read it. Other books may have more information, but they are dull to read.

People have been giving me all kinds of books to help me prepare. The problem with those books? BORING. And don't address a lot of the realistic problem you'll encounter. I bought this book for daddy to be because it looked fun, and those are the only kinds of books he likes. When it arrived, he and I actually paged through it with a friend, laughing at the pictures and enjoying the practical advise given.All in all, we've both read it front to cover now and we plan to give it to other friends that are expecting."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband loves this book. It's the only pregnancy book for dads he will read. He says it's the only one that doesn't make him feel stupid. :) I agree; there is a huge difference between this book and all others I've seen so far. Most make little jokes about men being clueless; this one is just a no-nonsense guide tailored for men.The page that convinced us to buy it was about the \\"decoy drawer,\\" a trick to distract babies from your important gadgets elsewhere. The book is full of tips you'd never think of like that. While it's definitely directed toward men, it has some things I found helpful as well. It also seemed to get my husband a little more interested in the coming baby. He looks forward to using some of the tricks in this book much more than picking bassinets, decorating the nursery, etc.The book prepares men for the first year with a new baby. I only wish they had one to get my husband through this pregnancy!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I'm a new dad and I love this book. I'm a younger father (25-30 range) and this book's sense of humor and direct-style really spoke to me. The info is useful and presented in a way that will help you remember it. If you're an expecting father and want the basics with some nifty bonus tips, go pick this up.

I have read nearly every \\"how to raise a baby\\" book and this one I found the most useful & fun to read. The \\"Everything You Need To Know\\" series could learn a thing or two from this book about how to incorporate personality into their overwhelming barrage of information."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Read this book 3 times before the baby was born, because it was so funny. Several of the nurses in the hospital saw it and wrote down the name of the book so that they could recommend it to other new fathers.

I have been trying to be very involved and informed in all aspects of our pregnancy and into the child raising years. Although I am a teacher, I am very nervous about raising a child that I am 100% accountable for.This book has provided not only the necessary information on most subjects, it has provided the much needed sense of humor. I was reading and laughing a lot, so my wiofe and family needed to have it read aloud so they didn't feel left out on my own little jokes. I highly recommend this to any father to be who needs info and laughs."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband since we're TTC our first. He wouldn't put it down once I gave it to him. He loved it and learned a lot from it also. He would follow me around the house giving me helpful tidbits! I read it and loved it as well. Very funny. Very informative. Great book for those who are planning to be parents!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"We loved this book so much that it's now our standard gift for 1st time parents-to-be.

Not your average baby book!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My fiance was given this and I think I had as much fun reading it as he did. The advice is very practical and sound and presented humorously. Lots of wit and useful information. I highly recommend for Dad and Mom, too."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"At first glance, Be Prepared looks like it might be a joke book. The bright yellow handbook format cover shows a child in a backpack strapped onto a smiling, manly fellow in a lumberjack shirt. Front backpack straps replace the man's suspenders, baby bottle, rattles and other toys are at his waist, toolbelt style, and a pacifier dangles from a strap in his fingers. It captures attention.Likewise, the inside of the book captures attention with well designed layout and graphics. Readers recognize the content, presented with abundant wit and style, is playful but not a joke. This is a creative, purposeful production with solid, helpful information delivered in fun, maybe over-the-top, masculine terms, but quite real.With useful, pithy information in easily assimilated chunks, and a fun filled, \`can-do/here's how', unsentimental attitude, this nuts-and- bolts manual attracts expectant and new dads the way their beloved Worst-Case Scenario books used to, but with more usable material that really will help prepare them for parenting, appreciate their baby, and boost their confidence. Dads who know how to care for their infants are more likely to participate in care and strengthen parent-child attachment from the start. This interesting book imparts the preparatory knowledge well indeed.It is organized in five general sections by age, from newborn to one year, with basic information about normal development and needs, and appropriate fatherly responsibilities and skills. Mindful, entertaining, diagrammed instructions for hundreds of such necessities as diapering, stimulating, soothing, bathing, swaddling, burping, reading Sports Illustrated with the baby, and recognizing types of crying, are laid out with humor and a decidedly masculine slant:\\" Place one of your large outdoor trash cans under the window of the baby's room . (If you live in the city, you can hang a bag from the rail of your fire escape.) Each time you get a dirty diaper, simply open the window and throw down a long range jumper; Once a day, you can go out and collect the air balls, but don't be surprised how fast you'll get the rhythm down. . . \\"\\" . . Studies have shown that the most effective rocking mimics the mother's walking pattern, which is approximately sixty rocks a minute. . . try reggae music. The beat is solid and steady, and it's got a natural buoyancy that will complement your rocking. And best of all, most reggae music cycles at around sixty to seventy beats per minute, tailor-made to your baby's needs. (Bob Marley's Buffalo Soldier is almost a perfect sixty b.p.m..\\"WIthout being simplistic, this creative book actually will help dads get their parenting rhythm down, and will appeal to many men who otherwise would not read a book for new fathers. It's a good start.Authors Greenberg, a comedian, and Hayden,an illustrator/graphic designer, are parents of a daughter."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book isn't meant to be the be-all, end-all of new parent books, but if you're a new dad and are a bit overwhelmed by a) fatherhood and b) all the BOOKS about parenting, this is a great book to get. It's got great retro artwork, a loose style, a sense of humor (something you don't see much in parenting books), and (mostly) very sound advice and information, from what your brand new baby will REALLY look like to how to keep your almost-one-year-old entertained on an airplane....My kid just turned a year old and I implemented many of the bits of advice I found in this book. It was well supplemented by \\"The New Father\\" and by \\"What's Going on in There?\\", making a trio of books that runs the gamut from theory to practice, from micro to macro. This book ended up as a well-thumbed bathroom reader after I finished it.By the way, the website for this book has some activities: listen to the sound of a baby crying for several minutes (to help you acclimate if, perhaps, you're still \\"expecting\\"), dad exercises and more."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"We just had our first baby last week. I picked this book up a couple of days ago and have been reading in short burst (as the book was designed for) with a book in one hand and a sleeping baby in the other.The content is fun; engaging to read for both parents. It also does a great job of zoning in on the \\"important\\" stuff that new dads want to know, rather than hundreds of pages that are great info, but simply would never get read by most new parents during their haze of sleep deprevation.5 well deserved stars."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"All the other reviews have pretty much covered it -- this book is hilarious, kitschy, easy to read, and so incredibly practical. My husband loves it, and it's great for moms, too. This book just gets right down to the meat of the matter -- how to care for a baby, how to solve problems, how to be a supportive partner."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Or at least laugh while you're losing it, this is the book for you. My wife had picked me up several parenting books, and they all had a tone that dad was an ignoramus that needed serious help. All were pretty dry to boot. I picked up this book while we were shopping for baby furniture. Thank goodness I did, because my wife had to be induced, and our daughter came a month early. I was terrified, but this book helped me get through. It has some great common sense suggestions, and manages to make you laugh through it (no small feat when you haven't slept in 3 days). I liked it so much that I went out and bought copies for 3 other guys I know who are either new or expectant dads. Much like the Boy Scout manual for scouts, this book should be at dad's side at all times. The only, minor, complaint I have is the topics tend to skip around a bit. Not bad, and it probably helps keep it light, as you don't get 15 pages on diapers all at once."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I'm a new mother, fully equipped with the requisite stack of new-mother books. And you know what? I've gotten more useful information out of this one book of my husband's than any of those. In between the duct-tape diapers and taking the baby to happy hour, there's a lot of good common sense here.Plus, unlike the \\"humorous\\" books targeted toward women, this one is actually funny."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is a great starting place if you are like me and are a first time Dad with absolutely zero experience dealing with babies. It presents really useful information and tidbits in an entertaining format for guys. The illustrations are quite amusing as well. Who knew that Bob Marley's 'Buffalo Solider' has a perfectly soothing rhythym that matches the baby's heartbeat and helps them relax? It is also contains tidbits on how to leverage your bundle of joy psychologically on others - catching relief at work etc. Things that guys need to know that they would never learn from your typical baby books. I particularly like the bit on how to powernap to minimize fatigue.If you are a guy and are clueless, take a crack at this book. If nothing else, you will be amused and I am willing to bet you will pick up ideas (and retain them) much faster than you would reading a library of your run-of-the mill baby books. I'm passing it on to my buds when they get their first crack at being dads."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"It has humor and really great information.

Seen him struggle to manage the new tasks facing him? Run out and buy Be Prepared as soon as you can. I have given this book to 3 new fathers this week and they have been delighted to receive a book written JUST FOR THEM! I have even witnessed a wife trying to wrestle the book from her husband. Be Prepared is both informative and funny. A great read for both new and 'old' dads. The learning never stops!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I thought I would write and let you know that I love your book. My wife hasn't yet delivered, but she will any day now. When she first found out that she was pregnant she dragged me to the bookstore and told me that I needed to pick out a book that would help me with this baby. She picked out a long boring book written by some doctor somewhere, and I luckily found your book. I have already read through it 2 1/2 times since I bought it, and I will probably read it again! It's one of the funniest books I've read, and it gives me so much information that for once my wife thinks I'm intelligent! I just wanted to say thanks for writing such a great book for guys like me who the last thing they want to read about is all the stuff about babies.

Every page has a new tip or trick I would have never thought of.-----------------------UPDATE: After beign a dad for over 6 months, I have really grown to appreciate this book. It got be prepared and desensitized. Even covers things like pets, something I would have never thought of.I buy this for any new dad. Even if you want to go after a more serious book to talk about how the rainbows touch the unicorns and sweet blah blah.. get this.Because while that book is off on a 1000 page tangent on how great fatherhood is, this one will be telling you HOW TO BE A GOOD DAD....I mean cmon, we all know how great and important fatherhood is. Thats why were having kids, right?

It's easy and fun to read, versus some of the other more 'dry' parenting books.Plus, it's got some great ideas of games parents can play with their babies. And, even some money saving tips, such making your own bath toys - versus spending money on ones from the store.We're expecting our first child, and this book was definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband is about to become a father and has never even touched a baby, much less cared for one. He was freaking out about all of the responsibilities, and this book calmed him. It explains the simplest tasks, like holding a baby, changing a diaper, burping, etc, all in a no-nonsense way. It's simplistic enough, and amusing enough for men to understand and actually read. I read it myself and learned a thing or two. There are great suggestions for babies that won't stop crying, what to do when you run out of diapers, how to help out your torn-up, exhausted wife who just gave birth.... it's everything a man needs to know."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband and I love this book.

I read it cover to cover and wished I could have 30 years ago. I hope my daughter reads it too. It's full of great ideas from a guy who appreciates technique and has worked out many good ones - how to get nasty medicine into a baby's stomach, how to dispose of disposable diapers from the third floor, how to keep shampoo out of the eyes. His macho angle (the football hold) is cute rather than offensive.

I really enjoyed it myself."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"As somebody who has been in scouting most of my life, I loved the format of this book -- that's what attracted me to it initially.However the writing style, and the sound advice, make this a book worth reading and worth sharing.The writer especially understands the mentality of boys (young or not so young) entering the world of childcare.I have shared a few copies with kids who are now having kids of their own.I like presenting this as a gift at a baby shower, because 99% of the stuff is for mom or the baby -- dads need something too!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I got this book for my husband for Father's Day.

We have an 8 month old daughter and he had been expressing that he felt useless in her care.He LOVED this book! For that matter, I read it myself and loved it.

This book is extremely sensible, easy to read & had great insight. I flipped through it a little bit to check it out before wrapping it for Christmas and could not put it down. I should have ordered it for my husband. It not only shows you how to swaddle a baby, tips for bathing/playing but also understanding what your wife is going through after giving birth. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it as a gift for any new dad."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband hoping he would get the hint that I wanted him to know something about baby care before our baby got here.

My husband just can't get enough of it, and he hates to read."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"We have bought this book for every new father friend we know. It is a humorous, light read (as if new dads have a lot of spare time to read!!) Maybe it's not the BIBLE of parenting, but it makes a great gift."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"What a fantastic book this is. My husband got it as a gift for Christmas and reads from it every night. It is written in a witty, easy to understand voice that I really think most men would find appealing. We've actually laughed out loud! All of the important tidbits that a new dad (and mom for that matter) could need, are right here in this charming little book. My husband will yell to me at least once a day: \\"Hey! Did you know...\\" and then he'll tell me something he just learned in this book. I love that he has a way to feel informed and knowledgeable. I've realized how important it is for a dad to feel connected and functional during pregnancy, and books like this honestly seem to help with that! I would recommend this wonderful reference to any new parents-to-be."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I gave this book as a Christmas gift to my husband (we're expecting in March 2010) and I enjoyed reading some sections before I wrapped it for him. It's laid out similar to a magazine so that it makes for more concise, to the point, reading. It offers technique options for dads, and it comes from a male perspective on fatherhood. Both my husband and I can learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I gave this book to my husband for Christmas just a few days ago and he's been glued to it ever since. We're expecting our first in April and he's been complaining about not being able to find a good book for First Time Dads. Well this is the book for him! The drawings and diagrams are fantastic, the information is very useful, and it is overall sympathetic to the mother's plight. :)Some of the various things the book includes is distinguishing between different cries, how to swaddle a baby, what to do with a colicy baby, how to burp a baby, different methods of feeding baby food, which foods to start with, and just an entire array of useful information. And the way the book is set up makes it an easy read that you can pick up at any time.Also, I wouldn't limit this to just dads either. I've learned a TON reading this book myself and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Five stars all the way. First time dads will be grateful."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Fantastic book. Loved the writing, the drawings, and the overall flow of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot as well."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"So I'm about to be a father in a few months. I don't like to get caught up in the whole book reading thing when it comes to parenting. I know how I was raised and I know how I want to raise my kids, but that doesn't help when it comes to soothing a screaming baby or knowing how much food is enough food or what temp is a safe temp and when I need to be heading to the ER. This book tells it all. It's not a boring read though at all. I actually learned while I was laughing. This goes over different activities you can do to keep your baby's brain thinking as well as how to calm them down while you're driving. Overall, this book is filled with good knowledge any father can appreciate, without boring you to death. I seriously am not a reader, but this book was hard to put down. There are also lots of pictures for us guys to keep us interested. If you're looking for one of those serious, boring, endorsed by some doctor books, this isn't it. This is written by a real dad to get you through real situations."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband a few weeks ago when we found out we were pregnant. The way the book is written puts everything in terms guys can relate to.

I recommend this book for all fathers!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is great for the new dad (currently still an expectant dad at this point). Each section is 1-5 pages, so it is great for picking up and reading incremental. Also great to flip back to when you need to actually use the techniques.It reminds me a lot of my Boy Scout handbook (which I think it is probably modeled after).I bought another book \\"Caveman's Guide to Baby's First Year\\" and I like this one a lot better.I also like that the cover is laminated, this will come in handy when the instructions are a little too close to the action.Also the diagrams (like that of swaddling) are very clear and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Gary Greenberg and Jeannie Hayden give a review of the first year of fatherhood. The book is divided organized by stages of the first year: the first week, 0-3 months, 4-6 months, etc.In each section, they give advice on handling fatherhood, practical down-to-earth tips (making a sock glove to hold your baby), money-saving tricks (homemade teethers), etc. and sprinkled with plenty of humor and illustrations!Great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Be Prepared is chock full of helpful information.

Most of the toys I looked at here had at least one 1 star review that made me panic about how safe they where. I was desperately expanding my search to find anything people where saying was really good for a newborn baby as I knew I wanted to get them something that was meaningful.I am glad I made this purchase choice. Now that my Brother and Sister in law have had the baby. They keep telling me about how this book has proven helpful to them. I keep getting repetitive thank you's every time they talk about the baby now because of it and I knew I had to come back and give this product a 5 star review.I will also keep this book in mind if I ever do end up having children of my own someday."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book was perfect for my husband!

I love how the authors assume that daddies will take an equal role in caring for the baby. This is not even questioned; it's just a given. I love that!

Saying this though, the book is a great read for both parents, and you will find that you can easily get through the book as it is engaging and the format is such that it makes it easy to read and easy to find the information that you are looking for too. The setup of the book reminds me of the old Boy Scout manuals which I think was the intention, and with all of the illustrations that are within the book you cannot go wrong!

I thought it would be good for a laugh, but it ended up being useful too. I read this when I was pregnant with my third child and I wish I had read it when I was pregnant with my first.

He hasn't looked at it yet as I just got it today but I can tell this is one father-to-be book that he'll actually flip through and read because of it's funny appeal (and pictures). I let out a huge giggle in the class when I flipped through first few pages about the how the baby really looks lol. Awesome book.

I have learned things myself so it's not just for dads! Many other new-dad type books really dumb men down by not being very serious at all.

He refers back to it at all times, it is like his saving grace. He wouldn't even let me read it because he liked having tricks up his sleeve that I was not familiar with as an ego booster, which is great since Dads don't always get the time with new babys they deserve. It really did help him prepare for our baby. I bought a copy for our friends who are expecting."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Loved this book.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book and the illustrations it contains are hysterical! A must-have for any dad-to-be. Women will get a kick out of this too!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"When I began researching books about being a father, my wife was around 6 weeks pregnant. Becoming a parent for the first time is daunting, pressure-filled, and overwhelming. It seems as though the things you need to know just keep piling up! You find an answer to one thing (how to change a diaper), and 2 more things come up (baby powder can be inhaled by my baby??!?!). Thankfully, this book's author takes a very candid and honest approach to teaching the necessities of being a father, rather than the worries.All throughout the book are pictures of things that only a guy would put in a book. I find them comical, but also very poignant. The text supporting the pictures is informative, and the information outlined in the book is very, VERY useful. For instance, using a tube sock with a thumb-hole cut in the side of it to help you grip your baby during a bath is incredibly useful information, and has definitely helped me out. Also, there is some information about combating colic and dealing with crying that I have found particularly useful.Does this book contain EVERYTHING about being a father? No, it doesn't, and it certainly doesn't attempt to. What it does is help eliminate many of the questions about what it takes to ensure your child survives with your own sanity intact. The book is well-organized, and provides a practical approach to performing those tasks you need to perform.I highly recommend this for first-time fathers. It has been a great handbook for me, and will continue to be as much until at least my son's first birthday next May!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"One of the best I got before becoming a dad and one I've since given to friends as they prepare for fatherhood. Where many of the parenting and baby books that piled up in our house seemed only to add to my general sense of stress about what was to come -- too many experts, too many by-moms-for-moms takes, too much advice, too many details about developmental milestones and what to do whens that just made my head spin, this one was a very easy, very funny read, complete with cartoons and many tongue-in-cheek takes on what's to come - like the guy saluting farewell to a pair of suddenly more magnificent than ever breasts, now answering a higher calling. You get the idea. Thanks to this book, I was even the one to teach my wife how to handle a few of the new baby tactics. Though for me, even more so than learning the techniques, to really get into the head space of a dad, and to finally feel ready what helped me most was hearing stories from other dads about becoming and being.Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Yearhelped, even if it was from the moms point of view. Maybe the only one I got entirely through before our son was born. Here's one from the dad'sThe Faith of a Child"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"The authors have indeed succeeded in writing a perfect primer for the first-time father. Advice is given in a manner that helps fathers be useful and helpful as an active partner with Mommy. The authors treat the differences between fathers and mothers clearly and give fathers the basic information that they need. It provides tips and advice and uses a good deal of humor in the process. Many masculine examples, starting from the basics, as well as instructing fathers on what to do and what should never be done are included in the book. The fact that the information provided is presented by the age of the baby, truly makes it a useful handbook.Jeffrey L. Fine, PhD, Psychologist: Author of: -\\"The Art of Conscious Parenting\\""},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"The picture on the front does a pretty dang good job of encapsulating what the book's like. With all the fears of impending daddyhood, I found myself feeling quite naked about the whole thing. Every guy wants to feel like he has the right gear, the right set of nifty \\"man-skills\\" knowledge, and the instincts to solve problems, and we tend to view most things as problems to be solved.This book takes a tone of tongue-in-cheek good humor and illustrations that remind me ever-so-slightly of my once-beloved Scout manuals to help prospective dads feel a bit more empowered and bit less mystified by the whole process that is raising a baby. There's not a ton in there about the psychology of being a dad or anything like that, at least not overtly so. But the author breaks down the nitty gritty of having a pregnant lady and then a baby and then even a toddler in the house with lots of \\"Insert Tab A into Slot B\\" (wait, that's how the baby came about in the first place--never mind) type explanations for things like swaddling a baby, getting a bottle ready, and \\"You can actually rock the kid without breaking him\\" stuff.Everyone I've suggested it to has loved it. It's not too touchy feely, it's something worth keeping around and checking on as the kid grows up, and is great for dads who maybe haven't been around babies too much or just need a refresher. You know, it would probably be useful for moms, too, but it's definitely written to an audience of men.I do agree with some reviewers that there's a good handful of suggestions in there that might cause some philosophical disagreement, but with the way it's written (a series of tips and suggestions) you definitely feel as a reader that you have a lot of leeway to glean what you want without getting too off-put by the whole thing."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This small book is hilariously funny, but also extremely informative. I expected it to be a put-down of men and how inept they are with babies, but it isn't like that at all. It's a very intelligent explanation of infant behavior and needs, and of how a father can be just as good a parent as a mother. Practical guidelines abound: how to baby-proof each room in the house, how to change a diaper, how to make a baby laugh (not to mention the reader!) There are also helpful hints on how to alleviate as much of the mother's stress as possible, and explanations as to why she feels so weird and lousy. By the way, I'm a grandmother, and both my husband and my son-in-law are excellent fathers. I bought the book for myself, to remind me of which parts of the house need baby-proofing, but my daughter borrowed it right away and I haven't gotten it back!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Be Prepared reminds me of the Boy Scout Handbook only with humor as an added bonus! (Probably by design). This book is the perfect nuts and bolts manual for early childhood rearing packed with answers to the questions you are almost certainly already asking yourself. Great practical advice and light of heart to keep first fathers from freaking out. It gives you the real scoop on the major things you should know and keeps you in perspective. I highly recommend this book if this is your first baby, as it is mine. One caveat though, it is a from-the-day-of-birth manual and does not cover the pregnancy term. If you are looking for advice during the pregnancy, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and refer to it often. I'm a first time Dad and both Mom and I find this manual helpful, especially the short and concise sections.We have a detailed Penelope Leach book that we refer to for 'heavy' reading covering more in depth issues and the psychology of child rearing, but Be Prepared has been a far more valuable day-to-day reference.What you'll get:*A well organized, insightful, easy to use manual on basic baby care*Covers the newborn up to 12 months including feeding, changing, pets, toys, travel, camping and parental relationships (sexy time)*Useful facts and techniques that you can instantly apply to help understand and soothe your baby*Humour and cool art- the authors actually went to the trouble to make this book both informative and a fun journey to read and rememberAn especially good book for Dad.

I even read of few chapters and it made me chuckle. I would definitely recommend this for new daddies to be."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"After reading the reviews about this book, I ordered this book from Amazon.com. I received it and riped into the box to get it out. Actually, my wife stole it from me, but I got it back. I am about to be a new dad and I loved this book. It was funny, gave real life tips and made me want to read it from cover to cover. The book shows a dad with a tool belt filled with everything he will need for his baby, but I think this book was left out of the belt. It is awesome!!!!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This handbook was surprisingly comprehensive given its size and how many pictures are in it. I was glad to find that it answered several questions on my mind as an expectant mom (even though I bought it for my husband) and it took a short time to read each section. I find the author really took time to lay out the important facts/options piece-meal so you can absorb the information. I have other books that cover the same subjects in long written form (which is also good) but when crunched on time, this one was succinct and touched on the key points you need. The humor is great but I think the visualizations and breakdowns are really the highlights."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"i didn't know what book to buy for my husband, but this one had great reviews, so i bought it when we found out we were pregnant. it is AWESOME!! not only is the book funny, it is super informative. just as the title says, it is practical. and i love that it acknowledges that parents will make mistakes, but then gives advice on how to deal with the situation if mistakes should occur. we both love this book so much we haven't yet bought any others and our son is now 3 months old."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband doesn't really \\"like books\\", but being all pregnant and hormonal I insisted on getting him a how-to book on fatherhood and forcibly suggesting that he read it. I am a somewhat reasonable person and realized that asking him to read 'What to Expect...' was just too much to ask.This book is REALLY funny in a non-annoying way. The material is very well organized- sections are short so that he can pick it up, read two pages in two minutes, and then put it down.Most importantly, the advice given is truly practical and designed to fill that \\"I want to be helpful, but I want to do it with powertools or while watching sports\\" need that men have. Suggestions such as reading Sports Illustrated to the baby (what's the difference? at least you're reading to them!) or on how to mitigate diaper odor with strategic placement of the garbage can make for win-win-win outcomes for mom, dad, and baby."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this for my son who was expecting his first child. It was delivered very quickly. He thoroughly has enjoyed this book and he's not much of a reader. The information and advice is presented in a humorous way.

I think that alone speaks volumes about the book!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Is this book an all inclusive guide to caring for a baby? NO. But, it is an excellent book and covers the essentials. Furthermore, it does so with some humor thrown in and it because of that, it reads pretty quickly. The advice is good. My wife enjoyed reading it too. Highly recommend this book along with baby 411."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is excellent for first time dads who feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of parenting resources in the world, most of which are written for moms. Everything is broken down to one to three pages and is straight and to the point. Yes, there could be more detail, but for a lot of people they just want the basics. It covers a surprising amount of information in a relatively short book. If you want more information you can always go and get a book with more detail. I work with lots of new dads and they, as well as many of their wives, have really enjoyed the book too. I recommend it to all the new and expecting parents I meet."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I've never written a review on Amazon before and yet this book inspired me to do so. I have looked high and low for some sort of book that will prepare my husband for the INSANITY that's about to (happily) befall us. I came up empty-handed -- every book I found was either too much material for a dad, had bad ideas or was terribly out-dated (one told dads to \\"send a fax\\" to let your wife know you care and another told dads to make sure the baby knows that the dad is the real decision-maker). This book, however, is perfect. It's organized by time period -- first week, 0-3 months, 4-6 months, etc. Then, within each time period are little vignettes that focus on key issues such as how to change a diaper, how to stimulate the baby or, most important, how to keep your wife happy. The writing is funny, not too heavy, and really focused on the \\"need to know\\" rather than the editorial commentary you can get with some parenting guides. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you have a husband who's not big on sitting down and reading a long book on parenting. P.S. It's great for moms to read too!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is a must for new dad's and mom's alike. It is not only very information, it is information with a sense of humor on raising a baby. This book has a very realistic approach to the common, everyday things you face with a new baby. I will definitely be buying this book as shower gifts going forward for all the new dads out there. My husband loves this book too."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I rarely review books but this is the best new dad book ever. It's frank and upfront when it needs to be but it doesn't try to shock or scare you. It's entertaining but also informative, in a practical way. The goofy illustrations balance out a goldmine of practical tips and facts. If you happen to find a paper copy, check out the \\"Bidding farewell to the breast\\" picture and you'll be sold. Most baby books are so dry and medicinal, or they're feminine and spiritual and weird....I want to learn everything but it's just so hard to sit through that stuff. I never would have gotten all the info that I did if it wasn't for this book.From now on, any of my male friends that are expecting a baby will be getting a copy of this book as a gift from me."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This is actually the third time I've purchased this book - once for me and twice as gifts for new dads-to-be. Be Prepared teaches dads a lot of the stuff we're expected to know, but it presents it with a simple approach and plenty of guy humor. Let's face it - the ladies in our lives often take the approach that the more important something is, the more complicated and serious it should be. Instead this book starts from the premise that we men are simple creatures who enjoy a good laugh, and that we should take a simple approach to having a kid and laughing with him. It actually starts with tips on how to be supportive of your pregnant wife, so for best results pick up this book the second you find out that you or one of your friends is going to be a dad. It also includes checklists such as items to grab before leaving the house with your child and exercises you can do to play with your kid and get a workout in at the same time. Is it the only book a new dad should read? Probably not. But if a new dad were to read one book and one book alone, this would be it."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this for my husband when we found out we were expecting!

Actually, it is good for expectant grandparents too! It is practical, giving hands-on ideas to help with your baby, misconceptions, and fears and doubts in facing one of the biggest challenges of life - Parenthood of a brand new baby. We bought it for our son during the pregnancy of his first child, and thought it was so good, bought it again for our son-in-law for the birth of their second child."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Not only is this book hilarious and illustrated in a witty parody of Boy's Life (which my husband knew because he's an Eagle Scout) it actually has great, accurate info. If you've ever seen the movie Knocked Up you may remember the controversy over getting the dad to read the birthing/parenting books. That bit rings true for all guys, I think, because most of those books are so geared to women so they feel like a chore to read. This has a really practical feel to it, without a strong bent toward one particular parenting style. Of course it shouldn't be considered the only book you'll ever need, but it's a great staple and a perfect (rare) new dad gift. I enjoyed it too!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Great content and def written with a man's sense of humor in mind.

I bought this book for my husband because it looked like something slightly more engaging to read for a guy than the 400 page books we women have been delving into since becoming pregnant. It was so worth it. He loves it. He takes it with him to work everyday and keeps it in his bathroom to enjoy. It is \\"snippets\\" of info that are long enough to cover the important stuff but short enough to remain very entertaining. Each time he reads something he comes and shares it with me and tells me the cool new thing he has learned about the newborn we are expecting. It has some very informative basic information, I have even loved reading it because it doesn't cover what is in the books for women, it has a completely different perspective and I can say I have learned quite a bit from it. It is light, but still talks about important ways to care for your newborn. I love it, both my husband and me recommend this book to any new father."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I'm one of those girls that relates better with guys. I never babysat as a teenager and have never really been exposed to babies before. Now I'm pregnant and when I start thinking about how I'm going to handle having a baby of my own mild panic attacks tend to set in. Honestly, a lot of those first year(s) books I've tried to read are boring! I started reading this book after my fiance picked it up and I love it. I can relate to the material, the tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcasm, and I feel like I actually learned something.This book also gets major bonus points from me because I've skimmed other father-to-be books that are downright piggish and male chauvinist. Be Prepared, however, encourages fathers to be supportive partners in parenthood.Sure, it's not going to cover everything regarding motherhood as it is geared toward fathers, however it's a terrific supplemental book that really is a breath of fresh air in comparison to all of the other information out there."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I've given this book to many new Dads. Every man has had something good to say about it.The short, yet to the point examples are right on track for the new Dads in my life."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I love this book. I borrowed a copy from our Doula first and I couldn't put it down. Had to buy it for myself."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Aside from wonderful aesthetics of the 1950s Boy Scout manual-type graphics, this is a fantastic book with real concrete advice and tips for new dads.Unlike a lot of other \\"new dad\\" books I have read and borrowed, it is not about one man's personal introspective experience with a newborn, nor some overly verbose detailed explanation of everything a newborn brings. \\"Be Prepared\\" goes right to the point in describing how to quiet and soothe a crying baby, change a diaper, and babyproof the home. This book is well designed for the practical and down-to-earth dad, and will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Of all the books targeted at dads-to-be, this one is our favorite. It presents all the relevant information in brief and to-the-point chunks complete with engaging illustrations. I think this brand of humor probably appeals to the majority of the dad population. This is now our go-to shower gift for expectant fathers. I'm so glad we stumbled across it."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I absolutely love this book. It has a wealth of simple and helpful tips for new dads, and in addition to being informative it is quite entertaining to look through. I leave it out on the coffee table and all of our guests love looking at it. Right from the very first two pages of \\"This is what you THINK your baby will look like\\" and \\"This is what your baby WILL look like\\", it's a wonderful read. Lots of great pictures as well :)"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"browsed through it and liked what i read about the advice to a new father.. who knows not much about birthing . Practical and down to earth explanations about real issues."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Bought this for my husband. He likes the easy format, pictures, and humor. I also found the advice to be useful too."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"A good lighthearted read for more contemporary dad's that aren't ready to hunker down with a heavy-handed copy of \\"what to expect when you're expecting.\\"Let's be honest, there's some stuff about being a dad that's just silly and this book points out all that stuff in a way that's entertaining and keeps your interest for the fun stuff...I mean Martha Stewart's not going to suggest that you reuse a 6-pack beer bottle to keep baby bottles at the ready."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband who wanted to be involved in caring for our twins when we deliver this March 2012 :-) Having read the good reviews, I ordered this and it's a really fun and practical read! I even read it too as it really simplifies a lot of the mystery surrounding how to take care of newborns. It's simple, funny and straight to the point. Recommend it for both moms and dads to be."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I purchased this for my husband shortly after finding out that we're expecting our first child. He doesn't typically enjoy reading for pleasure, but he's almost finished with this and has really enjoyed it. I've laughed pretty hard about some of the passages he's read to me. I find it cute that he'll point out items at the store that \\"the book\\" said we should get. I think this book offers a fun, light-hearted approach to parenting."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband. He didn't start reading it until about 2 months after our daughter (1st child) was born. He said it was the most useful book of all the ones I got him. He also said that the author was funny and that it was an easy read. He liked the book so much, we are buying a copy for his brother who is about to have his first child."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Some of the electronic gadget stuff is out of date but I (to-be-mom) found it informative and amusing to read. All books I read for new moms were focused on breast feeding and cribs but I found the breath of the topics covered in this book more practical."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"We got this with our first baby in 2005, the year after the book was printed. We still give this to all of our male friends who are becoming fathers for the first time.What the book is not:Some reviews say they don't like that it is not comprehensive, but I don't think it is meant to be. I mean, it isn't even that many pages, so how can someone think it is going to be comprehensive? I wasn't looking for that in the book.What the book is:It is a general guide with some very specific ideas and advice on how to be helpful as a dad in a situation that is pretty much mother-centered at first. It gave my husband practical tips from how to wash a baby safely, to how to understand all the different kinds of cries a baby can produce.What I, as a mom, liked about the book is that it shows dad's new role in a positive light. So many books geared to new dads are really demeaning to the mom and the new lifestyle a baby will bring. I get tired of books that speak disrespectfully about the moms and the new lifestyle of being a dad, as if it is a huge burden they got tricked into. This book is more about the partnership of parenthood, and I appreciate that. Humor combined with honesty makes this a helpful book, even this many years after its print date."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I purchased this book for my husband for his birhtday shortly after the birth of our daughter. We have both enjoyed reading it and looking at the accompanying illustrations, which are sometimes hilarious, and he has even employed some of the knowledge he's learned. Overall a good book and very male-oriented to encourage new dads."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"If you are a very serious person and really need to study babies like its your board exams, this might not be the book for you. But if you are looking for fun, easy to read, and yet informative book, this book is great. Tells you how it is. How accurate it is, i guess I will only know when we have the baby. But for dad's who wants a book to read that is not so intimidating, this is it. Only baby book that I can get through painlessly."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book, because I thought it looked like a manly book my husband would read. I could barely put it down. It incorporates a lot of humor. the content is very basic, but includes things those mommy baby books don't."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"A huge hit in our household. Educational, to the point, humorous, honest, and an easy read. More books should be published by this author."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"...this is it! Not only is it an enjoyable read, BE PREPARED is filled with good, result-oriented ideas for new dads. Best of all, its concise, to-the-point style makes it so you don't need to sift through paragraph after paragraph of filler to get to those ideas. A must-have for every new father."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book for my husband, but I ended up reading it also. It had lots of helpful information and shortcuts on exactly what to do with your baby after its born (the tips on the emergency diaper and the New Years Panda alone were worth the book :-) )"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I got this book for Christmas for my two son-in-laws who are about to have their first children (just five months apart) and it was THE HIT of Christmas. Extremely well written, with pictures, very, very funny and very, very right on with lots of useful information to prepare Dads. It is a read aloud type of book -- it is that funny but true to its laugh and words!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Here's a book Dad's to Be and new Dad's will definately want by their bed-side. A Man's look at caring for a newborn baby & what to expect when the new little one arrives. Humerous and practical has great tips like how to construct an emergency diaper with duct tape and a few other easily accesible supplies. Be Prepared is a great resource and help for surving this trek through unexplored territory!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband found this at a used bookstore and the book is excellent. The cover makes it look like it's an old book but it is updated and down to earth. We have bought this book for a couple of our friends that are expecting. It's humorous and really full of information.Funny parts..it mentions men saying \\"so long to the breasts for a while\\" because they belong to the baby. haha And even talks about changing a diaper at a football stadium."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This is the book we wish had been around when we had our children over 30 years ago. Who knew that you could quiet a colicky child by wrapping him in a warm towel and sitting on a jiggling dryer? This and many other practical (and the emphasis is on practical in this book) tips are what make this book invaluable. It's written in a humorous style with spare verbiage and fun illustrations, which appeals to many new parents (especially dads) who don't want to plow through chapter after chapter of infinite written detail. In partnership with some of the more detailed books, which a new parent can read at their leisure (if they have any), this book is a treasure. I now order it as a baby gift for every set of new parents. It's a reassuring, helpful, terrific book for parents of newborns, especially."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this for my husband to announce that we were expecting. He skimmed though it once and while he found it funny, he put it on the shelf to collect dust the next nine months. Once our son arrived I blew off the dust and left it in plain sight for him to remind him he had it.Our son is now 7 weeks old and he has read it at least 20 times cover to cover and will go back to reference it when we are facing a new baby challenge. At least daily I hear \\"Well, according to my daddy book...\\". This book has been a sanity saver for him as it puts the intricacies of having a baby into \\"man terms\\". We now buy this book for every new expecting dad we know."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This was a great book and resource for my husband. It was the only parenting book he would read."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"So I bought this book for myself - I am a 33 year old first time Dad. Being new to this, I had no idea really what to expect. I keep this book in my diaper bag in case I am ever alone with the baby and my wife is not around. The book has good tips on how to calm a crying baby and is also written in a fun way - I didn't find it boring, and its about a baby. I really surprised myself as I normally dislike books. I also like how the book is divided into stages, making it a reference for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is both factual and funny. What a great gift idea for the new dad. It's always easy to come up with a gift idea for the new mom, but coming up with one for the new dad is a lot tougher. Thanks to these two authors, the problem has been solved."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"A family member sent this when my firstborn arrived, and I enjoyed the book's humor and valuable content so much I gifted it to my brother-in-law when his first child was born. Just like the healthy food for kids that tastes good (they'll never know they're eating healthy!), this book delivers a wealth of invaluable tips, timing of events, how-to's, Dont's and straight up information via humorous drawings and diagrams, wit, catchy phrases and laugh out loud style.I often read the book in bed at night and would share passage after passage with my wife - the new mom - who would chuckle along with me (quietly, so as not to wake the baby). To confirm it's your flavor of book, check out the sample above: \\"What Your Baby Won't Look Like\\" and the back cover's list of topics, including \\"How to stay awake (or at least upright) at work.\\" Well worth it!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I was never a boy scout, but as a new mom, I thoroughly enjoyed this book's refreshing sense of humor and practical, can-do approach to parenting a newborn when all the other books are long-winded, too serious, or aren't digestible in small pieces here and there when the baby is napping. I recommend this book *highly* to every couple expecting the first baby. You simply cannot go wrong giving this as a baby shower gift, but you might want to address it to the expecting dad, or mom will co-opt it all the time."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I was a single mom before I met my husband.. I wish I had read this book! Now we are going to start trying in January and I read this book hoping to find something that wouldn't sound condescending, protaganistic, or droll. I found it informative, funny and interesting to read. It really taught ME a lot. I left in the bathroom for my husband to read.. :) He read a couple of pages and found it interesting. Trust me you won't be dissapointed! BTW.. I have bought almost every book out there for fathers.. This is by far one of the best!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This is practical, and a great resource for the new parent. Humerous and inciteful. Great read."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I was so excited to give this book to my brother on the occasion of his wife's baby shower (why should he be left out of the fun!) He has since let me know that he has learned much and laughed often while reading his new baby guide. He also thinks the look of the book is cool - retro boy scout-style illustrations teamed with witty, practical information. My sister-in-law likes it, too! She loves that it gets him prepared not only for the baby, but also for the changes she's going through. Thanks for helping the Auntie-to-be and my family!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"As the father of a six month old, I wish I had this book from the beginning. It gives you really good advice without being preachy, and some parts are hilarious. The illustration of what your newborn won't look like and what it will look like is perfect."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this for two dads-to-be. They both loved it! They have humorous personalities and liked the humor in the book along with real advice. Great to take some of the scare out of the realization they are becoming dads."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I got this book for my son after seeing the massive parenting book of my daughter-in-laws. I ordered a different baby book for myself at the same time and I can barely lift mine. I didn't have time to read most of the book but what I read was funny and got the point across. The artwork is great and very helpful. The book great if you don't care to read. I saw things in this book that I wish I knew when my kids where babies, especially our colicky one. My husband laughed out loud when he looked it over. Our daughter dropped by and looked at it. We all agreed its one of the practical and useful books for male parents or other caregivers such as us \\"Grand-folks\\". Since I loved the book but didn't have time to read it fully before gifting it I am giving it a 4."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is all Man! The reading is informational and practical, but light and funny. Great for the new Dad who's used to holding a wrench on the weekdays or used to setting up a tent on the weekends."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Gary Greenberg and Jeannie Hayden have written a parenting book that is both highly informative and really funny. As a father-to-be (5 months and counting), &quot;Be Prepared&quot; has become my constant companion. Three words for anyone in need of solid parenting advice: Buy This Book."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I have been trying to get my husband to read a baby book for months, with no success. Until a friend got me this book. My husband can't put it down. I see him giggling to himself while he reads it. And I have to admit, it's much more fun than my mom's guide. And has almost as much information in it!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I could come up with many great things to say about this book, but I don't want to distract you from the main message, which is this: buy the book. If you are a new-dad-to-be, just buy the book.&quot;Be Prepared&quot; is very, very funny without being &quot;jokey&quot; or overly familiar in tone; the humor comes from truth born of experience. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Pure brilliance. I can't believe fathers have been able to function this far without it.This book is an excellent resource for all with children. Run, don't walk, do get it NOW!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"New dads will definitely be prepared for this life-altering event after reading this handbook. The writing is informative as well as humorous, which is a good thing since laughs are, at times, hard to come by during this period. The illustrations are extremely creative and beautifully executed.I would highly reccommend this book not only for new dads, but also for those of you who enjoy an excellent read."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I have not had the joy of this book, but by my nephew's reaction, I am ordering 2 more for my sons that are also red-neck-hard-working new fathers that are a liitle scared and could use a little lighting on the overwelming task of fatherhood. Give them a reason to laugh - they have just started a very long road which has no detours."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"If you're reading this review, you're probably about to have a baby, and you're wading through the canon of parenting books trying to decide which 1 or 2 are worth reading. If you're interested in something easily digestible, but more than a little helpful, and void of that &#34;parenting is beautiful&#34; New Age crap, this book is worth adding to your short-list. Kind of arranged in Boy Scout Handbook fashion, it's a series of short and (as it says) practical explanations/advice/ideas, arranged by month-spans, for how to deal with your new reality: a partner who's just had her insides ripped out, and a new, helpless, alive thing you're now responsible for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for at least the next 18 years of your life (this book will get you through the first one; the next 17, you're on your own).There are other &#34;parenting books for men&#34; available, but most seem kind of irreverent and unhelpful, almost trying to make a joke. I can't understand why a reader would find that worthwhile -- levity, I guess -- but THIS BOOK ISN'T THAT. Jokes are made, and some things are gimmicky/stereotypical, but for the most part you'll get a lot of actual help from this book.Take a look through the sample pages, and if you like those, you'll like the rest of the book too.Also, if you like the sound of the title, check out &#34;The Art of Roughhousing,&#34; which I found similarly well worth buying.(Finally, in case the book's authors ever check these comments: the illustrations are really great.)"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Bought this for my hubby while expecting our first child. He enjoyed it and read it much faster than the \\"serious\\" baby books. Now that our daughter is 3 months old, i can say that this book was the one he referred back to most when he had a question and he still goes back to it now. My best friend and his wife are expecting and I just bought this book for him too."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My Husband was not one to read the typical 'Daddy' books. Handed him this one and he couldn't put it down. Our son is 6 months old and my husband is still referencing it. Fair warning ladies, he gives me advice and suggestions on how to do things and prefaces it with &#34;Well, my Daddy book says...&#34;! Good buy, I would definitely recommend it because while he gives me unwanted advice sometimes at least he is involved enough to care to give that advice!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book arrived quickly. It's funny and easy to read. Lots of graphics and good facts. It was a hit as a present to the new dad!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I have a handful of baby books that no matter where I put them (coffee table, bathroom, desk) my husband was never inclined to open them up. Forwarding him \\"this week of your pregnancy\\" emails was about the only thing that would peek his interest. That is until Be Prepared. This book was given to him as a gift and the chapter titles cracked him up to the point he'd want to read more. While some of it can seem a little over the top going for humor (baby circuit training), this book has some really good information. Best of all it's really hilarious and he'll actually read it on his own."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"a friend recommended this book to me. its a short read, but right to the point. learned a ton, and used kindle to make notes for future reference. cant wait to be a dad!!!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I got this book when my wife was pregnant, and I get a copy for everyone I know who's going to be a dad.It's full of practical information. Presented in amusing ways. In short chunks you can read in the bathroom, in the OB waiting room, or while carrying your baby around because it's the only way to keep her from screaming. What I liked best, even before the baby was born, was that it really covers a lot of options. Cry it out or co-sleeping safely? Breast or bottle (and how to be a supportive partner of a nursing woman, whew! Something I can do to help!)? Babywearing?There's a cheat-sheet on taking good baby pictures. There is a section on camping (and we took our baby camping). There are hints I didn't see anywhere else. The retro cartoon images have a good mix of non-white guys, which I was not expecting.It goes through the first year, but I really stopped reading it about 6-8 months. I had enough experience that I didn't need that help anymore.Practical, informative, amusing, useful."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"As a former scout (and soon to be new dad), I enjoyed the old-school Boy Scout manual appearance of this book.

But my husband read it and suggested I did too. Now, we refer to this book all the time for advice and 'how to' do things...like giving medicine. No other book we have found has given us useful advice on how to give an infant medicine AND get them to swallow it instead of spitting it back out. It's easy to read, simple in presentation and makes you laugh right at the time when you are at your wits end. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"This book is a great first read for any dad.

I highly recommend this book to everyone, not just soon-to-be or new dads. I love this book! :)"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I give this book to all new dads I know. It is informative, encouraging and engaging. You can't stop reading once you start. Fatherhood is a scary thought for most guys and this gives them advice without being overly emotional or preachy.

A friend gave me a copy as a \\"congratulations to the new dad-to-be\\" gift, and now I'm constantly recommending it to others (including you, dear reader). It's a soft start to the world of baby literature with practical advice for the realities of parenthood for the new dad."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this for my son who became a dad right before Christmas, thinking that he may skim over it quickly and possibly refer to it from time to time. Was I wrong... he loved it! His brothers (22 and 18) even read it, and I overheard them talking about how much they liked it. This is huge, since I've never heard my children discuss any book, EVER!

Great buy!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"A buddy of mine and his wife were having a baby a few years back. He purchased \\"Be Prepared\\" to learn about becoming a father and what to expect. I started reading it, just to check it out, and laughed out loud at how funny it is.

Very funny!!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I'm not even a dad yet (my wife and I are about to start trying), but I picked this up for a window into my future and to pick up some pointers early on. The book is hilarious, but, contrary to what one reviewer suggested, I wouldn't call it just a jokebook. It's a terrific, very practical parenting book that's also very funny.Having read a couple fatherhood books already I found that this book provided fresh, practical information I haven't read in other places, and yet presented it in a way that's quick and fun to read. I feel as though I know how to handle a bunch of situations that all new fathers (and mothers) will invariably be in, and feel proud that I'll be able to contribute in these ways to my baby's upbringing, safety, entertainment and development. A great joy to read, and what I expect will prove to have been a great lesson in fatherhood."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Comical, realistic, genius.

Think Boy Scout handbook meets parenting advice. My husband would read this book and chuckle (see \\"Evolution of the Boppy\\"). It's the only parenting book that he has read from cover to cover.

Trust me, you'll like it!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I knew that when i heard my husband laughing out loud from the other room while reading this book that it was a good one! It's tough to find men's books that really mean something and don't take them months to read. This caught my husbands attention from the first page to the last! It has the funniest sense of humor. our child is three months old and he is still refrencing it quite a bit. I have ordered it for three other friends husbands who are expecting.

I think it was the only Baby Book that my husband actually read willingly and enjoyed... he laughed out loud reading it and as a bonus shared the funny parts with me.

It's simply written and very humorous. It answers a lot of questions for first-time dads and has a lot of great hints and insights. I referred to it the first time I gave my grandson a bath.

Hands down this is the better of the two we purchased. He loves it! Its very easy to read, has photos, instructions, and is easy to navigate. It really is geared towards men, and the role that they play in being a parent to a newborn. I would recommend this to those who want something guy focused and very informative. We're very pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Hubby seemed to really like this book ~ approached fatherhood with a laugh.

It looks like a Boy Scout manual and the illustrations inside are reminiscent of old school Scout manuals from my childhood. The information, however, is much more useful than anything that I ever learned from one of those old books. Also, this book is much more humorous. This book is a very comforting and funny way to learn some of the things that aren't necessarily mentioned in some of the other pregnancy books.I would definitely recomend this book to any soon-to-be father (or mother for that matter). I've already talked several of my friends into buying it, and they all agree that this one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I bought this book on a whim for my husband (we are currently expecting our first child). I was VERY pleasantly surprised by it. Be Prepared is laugh-out-loud funny, but it is also incredibly informative. I love how much info it gives to new dads about how to interact with their babies, even newborns, and how to help mom with taking care of baby. For many new parents, babies up to a few months old seem like \\"blobs\\" that \\"don't do anything.\\" That's why I love sections like \\"baby party tricks\\" that give dad a way to interact with his newborn child, and also helps form a bond between them.This book is EXCELLENT, I can't say enough great stuff about it. It just has the perfect mix of useful info, humor, and isn't at all intimidating for new dads."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My wife is due with my first child, her second around July 19. I just want to say thank you for the great book! I've purchased many similar books that can't even begin to come close to your fine piece of work.

In the span of one year we'll have gone from one now 15 yr old daughter, to also having 12 and 17 yr old foster sons! Yes we are insane!

I definitely encourage new moms and dads to have this in their library!"},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I don't like advice books. I think raising a kid is largely a matter of experience. But this is an exceptionally well designed and written book that is great for first time fathers. I am a father of two and bought this as a present for a nervous soon-to-be Dad. I don't expect him to start constructing diapers out of duct tape (I'm totally inefficient but I've never run out of diapers) but he'll get a great idea of what it is to be a new Dad from this.

We read through a few chapters beforehand - giggling but not taking it very seriously. Then our daughter was born, and this suddenly became mandatory reading. It was a lot more fun for our sleep-deprived brains than the dry, doctor-written tomes (which have their place, don't get me wrong), and, importantly, it contained a lot of the random wisdom that only a newbie parent who has had to 'wing it' could offer. We both read the entire thing, and are STILL using the information from it (our first is two, and our second is on the way). The off-the-wall, but effective suggestions on how to get a baby to sleep alone are worth the price!

I found it unbelievably relevant and witty.Even though it was written for fathers, but I saw my wife reading it (and smiling) a few times. With section titles like: \\"Bidding Farewell to the Breast\\", \\"Night of the Living Dad\\", etc... it's a light reading without being frivolous.There's also a web site that accompanies the book, beprepared.net, which seems to have some nifty resources, like a sample of white noise that one can download and record on a CD (as the book suggests) to help sooth the baby."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Some of the content is getting a bit old on this book, so it may not be perfect for a new gift to dads anymore, but it was a funny and quite helpful read.

I have nine nieces and nephews and must have picked up a good deal of this information from watching them and from my siblings telling me what they were going through. I enjoyed the manly alternatives to usual stuff, duffle bag for diaper bag, how to organize it, and the six pack bottle holder. Other information like making emergency diapers and some baby proofing tips will be useful. I really liked this when first reading the book, but I cannot believe the editors and author did not catch the numerous misspellings and typos.

He said it has good tips and the reviews on Amazon were amazing. I have to say I am a bit disappointed. I am not sure if this book disappoints on an intellectual level or is just out dated. I am in my late twenties and am expecting my first child in the next week or two. Some of you might say any day now. Because it's my first, and I am oblivious to anything that has to do with baby care, I decided to tackle the issue with some light reading. This is what this book is light reading. It has mainly pictures and dumb anything down. I am on my third sitting, I have been reading this book at work (Yes while on the clock) and I have maybe 20 pages to go. Some of the pictures make the bby seem like he is a 60 year old man out of a 20's movie. I have to say that tips like:1. Taking your baby for an outside activity such as the: Horse Race track?! The local laundry mat - I live in NV not NY we don't have those around here.2. Have a cover for the VCR opening because kids love sticking things in the slot. Thanks also for going into detail on how to un-jam a VCR and not damaging the VCR heads. That will be very useful. Serious if you have a VCR this book is for you.What can I say if I was reading this book in the late 80's or early 90's and I was in my 40's, this book would be great. I think its a bit outdated. It really goes from one extreme sarcastic remark to the next.I would say that you can sum up this book into list of 10-15 facts that you actually need. It was disappointing for me. All his Macho Man, Red neck techniques are a bit insulting in my opinion.Thanks you for lowering my IQ. I am sure you can find the same good tips in a better written book. Duck tape the faucet in the tub with a sponge, got that on my to do list after I baby proof my VCR."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"My husband bought this book for himself and he loves it - six months on he is still dipping into it at bedtime. And so do I! He also bought a copy for my brother who was unsure at first but soon discovered it is more than just funny but has lots of useful advice too. Definitely beats other 'humorous' dad's guides hands down.What I must take issue with though is that it perpetuates the idea that you should spend the first six months of the baby's life rocking him/her to sleep and then at six months you should suddenly abandon him/her to cry alone to get to sleep when they only know what we have taught them! If we started as we mean to go on, they wouldn't get this conditioning in the first place."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I returned this book. Maybe it's just me, but I found the writing and artwork to be mediocre. The artwork is supposed to be a throw-back to 50's 60's book, but doesn't pull it off and ends up looking crappy. The writing is kinda jokey and the tips are worthless- (really!? I need to know how to make an impromptu diaper form duct tape and rags? maybe cause I'm not a dad, but whatever.) I would prefer more facts and real info."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"I first bought this book for the kindle and hated it.

I was a little nervous as to how he would respond to the purchase (would he be insulted or what if he didn't read it, would I be insulted?!) but the reviews were so good that I decided to take the plunge.Well let me tell you this book has been great. I noticed my husband picked it up the first night, no doubt due to the funny cartoonish cover (read: unassuming). Since then I'm honestly wondering if I should read it myself as the tips are no nonsense, funny and and insightful. In fact, I'm starting to think he may know more about changing a diaper than I do!One thing I want to specifically mention is that the book is really good about explaining how insane us gals can be around this time. I'm still pregnant and I am feeling the mood swings wash over me like Saturday's laundry! I can't imagine what it's going to be like after the baby has arrived.

There were SO MANY things I didn't know about babies and how to take care of them. Not only that, but it's written specifically to and for men, so it's a really easy, funny read!I was scared of all the things I don't know about when the baby gets here and I have much more to learn, but now I truly feel prepared for his arrival and have a great book to reference in case I'm not sure what to do in any baby situation!

It's a nice book that explains to new dads how to handle their new bundle of joy. From how to bond with your new baby to chasing a one year old around. My husband was never around babies when he was growing up so this helped him a little. I think it's a great book to give to new dads.

My husband hated it."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"The practical information in here is VERY basic.There's probably nothing in here for anyone who has been around kids, but there were some good tips for my husband who has barely been around any infants.He thinks most of the book was funny and got a kick out of some of the drawings.A few of the points are just ridiculous... my husband had better not be making my newborn think she's falling just to show off her reflexes as a party trick and he is not leaving a window open and shooting baskets with dirty diapers into a trash can outside. We're also not wasting an entire drawer in every room of the house to make a \\"decoy drawer\\" when babies should probably not be encouraged to open kitchen and bathroom cabinets AT ALL to play with the contents. Yes, I know they'll get into everything anyway but I found that tip strange with a very small potential to be dangerous, since now they are going to want to look for the \\"decoy drawer\\" at other houses that aren't baby-proofed.That said, those few examples are a small part of the book and most of the information is useful, if basic. I only rated it low since there is a lot of very basic information (how to change a diaper) or \\"fluff\\" (makeshift duct tape diaper) so he still needed to read my \\"serious\\" baby books so he would know how often to change a diaper (other than the obvious!) and other more practical tips."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Great, practical advice, except for getting a baby to sleep. It sounds harsh, but being a father of 4, including 4-month old twins, I found it better to simplify the bedtime ritual. For infants, put them in bed, kiss them goodnight, turn out the light, and close the door. For the twins, we let them put themselves to sleep. No rocking, no white noise, no music, no art of the transfer this time around. Much easier, and they sleep. Also, avoid using pacifiers. They become a crutch and god help you if you don't have one when you need them. Other then that, great advice."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"While this book contains some useful information, much of it is outdated. Further, I was saddened to see how self-absorbed and negative it was. Much of the book seems to indicate the author feels fatherhood is a life sentence of drudgery. Considerable mention is made of the death of one's former freedom-loving existence, and how a baby will inconvenience one's life. I purchased this book based on the number of glowing reviews and was disappointed with the book's negative additude toward fatherhood."},{"Title":"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads","review":"Definitely funny. But not helpful at all. My husband got it as a gift.

He is not scared about becoming a father, he just wanted some practical advice and the added humor is appreciated. I read this entire book before he came home from work, and I was laughing the whole way through. There were very few parts that I found offensive (unlike most pregnancy/fatherhood books geared towards men). There was one part about how you shouldn't let you baby look at Maxim magazine, because it could stimulate the breastfeeding reflex? It was a really poor attempt at humor and since there aren't any magazines like that in our home, it did bother me a little bit. My Husband is not that kind of person. I choose to ignore that one comment because, for the most part, the whole book is very funny and helpful.I wouldn't say this book is the \\"secret key\\" to fatherhood (obviously), but I think it was helpful and humorous and we both got to take something away from it. It is definately more practical then any maternity books I have!

He is not the \\"reading\\" type at all, but from the reviews, I thought this book would capture his interest. Well, I just received the book in the mail and thought I would just thumb through it before wrapping it, but as it turns out, after the first couple pages I was hooked and actually read the entire book myself in a few hours! It is HIGHLY entertaining and I really did laugh out loud many times. Since I'm as clueless about babies as my husband is, I really feel like I learned alot about what we can both expect when our baby arrives (and maybe because the book was written with a lot of humor, I don't feel intimidated or overwhelmed after reading it). I'm so excited for my husband to read this book! Highly, Highly recommended!UPDATE!!! It's several months later and this book was indeed a huge hit with my husband! I've never seen him so interested in a book before and I've found him literally cracking up laughing while reading it. There is so much bonding time between mother and infant early on that I think Dad's may sometimes feel left out. However, this book makes many suggestions about lots of \\"manly\\" jobs that dads can take charge of, including very funny and creative ways to take baby pictures, handling all the audio visual equipment, babyproofing the hotel room in record time, creating a fake out drawer of old remote controls/cell phones to keep baby amused, etc. After reading these suggestions, I think my husband feels like he too is needed in the care of the infant and will play just as important of a role in baby's life as I will! He has read comical excerpts of the book to family and friends and has even taken the book to our centering group to show all the other first time dads! You wont' be disappointed!

I think if you're looking for a book for men to read about new babies, this is it!He likes it because it covers not only what to expect from the birth itself (what the baby will look like, act like, etc) but the different phases as they get older.

In the final 12 chapters our book explores more complex statistical procedures (log-linear models, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, and others) in the identical format as the earlier chapters.The comments by the individuals from Iowa and Minnesota reflect the many e-mails we have received on this book from, literally, all over the world. While we routinely recommend that anyone who uses the book first take a course in statistics, for anyone with reasonable math aptitude, the first 16 chapters should be understandable without ANY statistical background. If you are looking for a book that is comprehensive yet ultimately understandable for fundamental statistical procedures (data entry, data manipulation, frequencies, descriptives, chi-squares, t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, simple linear and multiple regression analysis, graphs) but includes excellent coverage on the more advanced procedures we suggest that this book was made for you.We, the authors, welcome your comments.

Fagan's &quot;Canyon Country Wildflowers&quot; is the best guide to these treasures that I've yet seen. The photographs are absolutely top-notch (sometimes I browse the guide, just daydreaming...), often showing the entire plant in its natural habitat. Likewise, the collection is relatively complete. Flowers are organized by colors and typically easy to find. To top it off, the book is relatively compact and durable in the field.

Questions range from the elementary of how long one should sit at a time to the more intensive of how to maintain concentration when not sitting. Omori Rotatishi was best able to convey his points by drawing upon his vigorous training as a martial artist of the samurai era and his scholarship in both Chinese and Japanese bringing to life the many traditional Zen teaching stories.The book provides an introduction to the physical nature of training, discussing ones state of mind, the physiology, breath, posture, pain, and drowsiness. Training is placed in a context which gives sitting meditation depth and breadth. Sanzen Nyumon discusses the rationale for zazen, the foundation of Zen training. Zazen, while seemingly a simple activity, is not just &quot;quiet sitting&quot; and its value remains in fully understanding the subtleties of the activity. The book also provides instructions on how to sit zazen, and how to adjust one's breath, posture and mental state."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Zen Training: Sanzen Nyomon","review":"This is a no nonense guide to zen training by a very hard man.I say hard-he was perhaps harder on himself than anybody else.Omori Sogen really drives home the amount of effort required to practice zazen.Practising the way Omori Sogen teaches will give real benefit in daily life.As he says if you are no use to society then what use are you?This hard Rinzai training is not suitable for everyone-it requires firm discipline to train in this manner-but its a thing worth doing.In these troubled times this practice can bring peace of mind and make people useful members of society.Its worth reading the biography of Omori Sogen by Hosokawa Dogen[available from Amazon]to get a real feel for the man and his teaching.If you want some touchy-feely type of meditation then dont buy this book.Life is hard and cruel but one can still have peace of mind.It sometimes requires that one is hard to oneself to get it."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Zen Training: Sanzen Nyomon","review":"It is well worth the money.

CARPETS is Hogan's anacronym for Case Analysis, Regression, Parts/Ego State, Time Track Therapy and Suggestive Therapeutics. The highlight of the model is the Time Track Component. Never have I seen such a beautiful piece of work in the field of hypnosis. What you learn is how to weave a clients past and future positive resources into their present day state of mind. This modality alone is worth the ... price of the book.The discussion of ethical issues, case analysis and legal issues is first rate. The details of regression are sketchy at first but made clear later in the book when his co-authors give verbatim transcripts of their session work. The ego state therapy is better described in Ego States by Watkins, but the treatment is sufficient. The specialty chapters on Emergency Hypnosis, Past Life Regression and even UFO abductions are tantalizing and always prefaced with cautions of ethical use and careful handling of the client.This book started off a bit clumsily and then by Chapter Two it was clear it was one of the finest books on hypnosis I have read.The New Hypnotherapy Handbook is a wonderful book for the advanced beginner and the seasoned practitioner."},{"Title":"The New Hypnotherapy Handbook: Hypnosis and Mind/Body Healing","review":"If you are a hypnotherapist who wants to really help people create permanent change this book is a must - period.I own and have read, highlighted and reread the original Hypnotherapy Handbook.

A young couple from Mass., after reading Henry David Thoreau's adventures in the mid 1800's, decides to test Mr. Thoreau's theories and heads to the 'new' state of Alaska. The lack of grocery stores, electricity, or 'modern' convienences pose little hardship for the Angiers, but instead this book profoundly shows how simple life can be, if we let it. One must wonder, in this day of 'futureistic' computers, if the life they lead in \\"At Home in the Woods\\" could ever be found again, or survived, by those of us today. The peace, yearning, and tranquillity that one gets from reading it seems to draw the reader to the wild once more."},{"Title":"At Home in the Woods","review":"I just finished this book tonight and must say that I loved every page of it. It was the first book of the Angier's that I have read, and I can tell you it won't be the last. The way both Brad and Vera describe in flowing detail and friendly, backwoods banter, how their first few years were like living in the mountains and off the land, will spark a fire in anyone who longs for such adventure. Read it. It is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"At Home in the Woods","review":"The book is a fictionalized memoir. Angier and his first wife, Irene, moved to B.C. and rented a cabin from a local woman while Angier wrote articles about the wilderness in order to make money, and Irene trekked into town for supplies. The couple experimented with \\"living off the land.\\" Some people of Hudson's Hope relate that the writer learned from residents about wildernless living and did not authentically live the life he claims in his book. His second wife is the 'Vena' of the tale, which uses Thoreau's philosophy and life to lend authority to a fictionalized segment of Angier's life. After the dam was built, Angier moved to California. The book &lt;At Home in the Woods> may have influenced some people to pack up their lives and head out for northern B.C.; some may have discovered that they were ill-prepared for the hardships they found. I'd like to hear your stories, whatever outcome applies to you."},{"Title":"At Home in the Woods","review":"I bought this copy for my son who loves to explore the woods and ledges of wild country.

Not &quot;based on a true story&quot;, but a real, live, no frills true story. If the title &quot;True Grit&quot; wasn't already taken for a cheesy western, I'd grab it for this book. It is about a couple in their 30's, living in Boston, romanticizing Thoreau and &quot;Walden&quot;. One day, the husband says, &quot;Let's do it. Let's find a location that will be condusive to living off the land, and go there.&quot;And so they do. Duffels full of axes, woolens, lanterns, and a few how-to books, they take a train to British Columbia, find an abandonded prospector's cabin, get it water-tight, and live there. Their nearest neighbor lives a half mile away, they're basically sqatting on this land, winter's coming, and they've got to live on oats and berries, and whatever Joe Boston (Bradford Angier) can kill out in the immense forest which serves as their backyard.It's wonderful. Very (to use that popular wine judger's phrase) approachable. Read: easy to read. You don't have to know anything about nothing to enjoy this book.

Each subliminal metaphor is carefully interwoven with the plot, like an intricate Celtic design. Set in the ancient Ireland of young Bridey O'Reilly, our Dorothyesque heroine who proves herself indispensable to St. Patrick in his quest to drive the serpents out of Eire. The author weaves Bridey's world out of the yarns of historical places and authentic folklore. Well worth picking up -- a great read for any age."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"I started and stopped the Renshai series with this novel. Too many references to characters I didn't know,and to characters I thought I did know from Norse mythology, but didn't expect to act the way they did in this novel. Maybe I've been brainwashed by the Wagnerian version of 'Twilight of the Gods', but I was expecting something a bit nobler and more awesome than showed up in 'Beyond Ragnarok'. The elves seemed to be particularly clueless."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"This book was great! But i was a little disapointed when Mitrian of Mar Lon (or the &quot;old&quot; characters) weren't in this book. But i realize it's necessary. It bothers me that they didn't tell about what happened to them in this book. I like the new charecters though. And the elves are funny! But another thing that REALLY annoyed me was that Reichert repeats herself over and over again. Like how every time Baltriane passes the paintings on the walls she always mentions that he takes no notice of the beautiful paintings or that it ceases to amaze him."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"Mickey has actually been able to comprehend the nature of our gods-well mostly anyway.The epic is higly entertaining more so because she manage to blend the danish,german and norweigen languages into concepts used by the elves without destroying the rest of the story.I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of the characters personalities but it\`s a good book anyway.If prince of demons is the end of the renshai chronicles it\`s a pretty strange ending of a epic."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"the begining of the book is very confusing and it dosent seem to &quot;connect&quot;with the last trilogy but over all it is a good book and i'm glad i read it. i hope micky keeps cranking em out!!!!"},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"I loved this book and Prince of Demons.

I had picked it up at chapters one day when my dad had taken me on a big book-spree (yes, im insanely in love with books) anyway, on our way out i spotted it in a bargain box and i instantly had to have it. Even though it was a beautiful hardcover, I got it for little more than 6 bucks. I bought it straight away. i started reading it that night and was done about 2 weeks later. The characters are amazingly real to me, and the setting was so well thought out that i was actually convinced a few times that it was real! i really loved that book, and have read it once more after that summer. If you like fantasy novels, I really do suggest this one because it has everything you could ever ask for; romance, fighting, quests, arguments, elves, humans, knights, princesses, kings, deception etc. etc. I could go on, but im not going to take up your time since your going to buy the book now instead of listening to me ramble on about how AWESOME it was **winks** go, buy, now!~Rav"},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"This book was almost the destruction of my 2nd quarter grades, since with it and the sequal I didn't really accomplish _any_ schoolwork for at least a week.

The author builds on the characters she created in the first trilogy and takes them to levels of conflict that she could not have set up otherwise.Good and evil?

They learn about violence, love, and the true evil that normal men of power can accomplish...on top of that, they are forced to deal with a supernatural evil of unprecedented levels.The badguy in this book will have you wanting to jump into the story, grab a sword, and take his head (sorry, reference to another good fantasy tale ;-) ).Don't start with this book and its trilogy...start with &quot;Last of the Renshai.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"Overall this was a great book. It is full of deception and heroism. Some of the characters seem to act irrational sometimes, but this is how it would work in real life. The plot is defined and developed, and the characters have strong values which they usually stick. I also enjoyed it because I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. This book is definately a good read, but I would not put it in my top five.(This book was great, don't get me wrong, but after this book definately read the Iron Tower Trilogy {The Dark Tide, Shadows of Doom, and The Darkest Day} by Dennis L.

However, the work continues on to become a sloppy mess, brightened only by the powerful images of the characters and the cool concept of Law vs. Chaos. The pace is definitely too slow, and the language has a flowery, showy feel, as if Reichert is trying to impress her readers. Well, it doesn't work, because the formality of the words adds to the tedium of the plot, which splits off in a dozen directions and meanders away to pointless storytelling."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"I thought this, as well as the other novels in the series, were VERY well written. I have to say that the romantic &quot;scenes&quot; were on the mushy side.

I still highly recomend the series."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"I found myself reading this book and wondering what is going on. I think Mickey hardley scratched the surface of the characters personalities and it seemed like they were just going through the movements."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"This is a young adventurer quest book, where a group of young teens venture off into the world in an effort to save the kingdom. As they progress through their mission, they are forced to make tough decisions and learn what growing up is all about. Unfortunately, this book is far from epic. It's the type of story where the heroes are more likely to get saved by a snarky talking cat than a regiment of heavily armored cavalry or dragon riding warriors. To make matters worse, the pacing sluggish and there are quite a few tangents that hurt the momentum of the story.Story:Angered over the destruction of their homeland, the elves decide to topple the human kingdoms by kidnapping the heir to the throne. A band of young teens form a party and covertly attempt to save the imprisoned prince. There's a princess, a knight, a thief, a Renshai, a bard, and a talking cat. (Yeah, the talking cat is going to be a deal breaker for many of you.)World Building:The world takes place after the mythical Ragnarok, the Viking End of the World, when the world is thrown out of balance and is consumed by demons and flame. Generations later, humanity is rebuilding, the wizards are no more, and the remaining gods must preserve a balance between good and evil and law and chaos. This book features more of the elves, who are magical, immortal, and incredibly naive.Characters:The strongest part of the book is the character development. Because they are all around the age of 15-16, they have a lot of growing up to do and this is a book about self discovery. The characters throw themselves into a difficult situation and realize who they really are in the process. They fight, argue, bond, and build friendships on their quest and they're all likeable in their own way.Writing Style:The weakest part of the book is the writing style. The plot seems to sputter as the story arcs skip from the elves to the party to the gods to the kingdom and due to the slow pacing of the book, you tend to forget what is happening in the world. You start asking yourself, \\"Where are they going, again?\\" \\"What were the gods doing?\\" etc... The other problem is that all of the dialogue scenes are painfully slow. In every scene, the author writes the dialogue, the character's emotions, and their gestures, so it ends up taking 3 pages to write, a very short and seemingly simple conversation. All of this is unnecessary. The reader will understand what the characters are feeling by the dialogue and the gestures. You don't need an entire paragraph of feelings for each line of dialogue.\\"Fine, we'll go East,\\" Tae reluctantly agreed.\\"You have no honor!\\" snarled Ravn through gritted teeth.These things work just fine. The only time you need to write the dialogue, gestures, and feelings are when they conflict. But to do this every time, in every scene, just feels tedious.Action:There is some good descriptive swordplay in the book and it's not overly gory. The book opens with a massive gods vs demons battle, but after that, there are just a few duels and skirmishes. Unfortunately, most of the swordplay scenes are the Renshai practicing their weapon katas. Every day... even when poisoned... even when imprisoned... 5 minutes after being tortured... they practice their flawless forms. This gets boring after a while because every time, it's the same: Perfect. This book could really use a montage.Maturity: TeensThe themes and lack of sex and gore suggests Teens! The main characters are young teens who are venturing out into the world and learning about themselves, so this is the right audience.Overall:There are some good parts in this book, the world is interesting, and there's an original portrayal of elves, but the story is bogged down by unnecessary tangents and the dialogue hampered by loads of unnecessary detail. If you're the type of reader who likes to visualize the story in your head, then you'll find this book very frustrating. If you love to read words and you want a young adventurer story, then you may like this book.Read it if you like the idea of young heroes on an important quest.Read it if you loved the first trilogy and want another one aimed at a younger audience.Avoid it if you like gritty action like the worlds of David Gemmell, Joe Abercrombie, or Warhammer.Avoid it if you like fast paced stories with momentum.Avoid it if you love the traditional portrayal of elves as wise acrobatic hunters adept with bows. You may not be able to accept these elves."},{"Title":"Beyond Ragnarok (Renshai Chronicles)","review":"I am a big fantasy fan but there are only two people i think have earned the right to be called real fantasy authers and mickey zucker riechert is on of them.

Thus, the lonely way.Confessional words from this studied church historian and exegete and ecumenist pour forth on observation of his own ecclesiastical scene as well as ours here in the States.The opening essay is fascinating, since it entails Sasse's initial visit to America. His comments are penetrating and analytical, e.g. \\"This churchliness of life has a down side to be sure: the secularization of the church. ... Tkhey have opened their doors in part to modern civilization, which has endangered the purity and depth of the faith. Here is the reason for that superficiality of American church life which repulses us Germans.\\" \\"The consequence of this, along with the concurrent leveling effect of American life, is an elimination of confessional anthitheses. .... All this has created a common religious atmosphere, in which the confessional lines are blurred. Thus fighting has been replaced by cooperation, one of the great American catchwords.\\"Delivered in 1928, an essay on the church as body of Christ is yet another of Sasse's confessional themes, strongly confessing the Lutheran substance of sacramental presence of Christ: \\"The church is the body of Christ, is identical with the body of Christ, which is really present in the Lord's Supper. The participation in the body and blood of Christ present in the Lord's Supper is synonymous with membership in his body.\\"Instructive thoughts and admonitions which provide more than ample reflective thought of their adaptation and input to current theological issues and ponderings.A valuable resource for the church of the Reformation and those interested in listening in on this timeless saint of the Lord's literary output."},{"Title":"Second Coming-The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan","review":"There is a type of sports fan endemic to Chicago: guys whose formative years spanned decades of losing seasons, guys who never learned the ups of fandom, just the downs, until the only joy they could take from professional sports was the cynic's pleasure of having their low expectations fulfilled. Guys, I admit it, like me. When a winner does finally appear in a city like Chicago, these fans react like albino fish brought up into the sun from the lightless depths, blinking uncomprehendingly: they know something is happening, but nothing in their experience tellsthem how to react. The good news is that most of us recover from the shock after a year or two, and that most of us don't become professional sportswriters. Then again, there's Sam Smith.Smith's &quot;Second Coming&quot; purports to be a hard-nosed examination of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls during Jordan's &quot;retirement&quot; from the NBA following the death of his father, Jordan's travails as a minor-league baseball player and subsequent return to basketball, with (at first) less-than spectacular results. A sequel to &quot;The Jordan Rules&quot;, Smith's first uncensored-behind-the-scenes look at the Bulls during their early-'90's title runs, this book is both less shocking -- you only have to open any week's sports pages to realize that today's pro atheletes are not choirboys -- and more mean-spirited than its predecessor.If Sam Smith were an NBA player, he'd be Bill Laimbeer: moderately talented, but cursed with a congenital inability to pass up a cheap shot (Smith takes gratuitous aim at everyone from the Bulls' TV announcers to Madonna) and the obnoxious habit of feigning bafflement that anyone would take offense (Smith is shocked, *shocked* that Jordan and others had less-than positive reactions to &quot;The Jordan Rules&quot;).There's no doubt that many aspects of professional sports are open to criticism, and Michael Jordan is no exception. But &quot;Second Coming&quot; provides little criticism and lots of tabloid-style dirt-dishing. Smith reports the facts of Jordan's gambling sprees (by far the most legitimate fan concern covered), but then sabotages his own credibility by mentioning every scurrilous rumor, most of them proven to be false, that followed those events and the shooting of James Jordan. I held on as Smith hammered away at his theme -- that Jordan was too old, too selfish, and too poor a leader for his comeback to be successful -- waiting for the &quot;bonus chapter&quot; (added to the paperback edition) on the Bulls' historic '95-'96 season. How would Smith explain his remarkable lack of predictive skills? He wouldn't, preferring instead to concentrate on the antics of Dennis Rodman.If you want to know more about the dark side of professional sports, and maybe even do something about it, read Mike Lupica's scorching fan manifesto &quot;Mad as Hell&quot;. If you want to read about Jordan and the Bulls, buy Bob Greene's sublime &quot;Hang Time&quot; and its sequel &quot;Rebound&quot;. Lupica may be a bit overinflated and Greene a little too uncritical of his subject, but at least neither of them have forgotten the reasons why we started watching the game in the first place"},{"Title":"Second Coming-The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan","review":"&quot;Second Coming: The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan - from Courtside to Home Plate and Back Again,&quot; by Sam Smith, is a biogarphy about Michael Jordan. It starts out a little before he won his first NBA championship with the Chicago Bulls. It tells about the seasons leading up to his retirement in October of 1993. Through that time, the author talks about the next two seasons. It talks about Jordans' personality at the time, and some of the problems he was having to deal with. It profiles Jordans' gambling troubles and the troubles he was having with the media. This book is similar to the book &quot;Tiger Woods: The Makings of a Champion.&quot; These two books are very similar because of their genre. They are both biographies about famous sports stars. The only difference between the two is that the Tiger Woods book talks more about his childhood than the Michael Jordan book does. I thought that this book was very good. I liked it because I really liked the structure of it. I thought that it was really easy to read because it goes in a logical order. I think that since it has good order, this serves as a good model for writing. There really is not much imagery in the book because it is a biography. I thought that this book was very good because it tells a lot of good stuff about Michael Jordan's professional career. I think that one thing that this book lacked was information on his personal life. I think that I could have realated better to the story had there been more personal info on him. I think that anybody who likes to follow Michael Jordan would enjoy this book very much. Overall I liked this book a lot and I hope to read more books by this author."},{"Title":"Second Coming-The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan","review":"I have been searching everywhere for this book, amazed and delighted now that i can read it, thankyou so much for the great service and affordable prices."},{"Title":"Second Coming-The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan","review":"I have mixed feelings about Michael Jordan. On the one hand, he is a great athlete. I respect his work ethic. He has turned in a number of great performances and is no doubt one of the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.There is a flipside. Michael Jordan got all kinds of special treatment while he was in the NBA. He was the first player I noticed who was granted all kinds of trips to the charity stripe because of unbelievably, ticky tack calls. He scored at least ten points a game at the free throw line from bogus calls. It was great when there was a picture session for 'greats of the game' with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Magic told Larry not to stand too close to Michael or they might call a foul. In front of reporters and television viewers, that was a classic comment by Magic. I believe Mike got 99% of all calls in his favor because he was such a cash cow for the NBA. Dominique Wilkins was robbed of a slam dunk championship when Mike scored a perfect 50 doing the same dunk Dr. J did years before. I doubt Dr. J ever received a perfect 50 for it. Dominique's dunk was much more impressive, and he received a 49.5. Please. Mike got in a fight with Reggie Miller, and only Miller got suspended at first. Only after there was an outcry did Mike get suspended. How are Mike's punches different? Mike elbowed Kevin Johnson to the ground for all to see, and Kevin was called for blocking!I am not too impressed that the bulls beat the lakers in the NBA finals. Magic was double teamed every game every minute he was in. On top of that, James Worthy and Byron Scott were injured. Magic and Larry never won three championships in a row because the competition, teams, and players in the 80s were much better than the nineties. Luc Longley, Will Perdue, Bill Cartwright, or Bill Wennington stopping Kareem? Ha!Sport Magazine recently had a piece on the ten greatest moments and ten greatest players ever in the NBA. Mike was ranked number one all time player. Kudos to Mike for mentioning in 'For the love of the game' that to pick a &quot;greatest ever&quot; is impossible because of all the different eras and evolutions of basketball. The nineties bulls were given three of the ten greatest moments in NBA history. This is just more Mike bias. Give me a break. There are hundreds of classic and amazing moments in NBA history. One of the moments picked was Mike beating the Jazz in the final minutes of his last game. He put his hand on Bryon Russel's backside and shoved him out of the way. Then Mike made the game winnig shot. All eyes were on Mike, but the ref did not make the obvious call.There is also Mike's arrogance. According to him, Wilt Chamberlain was a fluke eventhough Wilt was a great all around player. He made a comment about Magic and Larry reaching a 'certain level of greatness' and that the two were not good on defense. What? Are we talking about the same Larry Bird? Shaquille Oneal is also much better and much improved than Mike gives him credit for. Shaq has turned into a solid defender, passer, and he works hard at both ends of the floor.Mike's corporate poster boy behavior is laughable. He did ads for AT&amp;T and then MCI. The Wayans family is also split between the two companies. Mike talked about the enviroment in Rayovac ads and then pitches hot dogs? Mike is not the only athlete who will pitch anything and everything to make millions. I wonder if Mike has checked into Nike's labor practices.Players like Mike and Charles Barkley soured me on the NBA. Charles played like a thug and got away with it because he was a star. Plus, Charles insisted on wearing number 34 at Philadelphia eventhough it was retired for NBA great Billy Cunningham. The star treatment and inflated egos has grown old, and that has turned a lot of people off to sports. I miss the Lakers and Celtics match ups of the 1980s."},{"Title":"Second Coming-The Strange Odyssey of Michael Jordan","review":"I agree with back and forth. People who slam the book are biased. MJ has a good and bad side, and the people who whine are probably his fans or have shares in his company. The problem is players from different eras can't be compared. How do you compare Oscar Robertson to Earvin Johnson? You can't...but you can compare them relative to the players in their era, to players they played against, and compare their relative greatness to the relative greatness to the players from other eras. Compare Michael to others relative to his contribution of others...don't just compare scoring, or Dominique Wilkins would be surely better than Bill Russell...only a misinformed or ignorant NBA basketball fan would think something as preposterous as that. Kudos for Sam Smith and taking off the kid gloves. If the book is all trash journalism, why didn't Michael sue for slander or defamation of character? There must be some truth to it."},{"Title":"Proverbs (Old Testament Message Volume 17)","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to the Sapiential literature as well as an explanation of the Book of Proverbs. Proverbs is an unusual biblical book in that it mixes practical maxims and advice with religious instruction. As author Dermot Cox, OFM explains, this is at least partially because the book is a collection of sayings from a variety of sources, some religious and some secular.After the explanation of the role of Wisdom literature in Scripture, it goes through Proverbs by quoting a section and then explaining it. The quotations save the reader the inconvenience of having to consult the Bible while progressing through the book. The explanations are easy to follow and understand. I feel that, after reading this, I have a better understanding of Wisdom literature in general and Proverbs in particular. For that I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Weapons and Hope (author of disturbing th universe)","review":"In \\"Weapons and Hope\\" Freeman Dyson combines the work of filling in the autobiography he started in \\"Disturbing the Universe\\" and the task of reflecting intelligently and critically on how, exactly, man may hope to survive as a species, having created nuclear weapons and having armed several nations with them.The autobiography part of \\"Weapons and Hope\\" takes a different tack from \\"Disturbing the Universe,\\" its biographical half being largely a chronicle of his father, the elder George Dyson, musician, cashiered teacher, composer, who redeemed himself and made a respectable living in the unlikeliest way imaginable for a musician pressed into World War I - by writing an instruction manual for the use of hand grenades, royalties from which removed his financial burdens for quite some time. Dyson's unflinching honesty in relating the shape of his father's early life is perhaps the best testimonial to that man; one can only hope to be the sort of man who could come through as well in such a recounting as Freeman Dyson's father.This sort of biographical detail is alternated with a very frank and erudite discussion of how nations actually use weapons to help achieve their national goals, as opposed to how we are taught this happens. As Dr.Dyson is one of that select group of physicists who seem to be consulted on the thornier technical aspects of national defense with regularity through many different administrations, his vantage on the subject matter is as good as one could hope for; his narration is at once clearer, more pleasant to read, and more piercingly accurate than anyone has a right to expect.Dyson also possesses the integrity to scrupulously separate what he knows to be true from what he believes to be true, something that other scientist-commentators on national defense such as the late Carl Sagan were not always as careful to do. One comes away from Dyson's cogently argued discussion of the several possible paths through the thicket of nuclear defense policy not so much reassured as armed with the information one needs to make the best of what is a grim situation indeed... and feeling as though one has sat with the man and discussed the matter with him at length and rather enjoyably.Freeman Dyson's gift for presenting even the most esoteric information accessibly and conversationally reminds one of C.S. Lewis' better essays, without the partisan glibness in which Lewis occasionally indulged. Having been a lifelong and devoted reader of Dyson's, when I Emailed him to ask about a point of technical history I was looking into several years ago, I had to be careful to remember that we had in fact never met - his writing is so readable and personable that one comes away feeling that one in fact had had the opportunity to discuss his subject with him in person.Whether you are curious about the actual state of national and global nuclear weapons policy (as opposed to what we have been told for years) and the ways in which we might survive the situation we are now in, or want simply to spend several hours in the most enjoyable way possible, I can recommend \\"Weapons and Hope\\" heartily.

What he learned there, his experiences studying under Manhattan Project scientists at Cornell, and work on arms control treaties in the early 60s, informs this thoughtful, humble and painstaking examination of arms control and cold war diplomacy.While not as urgent a read as it might have been ten years ago, Weapons and Hope is still worth reading.

Far too often therapists and others in the counselling field misdiagnose and mistreat those who are suffering from TRS.

I did not disagree about everything he said, somethings I think that everyone can agree on regarding why and the emotions behind the destructive behavior. The author tries to take things one step further explaining why people with these self destructive behaviors do what they do but I just felt he was way off. Also it bothered be that the continually used the term self mutilation which is offending for those of us that do practice SI and it seems to me that had he understood more about the behavior he would use another term.

It's very intense and has a great deal of upsetting and graphic stories of abuse- many of which are sexual in nature. It's hard to get through at times. If you are in the midst of dealing with a cutting problem, this might be too hard to read. If you are just starting to recover, this might trigger a relapse. It's a good book, but just proceed with great caution."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book of Hope and Understanding","review":"My therapist let me borrow his copy of this book when he first started treating me. If anything, this book was more upsetting to me than helpful. I went ahead and gave it three stars because I think if you were a professional trying to get a grasp of what was going on in the head of someone who self injures then this book would be helpful. But for me the graphic descriptions of the abuse the women in the book suffered was a bit much, especially while trying to process my own issues. Plus it did not offer me any true insight into my own problems with self injury, or any guidance as to how to stop.

In order to understand these women, it is necessary, says the author, to understand TRS, or Trauma Reenactment Syndrome. All of the women in this book were subconsciously reenacting experienced trauma in childhood. Once made to comprehend that, the women were given a &quot;program&quot; of sorts to help them find their way out of the ever progressive syndrome of self abuse. This book made me look at this syndrome with new eyes and a clearer understanding of the courage the women she writes about have. This book will provide assistance for the many women out there who live with the shame of their obsessions, and will provide hope for a brighter tomorrow. Dusty Miller writes to the average reader, as well as to therapists and other professionals. The book is easy to understand and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book of Hope and Understanding","review":"I think this book is a must read for anyone who is treating or in a relationship with a women her engages in risky behaviors or self-mutilation.

She describes how women may try a variety of therapies and self-help organizations for addictions yet, they don't resolve the issue. For example, they go to Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and that doesn't quite fit, although the information can be helpful. Some women go to cognitive therapy for years and worked on child abuse issues, while it might have resolved a lot, it still may be found lacking. She claims that the term complex PTSD more closely approaches the panoply of problems displayed by trauma survivors yet more needs to be included.She labels the problem as Trauma Reenactment Syndrome or TRS whose central characteristics include:1. A sense of being at war with one's body2. Extreme secrecy as a central organizing principle of life3. Inability to self-protect, often evident in a specific kind of fragmentation of the self4. Relationships in which the struggle for control overshadows all elseMiller uses a triadic relationship model between the abuser-victim-non-protecting-presence to explain the dynamics that occur when people continue to hurt themselves even when they know it is wrong.At one point the abuser and non-protecting presence were external. Later, the roles become internalized in order to maintain relationships. At various times, the self-injurer flips through all three roles. There is no room for a protective presence and therefore one grows up to have difficulty in keeping herself safe.There are case studies throughout the book that provide clear examples ranging from child torture to an over-tending grandparent. Some of these are rather graphic, but to understand the problem, it is necessary to see its depth and the reasons for the resilience to therapy.The second part of the text discusses therapeutic solutions. It is not written as convincingly as the first part. It gives the impression that the author may be still trying to determine the best therapeutic method.What Miller comes up with is a method based on an outer ring, middle ring and center ring. Each ring represents the level of knowledge gathering and revelation that takes place between the therapist and the client, with the center being the most intense.What is understood is that the therapist is doomed to failure if they push for information too quickly. There must be a deepening trust along with an understanding off rules and procedures between the therapist and the client before dealing with the core issues. If a client were to enter therapy to primarily deal with sexual abuse issues, the therapist should slow the process until a necessary rapport and trust relationship has been developed.I would recommend this book highly to women who have been in recovery for some time and are still wondering why it isn't working. I think all therapists should read this book to get a more in depth understanding of Trauma Reenactment Syndrome."},{"Title":"Women Who Hurt Themselves: A Book of Hope and Understanding","review":"At last...there is hope of recovery. After reading many other books on the subject of self-harm, a lot of them containing helpful information, I still despaired of getting well. When I came across Dusty Miller's book, I was amazed at the depth of insight into self-injurious behavior it contained. I feel like shouting to the world that SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS. The book addresses a problem shrouded in mystery even to the woman herself, but I believe that the author has found the key. It is not my custom to write reviews even though I devour books of all subjects; however, I had to encourage other women to get this book.

I have been through inpatient and outpatient treatment for bulimia and drinking and have not been able to stop hurting myself.

If you think that you might be a woman who in whatever way keeps reverting to abusing herself for release, relief, comfort, or just to keep your sanity, I highly recommend this book. It will not cure you, but it gives great insight and has helped me feel less out of control in many ways. I can now see why I act in certain ways (i.e. try so hard to be close to someone them continuosly push them away, and more).

Fearful of Gamel Abdel Nasser's pan-Arabism and his popularity in the west where Isreal had come to expect it would enjoy support, Israel mobilized a small guerrila force of young and mostly Egyptian Jews (in an ironic hint to the Exodus, Egyptian Jews were called &quot;Hawagat&quot;, signifying that they were less Egyptian citizens then residential aliens) to execute small attacks around that country, less to destroy it than merely make it look less orderly than Nasser could claim. Under circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery to this day, the conspiracy fell apart and the usual suspects were soon rounded up, tortured and imprisoned in brutal Egyptian jails. When the Egyptians published their findings to the world, the feedback wreaked havoc in Israel, bringing down the government and destroying long constructed public careers. For those not executed by the Egyptians (once their ties were firmly linked to Israel and not merely some super-patriotic gang of Egyptians leery of any contact with the west) the ordeal only began with their convictions around 1954. Though Israel captured hundreds of Egyptians in her wars of 1956 and the Six Day War of 1967 (including the military officer who presided over the trial), the surviving members of the operation (in this book, the term used is &quot;the mishap&quot;) remained incarcerated through early 1968. Even still, a gag order prevented them from telling their story until the mid 1970's, by which time, they still had more questions than answers. Mostly - why was there no warning that they had been compromised?; why had no escape route been prepared?; and most heartbreaking of all - why were they left to rot when Israel held hundreds of Egyptian POWs in the Sinai campaigns of '56 and '67?Author Aviezer Golan seeks no answers, rather tries telling an absorbing story that only begins with the mishap's participants entrance into 14 years of incarceration. The book is actually most poignant when looking inside the Egyptian prisons. If De Tocqueville was right about analyzing a nation through its jails, then those in Egypt have a strange story to tell. Though jailed with many petty criminals and murderers, the Mishap's conspirators also meet political prisoners - both far-right Islamists of &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; and various leftists who had run afoul of the Nasser regime in its many political shifts. Prison conditions, like politics make strange allies and leftist Egyptians who befriended the imprisoned Jews at first, turned against them when politics shifted in their direction. The hardcore Islamists, though taught to abhor the Jews as a matter of eternal religion, forge a more durable bond with the Jews, admittedly not one that can be expected to change things outside of prisons. All in all, &quot;Operation Susanah&quot; isn't a story you'll forget."},{"Title":"The relations between Arabs and Israelites prior to the rise of Islam, (The Schweich lectures)","review":"(From another review): \\"The Relations Between Arabs and Israelites Prior to the Rise of Islam.\\" By D.

Thus, it is not for those who don't know Irving Penn, unless they are adventurous students of photography. This is evidently a collection of random works which together form a map of Penn's artistic mind. It is like a conversation with him about some of his work.It contains sketches and photographs presented un-pretentiously, one on a page. Each one is a key or entry point into Penn's work and a hinge between him and the world of art and culture of his time. If you are not fresh off the turnip truck this is a book that may take a year to read as you think about each image and the infinite connections it has. If you are serious about photography and don't know Penn and his influence, this book will last you a lifetime as you study his sketch of the tree of those who influenced him. Any of his contemporaries mentioned on the tree could easily have erased his own name and put Irving Penn in his place, I think.My favorites are his messing with his portrait of John Marin, his unusual portrait of Barnett Newman, and other sketches and scribblings on or about some of his familiar work. I was struck by his photographs of the street, and some other subjects few of us have ever seen. This book is revealing in much the same way as Earthly Bodies.If you just like great photographs, this is a thought provoking, warm and modest tribute to one of the architects of the medium. If you are an artist and can't imagine being 87 and able to produce a random notebook this rich, you have a lot of work to do."},{"Title":"A Notebook at Random","review":"Irving Penn is a wonderful photographer and this book is a unique opportunity for any serious student of photography (or Pro) to peak over the shoulder of a master. Penn's technical ability and sense of composition has always placed him in a unique position whether for Vogue magazine, Gianni Versace ads, or personal work. Unlike his other photo books \\"A Notebook at Random\\" addresses the ideas behind the images by showing the minimal notes and insightful line drawings that were the blue prints for some of his images. Thanks Mr. Penn for being so generous."},{"Title":"A Notebook at Random","review":"We often do not get the chance to view the notes, sketches, and thoughts that an artist goes through along side with the final piece, with this book that is what you are getting. This is not a book that biographies' the life and works of Irving Penn chronologically. Instead the book is fashioned in a random order, which gives us an insight into the inner workings of Irving Penn as a person.Some of the highlights of this book are the amount of photographs which have never before been published or seen by the public, along with many of his signature pieces throughout his career. This book truly gives us a better understanding into the raw endowment, originality, and involvement as a photographic engineer and a daring artist."},{"Title":"A Notebook at Random","review":"As a long-time admirer of Irving Penn, I thought this would be yet another look at the many images from past books.

By then in her thirties, she had already achieved the status of restricted person because of her political allegiances and her declared opposition to illiberal white rule. These days Zimbabwe makes the news because of internal strife and oppression. It is worth remembering, however, that fifty years ago the very structures of Southern Rhodesian society were built upon oppression, an oppression based purely on race.Fifty years on Doris Lessing's Going Home an historical record of this noxious system, a record that is more effective, indeed more powerful because of its reflective and observational, rather than analytical style. Doris Lessing, a one-time card-carrying Communist, laid a large slice of the blame for the perpetuation of discrimination firmly at the door of the white working class. Though not all white workers were rich - indeed she records that many were abjectly poor - what they had and sought to preserve was an elevated status relative to the black population. She describes white artisans as white first and artisans second. Though trade unions actively sought equal pay for equal work, they never campaigned for any kind of parity for black workers. On the contrary, they demanded the maintenance of racially differentiated pay rates. How's that for the spirit of socialist internationalism and brotherhood! (I accept there is a misplaced word there...). In fact Doris Lessing records that it was the relatively liberal capitalist enterprises that demanded more black labour, their motive of course arising from cost savings, not philanthropy. So trade unions spent much of their time making sure that companies hired their quota of higher paid, white labour.Even in the 1950s, she remarks on the likelihood that many Africans were already better educated than their white counterparts. White youth shunned education as unnecessary, while Africans saw it as a possible salvation. She notes that the people who treated the African population the worst were recent immigrants from Europe, particularly those from Britain, who tended to be less educated themselves and drawn from the ranks of the politically reactionary. Such people, apparently, were equally critical of immigrants from southern Europe, and expected Spaniards and Greeks to work for African wages, not the white wages that they themselves demanded.The situation in Rhodesia, clearly, had to change. Not only was such crass discrimination unsustainable, it was also comic, as are all racially posited class systems. While the South Africans over the border created honorary whites of the Japanese they increasingly had to do business with, the Rhodesians went through their own equally idiotic contortions. An example of such nonsense is quoted by Doris Lessing when she remarks that there was a privileged group of Africans who were granted the right not to carry passes with them at all times, as long as they carried a pass to record their exemption.But it is also worth remembering that Doris Lessing, herself, was a banned person, unable to travel to certain places and very much under the watchful eyes of the authorities. In Going Home she observes a society that had to collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. The fact that this took more than twenty years after the book was written was nothing less than a crime, and probably contributed to the subsequent and equally lamentable reaction.Doris Lessing records seeing a British film towards the end of her travels. She describes it as a \\"cosy little drama of provincial snobberies and homespun moralities played out in front of African farmers in their big cars\\". Fifty years on, Britain is probably cosy and provincial, and the snobberies are still rife. But now it is not Rhodesia where these reactionaries look down on people of other races overpay and under-educated themselves. It is not in Africa where corporations would dearly love to employ cheaper labour, imported if need be. Rhodesia's white privilege of the 1950s was obviously absurd. But there are some parallels with economic and class relations in the Britain of today and, like all good books, Doris Lessing's Going Home may even add prescience to its qualities."},{"Title":"Going home","review":"Lessing documents the nature of the political and cultural milieu of Southern Rhodesia in the mid-fifties. In many ways this is an excellent historical investigation in journalistic prose.My concern is with the book's underlying assumption that that those who left Britain to occupy the colony either became less moral, or were already less moral, than those who stayed behind. Lessing tends to represent those who remained back in Britain as denizens of proper and correct behavior. Life in Africa is thus seen to exert a corrupting influence on otherwise wholesome and correctly mannered British people:\\"Why was it that when white people came out from Britain, first they were indignant about the colour bar and the treatment of the Africans, and then they very fast became as rude and cruel as the old Rhodesians?\\" (p162)I feel the book has the quality of being a bit dated for its moralizing perspective.\\"Africa belongs to the Africans\\" and Europe belongs to the Europeans is the underlying premise of the book -- and although it is unspoken, it comes across in many different ways, such as in the formulation quoted above.What needs to be examined, in order to give a sense of context to the book, is whether attitudes remain automatically \\"civilized\\" so long as they do not go abroad.Also, are black Africans not similarly subject to \\"corruption\\" by virtue of living in Africa -- or is this corrupting effect of the continent only effective on the whites who have gone there?Lessing's book attempt to teach a moral lesson about colonialism, but leaves these fundamental philosophical questions unanswered."},{"Title":"Fraud : Bringing Light to the Dark Side of Business","review":"Very well written and highly informative book on the white collar crime issue of Fraud. Dr. Albrecht has outdone himself with this extremely useful and easily understood literary work. As a fellow researcher in the white collar crime realm, I feel that this book will be an excellent reference and referal for me when I am conducting my empirical research. I feel that his in depth but easily understandable definitions of the various kinds of fraud are a useful tool for the reader who is essentially uniformed about the global growing concern of fraud. I strongly believe that his sections on the pressures involving white collar crime are quite true and accurate. This book should also be used as a tool for professional law enforcement, accountants, and attorneys to expand their knowledge of the many faces of fraud."},{"Title":"Fraud : Bringing Light to the Dark Side of Business","review":"This the the most descriptive book about fraud ever written...hands down!

If you have ever wanted to get an idea about how a forensic accountant thinks, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Fraud : Bringing Light to the Dark Side of Business","review":"This introductory text rather thoroughly covers the basics of fraud symptoms, control factors, detection methods, investigations, and prevention. It's quite easy to read, with short, interesting case studies. By reading this book, I not only learned a lot, but also had a clearer appreciation for the entire scope of the subject(s), thereby permitting me to discern which areas I should consider for additional education and training. The authors did a splendid job of writing &quot;to instruct the reader&quot; as opposed to simply presenting their acquired knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"Symbols of Japan: Thematic Motifs in Art and Design","review":"The book is organized by themes. Each chapter is a group of symbols. The chapters are: 1 - Cosmos, Heaven, &amp; Earth; 2 - Trees &amp; their fruits; 3 - Diverse plants; 4 - Birds &amp; insects; 5 - Land &amp; sea animals; 6 - Demons, deities, and figural groups; 7 - Religion &amp; good fortune; 8 - Objects of everyday life; 9 - Music, board games, and cultural pursuits;Within each chapter, each subject is treated alphabetically. So for example for Ch. 4, subjects treated are: ...., Bamboo shoots, Beans, Bellflower, Bracken, Bush Clover, Chrysantemum,....The information is there, no question. I was looking into what the heck was that egg-shaped 'tama' that I've seen associated with the Inari fox several times on netsukes, now I know (it's a wish granting jewel.) The 2 reproaches I would make are the following:First, the information is there but it's a very dry reading. So for example in the case of the tama &amp; Inari fox, I know now what a tama is, but I would have loved a little bit more info on why it is associated to the Inari fox, why it's shaped like an egg, etc. Basically, I would have liked some info on the legend behind the symbol.Second, the book hesitates between being a scholarly reference book (somewhat dry content) and an entry level one (1 inch deep and 1 mile wide.) For example, the Chrysantemum gets as much treatment as the Cherry Tree (FYI, a full page), but the author only mentions that it is an imperial emblem once, en passant, in the last paragraph (as if any reader, of course, would already know that.) She also doesn't talk about how the Kikumon is used by artists who had been such authorized by the imperial family as an endorsement / reward.The book is quite well illustrated with generally at least 1 plate per page. Illustrating ALL themes would have required 2 more books! Some of the pictures are of unusual subjects such as modern jpz art pieces that I at least had not had the opportunity to see before, or a couple of amber netsuke. Loads of inro boxes, netsuke, and prints. I have not seen a single sword blade (but there's at least 1 tsuba.) There are a great quantity of small size example of mons, typically a couple for each key theme (e.g., 2 for each of Stars, Sun, Moon, Lightning, but none on Snow, Rocks, Mountains,...)All and all I will give it a grade of 4 out of 5, as an entry level reference book for Jpz culture *generally speaking*. If you are looking for an treaty focusing on a specific art, or one that would give you more than the raw information and include legends and stories, you might be disappointed."},{"Title":"Symbols of Japan: Thematic Motifs in Art and Design","review":"This wonderful, fascinating, and gorgeous book is one of the most useful volumes I have ever come across. After years of wondering what visual images signify on Japanese artifacts like a wedding kimono, this remarkable book enables us to understand what they mean. If you want to know what an adulteress looks like, you will find out in this book. An adulteress wears one pot on her head for every adultery. The puzzling world of the netsuke, in which men often sport frogs on their heads, is explained here. The index is entirely useful, so that anything can be found quickly. I looked up &quot;tanuki&quot; (like our raccoon) and &quot;hair,&quot; and found a wealth of information immediately. This book is so beautiful it is enough simply to look at it, but it also gives the reader access into deep understanding of Japanese culture. You will amass an enormous understanding without even being aware of it. Merrily Baird has gone ardously and exhaustively afield, and the result is a book that is astonishingly readable, often funny, and completely sound.

It is written clearly; the images are wonderful; the margin images with added information (with lots of crests/mons) add to and supplement the entries. Plus, the index is done well. Example, you can look up Aoi, or Hollyhock without having to figure out the Japanese word for Hollyhock. This is a plus for me since I don't know Japanese. There's also a list of eras with dates, both Japanese and Chinese, for quick reference. Finally, the book is published by Rizzoli. If you know anything about art books, you know that you can't get any better, and this book confirms that once again. I'm using it to research the iconography on an old piece of Japanese cloisonne.

If those children might be walking around amongst us? If those same children might be victims of a diabolical plot to deprive them of their rightful inheritance?Neither had I until I stumbled onto a gratis copy of Benjamin E. Dean's classic tome \\"A Virginian in Yankeeland.\\" This is THE indispensable work for those of us who have wondered about the issue of our greatest Founding Father's issue.Benjamin Dean is apparently a man wealthy enough to self-publish his own account of being \\"George Washington VI\\". Bully for him, I say. The world needs more of this sort of thing. In any event, Benjamin Dean stumbled upon this revelation sometime in the 1940s while he was in Kentucky. A bunch of GIs, off to fight the Nazis, observed that he had a stunning resemblance to George Washington (Just like the grocery clerk I saw the other day who thought I resembled James K. Polk).By far the best section of this immense book is the introduction. The rest of the book, as far as I can tell, is full of rich yarns about the author's childhood in upstate New York. But the introduction lays bare the heart of the matter, including the author's (or, as he likes to write, \\"your George Washington VI\\" or \\"your Virginian\\") fight to reveal the truth.He first made his point sometime during the 60s when he called a live radio show to declare his ancestry. After that, in his words, \\"seven years of media silence\\" followed. His next big break was an appearance on a \\"closed-circuit\\" TV show sometime in the 1970s. Finally he got the attention of the powerful interests who connive to deprive the heirs of Washington of what is rightfully theirs. A very catty article was written about him. Nothing if not determined, Benjamin Dean has chosen to take the high road in answering this scurrilous attack, writing and publishing a multivolume epic.And you have to hand it to him. I can't say I fully read this book, but anyone interested in the history of upstate New York in the early 20th century, or the progeny of George Washington will undoubtedly find this books and its sequels riveting. May Benjamin Dean write and publish many more books on these themes!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons is an Agatha Christie murder mystery. The novel opens in the Royal Palace of Ramat. A politcal coup is in place against Prince Ali Yusef. Ali is a young and democratic leader of the land. His aideEnglishman Bob Rawlinson and Ali plan to flee the country in a plane. Prior to this flight, Bob hides a bag containing priceless jewels in his sister Joan Sutcliffe's room in the hotel. Joan and her daughter Jennifer were visiting Ramat as tourists. Bob and Yusef are killed when their plane crashes. Where are the jewels?The plot then revolves around the events at the exclusive Meadowbank School for young ladies. The school was founded by the formidable Miss Bulstrode. Three persons are murdered at the school as the murderer wishes to locate the hidden jewels. The police are unable to solve the crimes until Hercule Poiret steps in to unweave all the strings in this complex thriller.A fun read as Agatha Christie's brilliant mind leads her readers through a complicated maze until the solution of the mystery is made manifest by Poiret. An excellent Christie!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"I have recently decided to revisit the wonderfully entertaining works of Dame Agatha Christie. And after a more than thirty year hiatus I have found the reading as fresh and entertaining as ever. The author has an engaging style that holds the attention throughout the writing, and this is certainly evident in \\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\". From the first pages the reader is provided with a detailed and intimate acquaintance with the physical setting as well as the characters, and this is developed and carried throughout the ensuing pages. I especially enjoyed the appearance of the indomitable Hercule Poirot in the later chapters and the cool development of his part in the solution to the mystery at hand. I have made a vow with my \\"little grey cells\\" to re-read every one of Dame Agatha' s Poirot collection as well as her other works."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"excellent read with very intricate and clever plot , with the usual high quality standard you can get from Agatha Christie's book. My only comment is that Poirot comes in to the story only very late about a bit more than halfway through the book, but very good nevertheless"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is one of the best books by my favourite writer.full of suspense and some action too.Only thing that bothered me was that our \\"Little Belgian\\" is introduced in the 2nd half of the book.its highly recommend to any Christie fan."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is my first experience with Agatha Christie. Mystery is not a genre I read a lot of, but Christie is so well-known I thought I'd give it a shot. Many novels do have elements of mystery in them, of course, particularly in hiding certain plot points or motivations until the end, so I am familiar with the conventions. I find that mystery, like many other things in life, is at its best before everything is revealed. Monster movies are always scarier when you don't see the monster than when you do. Cat Among the Pigeons is no different. I think it has a satisfying reveal, but Christie cheats a little to throw us off track.I like Christie's writing style. She sprinkles plenty of wit and humor throughout her storytelling. There is a general feeling amongst the characters that there is a cat among the pigeons. Somebody doesn't belong, but nobody can put their finger on who. The reader will have their guesses, of course, based on evidence and hunches. Christie throws out plenty of red herrings, and it's our job to try and see past these distractions. I had an idea of who the murderer was, but I was proved wrong. At first I was okay with this, but as Christie revealed more details I felt like she cheated. Something happens that leads us off the trail of the killer, and while there is motivation behind this something that happens, it is nonetheless difficult to believe it would happen. I will leave this vague so as not to spoil anything for you.Other than this, there was plenty to enjoy. The description of the workings of Meadowbank were fun to read, as was getting to know the key characters like Miss Bulstrode, who seems to amaze everybody, even the narrator. The introduction of Hercule Poirot feels random, but I guess it is necessary to solve the mystery. The early scenes in Ramat were also effective. There's a brief moment of interesting political discussion that took me off guard. The prince of Ramat can't understand why his people want to rebel against him. He wants to enact welfare programs to help his people, where his father was a murderous tyrant. Yet they want to oust the nice one. He's hurt and bewildered by these developments. It's as though his people aren't ready for a progressive leader just yet. The prince is left wondering the same thing as Miss Bulsrode - why murder at all?"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"I admit that I like old-fashioned books like Agatha Christie's. For me this was not a \\"typical\\" Christie book, which is probably one of the things I like about her so much - I find that often, her books are not quite what I expect them to be. In this case, a coup in a Middle Eastern country, a missing sack of precious jewels, and murder at an exclusive girls' school in England mix for a fun and fast read. I like the way Christie does international intrigue; and it's also interesting to see how the unrest in the Middle East of the 1950s continues today.Another interesting thing about the book is that Hercule Poirot doesn't show up until the last third. As much as I like Christie, a little bit of Hercule goes a long way. (I often find the mysteries in the Hercule books \\"better\\" than the mysteries in the Miss Marple books, but I do enjoy Miss Marple's company more.) So, this was just the right amount of M. Poirot for me. As usual, he asks his crazy questions, like \\"Did anyone notice her knees?\\", that turn out to be quite useful in uncovering the mystery.Something else I noticed was Christie's wit. Interestingly, I don't usually think of Christie as in the \\"witty\\" category, but there is a nice sprightliness in the book that keeps the pages turning. The characters are well drawn, too; I know there are critics who complain about Christie's \\"lack of characterization,\\" but the personalities at the girls' school are very nicely drawn. Overall, I enjoyed the mixing of the genres here and found CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS to be a pleasant summer read. Of course, it's not one of her very greatest (like TEN LITTLE INDIANS, MURDER ON THE O. EXPRESS, ROGER ACKROYD) but it's not one of her pretty bad ones (like ELEPHANTS CAN REMEMBER or POSTERN OF FATE).Enjoy - and if you have a teenager who likes mystery, get him or her into trying Agatha Christie. A great way to help teenagers become lifelong readers."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is generally thought of a mystery novelist, the creator of Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple--but she varied her output from time to time, writing several celebrated plays, numerous short stories, and occasionally turning out a novel that was more of a thriller than a mystery. Such is the case with the 1959 novel CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS, which begins lightly enough among school girls attending the famous Meadowbank school in England and then unexpectedly seques to a revolution in the middle east, stolen jewels, a kidnapping, and three murders.Although most of the story plays out at Meadowbanks, the plot pivot is in the middle east, where revolution threatens progressive Prince Ali Yusuf. In an effort to protect himself and at least part of his fortune, the prince gives his personal pilot, Bob Rawlinson, an extremely valuble package of jewels and asks Rawlinson to find a way to move them to England. Rawlinson agrees and hides the jewels among the luggage carried by his unwitting sister and niece, who are visiting the area but are scheduled to return to England shortly. That same day Rawlinson and the prince attempt to escape the country on an airplane, but sabatoge causes the aircraft to crash and both are killed. It becomes apparent that the jewels are not among Bob's sister's luggage; the must therefore be in the luggage of his neice, schoolgirl Jennifer. To further complicate matters, Jennifer is not the only student at Meadowbanks with a connection to prince Ali Yusuf; his cousin, Shaista, is a student as well, and it seems likely that the jewels will find their way to her.No sooner are the girls settled at Meadowbanks than not one but two murders occur. Fortunately, Jennifer has a sharp-minded school friend named Julia Upjohn, daughter of a woman who worked in military intelligence during World War II. Julia soon realizes that there is a problem, unravels the story of the missing jewels, and after an inspired guess locates them as well. But now her own life is in danger, and Julia wastes no time in going to the celebrated Hercule Poirot, who produces a final solution--but not before a third death ensues.CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS is not among the first rank of Christie's novels; although she clearly had fun writing it, and writing similar novels, her gifts did indeed turn more toward the intricate plotting required of her mysteries and less toward the action-adventure required of a thriller. Even so, it is a very enjoyable read--for both fans and newcomers a like. Recommended.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Floy Bennett"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Agatha Christie choses an illustrious girl's school as the setting to Poirot's latest mystery, though Poirot himself is not a major player in the proceedings, appearing for the first time well over halfway through the book. Instead most of the action centers around the staff of Meadowbank School, and its tone resembles that ofthe Tommy and Tuppence storiesconsidering its emphasis on espionage and international politics.Mrs Bulstrode rules over Meadowbank School with pride and competence, having established it from virtually nothing many years ago with her college Miss Chadwick. The two women now run the most exclusive girl's school in England, though unbeknownst to them, events are happening on the other side of the world that will have a huge effect on the school. When a cache of precious rubies goes missing from Ramat after an uprising against the monarchy, special agents across the globe narrow their search down to Meadowbank School thanks to a link between the Sheikh of Ramat's English pilot and a young student at the boarding school.Secret international forces converge on the school, leading to a cloak-and-dagger mystery, with plenty of secret identities, buried secrets, hidden jewels, and of course - murder most foul. When an unpopular teacher is found dead in the new Sports Pavilion the police are called in, but none of them have any idea as to the purpose behind such a killing. Only one thing is certain: that one of the school's staff is involved; the proverbial cat among the pigeons.Setting the story in a girl's school was an enjoyable change of pace, as Christie deftly paints the interrelations between a suspicious staff and the excited girls, all with their own secrets, opinions, viewpoints and understanding of the world around them. Though the characters are not particularly well-drawn (and a few are simply names on a page), the atmosphere of a school is well-handled and lends the book an added sense of danger considering the close proximity of so many innocent lives. In many ways, this is a \\"woman's book\\", given its emphasis on gossip, blackmail, mothers and the allure of jewels.Sometimes too many things - like the jewels' hiding place and the reason behind the focus on the school - are telegraphed too early, and as blasphemous as it may sound, I felt that the gradual uncovering of revelations were better handled in therecent television adaptation starring David Suchet, as well as being better paced in general thanks to Mark Gatiss's screenplay.\\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\" is certainly not Christie's best Poirot novel. Perhaps by this time she was running out of steam, not to mention struggling with her well-documented frustration with the fastidious little Belgian. Devoted Christie fans will want to finish \\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\" for the sake of completion, but newcomers to Christie's work may wish to start their reading experience elsewhere - say withThe Mysterious Affair at StylesorThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie I have read after my class was required to read a mystery novel written by one of the authors during the Golden Age of Mystery. I have to say, I was impressed. It was a little slow at the start, but it is to be expected in most of her books. Once the first murder occurs, though, things pick up pretty fast. This takes place in one of the best girls' schools. But what happens when the best girls' school has a murder? Is it the best?See if you can find out who the killer is!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"I absolutly loved this book. Although Hercule Poirot doesn't come in untill closer to the end of the book, this is in my oppinion one of the best Agatha Cristie's and it will keep you guessing to the last page."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is one of my favorite books from Agatha Christie's later years. Her grip of story telling, plotting and planning is still strong. There is some humor in the narrative and amusement is provided by many of the characters.Agatha Christie tries her hand at the girls' school setting here. Older reader will suspect that she was well-acquainted with similar settings chosen by A A Milne and Dorothy Sayers, and that she had been brought up on the once popular school girl annuals. Of course there needs to be a raison d'tre behind the series of murders that occurs at the school and this is well narrated also.I have mentioned the narration several times. It is an element that helps explain this writer's phenomenal popularity. She gets the timing right. Other writers in this genre produce more elegant prose but somehow fail in this regard.At this time in her career, Agatha Christie was experimenting with narrative methods. She attempted the \\"quick scene change\\" method here, and brings it off with skill and flair. She also, at this time in her career, frequently milked the situation where something was briefly glimpsed in a mirror, or a familiar face briefly glimpsed at a great distance. Watch out for these occurrences as you turn the pages to reach Hercule Poirot's final revelation of just who is the cat among the pigeons."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons by Agatha ChristieBlack Dog & Leventhal, 1959297 pagesHercule Poirot Mystery4/5 starsSummary: Meadowbank School is an outstanding school for young girls which is suddenly rocked by the murder of the new games mistress. Was she too curious for her own good? Does it have some connection to the recent revolution in a Near East country? (Hint: yes) Never fear: Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells are on the case.Thoughts: The book opens with a four page list of the characters, which I read hoping to get set for reading this. Instead it overwhelmed me and I had to just keep reading in order to be able to follow it. There are a lot of characters, mostly female because the actions takes place at a fine girls' school. The opening is very confusing as it shifts from Meadowbank to that Near East country to two females who connect both places. Headmistress Miss Bulstrode of course made me think of Millicent Bulstrode of Slytherin but luckily she's a much nicer person and Eileen Rich is consistently described as ugly although I cannot fathom why that's relevant to the story.There seem to be long passages where nothing is really happening. I found it easy to read and I was motivated to finish it. Interestingly Poirot doesn't show up until basically two-thirds of the way through the book. Yet he solves it fairly easily by picking up on a few strands. I didn't solve the murder (er murders) but I don't mind. I should have noticed something was up about that person but I didn't connect it fast enough. I also thought there was going to be a romance (I like the little romances Christie sometimes throws in) but I was wrong.Overall: A fine outing although somewhat confusing and less engaging than Christie's best. Do not begin your exploration of Christie with this."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"I have recently &quot;found&quot; Agatha Christie books. It believe her to be an excellent author.

It is believed the jewels will turn up at Meadowbank School since not only the prince's sister but also the sister and niece of Bob Rawlinson are all students there. Not surprisingly, murder after murder takes place at the prestigious school. Everyone from the headmistress and teachers to the students and parents are suspects until Poirot's clever little grey cells solve the mystery."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"There was a time when I would honestly read this book about every two months. I simply HAD to be reading Cat Among the Pigeons, no matter what else I was reading at the time. I would alternate between two different Agatha Christies and this one, and it actually lasted about a year! That's my testimonial to how absolutely perfect Cat Among the Pigeons is.And what makes this book so great and worth the money? Well, for one thing, Agatha did a flawless job of capturing atmosphere in this book. Ramat doesn't even exist, I don't think, yet I could feel myself there, feel the heat, practically see the opulence of the unfortunate young prince's palace, and feel the current of danger and imminent disaster present in every Ramat scene. I have no idea how she did it, because she was never one to give readers a lot of local flavor. And now, here is Agatha Christie making us feel the heart of an IMAGINARY CITY!The same goes for the girls' school. I could clearly picture Meadowbank in my mind, with its lazy afternoons and young students concerned more with boys and hiding places for cigarettes, than the relationship between Iago, Desdemona, and Othello.The characters could reach out and tap you on the nose, they are made so perfectly. There are no faceless, plastic people in this novel (not that there always are in other Christies.) I've often mentally applied Christie's wonderful description of Ann Shapland's hair to other people in my life: &quot;hair that fitted her like a black satin cap.&quot; And even though there isn't much else to Julia Upjohn's physical description besides having a freckled face like her mother, she forms a distinct appearance in my mind because of Christie's description of her personality. I don't want to give too much away, but I'll say that she's the kind of girl that Poirot would respect.And last but never least: How is the actual 'mystery' part? Well, as other reviewers have said, you will have NO IDEA who 'did it.' I can guarantee it. Truthfully. Honestly. You will pause for a second in that wonderful Agatha-Christie-Stupor while it soaks into your head. So don't worry about that part. Agatha didn't miss with this book. The shock effect for this one is one of the highest I've actually ever felt, higher than Death on the Nile, and actually getting up there with Roger Ackroyd and Orient Express. I'm serious! That's how surprising this mystery/thriller is.To sum it all up: The atmosphere is great, the characters are great, the mystery is perfect, and oh yes! I nearly forgot! The thrill factor is VERY high! There is one particular scene toward the end (it involves a chair; that's all I'll say) that will make you AT LEAST a little paranoid that there is someone watching you. Very creepy and very well done. That happens many times throughout this book.Cat Among the Pigeons is one of the best. To be fair, it is THE best of all the mystery/thrillers. Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is definitely one of Christies best novels, right up there with Death Comes as the End, And Then There Were None, and Murder in Mesopotamia.Yeah, ok, she might not be a literary genius, but she definitely has genius of a kind. She practically invented this type of detective novel (i'm not counting Conan Doyle. Why? Because i hate his ludicrous novels), using the brain, whilst at the same time creating great character sketches.She doesn't develop her characters loads, but then, that is NOT what her novels are about. they're about enjoying a great puzzle. And boy, can she construct a great puzzle! The one here is probably the bestm in that is lacks Hercule Poirot for about the first three quarters (some of her best books were those which were without Poirot or Marple). through that she was able to create a good psychological detective story, then bring Poirot in at the end to tie it all up neatly and provide the solution.The climax is great, and probably one of her best. I read this when i was about 12, and was not at all versed in the workins of a detective novel, in that it is the least likely person who did it. I just enjoyed the read, and was gladly surprised when i found out the identity of the culprit. No doubt, those with mroe experience would have been able to spot the killer straight away. However, this remains one of her best novels, and one which i will enjoy reading again and again."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"this is a really good Agatha Christie.

Ms. Christie's masteries include the ability to make us like and even care about characters in as little as 2 or 3 sentences. By doing this she clouds our judgement on motive, deception, and the ability to deduce what only becomes obvious after another classic Poirot confrontations with the suspects. This is one Christie's best &quot;later&quot; works."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"A longer novel than usual for Christie, \\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\" deals with international intrigue at an exclusive English girls' school. A coup in the Middle East triggers off a deadly search for missing jewels. Action converges on the school. The Special Branch and local police try to solve the string of murders among the schoolmistresses, but it takes Hercule Poirot's little grey cells to see through the disguises and subterfuge and bring all the loose ends together. The plot seemed flimsy at times and some of the attitudes expressed in the novel made it appear dated in the extreme. For a better Agatha Christie set partly in the Middle East, I would recommend They Came To Bagdad."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Typical Agatha Christie Poirot mystery.

Poirot, the belgian detective scrambling through the holes of a mystery like a mouse, not powerful but ready to zoom in.That day when I went to the library he was prepared to zoom in to a barden school for girls. It seems very peaceful until two teachers die. The interesting thing about this book ias that Poirot comes at the end. Thsi is a sign.. at the end things gom wrong. In each Poirot mystery there is a lesson to be learned, a thread to pull on. Not 0only these suspects learn, but we do too! This book has elemants of a regular mystery but thery disapear to a far away island they do not escape but get covered. By Hercule Poirot, the suspects. And I still now am getting covered up. For Iam a cat among the pigoens, we all are and all will be."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This is one of Christie's best later works and it shows she can still weave intricate plots and characters together with effective ease. Great atmosphere and story, with Poirot popping up almost toward the end. You'll never see any of the final threads coming. Perhaps her most entertaining book of the 1950's."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons is really a delightful book.

It was a good surprise."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This I think is one of the best books that I have ever read. I have read a lot of Agatha Christie's books because they are all murder mysteries and I love murder mysteries. Agatha Chrisitie is my favorite author and she will always be!I Recommend you read this one!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This was one of Agatha Christie's &quot;not so good&quot; books. Thankfully there aren't many but they do exist. Perhaps she should not have mixed genres (spy thrillers and crime). Mind you, there isn't a James Bond chase scene in the book but the opening pages takes the reader to a fictional Arab nation on the verge of a coup d etat and sees its young prince exchanging ideas with his English pilot on how to smuggle out the royal jewels.I am not spoiling anyone's surprise when I say the deaths in this novel are connected directly or indrectly to the jewels (which have ended up in a girls school, by the way). The three murders all come rather late in the book and as such the revelation of the culprit by Poirot feels rushed.Yes, the book is touted as a &quot;Hercule Poirot mystery&quot; although we only get to see him three quarters into the story. Since almost all of the investigation was handled by the local inspector, an undercover Special Branch officer and a very intelligent girl, it would have been better if they tied it all up with no need for Poirot to show up.All in all, I was not impressed with Cat Among the Pigeons. Those new to her work should start with other titles as this one may turn them off Agatha Christie, who was a good mystery writer actually. Her mystery novels usually ends with the reader (me, in this case) gasping and going, &quot;Damn! She's good.&quot;This one didn't. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Really, I don't think Cat Among Pigeons is considered one of Agatha Christie's best works. How can it be? The story starts very slowly, with no real narrative hooks in the plot at all. There are superficial facts about characters in the book that really don't affect the story at all. It just fill up pages. Then, the murder of the gamesmistress is discovered near the middle of the book, which I think is another mistake. How can you expect the reader to keep on reading when they figure out that the actual murder is a long time coming? Then, the famous Hercule Poirot (who is the only reason that I read this book) is introduced very lately into the book.I think another reason that I really didn't like this book was because there are so little suspects in the book. I mean, you can right off the bat count off numerous people. Plus, there are many who were incapable of actually commiting the main murder, and this also eliminates many but a few.All in all, I was disappointed by Cat Among the Pigeons. If you are looking for a real Hercule Poirot thriller, look for Murder on the Orient Express or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This was the very first Agatha Christie novel I read. I thought it was absolutely riveting. A great book for just about anyone, I would say. Reading this book got me hooked on Agatha Christie, though I suppose I was spoiled by it, because none of her books that I have read since then have measured up to this one. This book is a must-read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery. Remember, dont assume reading this book, for it will send you in the opposite direction of the solution. you will never guess what the ending is, that I guarantee!

Mixed in with also a bit of spying at the beginning and Poirot's wit and wisdom this book is fabulous and has an unpredictable but fruitful ending!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Agatha Christie, it is not often recognized, was a very good writer. Although her books never achieved the skin-tingling creepiness of John Dickson Carr, the best of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; mystery writers, and though Carr's books are perhaps more re-readable, the writing in Christie's best books (the 30s, 40s) was often as good as any other writer of the period.She was also as good at writing cloak and dagger books as well as convention detective mysteries, though these books are not generally as well known.&quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot; should be one of her cloak and dagger books. It veers into John Buchan territory with revolutions in foreign coutries and smuggled jewels. It is not, on the face of it, a Poirot novel. When he makes his appearance near the last third of the book, he is a welcome addition to a plot that's beginning to collapse under its own weight. Instead of being a novel of espionage or a novel of detection, it tries to be both. The result is a novel with three murders, but all of them coming late in the narrative and therefore bunched together. Because the set-up is so long, Poirot is forced to make some quantum leaps beyond his normal logic, that seem more like inspired guesses than deduction. One wonders why he was necessary at all.The book is set at a girl's school and there are many extraneous characters. Christie helps us with her usual page of character descriptions at the start, but many of the names remain little more than names.Christie was a good writer. She normally got to the point and didn't string plot threads together until her books got oppressive. And the two genres she tried to mix in this book could have been combined in a longer, more complex novel. An earlier introduction to Poirot might also have helped. He is anticipated, but, curiously, is never mentioned prior to his introduction and comes out of the blue.It looks almost like two books that have run together. Christie normally didn't waste more than one good plot on a book, but here she has the jewel story, which would've made a crackerjack espionage novel along the lines of _The Secret of Chimneys_; and the murder mystery, in the last half, that would've made a fine, typical Poirot novel. A young detective who goes undercover in the book would've made a fine solver of the jewel story.Too, many of the elements of this novel seem borrowed. The young detective's superior comes off as a lethargic version of Carr's H.M., for instance.However, one warning: there is an element of the jewel plot that you will guess almost immediately, and wonder why Christie was so obvious with it. Further reading shows that to become more complex, and the reason she wants us to guess it early seems to be so she can take a sudden left-turn with it. But the element itself is not, it turns out, very important to the plot and she can allow us a few pages to think we're clever.If you are a long-time Christie fan and want to read all her books, _Cat Among the Pigeons_ is a must; if you're just starting Christie, you might want to read a dozen or so others before getting to this one."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"This 1959 novel begins in a fictional mideastern country. The country is on the brink of revolution, the young prince is planning his escape he entrusts the family fortune in gems to his closest friend to smuggle out of the country. Arrangements are made shortly before the two young men are killed.Meanwhile, back in England it is the beginning of the summer term at Meadowlands, an exclusive girls' school. Students and staff from all over the world are there, including a princess from the mideast whose cousin/fiance has just been killed. The famous gems have also found there way there. Various unusual occurances begin to take place at the school, strange visitors, unusual behavior among the staff and then murder and kidnapping.One of the students uncovers part of the secret and decides that she needs outside help so she contacts Hercule Poirot. Poirot, of course, resolves the mysteries both large and small that have been plaguing the school.There are more characters introduced in this novel than is usual in Christie's work which makes this one of the more challenging of her work to figure out. There are several subplots woven into the action that things confusing as well. This is a departure from Christie's usual 'cozy' stories of village life or house parties. It is more of a thriller than her usual work, some of her most sympathetic characters are killed and Poirot only appears at the end of the novel. Even so it is a very enjoyable mystery and one of my personal favorites.We are also treated to an update on the Summerhills, old friends from a previous book, MRS. McGINTY'S DEAD. Mrs. Summerhill is a friend of one of the students' parents. Poirot is delighted to hear that although Mrs. Summerhill's house is still disorganized and her cooking is generally deplorable she makes wonderful omelets, a skill that she learned from him."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve, about the same age as the main characters in the story. Some of the motivations of the adults seemed murky to me, but the children, especially young Julia, were all spot on! Good work writing about children, as is typical of Agatha (CROOKED HOUSE) Christie."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"An English pilot for a Middle Eastern ruling prince just managed to hide a fabulous fortune in gems somewhere in his sister's room, just before the prince was overthrown in a revolution. The unsuspecting sister returned to England with her daughter, just in time for the girl to start in Meadowbanks, an &eacute;lite girls school, where a female cousin (& fiance) of the deposed prince, was also arranged to attend.Several interested parties had been on the prowl searching for the gems, the pilot's efforts had not been as clandestine as he had hoped. With new girls, new teachers, and also a new young handsome male gardener, was it a wonder that some residents of Meadowbanks felt as if there was a hidden cat among the pigeons.Agatha Christie painted an excellent picture of an English public school going about its daily business. There were staff as well as students who were trying to get use to a new environment. There was a headmistress, who having successfully established the school according to her vision after years of struggle, was considering passing the torch to the next generation. There were old faithfuls among the staff who were less prominent but had heard and seen much of what others missed.Meadowbanks was probably Agatha Christie's of what an ideal school should be like.Having got the background set, Agatha Christie got down to business with the first murder, the victim being a rather unpopular new staff in the recently completed Sports Pavilion. Readers would have been given enough outright hints before this as to what would be of interest in the Sports Pavilion. The object of the mystery quickly turned from recovery of the gems to the discovery of the murderer.Midway, a second murder almost threw the investigators off-track, and a third murder was committed before Hercule Poirot who was called in late in the game seriously got down to business.Mystery readers could find little fault in way which the authorities set about trying to find the culprit, but it took bringing back a student's mother from Anatolia to trap the murderer.All the while, Christie managed to maintain a light hearted atmosphere despite the deaths in the story, with occassional injection of humour and wit. She included important and interesting roles for the diverse characters from students to faculty to police to parents in how the mystery was played out. This is truly one of her most readable book."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons is a book that shows what Agatha Christie can do. It is a well-written page turner.

The fact that this has to do with a school and the possibility of the murderer being one of the children was paticularly horrifying--but not out of Dame Christie's reach.In fact, I was expecting this to be focused on a more psychological view-point, something reminiscent of Endless Night or Crooked House. However, this was nothing more than a harmless novel with murder, murderer, and motive--the only difference its being in a school. I suppose the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I was quite anticipating something different. But who can blame me? After all, the potential for a psychologically horrifying mystery was certainly there."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"School Escape.Cat Among the Pigeons is a mystery involving a tiny tin-pot country, revolution, and jewellery.Poirot gets involved with an investigation at a very toffy girl's school, and he doesn't really expect to get involved in international intrigue, but it doesn't take him long to work out something odd is going on."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"Without any doubt,Cat among the pigeons is one of agatha christie's best.It is an awesome book.The story is set in an English bording school,Meadowbanks.I really love this book because the story is set in a school and agatha portrays the character of the teachers very well.I was happy POirot did not appear until the second murder had took place because i found him very annoying in the other books.However he really was a genius in solving the puzzle,which is fit for experts..Overall,Cat among the pigeons was immensely enjoyable and it is a must read!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"here's another one of agatha christie's classics... the title provides the clue to what the novel's mostly about... a page-turner which will keep readers entertained till the very end..."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons","review":"In school I was assigned to read an Agatha Christie book.

Great investment!"},{"Title":"Sound Advice: Becoming a Better Children's Choir Conductor","review":"Jean Ashworth Bartle is the director of the Toronto Children's Chorus, an excellent children's choir and one of the best in the world. This book is a wonderful addition to children's choir conductors around the world.The first few chapters are about teaching children to sing. They cover aspects such as teaching style and delivery, lesson content, and common problems found in children's singing. Following chapters cover a checklist for ideal rehearsals and performance preparation, developing music reading literacy, discipline, organization, auditions, conducting an orchestra, touring and recording, and great appendices.As one can see, most of the book is dedicated to things which are NOT actually conducting, for very little of conducting is actually conducting. Bartle's writing style is densely packed, and the reader should take care not to gloss over important sections.One of Bartle's main theses is that children can achieve great artistic performances and don't need to sing \\"All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth\\" or Johnny Goodguy's latest arrangement of \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" They can sing Bach, Leonard Bernstein, and folk songs/demanding music from cultures all over the world.Often a new choir director finds that their training has left them somewhat unprepared when it comes to the subjects of discipline, rehearsal pedagogy, auditions, conducting an orchestra, and various other administrative aspects of \\"running a program.\\" This book seems designed to focus on those skills.Consequently, there is little in the book regarding vocal technique, conducting gesture, score study and analysis, and other related topics--there are other great books out there on those subjects.For other books on church choir directors, consult books by John Bertalot. Other related books are Directing the Choral Music Program by Kenneth Philips and Chorus Confidential by William Dehning. Great books on vocal technique include those by James McKinney, Oren Brown, and Clifton Ware.Though church conductors will also find great ideas, I think Bartle's book is an excellent resource to any children's choir or community choir conductor, especially beginners. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Sound Advice: Becoming a Better Children's Choir Conductor","review":"This book had some helpful ideas, but is really for a beginning choir director, as it really deals with basic techniques.

I don't know how many times in one book a writer can use the adjectives \\"brown\\", \\"cocoa\\", \\"chocolate\\" and \\"dark\\" when referring to females:QUOTE (spoiler alert!): \\"God, she looked so good. Those Spanish looks, still petite, but her dark chocolate eyes were more pronounced. Her hair was dark, neatly pulled back, so fine, so tight, like her ass! She was wearing the rebozo I had bought for her all those years ago...\\"With the fascinated, exotic tone that comes through in the narration, you would think that the author had never even seen a woman who wasn't blond and blue-eyed, let alone romanced all the women he claims to have seduced. Les Barba sets himself as the swashbuckling hero of this novel (described on the back cover as \\"near fiction\\"). And he spends the entire story \\"bedding women down\\" left and right. Apparently this middle-aged, monolingual Vietnam vet is irresistible to women, and they let him know it. The book is saturated with sex scenes, written in a style that could best be described as \\"a harlequin romance novel minus the classiness\\".Of course, I realize that there are womanizing gringos like Barba who travel throughout Mexico on exploitative, libido-fueled extravaganzas. But most of them don't claim to champion the cause of the poor and oppressed. More often than not, dudes who exoticize women in other countries as much as Barba does end up in a moldy jail cell--not for collaborating with guerrillas as he claims to have done, but for soliciting prostitution.But if Barba is to be believed, his racist attitudes did not keep him from earning the trust of the guerrilla rebels. According to \\"Life Imitating Death\\", not only did the Zapatistas take the author under their collective wing after having barely met him, they let him into their inner circles. They granted him an interview with the elusive Subcomandante Marcos. They gave him an automatic weapon and let him join them in battle. They trusted him with their deepest secrets, putting him in charge of running weapons down to Chiapas for them.And all this for a man who obviously can't even speak Spanish, let alone any of the Mayan languages spoken by members of the EZLN. Barba tries to give his book the touch of authenticity by dropping in a few phrases in the exotic tongue of \\"ess-pan-yole\\" from time to time...too bad he didn't take the trouble to cross-check these phrases with a native speaker. (Apparently, in all his treks across Mexico, Les Barba never met anybody who could speak Spanish.) Nearly every Spanish phrase is written incorrectly (as well as many of the English ones). The title on the book's cover appears in English and \\"Spanish\\"; Barba's attempt at translating \\"life imitating death\\" comes out as \\"la vida remedo de la muerta\\", which translates as \\"life-I imitate-of the dead woman\\".The end scene of the book takes the cake. After killing the bad guy, fornicating his way across the Republic of Mexico, bringing weapons to Zapatista guerrillas, blowing the top off several international conspiracies, interviewing Marcos and single-handedly avenging the Acteal massacre, Barba is inducted into the Mayan culture as a shaman's apprentice. A Tzotzil-speaking medicine man decides to take Barba on as a student, choosing this man--THIS man, this monolingual gringo foreigner--as the person to pass all his ancient knowledge on to.And guess what Les Barba's shaman name is? \\"White Jaguar\\".If this book has any merit at all, it lies in the entertainment value of the author's myopic hubris and painfully \\"pulp fiction\\" writing style. But if you want to know more about the Mayan people of southeastern Mexico and the Zapatista armed conflict, please--pick up a book by someone who knows what they're talking about. At least someone who can speak Spanish."},{"Title":"Life Imitating Death","review":"\\"Les Barba's lyric descriptions of the highlands in Chiapas, Mexico are a painful contrast to the despair of the indigenous people of Southern Mexico as they struggle for daily survival in a harsh Darwinian social structure.\\"Jane Carton."},{"Title":"Life Imitating Death","review":"It's chancey when a friend asks you to review his book and even more so when it's your friend's premier effort. The topic (southern Mexico and the rebellion in Chiapas) hit near home, however, so I accepted the offer.I really enjoyed this book! I live in Oaxaca and his descriptions of people and places ring very true. I haven't been to Chiapas yet although I thought I knew a lot about it from the media. Wrong! Les has done his research and it shows. I learned a lot about the reasons for the Chiapas rebelliion and how and why first world countries are aiding and abetting the destruction of indeginious people and their way of life.I read \\"Life Imitating Death\\" shortly after reading \\"The DiVinci Code\\" and I found some similarities in this book; so much has to be hidden in codes and \\"authorities\\" are always on the trail of those trying to do good. I don't know how much of this book is non-fiction but if Les has been through some of the trials he tells about my cap is off to him. Reading about life in a Mexican prison, as just one example, had my stomach turning over.I am sure there are many good books on Chiapas by journalists and humanitarians but having this information in the format of a real page-turning thriller is a treat."},{"Title":"Life Imitating Death","review":"This \\"near fiction novel\\" as the author Les Barba, describes it, begins it's fast moving pace with the whirl of a helicopter rotor and spotlight of 10,000 watts, glaring down upon the Chiapas school volunteers in southern Mexico. These volunteers consequently are imprisoned, beaten and deported and commanded never to return to Mexico.This novel has many layers of interest: from romance & sex, deception & intrigue, ancient Aztec history to modern politics and strife, there is something for everyone here.But especially if one has any concern for indigenous people and their rights, or the destruction of the planet by way of deforestation of the shrinking rainforests, or the as yet unknown implications of genetically engineered corn, you will be informed by this book about what is happening in Mexico. The jargon of this book sometimes smacks of old detective novels like Mike Hammer Detective, or an old Bogey movie but at times gets mystical. The unfortunate idea is that their always seem to be oppressors and that the names of the oppressors change every hundred years, whether it be Cortez, the Spaniards, the Mexican Government, mega oil companies or NAFTA. Great first novel. I understand a sequel is underway now.

Also, Ravenhill condemns evangelists of his day for buying \\"$3 steaks.\\" That tells you how old this book must be :) If somebody knows where I can buy a steak for 3 bucks, drop me a line...shoot, drop me a line if you know where I can go out and eat steak for under 10 bucks :)"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill truly understands the concept of revival and why it is so needed today.

This work will lite a fire within your spirit!You will not be able to walk away from this work uninspired."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"If this book does not create a dramatic response out of you then you should check your pulse. Ravenhill's cry to the church should either elicit a cold-hearted scoff at what he says is necessary for revival, or a definite call for christian's with the fire still burning to fall upon our knees and begin to plead with God for a change in the American church. If you can read this book without having an emotional response then luke-warm christianity is your disease and you may not even know you need a remedy."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"In this book Leonard Ravenhill states that prayer and not \\"any dead mans echoed words\\" would provide the path to Christian revival. Leonard has since passed away and yes, some of the examples given in this book are outdated but his deeper message is timeless.Skarp-Hedin, I too am a Catholic Charismatic Christian that felt somewhat offended by some of the text in this book. I challenged myself to see God through Leonard's eyes. If you take the time and pick it back up you will see that Leonard's sword cuts both ways and spares no Christian Denomination.His call is for all to account for their time spent here on earth and how Prayer focuses us in that pursuit.Because Revival starts with you and I, my prayer it that we can see through the growing pains and only focus on the God who made us all. I'm sure Leonard would agree."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Unlike the last reviewer I opened the book and read it.

This is not a lightweight book, but one where Ravenhill gets to the core of people and the church. Why Revival Tarries? carries a lot of passion and practically demands that the church of Jesus Christ wakes up to the reality that there is a disconnect from the early church. Sometimes Ravenhill can be a bit radical, but that's what set him apart from other preachers of his time (as well as today). He was unashamed to call it like it was and he was not ashamed of the truth. This book is no different. A must read for any believer in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"No single book has proved more foundational to my Christian life and ministry than this."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"My husband was given a copy of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; and &quot;Revival Praying&quot; when he joined a men's Bible Institute several years ago at a Baptist Church that we were in at that time. My husband read the book and would read certain passages out loud to me and I couldn't wait to read the books myself. We both have the books well underlined in several places and I have purchased the book since then for several people. A few years before we read these two books, I was listening to a Christian radio station on my way to a friends house. The preacher I heard on the radio was so powerful, that I literally had to pull over to the side of the road. The preacher was Leonard Ravenhill. He was preaching on America and television, etc. and he was so right about what he said about Christianity today. I beleive this is a life changing book and should be read by every Christan. Each time I reread the book, I am convicted again and long to be the Christian he speaks about and would love to see that kind of revival take place in our churces. You will never be the same once you have read what this tremendous man of God has said."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Outside of the Bible, the most powerful book I have ever read. If you are \\"comfortable\\" in the pew, don't read this book. If you are wondering why God has not moved on this earth, then read this book!!! Written in the 50's you would think Ravenhill was sitting across the table from you today! If you are stagnet and want refreshing, then \\"buy the book\\" POWERFUL POWERFULL POWERFULL."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"A phrase kept coming to me early in 2008 - \\"Why Revival Tarries\\", \\"Why Revival Tarries\\". I actually thought that was a book by Charles G. Finney, and that the Holy Spirit was prompting me to order it. I was surprised, and yet not surprised when I saw that Leonard Ravenhill was the author. Approximately twenty years prior I had received some material from Last Days Ministries in East Texas (The ministry Keith Green started); and it was from them that I first heard the name Leonard Ravenhill.Sadly, it wasn't until 2008 that I actually ordered the book from Amazon and read it.I inhaled it! It was a breath of fresh, holy air.I consider it a modern day classic.Somewhere along the way, I discovered that the books available in our modern day christian bookstores are not necessarily acollection of \\"The Greatest Hits\\" of all time. Just as you have to dig for precious metals and jewels, you have to dig for truth and the anointing. It doesn't just fall on you like rain from the clouds. Though very thankful for the lighthouses christian bookstores are in a dark world, sometimes you have to hunt for hidden treasures that are no longer seen on the shelves.I began watching video segments of Ravenhill on youtube and ordered the interview of him that was taped shortly before his death. Since then I've been hoping that a biography would turn up, and now it finally has. \\"In Light of Eternity\\", the life of Leonard Ravenhill is a book that you might like to get. It's on my list of books to acquire.In the meantime, \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" is the definitive book that expresses the ministry of Leonard Ravenhill. Please get it, and get ON FIRE FOR GOD!"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Fifty years ago Leonard Ravenhill wrote Why Revival Tarries. It is now a modern classic. It has sold over half a million copies, and is translated into numerous languages. It is still widely available today.This book is a devotional classic because its author is one who was more concerned about the verdict of the Almighty than his own reputation; more interested in holiness than happiness; and more interested in the glory and honour of God than the praise and applause of men.It is actually composed of various articles he had written earlier, but because it flows from a heart on fire for God, and a life dedicated to holiness and sanctification, the words contain fire and power. No one who is sick of the ordinary and is desirous only of God and his best will be untouched by this powerful book.How can one adequately review a book such as this? Every page has memorable ideas and burning words. Perhaps the best way to present this book to others is simply to feature many of its valuable quotes.Ravenhill argues that we do not have revival for the simple reason that we really don't want revival. We are simply too contented, to smug, too self-satisfied, and too carnal. Our hearts are not broken and we do not earnestly long for a powerful move of God.\\"Revival comes as a result of a cleansed section of the Church, bent and bowed in supplication and intercession,\\" says Ravenhill. \\"The price of revival,\\" he says, \\"is travail.\\" But where is the prayer, the brokenness, the seeking after God?As he says elsewhere, \\"\\"The only reason we don't have revival is because we are willing to live without it!\\" That is our problem. We have become too comfortable, too lazy, too apathetic and too indifferent. In other words, we are neither hot nor cold, but, like the Laodicean church, are simply lukewarm, and we deserve to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth.Prayer is the key to revival, and Ravenhill speaks as much to our prayerlessness as anything else. Unless we get serious about prayer, and forget our trivial pursuits and worldly amusements, we simply will not see revival break forth.Prayer is the key says Ravenhill: \\"No man is greater than his prayer life.\\" Our greatness for the Kingdom will be directly proportional to our greatness in prayer. \\"To be much for God, we must be much with God.\\" The praying man is unstoppable: \\"He who fears God fears no man. He who kneels before God will stand in any situation.\\"Ravenhill reminds us that \\"As the Church goes, so goes the world.\\" The world is in a mess because the church is in a mess. And the church is in a mess because so many of its leaders and preachers are in a mess: \\"The tragedy of this late hour is that we have too many dead men in the pulpits giving out too many dead sermons to too many dead people.\\"If our churches are not full of dead men and women, they certainly seem to be full of sleeping men and women. \\"In the church pillars have given place to pillows.\\" How can God move in such a situation? How can God work when the material in his hands is hard, unwieldy and crumbling?Until we start to see our spiritual need, and start to cry out to God, revival will elude us. \\"If the Church today had as many agonizers as she has advisors, we would have a revival in a year.\\" Where are the men and women of God who travail and agonize over the woeful situation we find ourselves in?Until we are broken and repentant, we will see no fresh move of God's Spirit. \\"The church must first repent; then the world will break! The church must first weep; then our altars will be filled with weeping penitents.\\" Ravenhill goes so far as to suggest, \\"This generation of preachers is responsible for this generation of sinners.\\"Strong words, but true. Our problem is ourselves and our spiritual leaders. We need to break up the fallow ground and seek for the new rains. We simply cannot keep blaming the world for all our troubles. In many ways we have only ourselves to blame:\\"I do not marvel so much at the patience of the Lord with the stonyhearted sinners of the day. After all, would we not be patient with a man both blind and deaf? And such are the sinners. But I do marvel at the Lord's patience with the sleepy, sluggish, selfish Church! A prodigal Church in a prodigal world, is God's real problem.\\"He reminds us of 1 Peter 4:17: \\"Judgement must first begin in the house of God.\\" This is where we must begin. It is long overdue. If we do not act, and act soon, then the chances of revival - at least in the West - look very slim indeed.This book is spiritual dynamite. Those who already have it should pull it off the shelves and reread it. Those who do not yet have it need to go out and get it. The revival we all so desperately need basically tarries because of us - because of our coldness and hardness. This book will go a long way in helping to melt the ice and soften our hardened hearts."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Ravenhill says it like it is, and will bring you to your knees if you have any reverence to the Lord. This is just what anyone who claims to be a Christian should model themselves after. I highly recommend it to all who say they believe in God."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"So wrote Charles Grandison Finney in his book &quot;Lectures on Revival.&quot;Seeing that there was indeed a &quot;declension&quot; in what the New Testament Church should be, Leonard Ravenhill wrote this jeremiad over 40 years ago, yet his observations and his call to repentance remain ever so true today.From unctionless preachers, to self-satisfied, pew-warming church members, Ravenhill spares no one has his words cut like a flaming sword at the rampant sin that is in the church today.No one with even a modicum of spiritual understanding can read this book and not be committed to repenting, and making a decision to serve Christ Jesus more fervently.Doesn't He deserve our best?"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"This book will pierce your heart and give you a burden for prayer and the heart of God.

Basically, th author centers his view on praying, obedience, and self-denial.I highly recommends this book to every one trying to anyone seeking to understand revival.The books is an easy-read. The author is faithful to his style."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Sometimes you need an author that will jolt you out of your spiritual lethargy. Leonard Ravenhill will never fail you at such a time. I'm thinking now of 2 of my favorite Ravenhill titles: \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" and \\"Sodom Had No Bible\\".In \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" there are 20 chapters with a page of fantastic quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Imagine being a preacher as I am and being hit with:\\"One does not need to be spiritual to preach, that is, to make and deliver sermons of homiletical perfection and exegetical exactitude...Preaching of the type mentioned affects men: prayer affects God. Preaching affects time; prayer affects eternity.\\"That is paragraph two of chapter one--See what I mean! Or how about this:\\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying.\\"Yes he is eminently quotable, likes a rhyme, yet is never corny. I could provide many other great quotes, but I am far too slow a typist to reproduce the entire book here. The answer to the question of why revival tarries has much, I came to see, to do with me."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"It's best to read this in small doses and really think about what your reading. I'm not sure I could have taken it if I had read this in one sitting. It's too powerful.

It was the first Ravenhill book I've ever read and it certainly won't be my last."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill was a powerful preacher. He never minced words. He ALWAYS told it like it was. This book was probably his greatest book ever. He shows the cost of revival as well as how to get it. I think this is one of the most important books (apart from the Bible and the pilgrims progress) ever written. Read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"I was introduces to Leonard Ravenhill via youtube. I barely knew anything about him and yet his audio sermmon I watched on youtube was so riveting and utterly convicting, I began looking up his sermons on sermonaudio.com. I found this book in a campus bookstore and bought expecting another \\"Revial How to Guide.\\"I was and am still shocked at the power within its pages. Ravenhill writes with passion, wit and power. He did not attempt to write academically or intellectually, but prophetically delivering the truth of God unlike anyone else I've ever read.An awesome book that takes only minutes to read, but a life to grasp."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Though written a number of years back this is still as current as the daily news. True revival is for the BELIEVER in Christ Jesus. Someone must be at least barely alive to be revived. Bro. Ravenhill pulls no punches but 'goes for the throat' of the problem of 'Why Revival Tarries' for as the scripture says, \\"Open rebuke is better than love that is hidden\\" (Proverbs 27:5 KJV). This book challenged me to examine myself to see if I was in the faith (see 2 Corinthians 13:5).I highly recommend this book.Why Revival Tarries"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Highly challenging and inspirational. sharp and incisive.

If you want to read his best book under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Why Revival Tarries, is the primer to follow in the footsteps of Ravenhill.He is a man of tremendous prayer and going publicly to proclaim Jesus. This is not a new book but has been in existence longer than I have been alive. Reading books like this should NEVER be a substitute for the Primary book: The Word of God. However, this would be a must for those wanting to get away from American religiosity and dive into a deep, pure, obedient call to Biblical Faith in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Great read really made a deffrence in my prayer life and my desire to serve god.

I would challenge you to read and apply the principles laid forth for revival. It will change your walk with the Lord."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"This book should come with a warning label on it saying: \\"If you want to destroy your life go ahead and read this book!\\" This book absolutely destroyed me in every way possible. I remember recieving this book from a friend in Philly and was in a bad season in my life and also remembering being scared to read the book. No wait I wasn't scared to read it I was absolutely terrified, and my pre-concieved notions were correct. Once I picked up that book I was as good as dead. I began to weep and groan for weeks and weeks. The burning words in those pages completely consumed me and scathed me. I was skinned and hung up for death. Everything in my life was burnt up and left in an ash heap before my feet, so that I had to turn to God and say what now? He replied and said do what I have always wanted you to do, die! Everything changed for me, prayer life, ministry, preaching, relationships, church, conduct, and everything else. I walked away broken, battered, and bruised from this book and have never been the same. So with that read this book unless you want to live in your 'normal' Christian life, but if you have enough guts to actually do what the bible says, let Ravenhill expose your fakeness and start all over again from step one!"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill was a man of passion. His books represent just a taste of that passion. No other book in the 20th century so captured the heart of a man like this book. Brother Leonard longed for revival. He believed that the Church was playing games with a holy God and that the need of the hour was for genuine revival praying.This book is not a how to of prayer. It is much more. It is a call to prayer. It is a much needed rebuke of our spiritual laziness and apathy (Amos 4:1). We need men and women of faith to rise up and pray with all their might (1 Samuel 12:23; 1 Thess. 5:17). The sad reality is that the early Church was birthed in prayer (Acts 1:14) but today's church knows nothing of prayer. The prayer meeting, writes Ravenhill, is the Cinderella of the Church.Let this book go through you and may God use it to spark a hunger for Spirit-filled praying (Eph. 6:18; Jude 20)."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"This book was written in 1959, and 45 years later, what Ravenhill writes is still applicable today! This book is a prophetic call to the Church to wake up and be the Church of God. I picked up this book as it was highly recommended in another book that impacted me (Growing Deep in God by Edmund Chan), and I have found it deeply ministering.Ravenhill writes with many one liners that cuts to the chase in the heart of the matter that he is communicating. Phrases like \\"No man is greater than his prayer life. The pastor who is not praying is playing; the people who are not praying are straying\\", \\"Many pray, but few have faith\\", \\"God does not want partnership with us, but ownership of us\\", and \\"Our eyes are dry because our hearts are dry\\" are just some of these phrases that speak mountains of the situation in the Church today.I do not agree with everything Ravenhill writes about, but I read beyond the words and understand his heart from which he writes this book. Ravenhill's desire for God comes across strongly, and anything that is apart from God or does not seem to fit into his godly values would seem as \\"sin\\" and hence to be dealt with. Hence, I recommend this book to your reading (and read beyond the words to catch the fire that burns in Ravenhill's heart), and also Edmund Chan's Growing Deep in God. I find that as I read these 2 books, it is like God doing an open heart surgery on me, revealing the true nature of my heart so that I can repent and have God place a new heart in me (Ezekiel 36:26)."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"My prayer life slowly dwindling into obscurity, regulated to 5 minute sessions here and there, I knew I had to do something to revive my prayer life. I searched various authors and decided to give this one a chance. Thank you God! Within 15 mintues, I was on my knees pleading with God to forgive me for my self-centeredness, my wife wondering what was wrong with me. If it doesn't do the same for you, you are either an Elijah in prayer or your heart is calloused. Either way, you still need to be pray. Very brief yet potent! The author truly has a gift writing psyiologically. Thank you, Mr. Ravenhill. My hope is that this work will not return to you void."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Book for a season. If you're hungry to see God move and see the lost saved and the church move again in power, this is the book for you.

Awesome book, get it, read it, live it!"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"\\"Why Revival Tarries\\" is truly one book you won't want to put down. With a sort of prophetic voice from the grave, Ravenhill's plead for prayer is just as applicable today as it was when in was published in the 1950's. To call it timeless, would be an understatement. It's the perfect gift for all those searching for personal and/or church-wide revival - and is nothing less than breathtaking."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Leonard Ravenhill stikes me as a man of integrity by listening to his audios, but just as Paul mentions in 2 Corinthians that he lacks power in his voice but his written word speaks for itself, Ravenhill draws the power of the Holy Spirit onto paper as best a man can do. Preachers, elders, leaders and all followers of Christ, beware! You're about to get rocked!"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"I have read many christian books in the past, but this stands out. Bro Leonard did not beat about the bush. The chapters are short enough to be read in about fifteen minutes, but they are so packed that each may take you two solid hours to read. Every chapter is thought-provoking. Since I got the book in 1984, I have read it more than 30 times! And each time, it appears as if I never read it before. If you would read this book, be ready to end up upon your knees!"},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"I read this book for the first time 10 years ago. not every book should be like this. this is a special book for a special porblem: hard, cold and indifferent hearts.

And as the man is, so are his writings. If you can read this book and not be driven to your knees, even as you rend your clothing, then buddy you're dead already!A condensation of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; into a few words would yield the truth that it's Man's fault alone. You see, God wants to pour out revival, to set all of us ablaze with the fire of His Spirit, but we are so oblivious to the truth that our hearts are totally turned away from Him that we cannot begin to acquire what He is so richly wanting to shower us with.It starts with repentence - and not your mamby-pamby, watered-down 21st century style repentence, but the kind that tears a man or woman down to the soul, only to allow God to rebuild and reshape. Ravenhill argues that this is not something that happens overnight. If the Church wants revival, it's going to come with a cost. He proceeds to layout a compelling vision of that cost and the crucibles needed to hold what God will pour out.No Christian library is complete without the works of Leonard Ravenhill, and the best place to start is with &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot;. Get it today and be prepared for the glory that will come."},{"Title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"Leonard knows his Bible! He knows too that many Christians don't.

I also think that not every Christian will be able to. Jesus says that only those the Father draws can come to and believe in Jesus.

COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY: A WORKING MANUAL offers the same excellent how-to information provide in the black and white counterpart. The book contains many of Horenstein's excellent photographs and offers information regarding filters and developing color prints. While it contains some information on color transparencies (slides), it is somewhat scant and may in the long run be more helpful for printmakers. At a time when digital photography is all the rage, this book is not obsolete since Horenstein's expertise will help ant photographer, no matter what the medium."},{"Title":"Color Photography: A Working Manual","review":"Good introductory book on color film photography.

Some of the names are badly mangled/misinterpreted. Arranged alphabetically by groom, there is not a cross listing by bride. Brides and bondsmen are included in the index, making a search for females cumbersome. A better source is the WPA abstract of marriage bonds, but lacking that, this is a good book to add to your collection, provided you are as creative with spelling last names as the author was."},{"Title":"Juvenilia","review":"The madcap stories and parodies in this collection will have you sputtering with laughter. Any fan of Jane Austen will be guaranteed to adore this book.But, there is a bonus benefit to this particular edition. When I received my copy in the mail, I was a little startled, because the book weighed a ton, and each of its pages was thick and nearly laminated. The cover looked like it was produced on a dot-matrix printer from clip art, and it had the overall appearance of being a pre-release edition. There was even an apologetic note from Amazon, saying that this was the best available edition, and if I didn't like it I could return it, etc. But, I soon realized that this 'bad' plastic edition had a wonderful advantage - I could take it in the bath with me, and it didn't even get damp. There's something very zen about laughing like a maniac while in a hot bathtub. I wholeheartedy recommend the experience to you."},{"Title":"Fast Forward: Organizational Change in 100 Days","review":"The lessons Elspeth Murray and Peter Richardson wish to convey about organizational change are important, applicable and easy to sum up: If you want to change, do it quickly. The first 100 days are crucial. Build \\"speed, critical mass and intelligent momentum.\\" Traditional models of decision making and strategic planning take too much time and contain far too many bottlenecks, making them inappropriate for the Information Age. The authors have done their research and they clearly explain the key elements of change and how to apply them to a range of situations. In fact, the authors do too good a job of emphasizing their main points: The book's drawback is its repetitiveness. We recommend that leaders who haven't yet managed a major change or those who wonder why their efforts have not succeeded read this book - especially the first half. Once you understand the core concepts, you may be able to read the rest less intently."},{"Title":"Fast Forward: Organizational Change in 100 Days","review":"I expect that in a business world that values speed over most things, Richardson & Murray's book would strike a sympathetic chord. Nonetheless, beyond the existence of a popular belief that the quicker the better is how business should be run, I know of no research which would substantiate the claims to this effect. Are the stories that are provided by the authors sufficient to confirm their statements? I think not. Business is always looking for the next fad, something that will make all the difference in as short a time as possible. Management authors and practitioners who collude in this misguided search for the Holy Grail do more harm than good. Organizations are successful in the long term if they engage employees' hearts, not if they focus on things and logic. This engagement and involvement, the establishment of a democratic community, are not attainable in 100 days - maybe multiples of a 100 days."},{"Title":"Fast Forward: Organizational Change in 100 Days","review":"The authors present a framework for rapid implementation of organizational change. They assert that creating understanding for the need for change, building momentum, and perhaps scoring some initial successes in the first 100 days greatly increases chances for success. Successful change calls for Winning Conditions, the book's core framework, consisting of: correct diagnosis of the change challenge; early development of shared understanding; enrichment of shared understanding; establishing a sense of urgency; creating a limited, focused, strategic agenda; rapid, strategic decision making and deployment; a human flywheel of commitment; identifying and managing sources of resistance; follow-through on changing organizational enablers; and demonstrated leadership commitment. Discussion and examples make this approach clear and show how it's applied. The authors are careful to distinguish between different types (or depths) of intervention. The book is outstanding in its scope and quality of thought. It is highly informative, gets to the meat of ideas clearly and quickly, and gives the reader solid value from start to finish."},{"Title":"Naming Evil, Judging Evil","review":"The essays in this edited volume are truly insightful and thought-provoking - a highly recommended read. In his foreword to the book, Alasdair MacIntyre captures it best: \\"The papers in this volume are by a group of colleagues at Duke University . . . [whose] work has been informed by their shared reading, by extended interdisciplinary conversations and arguments, and by learning from each other's work. . . . It is one mark of a university that is flourishing that it is a place where such continuing, fruitfully inconclusive conversations on matters of moral and metaphysical moment are sustained.\\""},{"Title":"Naming Evil, Judging Evil","review":"If you're looking for MacIntyre's work, this book has almost nothing in it by him."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"excellant loved this book!

DOWNTOWN is his personal history entwined with the history of the city, from the Battery to Times Square, with fascinating examinations of the Villages, the old Knickerbockers, Trinity Church, the Bowery and all the sights, smells and significant indicators therein. There are several places I have not seen in my myriad of visits to the city that will definitely be examined on my upcoming trip. The Times Square information, of course, has been covered more extensively in the excellent GHOSTS OF 42ND STREET and DOWN 42ND STREET, detailed books about the area from the Lobster Houses to the Flea Circus to the Porn Palaces to Disney. BUT if you are not familiar with the history of the Square this is a great primer. Written in easy-to-read essay form, this book is a terrific introduction to Hamill's \\"downtown.\\" As a journalist, Hamill is able to segue between the personal (his mother takes him to Manhattan from Brooklyn to see THE WIZARD OF OZ, equating Manhattan to Oz in his individual vision of the city) and the historical, including a lengthy look at the origins of the city's paps in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"pete hamill and i both love new york.yes to us,it is the city of oz.it was interesting to learn of pete's parents and their immigrant struggles. the book is an immensely readable one."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"What a wonderful book!

It was so great that I needed to buy the print version so I could highlight the important parts and go back, find, and tour those places. If you love history or love Manhattan, you'll this book!"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"There are books I fall so helplessly in love with, I fear the last page because it means having to leave the special world the author has made. DOWNTOWN: MY MANHATTAN, an amalgam of history and memoir, is one of those books. It brings to mind all the \\"E\\" words: elegant, electric, extraordinary, exquisite, etc. Up to now, V.S. Pritchett's excellent LONDON PERCEIVED was my benchmark for a trip through a beloved city's neighborhoods, pushing aside the layers of time to plumb origins and connections to the present. DOWNTOWN exceeds it, at least in my affections. Here's why:Hamill is a New Yorker's New Yorker. The child of Irish immigrants settled in Brooklyn, he crossed the river to attend art school and never looked back, except for sojourns in the service and abroad. The former editor-in-chief of both The New York Post and The Daily News, he covered the city's politics, crime, commerce, art and people. Those he did not know personally or professionally he has tirelessly researched back to the first European settlers on the island. He brings them wrigglingly alive with masterful vision and carefully torqued prose while gazing upon a contemporary site that offers up some material connection to the past or at least its ghosts. He moves, as the settlement did, from the tip northward to Times Square and the edge of Central Park. Hamill's description of the architectural topography is peerless. On the streets, he can see the origins of the iconic New York personality, the accent (\\"like a fist\\") and enduring cultural icons. He celebrates the gains and mourns the losses, the latter epitomized by the 11th of September 2001. That day does not dominate the book but informs it with a quiet tension, empowering the terms \\"velocity\\" and \\"nostalgia\\" that are woven through as counterpoint leitmotifs."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"If you ever lived in NY City, as I have; you know Pete Hamill from his newspaper column.Pete is a great writer and Downtown : My Manhattan is a captivating book.Guaranteed to please every reader."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"This is a great book about the history of Manhattan and the why.

I grew up and always lived in Brooklyn, worked in lower Manhattan most of my life, sold real estate in Queens and spent my Sundays exploring the various cultures and cultural hot spots New York has to offer. I've even taken my vacation in New York City. After 43 years of living there, I moved out of the city, but my heart is always there.So, it is only natural that I look for various little things to remind me of my home. I have a little lucite cube of lower Manhattan with the World Trade Center clearly visible. I have books, maps, posters of Central Park and Times Square all around my house. And I visit when I get the chance.I also grew up in the \\"age of newspapers\\". Before computers and before television news anchors there were newspapers. Names like Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill were as well known to me as to any New Yorker. As I rode to work in the morning I read The Daily News, in the evenings it was the New York Post. Sunday morning it was The New York Times.So, sitting on-line one morning recently reading The New York Times Book Reviews, I saw a review of a new book by Pete Hamill called Downtown My Manhattan and just knew I had to read this book.Pete Hamill is about 20 years older than I am and he has been a main stay in the newspaper world as long as I could read newspapers. He has worked for The Daily News, the New York Post, The New York Times, Newsday, and The New Yorker. Anyone who reads New York newspapers recognizes his name. He has worked as a reporter and earned the position of Editor. His beat has always been New York and he knows it like no one else can because of his unique perspective.This book is the history of that part of The City commonly called lower Manhattan, which is everything south of 59th Street, or south of Central Park. No one here calls Manhattan by its borough name, it is simply The City and lower Manhattan is Downtown.This book is part biography, part history, part geography. It is a study of cultures, cross streets, music, art and food. It is a blend of everything New York expertly woven together to make a beautiful patchwork of what is the essence of New York City.Mr. Hamill covers the underlying history of lower Manhattan, from the Dutch founding through the progressive movement of the population north to Central Park. He covers the politics and the changes brought about by wave after wave of immigrants finding their place in this City. He covers the laying out of the neighborhoods, the building of the landmarks, the effects of culture and religion on the peoples who came here.But it is done in a style that can only be executed by a skilled newspaper reporter. The facts, the scandals, the news and the views all blended together to give the reader the most information in the least amount of space. No wasted words that would lead to boredom. No unnecessary details. This is headline news from a few hundred years that is blended together to make some fascinating reading. This is a collection of little bits of history as only found in the tabloids and hunting through the history books, dating back over the centuries that Mr. Hamill ties together to make a story that would grab any reader's attention.He discusses the who's who with the sordid facts. He gives us little tidbits of \\"gee, I didn't know that\\" that uncover the roots of our fair city. He includes sidebars of information that give a well rounded look at what drove the original settlers as well as the waves of those who came after.The Knickerbockers, Bowling Green, Tammany Hall, the three and a half ton bull, Five Points, Trinity Church, The Jewish Theatre, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Louchow's, the Rialto, the nightclubs, the theatres, the smell of the streets; it is all here to learn, remember and enjoy. Mr. Hamill leaves no stone unturned; these are the truths and the lies, the tender moments and the violent turns, the men and the money that made New York what it is today.Mr. Hamill includes an insiders look into the newspaper industry in New York, how it impacted the City as a whole and helped to make history as well as preserve it for future generations. There are also bits of Mr. Hamill's life here as he relives some of the most important events to occur during his lifetime in this City, to give that personal appeal that Pete is so well known for.There is so much more. For a book of 281 pages, it is packed with more information about New York City and its history than any book you could get from the library. From the founding of The City to today, it is a well written, in depth overview of what New York is about. All of this is done in the Pete Hamill style of writing that made him the household name we New Yorkers recognize and enjoy: short, sweet and to the point with just the right amount of newspaper intrigue that we crave to keep us interested. This is New York as it could only be told by someone who has lived and worked here all his life. It shows the love and respect that most New Yorkers have for their City.My only observation is that this book could have used a small photo section. For me, many of the locations discussed in the book are burned permanently in my mind. And those who live here or have lived here all their life will know exactly the buildings and locations spoken about. But like most folks, I appreciate pictures with my news. This book could have benefited from a small section of photos highlighting of some of the locations discussed. For those not familiar with the locations or buildings mentioned (there is a map in the front of the book) you may want to find a tourist book or a picture book of Manhattan to truly appreciate the verbal descriptions of some of the locations and architectural details discussed by Mr. Hamill in this book.However, there is an excellent \\"Suggested Reading\\" section at the back of the book for those who want more. I found this to be an excellent addition to the book.If you are a native New Yorker, a displaced New Yorker, new to the area or just curious about this city, this book is an essential part of your library. I would like to recommend this book for anyone who has a love of New York City, especially Downtown. boudica"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"To appreciate Manhattan to its fullest author Pete Hamill states you have to walk the streets. Since Hamill has \\"paid rent\\" in various locations on the island he is qualified to tell us what changes various parts of \\"downtown\\" have undergone over the past several decades. Downtown to Hamill runs from Battery Park at the southern tip of the island to approximately 60th Street. Hamill provides us with the history of the various parts of Manhattan and the changes that have taken place in areas such as Union Square, Herald Square, Washington Square, in \\"the Village\\", and Times Square, formerely Longacre Square. A huge victory for the city has been reclaiming Times Square from the druggies, feral children, porno parlors, and other seedy characters that inhabited the area mainly from the 1960's through the 1980's. Since my experiences in New York City have been limited to brief visits in 1958, 1973, 1978, and 2004) I don't have the necessary background to visualize all the places that Hamill tells us about. I did, however, find the book fascinating to read and picked up some historical tidbits I wasn't aware of. From my own limited observations the difference in the Times Square area in 2004 was a tremendous improvement from what it was like in the 1970's. Whether you are a veteran New Yorker or just interested in learning about this fascinating island, you will find Pete Hamill's \\"Downtown\\" to be an interesting and informative read."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"DowntownNew York is such a remarkable city with such a great history. Perhaps, therefore, its history can only be chronicled by a native with Big Apple blood running through his veins. Pete Hamill is such a man. Born and raised in Brooklyn, journalist/writer Hamill, in his simple yet poetic style chronicles the life and times of Manhattan, the city he loves and in which he has spent his life.Hamill begins by explaining that this book will be about \\"his\\" Manhattan, which consists of \\"downtown.\\" He explains that by \\"downtown\\" he means not just the section that New Yorkers today call \\"downtown\\" but all those parts of the city that have a historical resonance to him. Thus, Times Square is downtown although today we refer to it as \\"mid-town.\\" Harlem is downtown although it is far uptown (and Hamill does not feel competent to write about it in detail not having neither lived in it nor absorbed its essence as the rest of the city)New York's history is as old as the history of the New World. But Hamill's narrative is not strictly chronological. Rather it is geographical. He begins with the oldest part of the City, the battery and writes of the Dutch and the British and Colonial times. He moves on to describe the Wall Street area as it existed in Colonial times. Although unrecognizable today, obviously, important structures from the period exist. He spends much time discussing the Trinity Church, where Alexander Hamilton is buried, a mere block from where the World Trade Center once stood. As the City expanded northward with the passage of time, so Hamill expands his narrative northward, explaining how the \\"Knickerbockers\\", the offspring of the unions of old Dutch and English, moved northwards into elegant houses on fifth avenue outside the increasingly teeming streets of downtown. As early as the early 19th Century, old New Yorkers were already pining for the good old days. And this is the ongoing theme of the book as Hamill describes the growth of the dangerous neighborhoods of the Five Points and later the Tenderloin, precursors of the Forty Second street/times square district that would threaten the city in the seventies and eighties and the other neighborhoods that developed, Greenwich Village, The Flat Iron district, the lower west side that is today called Tribeca. That theme is constant change coupled with nostalgic longing for a vanished past. Sometimes the nostalgia is warranted, sometimes as in the case of the old Times Square, it is not.Hamill's writing is at its finest when he describes the Manhattan of his own youth, in the late fifties, early sixties. He writes of the great jazz musicians he saw, of the writers he drank with at the Lion's Head tavern. He brings the period to life but he never seems to imply that the future is not something to look forward to as well. Indeed, Hamill does not shy away from the squalor that overtook the City in the seventies and eighties, when rampant crime and drug abuse threatened to take New York down permanently. He marvels at the revival that has made New York one of the safest most pleasant large cities in the world today.The reader of this book will learn many interesting facts about New York's past, about its architecture and about its street life. Revealed are the buried layers of the past, still visible among the skyscrapers to those willing to take the time to look. This is a marvelous book and a great companion to \\"Forever\\", Hamill's fantasy novel about New York's history."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"This book was much more than I had expected. Thinking that it would be more autobiographical, I was pleasantly suprised to find that it was really the story of New York City, specifically the downtown area of Manhattan. Being a native New Yorker, Hamill gives great insight not only into the historical facts surrounding the city's origin, but also its lore, its people, its music, its drama, and its tradition. This book is so heaped with history, yet it reads so easily like a great love story. Like most New Yorkers, the names and faces of those who came before are soon forgotten, but Hamill brings them back to life again in a very real way. He leaves us with this feeling of connectedness to our past and a sense of longing nostalgia for old New York. However, he reminds us that New Yorkers do not live in the past and that self-pity is a mortal sin. The story of New York is very much one of constant difficult change, earned renewal, progressiveness, tolerance and optimism. These traits have been a part of the city since its origins and more important than ever as we see these traits come alive once again after 9/11. This book is a treasure to anyone who loves New York and wants to understand its history and its people without having to sift through textbooks that only gives facts. Put your vagabond reading glasses on and be a part of it."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Although I keep my Amazon.com profile location as being in Hawaii (I used to live there), I currently work in lower Manhattan. Pete Hamill's book was a joy to read. I was able to read a chapter in the book and then take the subway to the location Hamill described so beautifully and view the area through a different lens. Downtown is half New York City history and half autobiographical. Yet, because Hamill has spent his whole life in New York and has come to know it so well, the autobiographical parts of the book become a history of New York described by one of the City's most respected residents. This book is excellent and should be read by those interested in New York City as well as those merely looking for a fascinating story. The history and story of New York City is largely the history of the United States. And for that reason, this book is for everyone."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Pete Hamill is the Greatest Storyteller ever! Downtown My Manhattan is truly magical! Mr. Hamill gives us a history of the beauty that is Manhattan! Wheather he is talking about Battery City Park, Union Square, The Statue Of Liberty.

If you love history, or if you love Manhattan this book is for you! Thank You, Mr. Hamill"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"What a wonderful and spellbinding book. Although we know how everything ends up, this book takes us on a pleasant stroll uptown from the battery all the way to the Great White Way of Broadway.In his loving prose, Hamill offers the reader a history of lower Manhattan (his definition of lower Manhattan is a bit stretched, but you will understand why when - not if - you read the book), seamlessly combining the architecture with the people, the politics, and the conflicts that created the World's Greatest City.Whether you grew up in the outer boroughs, Manhattan itself, the suburbs or someplace else, you will find yourself walking astride of Peter Stuyvesant, Alfred Ochs, and Walter Winchell. You will be there with all of the Dutch and British aristocracy that shaped this city alongside of the huddled masses of Irish, German, Jewish, Italian, African American, Latin and Asian immigrants that made and continue to make New York City, and Downtown in particular, the crossroads and financial capital of the world."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Others have written great reviews for this book, so I will keep this short and sweet. I had never read a Pete Hamill book - fiction or nonfiction - but I love NYC history, so I figured I would give it a shot. I was not disappointed at all. Hamill's writing is so inviting and he has so much knowledge of the place he lives and loves, he draws you into a wonderful journey. I am not from the city, but I visit as often as I can. One doesn't need to be from the city to enjoy this book. Hamill gives you information that you can't find anywhere else in the warm manner he provides. This is one book I am keeping on my bookshelf to return to again and again. I am also now a Pete Hamill fan who is going out to read everything else he has written."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Part memoir, part social history, part guidebook, this work by Pete Hamill is a must read for anyone who loves to wander around Manhattan taking in the sights and sounds of the city. Hamill perfectly captures the sensations that make NY the world's greatest city.In addition to sharing his obvious love of the place he uses historical epsiodes that occurred in the various neighborhoods to both inform and entertain.As a transplanted NYer who visits as often as I can I completely related to the feelings evoked by this book. I'm never quite as happy as I am wandering around the streets of NY and reading Hamill's book made me realize it's time to jump on that plane and get back home for a visit.Great Book."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"bought more copies because friends ought feel the aweand shed the tears ending the reading caused. But thenI also ordered Drinking Life and Loving Women becausemore of Hamill is better than not enough.

Am a non-fiction reading politico, but storiesfrom Hamill's hand and heart are simply page turners.Went looking for a way to the publisher to thank him,got lost, of course. My thrifty self had bought his paperback.Then, I tripped over his photographer-daughter's siteand could not bear to go beyond the falcons in a B/W shotwithout returning to buy more copies for friends, etc.,Pete Hamill is a helluva writer.

As a people who just moved to New York, this was a great in-depth introduction to this fine city!"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"My attraction to this book was unexpected. As I got into it I became helpless to stop reading.To reveal too much would be a kind of sin. You must read for yourself. You'll learn, you will chuckle, cry and, I promise, the historical facts will amaze you at times. The history of New York is the history of our country, and our known history goes back only so many years. Just looking at some of the buildings, the architecture, the streets, will bring old stories to life. As a native New Yorker, Pete Hamill has lived his life as journalist and reporter, soaking up the flavor and moods of the city. He has been editor in chief of the New York Post and the New York Daily News, as well as author of numerous books and many articles and stories for other distinguished publications.New York IS history - and I think New York is Pete Hamill - and the natives live with it as they breathe. Pete Hamill will surprise and delight you, sharing his life and style while gently informing.Coming to the end of this book is like having to say a reluctant goodby."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"being an ex-NYer and having been changed forever by the years I lived there this book was a whirlwind tour through my favorite city. Pete Hamill knows his history and takes you through the history of buildings, people and the vibrant city that it's always been. Parsing bits of his own life with the life of the city it's like being on personal guided tour by one of NY's finest writers. My only problem was it was too short, I wanted to read more."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"In thinking about how I'd describe this book, I was influenced by a previous reviewer who found fault because there are no pictures in the book. I would counter that by saying this book has hundreds of pictures, the only difference is they are mental pictures shaped by the evocative writing style of Pete Hamill.What I think Hamill has created is a book that vividly describes past events, people and places the way most of us would remember events in our own lives. Our memory doesn't function like a photo album, it functions based on visualizing partial images with emphasis on the subject at hand. I think that's what Hamill has done. He doesn't describe in minute detail Battery Park, he describes it in glimpses that evoke a sense of the place. Providing pictures of Times Square would help in the detail, but it wouldn't fit with a narrative offered by someone remembering the place as it was for a 10 year old child."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"This beautifully written walking tour of lower Manhattan was an absolute pleasure to read, and halfway through, I knew I would be reading it again.Mr. Hamill brings to life the part of Manhattan from Battery Park to Times Square, in a way where you somehow visually experience the change from the Dutch settlement to the sky-scraping metropolis it is today. It's like a time-lapse film, in prose.I am one of those people who have only recently discovered New York. My wife and I have gone twice this year (traveling from SoCal), to simply spend two or three days soaking up that city buzz. Broadway, fine meals, touristy sight-seeing, casual walks...we have fallen in love with the city. This book puts my feelings into words.There are historical facts you were aware of, yet have never considered in quite such a manner, and there are historical facts you had no idea ever existed. You will find a host of both here.Hamill's prose is simple yet beautiful; a reporter with an eye for art.When the Queen Mary pulled into the harbor in the mid-40's, every inch packed with returning WWII GI's, Hamill writes how the roar from the city could be heard in heaven. He allowed me to hear that.He allowed me to visit the squalid Times Square, the one I'll never have to see, safely from the comfort of my recliner. He invited me into buildings that I'll never be able to explore anymore, since they've now long gone.Better yet, he has exposed me to places I've surely walked by, but never considered. I feel the need to go find them; I need to give those places the respect and attention they deserve.When I return to NYC, I'll have this book with me. I'm going to re-read it on the plane flight over, and I'm going to carry it with me as my wife and I stroll along those glorious avenues.This time, I'm going to reach out and touch those buildings and monuments I never \\"considered\\", and see them with new eyes, Hamill's."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Hamill's love for Downtown Manhattan is obvious. He speaks lovingly of \\"a city of daily irritations, occasional horrors, hourly tests of will and even courage, and huge dollops of pure beauty. He fills the book with tales of Peter Stuyvesant and John Jacob Astor, CBGB's and Delmonico's, but in the midst of this history, personal reminiscences are tossed in carelessly and this technique creates a schism in the narrative. It breaks the natural flow of his writing, which when on target create wonderful pictures of the Downtown that was. It's almost as if Hamill couldn't decide whether he was writing; history or memoir. I'm sure with careful consideration of approach this could have worked, but here style seems to be an afterthought, surprising for a newspaperman. Worth reading for his portraits of Old New York, but skip over the words when Hamill injects himself into the mix."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"IF YOU'RE A NEW YORKER (LIKE ME FOR 60 YEARS) AND THINK YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR CITY, BE ASSURED YOU DON'T (WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DISCOVERED AFTER READING THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK)!IF YOU'RE NOT A NEW YORKER BUT THINK YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF ITS EVOLUTION AND WHAT ITS LIKE TODAY,YOU KNOW NOTHING!

I live in New Jersey which is considered the poor sibling to the most exciting city in the world. Pete's right about writing about how much the twin towers' presence is missed alright. Where I live about thirty miles south of the city, you could have seen the twin towers. My grandfather's home was right across Manhattan where you could have seen the New York City skyline. He passed away before September 11, 2001. Every time I drive to Jersey City for school, I see the skyline without the twin towers and it's heartbreaking. It's just not the same without them there. Even though I didn't lose somebody I know, we all know people that did or survived the disaster with horrifying memories. Hamill's cynical but New York cynical, he writes about a city he loves so much, warts and all. Of course, most people just can't afford to live in New York City or they would not have moved away to the suburbs. People don't choose to run away from the city, they just have too because it's just expensive. Nobody unless you make six figures can afford to live decently in Manhattan or most of the five boroughs. The Village is not the same anymore since it has become so fashionable not just for gay couples but for straight couples with children. According to the times, the West Village has become family friendly. The East Village is following suit in becoming expensive and gentrified. It's all about money, who has it and doesn't that determines who gets to live there. Even Harlem has become gentrified like the rest of the city. Hamill doesn't talk much about the celebrity invasion that has determined who gets to live in the greatest city in the world. I love Manhattan! Would I live there? I don't know but it's got the best restaurants in the world, the best shopping, and the best sight-seeing of celebrities. In New York City, I feel so alive but it's still so expensive for the artists' population. Where do the artists like writers, artists, actors, and actresses go? The Village is no longer the place unless you're successful in your career. I wished the city well in the future and Hamill too. After September 11, 2001, there was a line in my church for confession which there never was or has been since. Many of the victims of 09-11-01 lived in New Jersey too. Commuters to New York City make up a lot of the foot traffic and business but they also contribute by spending the time to commute which can be difficult to do. If you want to see something in New York City, you should go to Penn or Grand Central Station and watch the commuters around rush hour. You'll see thousands of people waiting to find out which track their train is on and rush to get on board. I think of those stations as a place where I most likely run into people I know. New York City's great to visit, work, and even live if possible. I beg that the twin towers be rebuild but stronger because it's just not the same city anymore. I remember when I was in Warsaw where almost the entire city was destroyed about 90 percent I believe from World War II. After the war, the Poles rebuilt the city best as it was before the war and even added some Russian influence from the Soviet Communism. New York City should be rebuild those twin towers to make them stronger as well. There too busy concentrating on contracts and politics rather than remembering those lost their lives. If only, New Yorkers would stand up and demand the twin towers to be rebuilt and a memorial to honor those who were killed on that fateful day. By not rebuilding the twin towers, they are only cowering to the terrorists themselves."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"I'm a Manhattanite and can't think of another city where I'd rather live than this melting pot mix of a metropolis. To my mind, Pete Hamill is the quintessential New Yorker. A lifelong resident, former editor-in-chief of both the New York Post and New York Daily News, author of eight books, among them the best selling memoir, \\"A Drinking Life,\\" and \\"The Subway Series Reader,\\" Hamill knows more than most about the five boroughs, especially downtown Manhattan. He has certainly paid his dues, or rent, with 14 different residences during his lifetime. (unusual, as New Yorkers usually hold on to their apartments, forever). A cynical newspaperman, from the old school more than the new, Hamill was born in Brooklyn, the son of Irish immigrants. He is struck by those who, like his parents, fought for a brighter future while remembering what they left behind. \\"That rupture with the immediate past would mark all of them and did not go away as the young immigrants grew old. If anything, the nostalgias were often heightened by the coming of age. Some would wake up in the hot summer nights of New York and for a few moments think they were in Sicily or Mayo or Minsk. Some would think their mothers were at the fireplace in the next room, preparing food. The old food. The food of the Old Country.\\" As a child, looking with wonder for the first time at the gilded spires of Manhattan, from the pedestrian ramp of the Brooklyn Bridge, Hammil asked his mother in an awed voice, \\"What is it?\\" \\"Sure, you remember, Peter,\\" she said. \\"You've seen it before.\\" And then she smiled. \\"It's Oz.\\"Hamill's fast paced, fascinating narrative meanders with readers on a tour of lower Manhattan. His view of the city is a pedestrian's - which is the best view, if one doesn't need to be in the driver's seat. Hamill never learned to drive until he was 36. I have to laugh. How typical! What Manhattanite drives their car in NYC?? From the tony haunts of the \\"Knickerbockers\\" to the \\"lost cities\\" of Five Points, we travel with a most worthy guide. We are still able to see remnants of the British colony, the mansions of the robber barons, and the speakeasies of the 1920s. We wander with the author along the winding streets of Greenwich Village, to the grimy alleys of the meatpacking district, to the cobblestones of South Street Seaport, where the Fulton Street Fish Market and Dock once stood. I was surprised at how far uptown Mr. Hamill's \\"downtown Manhattan\\" ventures. But hey, it's his city too....to redefine or define. The author defends himself, \\"Broadway in my mind is an immense tree,\\" Mr. Hamill explains, \\"with its roots deep in the soil at the foot of Manhattan, which is why I insist so stubbornly to my friends that the uptown places I cherish on Broadway are actually part of downtown.\\" And if the old Thalia movie theater, at Broadway and 95th Street, is also part of his \\"downtown\\" experience, well, he's not the only one who got a first glimpse of Fellini, Kurosawa and Bergman there. So...that counts enough to place the old cinema below 14th street. Right??In this extraordinary book, which is both a personal and historical portrait, Hamill pays tribute to fellow New Yorkers like: Alexander Hamilton, who was shot dead in a duel with Aaron Burr across the North River in Weehawken, NJ, in 1804. Hamilton's grave graces gothic Trinity Church's centuries' old cemetery; Pearl Street's Captain William Kidd, who was hanged for piracy in London in 1701, \\"would not be the last New Yorker whose friends insisted he was framed;\\" John Jacob Astor, who emigrated from Germany in 1784 and became America's first millionaire; architect Stanford White, who designed the Washington Square arch and was the victim of New York's \\"murder on the rooftop garden\\" as a result of his love affair with the infamous Gibson Girl, Evelyn Nesbit; and authors like Henry James and Edith Wharton, who chronicled their times from a New York perspective.Nostalgia is a major theme that runs through the book. \\"Nostalgia,\\" proclaims the author, \\"is the city's ruling passion, after greed, anger and resistance to authority.\\" (I smile). He says, and it's true, that New York changes so quickly. \\"That every generation watches its own past being demolished\\" - a very acute observation! The Dodgers left us. Penn Station is gone...and so are so many small, neighborhood restaurants, cafes, movie theaters, that were important in an intimate way to our individual lives. Hamill is at once awed by the city's energy and haunted by her losses. As with all New Yorkers, September 11, 2001, weighs heavily on his heart. He lives in Tribeca, in the shadow of the former Towers, and witnessed the horror of that day and its terrible aftermath up close and personal. Hamill explains that the New Yorker's version of nostalgia is much more than a remembrance of lost buildings or the presence of those who lived in these places years ago. \\"It involves an almost fatalistic acceptance of the permanent presence of loss.\\" \\"This makes New Yorkers tougher,\\" he argues, \\"less sentimental. It has helped them move on after the attacks on the World Trade Center.\\"Mr. Hamill covers much ground in this wonderful biography of a city. He is able to give us a first hand impression of the abstract expressionists who thrived here in the 1940s and 50s, as well as bebop, jazz, the Beats who made Greenwich Village the \\"Village,\\" and many other old landmarks and legends. He integrates personal recollections along with historical observations for an outstanding mix of a memoir...and make no mistake, this is a memoir, of a city and a man who lives and breathes the city. While he waxes nostalgic, Hamill also believes that the city's changes make her stronger.The author's prose is sharp, clear - beautifully written. His plain-spoken narrative vibrates with life. And it is obvious how heartfelt the writing and observations are. Mr. Hamill is not an objective observer - no way! He is heart and soul a New Yorker, writing about the hometown he loves. And I loved every minute I spent reading \\"Downtown: My Manhattan.\\"JANA"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":". . . the greatest men and women. If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the whole word.\\" Whitman's words from his Song of the Broad-Axe never left me as I read Pete Hamill's wonderful book of his city, actually my city, Downtown.Downtown is part history, part-memoir. It is not a history of New York City as much as it is a history of Pete Hamill's New York City. It is at once a very personal piece of writing but in its own way Pete's story is one immediately familiar to any New Yorker. The streets we grew up on may be different but each of our individual and distinct stories must share more than a small amount of DNA with every other New Yorker for the last 300 years.I've never met Pete (calling him Hamill just doesn't sound right) but I've known him all my life. Pete is the child of immigrants. His family was part of the great wave of immigration that took the wretched refuse of those teeming shores and carried them not-that-gently to New York since the days of the earliest Dutch settlers. From the famine and oppression of Ireland (Hamill) to the pogroms of Russia (my family) they came. They came from everywhere. Like thousands of other immigrants or children of immigrants, Hamill's family struggled but made a life for itself. My father found his way to one of New York's lower east side settlement houses and learned a trade (music) that served him and his family well his entire life. Like Hamill, I remember the trips as a kid from Brooklyn and, in my case, Queens, New York to that city of proud towers known as Manhattan.\\"Downtown\\" is something of a walking guided tour. Hamill describes the building of lower Manhattan and its early history. He plots the expansion of the city north up beyond the original walled street that became Wall Street. He traces the expansion of what he calls downtown up through to 14th Street and Union Square and then on up to 42nd Street and Times Square. Along the way we read of his first trip to the city, the story of his parents' early life and hard times, and Hamill's own life and development. Along the way a few things become obvious. Hamill loves his city even when he is remarkably candid about its shortcomings. In China, the term for one's hometown is \`native place'. It is a word soaked with more meaning than home and as I read through Downtown it was clear to me that New York, downtown particularly, was Hamill's native place.For me, it was fascinating to read Hamill's descriptions of life and the development of lower Manhattan through the years. Like Hamill, I spent a good portion of my life working \`downtown'. I spent more than a few years in the shipping industry, when that industry shared downtown with the Wall St. crowd. I was a messenger and ran documents to and from every building Hamill describes with accuracy and fondness. From the Old Customs House to 17 Battery Place, 1 Broadway, 25 Broadway 90 West Street and all points in between. I walked to work from my first apartment on 12th street and 2nd avenue downtown every day. And, after taking dates home to Staten Island, I'd place myself at the front of the ferry so the breeze could keep me awake in the wee hours of the morning, and stand in awe as we glided quietly past the Statute of Liberty and watched the city's skyline loom bigger and bigger. Pete's childhood vision of \`the City' as Oz is singularly appropriate.Although Pete spends a lot of time describing the geography of downtown and the architecture of the buildings that became a part of his New York experience, Downtown is not simply an architectural digest. At its heart is the story of the people that built those houses and lived in them. It is said that \\"men make the city, and not walls or ships without men in them\\" and Pete is keenly aware of that. His feeling for the men and women that made his city is palpable.You do not need to be a New Yorker to love this book. Hamill knows, as did Whitman, that the place where a great city stands is not the \\"place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops\\" but, rather, stands in the hearts of people like Hamill's parents that arrive from distant shores to build those buildings and live their lives. They continue to arrive today and Pete rejoices in it. Pete Hamill's Downtown is a wonderful piece of writing."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Ex-newspaper editor of the New York Post and New York Daily News, Pete Hamill, was born in Brooklyn, moved around a bit, and returned to Manhattan where he lives and works. Having intimate knowledge of a city so revered, respected, and loved, but also scary and intimidating such as New York City, is surely grist for many a writer. Each time there are different aspects a writer will concentrate on, and many times one will not see what the other does, hence the many books on or about this awe-inspiring place. Mr. Hamill has a fluidity about his account which makes for easy, interesting, and page-turning reading about \\"his\\" downtown in Manhattan. It's a compelling read as Hamill tells the history of New York - easy to follow and it all fits into place - unlike other confusing \\"historical\\" accounts I've come across. From the late 1700s and through the 1800s and 1900s, so much exquisite change flourished in the then, and now, ever-growing city of New York. He not only covers the buildings and streets and avenues, but also the many peoples (the Dutch, the English, the Germans, Russians, Italians, Irish, and so many more) who so long ago had a huge hand in shaping the city."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Who knows New York better than former editor-in-chief of the New York Post and the New York Daily News, Pete Hamill? Few, I'll wager. Who possesses a better reportorial eye, or greater ability to spot just the detail that will bring his comment into sharp focus? None, I'll bet.Manhattan has been home to Mr. Hamill for some 70 years, and he seems to have loved every minute of it. There's also a bit of the historian in him as \\"Downtown\\" takes us on a journey back in time to some folks and events that have made the Big Apple what it is today. We go from the Bowery of the 1860s to the bohemian enclaves of the 1960s. Night spots are on tap as are remembrances of John Jacob Astor, William Randolph Hearst, and others.The author's personal memories are intertwined with events of the past resulting in a fascinating collage of thoughts and ideas. Mr. Hamill has referred to this work as a grouping of \\"essays.\\" It's so much more than that, especially when we hear it in his voice.\\"Downtown\\" is an intriguing armchair visit to the city that has become emblematic of America. Our visit, while absorbing and enjoyable, is just too brief.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Pete Hamill's \\"Downtown: My Manhattan\\" is part of the latest spate of books that combine personal New York City experience and New York City history, as do Colson Whitehead's \\"The Colossus of New York\\" (in a way) and Phillip Lopate's \\"Waterfront\\". However, Hamill's is as different from those two other books as those two books are different from each other. I don't know what is causing these authors to write such material--maybe the nostalgia brought about by the horrors of 9/11--but I'm glad they did.Nostalgia is the key word for Hamill's \\"Downtown\\". And it is not just the strong, personal nostalgia that Hamill luxuriates in: it's also the nostalgia that every true New Yorker feels for his City. Whether it was the Dutch or British who longed for their roots in the \\"Old World\\", as did the Irish, Eastern Europeans, Italians, Asians, Latinos, etc., or the people born here who cherish the memories of people and places now locked forever in the past, New York's ever-changing \\"scene\\" quickly compels our present into history. Hamill's sensitivity to this is brilliantly conveyed on every page.However, \\"Downtown\\" is by no means a treacly, misty-eyed glimpse backward. It is a studied and educational examination of several of New York's neighborhoods--some well-known, some not. The pieces about the Bowling Green area and Times Square were the most fascinating.What, to me, is special about this history is how it intertwines with other histories: with America's history, with Hamill's history, with my history, and, if you are a New Yorker, your history. I could not put down \\"Downtown\\"; in fact, I read it cover to cover in two sittings (I had to go to sleep) and then read it again. It's that amazing a book."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"Unlike this Native Son, I am not nor have I ever been a New Yorker. I go there when I want to unwind. With each book, Hamill proves his love for his City. Although I felt I knew this City after starting this wonderful book, I found I didn't know bupkis. This slim volume packs in so much history about the city itself, its evolution into the greatest City in the world, warts and all. Most books I tend to sell or give away once read, after taking notes so I don't forget the essence of the writing. This one, I plan to keep and take with me when I return, using it as a guide to areas I am not familiar with. Near the end, Hamill describes a scene in which he had tears in his eyes after watching the passing parade and reminising about the rejuvenation of a neighborhood. Suffice it to say, I was reading that passage through tears of my own."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"You don't buy Pete Hamill for experimental prose or hard-hitting scholarship--it's more like sitting down in a bar with a great old neighborhood character. Hamill's really in his element in \\"Downtown,\\" displaying his considerable journalistic chops along with some quite moving and exhilirating turns of phrase. He travels from the tip of Manhattan to Times Square, pulling out nuggets of trivia, historical highlights and vivid memories of his own, quite entertaining past as he goes. If only I could go along with him in person!If anyone writing today has \\"the gift of the gab,\\" it's Hamill."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"I grew up in New York reading newspaper articles by Pete Hamill and always imagined him as a rather gruff and cynical newspaper man. In Downtown: My Manhattan, Hamill reveals not only an incredible knowledge of the history of New York, but a tender and affectionate heart towards this most incredible city. Hamill serves up personal stories along with the people and places that once made up and, in many cases, still make up, downtown Manhattan.He takes us on the journey that so many immigrants took, leaving the Old Country and arriving, and often staying, in New York, that amazing melting pot of so many different cultures and peoples. He reminds us of the gifts we now take for granted such as free schools and libraries which were crucial in helping the children of poor immigrant families build new lives for themselves. We learn the history of the Battery, how Wall Street got its name, the development of skyscrapers, stories of the Bowery, Park Row and the Rialto. Hamill takes us along with him to learn about the first newspapers and the men who ran them. He tells us the stories of familiar names such as Peter Stuyvesant and John Jacob Astor, as well as less familiar names including Alexander Stewart who wrought radical change to New York City. We are taken to Times Square and the impact of the subway on transforming this intersection of roads into one of the most famous and influential pieces of real estate in the world. He takes us back to the neighborhoods when the diverse immigrant groups were struggling to make their way in this new world. We go to the villages, including Little Italy, Chinatown, and that most famous of villages, Greenwich Village. Hamill also pays tribute to the World Trade Center and the horrific events of September 11th in a personal and moving reaction to the terrors of that day.Hamill discusses the fact that New York City is always changing, sometimes for the better, but not always. Early on, he explains the difference between sentimentality and nostalgia for things that no longer exist: Irreversible change happens so often in New York that the experience affects character itself. New York toughens its people against sentimentality by allowing the truer emotion of nostalgia. Sentimentality is always about a lie. Nostalgia is about real things gone. Nobody truly mourns a lie.Hamill is the kind of writer who makes it look easy, who makes it sound like he is having a conversation with you about the most everyday of topics when he is actually weaving complex and often obscure historical facts and characters into a most readable, fascinating history of downtown Manhattan. While most of us have heard bits and pieces of this story, few have delved into the truth of it with the gusto and affection of this author. This is a most enjoyable read and one that takes us on a nostalgic, but never sentimental, journey into another time. This is one love letter meant to be shared and savored by us all."},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"For anybody who was born there or grew up in its immense shadow, there can be, no matter how far away you travel in life, only one place forever known as \\"The City.\\"And that city is the real life Oz known as New York. Bestselling author and journalist Pete Hamill knows this city well. He was born in Brooklyn and has spent the last four-plus decades exploring the streets of New York as both a newspaperman and resident.DOWNTOWN: My Manhattan, is Hamill's brilliant tribute to the city he loves. It is part history, part memoir, and part elegy.The book follows the growth of Manhattan from its roots as a Dutch trading post on the lower tip of the island to its inevitable expansion uptown to Times Square and upwards to the sky.The geographic scope of this book is no accident. It mirrors the area where Hamill has paid rent on 14 different apartments over the years and where he now lives. On these streets, he tells us, \\"I am always a young man.\\"Besides being one of America's most famous journalists, Hamill is also one of our greatest living writers. He is a master of the craft. He brings to this book both the journalist's eye for detail and the poet's gift for language. The writing is sharp and clear, and as tough as a street vendor on Canal Street during lunch hour.There is much here to delight the reader. Hamill reveals little known aspects of the city's history, from the first Dutch colonial governor, who was also the first to cook the city's books, to British Governor Lord Cornbury, who enjoyed strolling around in drag after 1702 and once had himself painted as Queen Anne.But we also learn how an African American named Master Juba joined with an Irish American named John Diamond in 1844 to create tap dancing. And then there is the first Broadway musical in 1866, which prompted 31-year-old Marc Twain to exclaim: \\"the scenery and the legs are everything.\\"Hamill introduces us to a city where \\"the present becomes the past more rapidly than in any other world city.\\" This is a place where the velocity of change is so great that it seems the entire city is rebuilt every ten years. But there are still many wonderful places you can visit today, such as Trinity Church in lower Manhattan, which, he explains, \\"asserts a sense of pheonixlike triumph, rebirth and enduring faith\\" while nestled among skyscrapers.The engine for this perpetual growth has been the immigrants, who still arrive daily in search of a better future. Hamill tells us the great enduring gift that the Dutch gave New York was tolerance. For New York was a city built on pragmatic concerns; commerce, not religion or political ideology, ruled its history. The only true religion of New York, we learn, is real estate.New York is a city that should not work. Today there are more than 100 languages spoken on its streets, including at least 10 dialects of Chinese. But it does work because, despite its fair share of crooks and scoundrels and disasters, the tradition of tolerance holds.Each new generation of immigrants becomes part of the alloy on New York. Lower East Side settlement houses that once helped Jewish immigrants now provide aid to Latinos and Asians.The immigrants also brought with them nostalgia, which would become the one thing permanent here. Hamill calls New York \\"the capital of nostalgia.\\" The immigrants endured a double dose of it. They felt the loss of the land of their birth. But as they assimilated into America and watched new waves of immigrants transform New York, they carried inside them the memories of the now vanished New York where they once lived and struggled.All New Yorkers carry this nostalgia. Even after Times Square and 42nd Street were rescued and cleaned up with the help of corporations like Disney in the 1990s, many of us find ourselves missing the old \\"Deuce\\" with its edge of danger and forbidden excitement.In describing this longing for the past, Hamill's writing becomes almost lyrical. On the long lost and much missed old Penn Station, he writes, \\"For generations, young men had waited near the clock for young women arriving for a night together on the town. I was one of them. We could look at the ruins of the station and remember girls in polo coats with snow melting in their hair...We could remember a time when we were so young that we thought the things we loved would last forever.\\"What lasts forever is New York. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand this great city or is planning a visit.Follow Hamill down these streets and into the parks. Stop and look up at the marvelous Beaux-Arts buildings that now house Starbucks and Kinkos on their ground floors. Stand in Grand Central Terminal during rush hour and feel the energy flowing around you. Gaze out at New York Harbor from Battery Park and imagine ships filled with immigrant dreams. You will find a magical place that will make you want to live forever.--- Reviewed by Tom Callahan"},{"Title":"Downtown: My Manhattan","review":"My initial reaction to starting this book (it was a gift from a relative who misses living in Manhattan) was that it would be heavy in the nostalgia that my aunt felt. And it was initially. However, Hamill creates an amazing tale of the incredible, and often little known, people that made downtown the place that it is today. He weaves his own life into a brilliant story that is supplemented by the history of a city that is as rich as any others.

Some of it, you're not going to get here. Such as the name of the department store that Stewart opened. Come on, what is the name of his store? The author doesn't say so off I go to do an online search. Where did some of these other places get their names? Look it up yourself because he's not going to tell you.The building setback zoning law to allow some sun to reach the people on the streets is an interesting morsel of knowledge I've picked up in this rendering of Manhattan.The author picks out certain parts of Manhattan and tells not only of its history but about the people whose lives played important roles in the making and constant change in this district. However, to a point that distracts and takes away from its quality. There is information told that certainly did not need to be history such as one young man's relieving himself in his fiance's family's fireplace. I'm sure he'd be chagrined to know that that made history. Who cares also, that a prince went to a brothel? Sure, brothels were part of NY's history but we certainly don't need to know who took advantage of them.I find myself wanting the author to move on, get to the point or something.

Of all the books and magazines given to us by the Australian government in the program, Carlino Polia Esq. shed more light and resolved more questions about Australia.Two of our children, aged 22 and 19, had difficulty putting your book down. They both read to the early hours of the morning enthralled by your yarn and the actual events.When we visit America after emigrating to Australia, we are often besieged with questions about Australia. It is Amazing how little Americans know about Australia in spite of the experiences of world war II. Carlino Polia Esq. relates experiences of the early auto industry not at all unlike that of my family in Cleveland, Ohio which had 22 automobile companies headquartered there prior to World War I.As an attorney who has acquired property in over 30 states in the United States, these sections on Australian property transfer were very enlightening. Over and over again you very subtly bring home to our children that education combined with experience and ethics will likely be rewarded with a quality of life. Again, my ancestors in America cherished the same values as Carlino Polia.I strongly urge you to find an American book distributor. There is a strong likelihood once Carlino Polia is reviewed, it will be well received and movie/TV rights will be sought from you. I could see Carlino Polia Esq. in a TV series, especially in commemoration of Sydney 2000.Just yesterday The Australian newspaper had an opinion column stating \\"Shrimp on the barbie\\" and \\"Crocodile Dundee\\" image of Australia has overridden the millions of dollars of government ads trying to re-image Australia as a global competitor in complex industries.Maybe tracing Australia's roots through Carlino Polia Esq. is a better antidote to the Mad Maxes and Bushwacker string of movies and books that seem to define Australia to America and other parts of the world. Carlino's involvement with the young artists, taking his paintings to a soir&eacute;e, a good golfer, then his appearance in white tie and tails with a top hat, tells of Sydney with a sophisticated cultural society from the early 1900s; not much different to that in New York London or Paris at that time.Wishing you the best for your book and in finding a distributor in America.Warmest regardsJohn Wagner.

Williams"},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"12 Again is the story of 7th grader Patrick, and his mother Bernadette (or Detta). Patrick chafes against his responsibilities as the oldest of three son, with two working parents. This causes friction with his mother, right up until his mother disappears on Labor Day. Detta has gone to sleep in her mother's house, and wakes up as a 12-year-old herself. For the rest of the book, the viewpoint shifts between Patrick and the now 12-year-old Detta, as Patrick tries to find her mother, and Detta tries to find her way back to her family.I enjoyed this book because of the wish fulfillment aspect. How cool would it be to wake up in your 12-year-old body, but with all of you adult knowledge? You could get straight A's in school easily. You'd have a better idea of how to make friends, perhaps. It's something I think about sometimes, in idle moments. If I could go back to my 12-year-old self, with the knowledge that I have today, what would I do differently? Could I stop September 11th? Could I prevent the tragedy that happened to one of my friends? Would I major in something to do with books in college? It's endlessly fascinating to think about.But back to the book. I thought that the mechanics of Detta's time travel were a little bit confusing, and I saw a few loopholes (Why didn't Detta go the library and get a Hotmail account - why did she need to email from her own computer?). But I liked the family dynamics between Patrick and his brothers. And I liked Patrick a lot. He's a kid who tries to hide from his friends the fact that he likes to do well in school, but can break the rules when he needs to. I empathized with his struggles as the oldest child, constantly having to nag and/or care for his younger brothers (I was the oldest of four, myself). There's also a wonderful school librarian who plays a small part in the story. She's fleshed out much more than she needs to be for her role in the story - I suspect that she's based on a real person. She adds warmth to the story.All in all, 12 Again is fun escapist reading, with a few more serious things to say about family dynamics, putting too much pressure on the oldest child, and telling people you love them when you have the chance. I recommend it.This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on June 16, 2006."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"This was a very interesting book. I read it very quickly and was dissapointed when it was over. I reccommend it to anyone who is looking for something to read."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"12 Again was ok, but not really worth the time. The plot is not about how Bernadette comes to terms with her age - it's about how she gets un-spelled and returns to her family. There is hardly any emotion in the book, besides the occassional \\"i miss my family\\" or \\"i miss my mom.\\" There's just Bernadette trying to figure out what happened to her, and how to get out of it, and her family trying to figure out how to function without her. Patrick's emotions are limited to \\"mom, please come home. the house is a pigsty.\\" then that gets solved when Bernadette's husband hires a babysitter/housekeeper and a tutor to help the boys with their homework. You wonder why they want her back in the first place.there is no emotional conflict or resolution - bernadette knows from the start that she wants to get back to her family. she seems very happy with her life, and becoming 12 again is only the result of an idle wish mixed with a mysterious liquid from her dead mother's pantry.that's my main complaint, but one more thing really bothered me: the ending. Bernadette becomes 40 again, turns a cartwheel, and heads for home. and we're left wondering how on earth she is going to explain her disappearance to her family, not to mention the police. and what are the friends she made at school going to think when 12-year-old \\"Detta\\" just disappears? what is the school going to think? Will they report her missing to the police? It just doesn't make sense.12 Again is a quick, simple read. There's no point, unless it's \\"don't drink mysterious liquids from the pantry of an old Irish woman who believes in fairies.\\" it's not a bad book - the writing is fine, and i did enjoy the occasional funny stories about Patrick brothers. The family was well-depicted. the characters, while not all that deep, weren't flat.It's an ok read if you just want something to pass the time."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"The main character is a 40-year old mom of three, named Bernadette who one night goes to her deceased mother's home to finish a report for her work without distractions. The next morning Bernadette discovers that she and everything else in the house has turned back to the way it was when she was 12. In the midst of all of this, everyone thinks she is missing. As Bernadette's mother is alive again and she has to go to school and figure out why she is 12. While this is happening, Bernadette's son finds out that his mom is 12 again, and it is up to him to get his mom back to her normal age barely knowing how to accomplish this task. This shows the theme of the book is about faith. I feel even though I did not care for the book the theme was well intertwined in the authors' writing style.Bernadette, the main character is a very trustworthy person because with some hard tasks she has to trust her son to come through for her. Also Bernadette is a very calm person because she never overreacts to a situation. For example when she was 12 she never yells or goes crazy; she just looks for a solution to get back to her normal age. Lastly Bernadette is a very kind person. Although she could probably run her newly made friends life because of her lifetime experiences, she is humble and makes friends with everyone.This story takes place in an urban town, long island. There are also a lot of people who have immigrated from Ireland, making the town a some what Irish community. The urban setting puts the story in place, because everything they needed was not that far away and they had many trains. The time was modern also; they had computers and all modern devices. Twelve Again is not a book that I liked, although the book had a good theme of faith. I think this is why it is an award-winning book.Twelve Again is a simple quick read. Even in the falling action, I feel no thrills coming from this book. In addition, I think the book is very predictable because there are no cliffhangers to keep me on the edge wanting to read more. In short, I would not put this book on my or your want-to-read wish list."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"Bernadette, journalist and mother of three boys, is frustrated.

Patrick is not happy to be spending the last day of summer vacation with his second grade brother, and he lets his parents know it.The day is hectic, with Bernadette trying to work from home and keep the kids out of her way. Then her computer crashes, losing her entire story. At dinner her husband announces he will be at a conference out of town the next day--on Bernadette's fortieth birthday. He's forgotten all about it.Stressed out and unhappy, Bernadette takes an overnight bag and leaves, heading down the road to the empty house her mother lived in until she died recently. She figures she'll at least be able to get some peace there and finish her story. Once at her mother's house, though, Bernadette begins to wish she were younger and that her mother was still alive. She takes a drink of something her mother kept in her pantry, a strange-tasting liqueur with a label written in Gaelic. She falls asleep without finishing her story.The next morning, Bernadette is woken by the sound of her mother's Irish brogue. Shocked, she looks in the mirror and realizes that she is somehow twelve again. When she arrives at school, she sees that she is in some of her son Patrick's classes, and that he is worried about his missing mother. Now Bernadette needs to figure out what is going on and how to make things normal again. And Patrick feels like it is up to him to find his mother before his entire family falls apart.I liked the bits of Irish legends and superstitions in this story, and I thought Bernadette's mother was a great character. I also liked how Patrick's father managed to pull things together after his wife was gone. Things didn't get too bad before he hired a cleaning lady and a tutor. I would have been interested, though, to have seen more interaction between Patrick and Bernadette in school."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"I loved this book. It made me want to keep reading it.

This happened to Bernadette McBride after her husband had forgotten her birthday. Her son Patrick went mainly took care of his two little brothers because his mother works as an editor for the local news paper and his father was a docter. But when his mother went to his dead grandmother's house to get away for a night she fell asleep working on a story for the news paper. When she woke up she was twelve again and her mother was alive. What had really happened was the house was set back to the time when she was twelve. She was said to be missing because no one had answer the door to her mother's house, she did not answer her phone, and she didn't answer emails until later in the story. In the end, Patrick had collected things his mother had told him to in e-mails and gave them to Detta (a.k.a. Bernadette) and she made three cakes which she must eat to go back to normal. I highly recommend this book.I recommend this book because the plot falls in order. Everything that happened was explained day by day switching between Detta and Patrick every chapter. This theory helped me understand the story a little bit better. Since this helped me understand more I was able to read faster while still comprehending the book. Since I can be a slow reader, this was a spectacular key.I also liked this book because it was funny to see people trying to figure out why Detta lied about so many things. Detta had signed up at her son's middle school hoping to watch Patrick and follow him home to look in the door as she walked by the house. Detta told the school the wrong social security number and had lied about why she had missed school for three days.One downfall to 12 Again though, is the unrealistic actions by characters. The three things Patrick's mother had told him to get were unusual. She was planning to use fairies to change her back. She had told him to get ten goose berries and ten goose thorns, a live ember from April 30th, and three sprigs of watercress. These materials were very hard to come by even though Patrick had collected them.I overall recommend 12 Again because it was written well. The plot fell in order. The novel made sense. Plus every problem was solved. I recommend 12 Again."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"What if you woke up one day and you were twelve years old again when just the day before you were a busy overworked mother of three kids? That is exactly what happens to Bernadette McBride in the novel 12 Again by Sue Corbett. The story is about of a frustrated mother and writer who magically becomes a seventh grader again after visiting her childhood home and her family who is missing her. While her family searches for her, Bernadette tries to figure out how to become her old self again because she can't tell anyone who she really is. This book is very entertaining, funny and with its fast paced action it will make the reader anxious to know what will happen next.A funny part of this book is when Bernadette enrolls herself as a seventh grader at her oldest son Patrick's school. She tries to find ways to communicate with him and see how he is managing without her. It is hard for her to fit it at the school because she forgets what it is like to be in middle school again. She makes a few friends but has to remember not to tell her real age.Another reason why I would recommend this book is because the characters seem very realistic. I could imagine them in the scenes of the book as I read. Bernadette seems like a normal mother who is stressed out from her work and also having to raise three children. Also Patrick McBride seems like a normal seventh grade boy. Like most twelve year old boys, he doesn't like to watch his younger siblings or to do chores and he likes to hang out with his friends.Another reason why I recommend this book is because of the creativity in the plot. This book will grab the reader's attention from the very beginning. The reader will have fun trying to imagine how Bernadette turned into a little girl again. They will wonder how a mother and son are in the same class together and not be able to tell each other who they really are.12 Again is an excellent well written novel that I would highly recommend.

Lately, she had been overwhelmed with her responsibilities as a mother and a journalist. While seeking solace at her deceased mother's house, she drinks a mysterious amber-colored elixir, which she toasts to her mother...and her youth. The next morning, the morning of her fortieth birthday, she wakes up twelve again.Patrick McBride was twelve when his mother vanished. While balancing his own emotions about her disappearance, he tries to keep the family going. At the same time, he repeatedly e-mails his mother, because he knows she has the laptop with her.However, while the outside world still exists in the present time, it is 1972 in Bernadette's house. She is tossed back into the loving care of her mother, and attends Patrick's school as \\"Detta\\", the new girl. Although she is relieved to have her mother back at her side, she misses her family dearly. As Bernadette tries to unravel the mystery of being twelve again, a lot of things become apparent to her, in ways which they never were before.Twelve Again is a delightful read for teenagers as well as young adults. Although it is essentially a book of mystery, Sue Corbett adds a tinge of humor here and there, making it a fairly light-hearted and enjoyable to read. The story is told from a double perspective - Bernadette's and Patrick's - allowing the readers to fully understand the complete plot, and striking a balance between the \\"past\\" and \\"present\\" of the story. The emotions of both mother and son are realistically depicted, and through Patrick's eyes, we get a peek at the rest of the family's reactions as well. As the mystery unfolds, we take a look at all its puzzling ingredients: a black rabbit, a hidden key, a full moon on Halloween night, fairy magic and Irish folklore. Although some of these elements remain fuzzy and are never fully explained, the message of the story is clear. Through Bernadette's experience, one can discover the power of regrets, as well as the importance of letting go."},{"Title":"12 Again","review":"12 Again is probably one of the best books I've read.

In this story a young boy of 12 named Patrick must help his mother Bernadette come home. Patrick lives with his mother, father, his brother Kevin, and his brother Neil. They all live in a home in a regular town just like many of us do. Patrick feels like he has to do everything with his younger brothers. He must babysit them on the weekends, and play toys with Neil (the youngest). Because his father is a doctor he can't help out around the house. His mother also works from home and is always locking herself away in her office. One day on Bernadette's birthday she got so annoyed with her kids and husband that she left the house to stay at her mothers. Her mother had passed away a few months ago and so the house was empty. While Bernadette was there she wished that she was younger. The very next day she woke up and found herself to be 12 again. The whole house had gone back to when Bernadette was 12 in 1979. For Patrick to help get his mother back he must go through hard times of trusting, believing and seeing.I loved reading 12 again, it was a great read. It really reminded me of how much I would miss my mother if she ever went away. I think that in this book it had a fate problem, because they have to deal with magic. On a rate of 1-10 I would say this book is about a 9. It has a lot of adventure and mystery. Another thing I liked about it is that you can't predict what's going happen next.

Shakespeare's work appeals to such diverse populations!! In his book of lists, Mike LoMonico does the same. Topics range from Shakespeare's most insulting lines, to some very interesting facts about the &quot;authorship question.&quot;Reason 2) The section entitled &quot;Some Random Thoughts About Shakespeare.&quot; This chapter alone is worth the price of admission!! Here, the author has compiled comments about The Bard from some likely (and unlikely!) sources. This &quot;list&quot; includes comments from Al Pacino, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Ben Jonson, and Peggy O'Brien, Director of Education for the Folger Shakespeare Library, among others.Reason 3) It's FUN. Mike LoMonico has infused this book with many clever and amusing facts and insights. The lists of &quot;troublesome&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; words are wonderful resources for teachers.... Of course...no Shakespeare resource would be complete without a tip of the hat to the &quot;Naughty Bits.&quot;Reason 4) It is a valuable Shakespeare resource! The opening and closing lines are a wonderful leaping-point for readers and theater-goers alike. LoMonico includes a &quot;Play by Play&quot; (pun intended?) synopsis of each play consisting of character lists, memorable lines, and a &quot;great&quot; passage from each.Reason 5) Film/Theater buffs!!! Order this book!!! Mike LoMonico has compiled a massive list of &quot;Shakespeare at The Movies.&quot; Including silent films dating back as far as 1899, the list goes on to include films as current as Almereyda's 2000 production of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; starring Ethan Hawke. Equally as comprehensive is his list of &quot;150 Great Places to See a Shakespeare Play.&quot; Wonderful!!!!!!!Anyone who makes Shakespeare a part of the present needs to have LoMonico's book!!!!!

There Jews had long beards and black coats that reached their ankles --- but were not quite like other Jews.In the spring after a very hard winter, they built a wall around their town to keep the cold out. Later, they invited an organist to play for the town --- although there was not a single organ in Helm.The world came to regard them as fools. An angel had been flying over Helm en route to heaven with a sack full of fools in need of repair when the bottom caught on a treetop and all the fools fell into the valley town of Helm, where they remained. The Helmites insisted that they were not the fools. \\"It's just that foolish things are always happening to us,\\" explained Mottel.For example, since thieves always steal at night, the Helm shopkeepers kept their stores open at night and slept by day. When no one came to their stores, they decided instead to hire a night watchman --- who wore an inside out fur coat to be recognized, sat on a horse and guarded the shops.But one fine morning, the watchman woke the townspeople. Their shops were emptied in the night. Furious, they dragged him to the Rabbi. He said, \\"I admit I saw the thieves break the locks. With my own eyes I watched them carrying the wares out of the shops. But I could do nothing.\\" Why? Because his horse was tied to the post near town hall, far away from the shops, and untying it was too risky. The horse might gallop off and kill him.With thieves in town, the Helmites decided there was no justice, and sent two messengers to buy some and bring it back to Helm, for rich and poor alike. The Helmites rode all the way to Warsaw, searching all the stores.\\"Look no further,\\" two rogues told them, \\"We'll sell you as much justice as you want.\\" For 2,000 pieces of gold, the rogues a few hours later delivered a full barrel of justice, nailed tight and sealed all around, warning the Helmites, \\"More sure not to jostle it on your way. You know how hard it is to get justice these days.\\"When they got back to Helm, however, and reverently lifted the cover on the barrel, they smelled bad fish. \\"Justice of the world smells bad,\\" they cried. \\"Woe! What shall we do?\\"Whereupon Gimpel exclaimed, \\"That is the kind of justice you have in the rest of the world!\\"After a great fire in Helm, the Rabbi consoled the people with the news that they could now expand their Synagogue, making it as large as Gimpel's potato patch. The Warsaw Jews gave money to their Helm brothers to fund the construction. But, carrying a great fortune, and convinced by scoundrels that they would be robbed on the road, the Helmites decided to buy feathers--which are light. And feathers, if stolen, could unlike money not be concealed by the thieves. Once back in Helm, they would sell the feathers and use the money to rebuild their Synagogue.They set out back to Helm, and when a favorable wind arose, they reasoned that by releasing the feathers they could save themselves the trouble of carrying them. They let the feathers fly. Once back in Helm, the people cheered their heroes' return. And what of the feathers? \\"When you grow up,\\" Gimpel told a saucy lad, \\"you'll understand that if a man can sometimes be late, surely feathers can also be late.\\"When after weeks the feathers had still not arrived, the Helmites decided to seek them in the larger world. And that is how the fools came to live among us.If you think you might be one of them, read the book to verify their traits.--Alyssa A.

He circled the title in heavy red ink and wrote in the margin with even heavier sarcasm: \\"Might the book have a bias?\\"Richard Wurmbrand certainly did have a bias, though not the one the \\"one star\\" reviewers below accuse him of. No, this is not \\"anti-Semitic drivel;\\" Wurmbrand was himself a Jew, persecuted by the fascists for his race, who loved his people. No, he is not a \\"reactionary fanatic,\\" nor does this book represent \\"the scarier mindscapes of the Bible Belt.\\" Wurmbrand is actually from Romania, which is I believe some distance from Texas, and you read his many fascinating books, you will find he was actually quite thoughtful. But yes, he was biased against communism. He spent many years in slave labor camps, was tortured, and saw friends die. (A slave labor camp, I might point out, is rather a scarier place than a Southern Baptist church; tens of millions of people died in such places in the last century.)Despite the provocative title of this book, such experiences did not render Wurmbrand bitter or unhinged. His argument here is not a vitriolic piece of ad hominem; rather it is a serious suggestion, backed up, it seems, by a fair amount of circumstantial evidence.It is commonly argued that Marx had nothing to do with the crimes of communism. Even if Wurmbrand's central thesis does not convince you, the evidence he offers does at least show the spiritual or psychological continuity between Marx and the crimes committed in his name.The book has its flaws, true. The evidence Wurmbrand offers is not overpowering. Wurmbrand sometimes takes phrases like \\"demonic fury\\" a little too seriously; I suspect it was often mere hyperboli. Also, he is not critical enough with his sources. Although he does not base anything on it, in one place he seems to accept the \\"Ritual Satanic Abuse\\" scam, for example. Finally, the book is a bit gossipy.Still, Wurmbrand knows a great deal about communism. He seems to have read very widely in primary sources, and provides strongly suggestive quotes to back up his thesis. He shows caution at times, and is knowledgeable and thoughtful.A few months ago I came across a dissertation in my university library entitled \\"The Role of Atheism in the Marxist Tradition.\\" The author of the dissertation, a journalist named David Aikman, wrote it under the guidance of Donald Treadgold, editor of the Slavic Review and a leading historian of the Soviet Union. It was interesting to me to find that Aikman took Wurmbrand's thesis very seriously, and in his own study of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, had found additional evidence that seemed to point in the same general direction.What did Marx and his chief disciples really believe? As Wurmbrand admits, Marx and Satan is not the final word on that question. But I think this little book does point out a set of facts that more conventional history largely ignores, and that ought to be considered; and not only as an intellectual curiosity. Wurmbrand was not an arm-chair critic, but a witness, survivor, philosopher, and passionate lover of God and man. The facts he points out, and his observations on this subject, are worth considering, if not just for their own sake, for the sake of those who died.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"On page 71 of my 1979 edition of WAS KARL MARX A SATANIST?, Richard Wurmbrand writes: Marx did not love mankind. Mazzini, who had known him well, wrote that he had \\"a destructive spirit. His heart bursts with hatred rather than with love toward men.\\" I know of no testimonies to the contrary from Marx's contemporaries. Marx the loving man is a myth constructed only after his death.This is a factor that all men and women who lean toward Communism/Socialism as a result of genuine concern for the welfare of all people would be wise to seriously consider before ascribing any noble aspirations to the manifesto Marx gave to the world. If what Marx wrote was true, that he harbored \\"hatred against all gods\\" and that he wished to avenge himself \\"against the One who rules above\\", should it surprise any of us then that the fruit of his philosophy is responsible for unspeakable torture, terribly unjust acts, and the murder of about 100 million people worldwide? Should any thinking person be mystified by the obvious unfeasibility of Marx's secular Communism/Socialism wherever it has been tried, and by the destruction and unhappiness it inevitably leads to for the people it proposes to benefit?WAS KARL MARX A SATANIST? By Richard Wurmbrand is just a small, 84 page booklet, but it contains lots of food for thought. If I was part of a jury given the responsibility to officially answer this question, in all honesty, I could not say that Wurmbrand's booklet proves its contention beyond all reasonable doubt. Wurmbrand essentially concedes this point when he writes, \\"I am conscious that the evidence which I give here is only circumstantial ..... I do not claim to have provided undisputable proof that Marx was a member of a sect of devil-worshippers, but I believe that there are sufficient leads to imply this. There are certainly enough leads to infer satanic influence upon his life and teachings ..... The sins of Marxism, like those of Nazism, surpass the ordinary. They are satanic.\\" With that I wholeheartedly concur.For the student such as myself, interested in the study of secret occult societies, there are a number of little \\"dots\\" provided in Wurmbrand's booklet that aid in seeing \\"the big picture\\" when one is connecting those dots. For instance, there's Karl's association with Moses Hess, whose family name appears in any detailed study of the Illuminati, and Karl's own Son-In-Law, Edward Aveling, friend of luciferian Annie Besant, and a leading personality in her luciferian Theosophy organization.On page 67, Wurmbrand makes the extremely intriguing supposition: \\"Communists have the habit of creating front-organizations. [The above text] suggests the probability that Communist movements are themselves front-organizations for occult satanism. This would also explain why all the political, economical, cultural, and military weapons used against Communism have proved so inefficient. The means to fight satanism are spiritual, not carnal...\\"I've given this book 3 stars only because of its cursory examination of a topic worthy of rigorous, scholarly study, and because it is not ultimately able to conclusively prove what it proposes. But anyone interested in this idea will find WAS KARL MARX A SATANIST? well worth reading and considering.On February 27, 1852, Karl Marx wrote to his comrade in evil, Friedrich Engels, about an inheritance he would come into if his wife's ill uncle passed away: \\"If the dog dies, I would be out of mischief.\\" On March 2nd, Engels replied, \\"I congratulate you for the sickness of the hinderer of an inheritance, and I hope that the catastrophe will happen now.\\" As bad luck for Marx would have it, the old man recovered and did not depart for a better world until 1855. But on March 8th of that year, Marx wrote again to Engels, expressing his glee: \\"A very happy event. Yesterday we were told about the death of the 90-year-old uncle of my wife. My wife will receive some 100 Lst; even more if the old dog has not left a part of his money to the lady who administered his house.\\"These are the two great \\"humanitarians\\" who gave this world the joys of Communism/Socialism. I'll say this much: If Karl Marx was NOT a satanist, he certainly missed his second calling. (God called him first - as God calls to each of us first - but we KNOW Marx wasn't listening to THAT Voice!)"},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"\\"The good of the workers was only a pretense. Where proletarians do not fight for Socialist ideals, Marxists will exploit racial differences or the so-called generation gap. The main thing is, religion must be destroyed.\\"_Marx and Satan_ by Richard Wurmbrand is a small book that advances the theory that Karl Marx was a member of a Satanic cult. To this affect, Wurmbrand, a Lutheran pastor who had been imprisoned by Communist authorities in Romania, cites many examples of Marx's poetry and personal writings. He also delves into the backgrounds of other members of the early communist/socialist movements, notably Frederick Engels and Moses Hess. Marx was born a Jew, however he was baptized at age seven for his family's business reasons. It appears that Marx may have been devout in his early years, but he later turned against Christianity with a vengeance. Marx's poetry contains references to overthrowing God and having himself [Marx] reign in His stead. Despite his current reputation in liberal academia as a champion of the rights of the poor, Marx made many disparaging comments about the poor and unenlightened. Despite his pretenses as being a champion of the exploited classes, the poor have generally in history been the ones least likely to change their \\"primitive\\" worldview in the face of drastic social change. Most of those committed to Communist/Marxist ideology in America are those from well-educated, upwardly mobile types who think they are \\"enlightened\\" about humanity's true condition. Marx called the Slavs and Russians of Eastern Europe scum and reactionary people. Curiously, he polemicizes against his own people the Jews, characterizing them as supporters of tyrants and as capitalist exploiters. The biggest issue that liberals (who are basically \\"softcore Marxists\\" that use subtle propaganda rather than open revolutionary violence) have with the world is the influence that traditional religion, in particular, Christianity, wields. This means the belief that mankind is not merely the product of material (i.e. economic, evolutionary, sexual, biological, etc.) drives, but rather the product of a reflected divine nature. Wurmbrand speculates that Marx may in fact have been a Satanic high priest. It makes sense that a Satanic cult would use classical Marxism as a front to achieve its ends in destroying the worship of Christ. Communism, as articulated in Marx and Engles' _Communist Manifesto_, states that human society is the product of competition between various classes of economic status. Marx revels in that the bourgeoisie businessmen and merchants destroyed Europe's old feudal structure, but that current setup would be violently overthrown by the proletariat, the common masses of humanity. His fellow revolutionary and propagandist #1 is the mysterious Robin Goodfellow, who is the spirit of revolution and Shakespeare's \\"knavish spirit that misleads nightwanderers, laughing at their harm.\\" Marx's demands for radical social revolution have been institutionalized in the government, academia, and even in many churches today, furthering the humanist New World Order based on the Luciferian principle of autonomy and rebellion against the Divine Order. Satanism reverses opposites and tries to turn black into white, right into wrong. Marxism/Communism is not about helping the poor achieve economic equity (\\"the poor you will have with you always\\"), but about Satanic rebellion and the destruction of Christ's Church.There are some problems with _Marx and Satan_. One glaring irregularity is Wurmbrand's statement that the Satanic cult is \\"older than Christianity.\\" Christianity is just a more recent name for the worship of He Who Is, rather than Satanism, the worship of transgression and rebellion. He is also off when he supports Theodore Herzel's Zionism. On a positive note, _Marx and Satan_ is not written in a spiteful manner towards its subjects, but rather with an attitude of compassion and repentance.Also recommended about the unusual beliefs of the founders of socialism: _Moses Hess: Prophet of Communism and Zionism_ by Avineri."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"I wish to avenge myself against the One who rules above . . .- Karl Marx._Marx & Satan_, published in 1986 by Living Sacrifice Book Company, written by Rev. Richard Wurmbrand is a fascinating look into the secret life of Karl Marx and the communist revolutionaries he helped inspire showing their Satanic influence. Richard Wurmbrand (1909 - 2001) was a Romanian Evangelical Christian minister who was brutally captured and tortured by communists. As such he had first-hand experience with the atrocities of the communist menace and devoted much of his life to researching the evils of communism. He founded Jesus to the Communist World (renamed Voice of the Martyrs) and was active in helping Christians who suffered at the hands of communists and Marxists. This book is unique in that it makes direct allegations concerning the person of Karl Marx. As is apparent to all those who have studied Marx, he is not only a hater of religion and Christ but also a hater of humanity itself and a promoter of destruction. Marxists have claimed that Marx was in fact an atheist and denied the existence of God. However, this book seems to indicate that Marx was actually a Satanist and involved in Satanic rituals and that communism itself constitutes a \\"Satanic cult\\". It should be noted however that the distinction between atheism and Satanism becomes blurry because of the hatred of atheists for Christ and because of the fact that many public atheists are actually private Satanists.Wurmbrand begins his book by explaining how Marxist ideas have even infiltrated Christianity. Indeed, it is maintained by some that Marx sought to aid the exploited masses and that thus his teachings may be understood as fundamentally Christian. Many Christians and even clergy have also embraced Marxism and preached his teachings as a continuation of the teachings of Christ. However, Wurmbrand quickly shows that this is a Satanic conceit, that Marx had no intention of aiding the poor and oppressed but only sought destruction, and that in fact Marx very likely worshipped the Dark Lord, the very enemy of Christ himself. Wurmbrand notes that the Jew Marx began as a Christian believer as a young man. However, he quickly turned to hatred of God in his writings, although his life had largely been comfortable up until that point. Wurmbrand notes Marx's relationship to Bakunin as well as the role of the Satanist Church (in its diabolical attempts to imitate the Catholic mass through the black mass) in the life of Marx. Wurmbrand shows how Marx composed a drama entitled _Oulanem_ which had Satanic undertones and may have participated in the black mass. Wurmbrand also compares Marx to another diabolical individual hellbent on destruction, the Marquis de Sade, and notes the role of Marx's hatred for books (including his own books which he called \\"swinish books\\"). Wurmbrand then turns his attention to Satan in Marx's family, noting Marx's desire to \\"chase God from heaven\\" and the role of the thinking of Bakunin and Heine on Karl Marx. Wurmbrand also mentions Marx's devilish poetry and the role of Marx's Satanic thought among the thugs of the Soviet Union. Wurmbrand also mentions Marx's ravaged life, his hatred, and his money troubles. Following this, Wurmbrand turns his attention to the life of Engels (the co-author with Marx of _The Communist Manifesto_). Wurmbrand notes the fact that Engels too began as a Christian (and was eventually to repent of his evils). Wurmbrand however notes Engels counter-conversion and the role of Satanism. Following this, Wurmbrand makes mention of the fact that Marx hated entire nations, including the Jews, the Germans, and the English. Marx in fact was a virulent racist and frequently made hateful remarks about blacks and others in his writings. Following this, Wurmbrand makes mention of a revelation made by one of Marx's housemaids. This maid noted that Marx in fact was involved in spiritual practices and prayed alone in his room with lighted candles and a sort of tape measure around his forehead suggesting phylacteries used by Orthodox Jews. However, Wurmbrand will argue that such practices were actually Satanic in nature. Wurmbrand also makes mention of family letters, biographers testimonies, and the secrets behind Lenin's life. Following this, Wurmbrand explains how the Antichrist of Marxism is in fact a \\"cruel counterfeit\\" and attempts only to accomplish destruction with no true interest in aiding the poor, the working class, or the oppressed. Wurmbrand notes the role of Satanism in the words and deeds of such men as Bukharin, Stalin, Mao, Ceausescu, and Andropov. Wurmbrand also notes the Satanic cruelty of the Marxists and communists and their delight in torturing innocents and especially Christians. Wurmbrand also notes the practice of communists for engaging in Satanic rites and includes copies of Satanic inversions of the Lord's prayer used by communist thugs. Wurmbrand considers religious obscenities and Marxism as a church. Following this, Wurmbrand notes the influence of the thought of Charles Darwin on Karl Marx. Wurmbrand also notes the role of a false Zionism based on socialism and Jewish supremacism in the writings of Moses Hess, a fellow communist. Wurmbrand notes the penchant of communists for mocking the Lord such as by naming one of their organizations \\"Hell\\". Wurmbrand also relates this to the black magical practices of the Nazis. Following this, Wurmbrand makes note of the Satanist mass within Marxism as well as the Satanic (and Croweleyian) idea that \\"everything is permitted\\". Wurmbrand notes the role of a figure called Robin Goodfellow (a nickname for Lucifer) in Marxist writings. Wurmbrand also makes some remarks on Lenin's tomb. Wurmbrand ends by including a chapter on the reaction to this book as it originally appeared, both positive and negative from communist and Satanist circles. Wurmbrand finally asks the question: Marx of Christ? He shows the great gulf between the God-man Christ (the true proletarian hero) and the all-too-human Marx. He also considers the fact that while Marx remained unrepentant one can imagine him saying \\"Proletarians of the world, forgive me!\\" for his vile crimes against humanity and God. The book ends with an appendix explaining why a Christian cannot be a Marxist, showing the diabolical influence of Marxism on Christianity through such new movements as Liberation Theology (existing parasitically off the Roman Catholic Church), and attempts to infiltrate the Orthodox Churches as well.This book provides a gruesome account of the crimes of the Marxists and makes specific mention of the hatred and blasphemy of Christ. The book makes a profound case the Marx indeed dabbled in Satanism and that Marxian communism constitutes a \\"Satanic cult\\". While the author notes that the hands of capitalism are not clean, he does note the importance of maintaining a Christian and spiritual brotherhood with one's fellow man. One cannot serve both God and Mammon. While many of those who remain sympathetic to the diabolical Marx are likely to dismiss this as \\"right wing propaganda\\", it will certainly give them pause before expressing sympathy for such a profoundly hateful and anti-Christian man who unleashed the terrors of the Twentieth century upon the world."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"Was Karl Marx an active Satanist? This seemingly phantastic suggestion gets strong circumstantial evidence in Richard Wurmbrand's study. He reaches his conclusion by considering several facts. The young Karl Marx was a believing Christian, as his earliest writings demonstrate, but at an early stage his love for Christ, for some unknown reason, turned into hate, and his thinking is radically changed. In his youth Marx wrote poetry, and in his poems he starts revealing horrific thoughts. Filled with venom, they tell us about self-idolizing and dreams of destruction and usurpation of God. He writes about his vision to wander victorious through the ruins of the world, and through the streangth of his words feel equal with the creator. On the other hand, however, he knows that he will fail: &quot;I know it full well, my soul - once true to God - is chosen for hell&quot;. In one poem he confesses that he has bought a sword from the prince of darkness. This is significant, as the introduction rite to the Satanist order involves buying a sword from Satan, paying with one's soul. Other poems, too, contain allusions to Satanic rites, for instance one named Oulanem (a distortion of Immanuel). Marx' housekeeper told that her master was a pious man. He used to kneel on his bedroom and pray with black candles burning. Karl Marx' correspondence with his family members contain some strange details. He calls his son &quot;dear devil&quot; and is himself titled &quot;highpriest&quot; - an office that does not exist in any other religion than Satanism (except ancient Judaism, a religion that he rejected emphatically). His doughter has also told that he used to tell scaring fairy tales to his children, about people who sold their souls to the devil. Marx' appearance is also worth considering. Though having a beard was not uncommon in his age, it was by no means common to let it grow shaggy as he did. In the Satanist order of Joanna Woolcott, however, this was the praxis. Wurmbrand offers more arguments and their cumulative effect is, in my opinion, convincing. This side of Karl Marx has of course been suppressed, not least beacause those who are interested in him usually do not want to believe it. It is interesting to notice that when the Communist party of India decided to make a rebuttal of the book, all they came up to was a plead to judge Marxism on its own value and not to care about the religious views of its architect. (Of related interest is Gary North: Marx' Religion of Revolution)."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"This book dives right into something that is ignored by even most critics of Marx - his satanic roots.Marx, like Engels, both were involved in satanic teachings of &quot;the communist rabbi&quot; Moses Hess. He wrote a number of satanic poems. In fact, his doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;I hate all the gods.&quot; Marx was delving into satanism long before he knew anything about economics. He had no knowledge of the plight of the working man or &quot;proletariat&quot; at that time.One of the critics of this book says that it is just anti-semetic and rediculous. Interestingly, if you look at that same critic's other reviews, his other reviews are for the band T.S.O.L which is an L.A. &quot;death rock&quot; band which he favorably compares to early Christian Death. His other reviews are for the band &quot;Death Church&quot; (which he likes) and &quot;Jesuseater.&quot;It's pretty hard to take a guy like that serious in a review of a book about satanism and Marx.Anyway, this book sheds quite a bit of light on the topic of Marx's turn to satanism during his school years. Marx's poetry about desiring to destroy the world and take the place of the creator is downright haunting."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"Who was Karl Marx? Richard Wormbrand allows the reader to decide, in a thin but powerful volume replete with original source quotations and references. Reverend Wormbrand is not a \\"fanatic\\" or a \\"right-wing extremist\\" or an \\"anti-Semite\\" as other reviewers accuse. He is a Jew himself, who did convert to Christianity and was imprisoned and tortured for many years under the Communists in Rumania. The negative reviewers obviously have not actually read the book, which is humble, circumspect, and full of forgiveness for those who have been taken in by evil. This is the same Richard Wurmbrand who founded the organization that distributes the book, \\"Jesus, Friend of Terrorists\\" to offer a hand of love and forgiveness to the FARC guerillas in South America. So, if you are thinking that maybe Rush Limbaugh wrote this book to somehow discredit the left-leaning Democrats, you would be very wrong.The overwhelming evidence in the words of Marx himself is very clear--even if Marx was not a practicing Satanist, he was extremely familiar with Satanism, he wrote a Satanic play, he wrote Satanic poetry, and he was filled with hatred for mankind in general, and Christians in particular. Richard Wormbrand establishes this very easily, by using direct quotations from the writings and correspondence of Karl Marx. The biographers of Marx usually contend that he was baptized into Christianity at the age of 7 for \\"business reasons\\". His father, a Jew, was a lawyer--and presumably would get more business as a Christian. The truth is that we don't know if the senior Marx was a real convert or a convert for expediency. But it is certainly possible that sometime during his teen years, Karl felt that his father was a hypocrite. That might have led him to hate Christianity, and also to hate Judaism. We do know that Marx wrote some virulent anti-Semitic materials, which was curious considering his ethnicity. In any case, his rebellion against traditional religion might very well have led him to extremes. That makes the idea that he was, in fact, a Satanist seem rather plausible. But again, even if he did not truly believe in Satanism, his pride, venom, and hatred are evident from his own words. It is abundantly clear that he was less an \\"economic theorist\\" than he was an anarchist and anti-Christian zealot.The only disagreement I have with this book is that Richard Wormbrand seems to equate \\"extreme\\" evil (such as the tens of millions killed under Communist regimes) with evidence of Satanism. I personally believe that mankind can come up with some pretty extreme evil even without the black candles and bad poetry of Satanism."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"This really should be required reading here in America with our new administration! Scary?, yes! Necessary information?, Definitely!!! We have an admitted Marxist turned communist in the White House advising our president(B.O.)!

It is well done, its very shot and it covered the circumstantial and convincing evidence that Marx was not an atheists, but in fact was a satanists. There are some incredible quotes on the book from Marx that are a big indicator of his true self. The horrifying thing is he seemed to be a good Christian kid. Yes Christian even though from Jewish culture background, the family converted to Christianity. All of a sudden he switches up and starts writing blasphemies against God and talking about destroying and leading many to hell. Even more horrifying is not only his own trek to hell but the fact he has succeeded, millions were and are being dammed to hell for believing in his theories.Read this from Mark and Satan....\\"...something mysterious happened in his life: he became profoundly and passionately antireligious. A new Marx began to emerge.He writes in a poem, \\"I wish to avenge myself against the One who rules above.\\"~ So he was convinced that there is One above who rules, but was quarrelling with Him. Yet, the One above had done him no wrong. Marx belonged to a relatively well-to-do family. He had not faced hunger in his childhood. He was much better off than many fellow students. What produced such a terrible hatred for God? No personal motive is known. Was Karl Marx in this declaration only someone else's mouthpiece? We don't knowAt an age when most young men have beautiful dreams of doing good to others and preparing a career for themselves, the young Marx wrote the following lines in his poem \\"Invocation of One in Despair\\":So a god has snatched from me my all,In the curse and rack of destiny.All his worlds are gone beyond recall.Nothing but revenge is left to me.I shall build my throne high overhead,Cold, tremendous shall its summit be.For its bulwark - superstitious dread.For its marshal - blackest agony.Who looks on it with a healthy eye,Shall turn back, deathly pale and dumb,Clutched by blind and chill mortality,May his happiness prepare its tombMarx dreamt about ruining the world created by God. He said in another poem:Then I will be a~ a to walk triumphantly,Like a god, through the rains of their kingdom.Every word of mine is fire and action.My breast is equal to that of the Creator.The words \\"I shall build my throne high overhead\\" and the confession that from the one sitting on this throne will emanate only dread and agony remind us of Lucifer's proud boast, \\"I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God\\" (Isaiah 14:13).Perhaps it was no coincidence that Bakunin, who was for a time one of Marx's most intimate friends, wrote,One has to worship Marx in order to be loved by him. One has at least to fear him in order to be tolerated by him. Marx is extremely proud, up to dirt and madness.\\"It seems like Marx took on the persona of Satan.Ask any marxists or socialists you know if they know these words from MarxThe following quotation is taken from Marx's poem \\"On Hegel\\":\\"Words I teach all mixed up into a devilish muddle.Thus, anyone may think just what he chooses to think.\\"Here also are words from another epigram on Hegel:\\"Because I discovered the highest,And because I found the deepest through meditation,I am great like a God;I clothe myself in darkness like Him.\\"In his poem \\"The Pale Maiden,\\" he writes:\\"Thus heaven I've forfeited,I know it full well.My soul, once true to God,Is chosen for hell.\\"And its not only Marx seems like all his socialist friends were involved in satanism in some way and then those who followed Marx such as the USSR were one gigantic satanic system.Marx loved the quote from Faust that \\"everything is worth DESTROYING.\\" And lets face it, he did an incredible job for his master satan. over 100,000,000 murdered in China, over 60,000,000 in Russia all in his name. And its even more insidious, Marxism has slithered its way into many churches, political parties, and is the dominant belief system of most collage professors, unions etc., For example Liberation Theology is part of marxism.Look at how marxism has infiltrated the environmental movement. Hear is a quote \\"Environmentalists actively seeking the destruction of civilization may seem like characters out of a Tom Clancy Thriller. But in an interview posted on the left-wing site Alternet, three environmentalists called for the end of civilization, as we know it, for the elimination of agriculture, and for attacks on the infrastructure holding civilization together. That article's headline asked, \\"Do we need a militant movement to save the planet (and ourselves)?\\"Hear is another quote \\"Derrick Jensen, Lierre Keith, and Aric McBay, leaders of a radical environmental movement known as Deep Green Resistance, argued that in order to save the planet industrial civilization must be destroyed, and that humanity must return to living the primitive lifestyles found in indigenous cultures. To accomplish these goals, McBay called for people to \\"break down the structures that are destroying the planet.\\"\\"Sounds like Marx don't they??Socialism/marxism sounds so good until you realize there prime goal is to reduce human population down to so called manageable levels.

Wells, who between 1905 and 1940 who lied about what he had seen in Stalin's Russia and when questioned by a Western journalist (pure evil) about the forced starvations in Ukraine at heart he was a social engineer. In his best-selling books such as Anticipations and A Modern Utopia Wells wrote that he believed the world would collapse; from this collapse a new order should and would emerge. \\"People throughout the world whose minds were adapted to the big-scale conditions of the new time,\\" he wrote. \\"A naturally and informally organized educated class, an unprecedented sort of people.\\" A strict social order would be formed. At the bottom of it was the base.These were \\"people who had given evidence of a strong anti-social disposition,\\" including \\"the black, the brown, the swarthy, the yellow.\\" Christians would also \\"have to go,\\" as well as the handicapped. Wells devoted entire pamphlets to the need of \\"preventing the birth, preventing the procreation or preventing the existence\\" of the mentally and physically handicapped. \\"This thing, this euthanasia of the weak and the sensual is possible. I have little or no doubt that in the future it will be planned and achieved.\\"He also said \\"The people of Africa and Asia, he said, simply could never find a place in a modern world controlled by science. Better to do away with the lot.\\" Population would be rigidly controlled, with forced abortion for those who were not of the right class and race. Religion would be banned, children would be raised in communes. The old and the ill would, naturally, have to be done away with and doctors would be given the authority to decide who had a right to live, who had a duty to die. (a common liberal theme).The American socialist Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood and is still a feminist and liberal icon (and try and you will be hard pressed to find her bad quotes, goggle etc., try to lead you searches astray). Black people and immigrants in general, were \\"human weeds\\" and \\"reckless breeders,\\" \\"spawning human beings who never should have been born.\\" She believed in the sterilization of the mentally ill, in \\"racial purification\\" and the elimination of those she labelled the \\"feeble-minded.\\" She was aware, however, that her racism might cause a few problems and warned that, \\"we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population\\"because it might provoke \\"their more rebellious members.\\" A Life long liberal who spoke at least 13 times at KKK meetings.And back to George Bernard Shaw who was and is one of the early founders of the socialist Fabian Society. This was a group working for british socialism. In fact they supported nazis fascists and communists. Shaw said that (I am quoting from memory), If you are productive we (the elite rulers) will take care of you, we will give you food shelter, medical, care, etc., but when you stop being productive, we will put you to death in a humane way.So socialism (progressivism etc,) can sound good on the surface look deep, under it lies satan.

Here, Wurmbrand suggests that Marx, the founder of modern Communism, converted from Christianity to Satanism at a young age and then used Communism as a tool to spread hatred and destruction.Some of the facts in this matter appear to be beyond reasonable question, both from historical record and Marx's own writings. Obviously Marx hated God vehemently, and his writings do give the impression of belief rather than atheism. Wurmbrand suggests, based on Marx's own writings, that Marx was a hater rather than a lover of humanity (and that Marx's supposed love for the proletariat was a fiction created by the Communists), and all things considered that seems quite reasonable. But to say that Marx's primary goal was to promote Satanism, as Wurmbrand suggests, moves squarely into the realm of speculation (and Wurmbrand has, at least, the good grace to acknowledge that much of what he asserts is circumstantial, although he seems quite sure of his evidence).Beyond the basics of Marx's upbringing, writings, and relationships with other Communist fathers like Engels, Wurmbrand is all over the place with poor reasoning, wanton speculation, and straw man arguments: Karl Marx turned to Satanism and wanted to use it to destroy humanity because nobody appreciated his poetry. Darwin is to blame for the millions of murders committed by the Communists. Led Zeppelin backmasked satanic lyrics into \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" Ludicrous assertions like these make Wurmbrand look foolish.It doesn't help that Wurmbrand seems to have no sense of irony or metaphor when he interprets the writings of others. Much of what he analyzes is poetry, and yet he takes every line about demons and such to be disturbingly literal. His inability to apply even the most basic critical reading skills neuters a number of his arguments.It's important to consider that based on Wurmbrand's own horrific experiences with the Communists, he's about as anti-Communism as they come, and it's somewhat understandable that he swings too far the other way (for more information, see Wurmbrand's superior work, Tortured for Christ).

Marx was against the middle class, the small shop keepers, who he called, \\"bourgeois\\". In the story where Christ throws a tantrum in the temple, he kicks out these middle class \\"bourgeois\\" calling them \\"thieves\\". It's only logical to think that some of this money was going to the church they were in because they were selling sacrificial animals in accordance with Judeo-Christianity, so Christ was most likely just making a false, Orwellian accusation that these people were robbing the \\"proles\\", just like his fellow jew Karl Marx does in the Communist Manifesto-The story of the woman who gave all she had shows that Jesus wants you to give EVERYTHING to the church, even at the cost of bankruptcy, turning yourself into a \\"prole\\".

Not only that, they *literally* had a direct connection to the Devil. The author, Richard Wurmbrand, is an evangelical preacher from Romania, who at one time was imprisoned by the Communist regime for his religious convictions. His book is relatively well known (I heard about Wurmbrand already 25 years ago). If millions of people can believe in Hal Lindsey or \\"Left Behind\\", why not claim that Marx was literally in league with Satan? Christian fundamentalists believe in even stranger things than this!Wurmbrand tries to make as much as possible out of Marx' youthful poetry, written long before Marx became a Marxist. Apparently, young Karl wanted to write a drama similar to Goethe's \\"Faust\\". Faust, of course, sells his soul to Mephistopheles or Satan. Hence, there is a \\"Satanic\\" streak in Marx' poetry. Since Marx had just become an atheist, he also makes a provocative connection between his unbelief and the \\"Satanism\\" of Oulanem, the main character of the intended drama.And this proves...what? Not much, expect that Marx' poetry is quite good! \\"Oulanem\\" could have become interesting, LOL.At several points, Wurmbrand distorts the history of the Marxist movement to prove his point. Thus, he quotes Bakunin as proof of the Satanic nature of Marxism. But Bakunin was an anarchist. Both he and his followers were eventually expelled from the First International by Marx! This is common knowledge, but perhaps not to Christian fundamentalists? At another point, Wurmbrand claims that Marx really supported slavery in the United States! In reality, Marx supported the Union during the Civil War. The Marx quote is either bogus or taken out of context.This brings me to the next problem with \\"Marx and Satan\\": its strange sources. Very often, the author makes sensational claims without backing them up. Thus, he claims that Stalin originally called himself \\"Satanashvili\\" in honour of the Devil. Source? None. At another point, Wurmbrand claims that the Communist leaders in Moscow carry out rituals at Satanic altars. This truly remarkable statement is taken from...a Russian Orthodox &eacute;migr&eacute; magazine in San Fransisco! The poetry of young Marx is at least authentic. It goes downhill from there, a real descensus.Even more disturbingly, Wurmbrand (who seems to be pro-Israeli) naively retells what seems to be anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. A rumour that Marx was a pious Jew praying in secret with phylacteries, is transformed into the claim that he was actually worshipping Satan. Good old Moses Hess is depicted as the real inspiration behind Marx' and Engels' Communism and break with Christianity. Moses Hess was both a Communist, a Zionist Jew, and a Freemason. (Yes, really!) Small wonder anti-Semites gleefully point out that Hess co-operated with Marx and Engels in the First International... The entire idea that Communism is Satanic and has something in common with Jews is common in Eastern Europe and Russia. Since Wurmbrand was a Romanian of Jewish descent, one wonders why he didn't recognize the \\"code words\\"?In sum, \\"Marx and Satan\\" is an unreliable piece of conspiracy literature. It does have that typical \\"East European feel\\" of bizarre folk superstition, but it also squares rather well with the fundamentalist milieu in the United States. Of course, I didn't expect anything else. I bought this book just for the fun of it, to peek into the mind of the most philistine of anti-Communists. And no, I'm not a Communist. Besides, if the Devil really exists, a much safer bet would be to work through \\"Christian\\" fundamentalism...

Russia has a vested interest in keeping many of Marx's writings unknown--they would sound bizzare to people unaware of the demonic connection or those naive enough to buy into the class struggle argument.Anatole France, the renowned French communist writer, was not only a Satan worshipper but had a special chair dedicated to presiding over Satanist rituals. It had horned armrests and legs covered in goat fur. This unusual chair was exhibited in Paris, but brought to Moscow. Oddly, it's not exhibited by the Russians. However, black magic rites are still practiced at Marx's tomb so it's not difficult to imagine that France's chair is still used today.Hess taught Marx that socialism is inseparable from globalism. The communists have traditionally used race and class struggle as a crutch and are undoubtedly proud of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton's work to promote revolution for revolution's sake in the US.(If Jackson and Sharpton were truly interested in helping their brothers and sisters around the globe they'd speak out against the slavery and genocide currently taking place in African nations.)Peter Verhovensky is quoted as saying, \\"We are already terribly powerful . . .

They do not and cannot.Large corporations compete, undercut, and threaten one another's marketshares every day.As one of many proofs, just look at the number ofinter-corporate law suits.Marxism is based on conflict between \\"social classes.\\" But social classes do not exist at all. This is not to say that there are not richer folk and poorer folk all about.It only means that all the richer folk share no collective common interests, and the same is true for all the poorer folk.Marxists claim that people's ideas and ideals are dictated by propertyrelations.They are wrong.\\""},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"While I'm not 100% convinced that Marx was a Satanist, this book has some great quotes and letters proving what an evil person Marx was. I'm also pretty sure that he was in some sort of underground society, maybe not Satanism, like Freemasonry that guides the way the world goes. Nothing else would really explain his enduring popularity and his ideas being continually pushed to the fore front of our culture and education even after all these years, and all the proven horror and failure that is Communism.Any economic system based on government force and coercion instead of freedom of choice is bound to bring on gross human rights violations as has been seen where ever Marxism has been applied. It really worries me that this is still such a popular philosophy being force fed to our high school and college students."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"Richard Wurmbrand has written an outstanding account examining Karl Marx as the individual, appending the fairly well established view of the traditionalist historians that Marx was the founding father of Communism. Their position is that this previously unknown young man suddenly rose out of obscurity to write the Communist Manifesto and thereby launched the Communist movement. Yet, throughout his life Marx was living off the income provided by Frederick Engels' share of the cotton mills in Lancashire, England. It is strange that Marx, the \\"champion of the oppressed and the downtrodden workers\\", as traditionalist historians dub him, would spend nearly all his adult life living off the profits acquired from a capitalistic industry. If Marx had been true and consistent to his principles, he would have rejected this money and lived by earnings of his own labors. Wurmbrand shows that in his youth Marx was a believer in God. However, while at the university, Marx has undergone a transformation from a believer to an unbeliever who wrote that he wished to avenge himself \\"against the One who rules above\\". Wurmbrand contends that this change in Marx's basic belief came after he joined a secret Satanist sect. As evidence of his membership, Marx grew a heavy beard and let his hair long - the outward signs characteristic of the disciples of Joana Southcott, a Satanic priestess at the time. Marx also regularly participated in occult practices and habits. Marx's conversion to a rebel against God was nearly complete as Marx called Christianity \\"one of the most immoral of religions\\". His conversion became even more evident when Marx showed his contempt for the traditional view of family life. Marx had an affair with his maid and allowed two of his six children to starve to death, because his contempt for industrious labor often failed to provide his family's sustenance. Two of his other children later committed suicide, perhaps because of their wretched existence as children. Such a behavior exposes him as a hater of God, and therefore, a hater of God's creatures. Wurmbrand examines Marx's poetry, correspondence, and biographical accounts building a convincing case for Marx's Satanic preferences. In one such correspondence, Marx has blasphemously stated that \\"the idea of God is the keynote of a perverted civilization. It must be destroyed.\\""},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"An outstanding book by Pastor Richard Wurmbrand. From the back cover \\"...not to be duped by marxism's benevolent disguise as a mere political or economic theory.\\"This information about Marx's beginning and life, (especially his spiritual beliefs) are very important to know for those who want to know the truth.Pastor Wurmbrand was imprisoned and suffered for 14 years in communist prisons in Europe. His first hand accounts of what he witnessed and endured are incredible. I highly recommend all his books."},{"Title":"Was Karl Marx a satanist?","review":"Wurmbrand's short and very readable book about the spiritual tendencies of the founder of communism is both revealing relative to the subject, Karl Marx, and to the author himself. We all have our perspectives, which necessarily color our presentations. And Wurmbrand's is that of a man raised as a Jew who converted to Christianity later in life. In this, he shares a certain similarity with many whose conversion may seem to be something rather less than complete. This factor manifests itself in his quite interesting treatment of Moses Hess, whom the author credits with planting the seeds of both communism and what he describes as an ungodly form of zionism. To this, the authentic Christian must ask, \\"Is there a godly form of zionism?\\" The answer is, of course, no!This notwithstanding, Wurmbrand's book is interesting, important, and insightful. We only wish that it could have been a bit more candid with regard to his depiction of Hess, who argued that both the race and the class struggles would be dispositive of mankind's future. Hess saw the race struggle manifested in zionism and the class struggle in communism. In any case, Wurmbrand perceived Marx as a tortured and spiritually conflicted man, who has done ever so much more harm than good. And to his everlasting credit, Wurmbrand quite correctly holds that the future hope for this fallen world is embodied in the love of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Give this book a read with an open heart and an open mind and be enriched."},{"Title":"Llewellyn's New A to Z Horoscope Maker and Interpreter: A Comprehensive Self-Study Course","review":"This book is a must have for the beginner and expert.Absolutely the most wonderful astrology book ever andone of the first of it's time.The updates are greatas well."},{"Title":"Llewellyn's New A to Z Horoscope Maker and Interpreter: A Comprehensive Self-Study Course","review":"I can not say enough about this wonderful book.

It's also useful for working newspaper folks to use as a reference book, to remind themselves, for instance, to include all the necessary components for a review of specific sorts of artistic endeavors.Dr. Titchener read aloud much student work in the class I took, and he pulled no punches in evaluating the results. There was one unfortunate woman who could not capably put one word in front of another, yet she bubbled constantly about what a great writer she intended to be, all the books and plays and articles she was going to author. Dr. Titchener one day pronounced her work &quot;trite&quot; (he was absolutely correct), and it was extremely amusing to see the woman's cluelessly dismissive reaction, her declaration that he was &quot;an idiot.&quot;About three-fourths of the way into the semester, Dr. Titchener had an uncommon experience in his own life, and he wrote a short feature about it, which he read to the class. The response was brutal; students viciously ripped the piece up one page and down the other, and poor Dr. Titchener just sat there absorbing it all... sorta like body blows in a boxing match. He was the only college professor I ever encountered who had the guts to expose himself to an open-forum critique from his students, and you've really got to admire someone who has the fortitude to do that."},{"Title":"Reviewing the Arts (Lea's Communication)","review":"I took a class called \\"Reviewing the Arts\\" and this was our textbook, heavily supplemented by actual reviews from major newspapers. The book covers art, theater, music and the like.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This book will take a person up to intermediate and give them a strong grounding in the blues. I would imagine that serious students would not allow a book to be their sole source of education, and so, if the pupil improvises, learns lines, jams etc, this book should help them bind it all together. By the time the student has finished this book he or she should be pretty good.Most of all this book has melodic pieces that are enjoyable to play. Drudgery is kept to a minimum.That said, most books have similar imformation; the blues is well documented and a lot of us know how to play it. What separates one book from another is whether its content encourages practise and advancement.This book does because the pieces are real blues, fun to play and technically relevantThe instructions are clear and easy to understand.I would buy this one again if it got lost or destroyed."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This book is recommended for intermediate-level pianists. I have some previous experience self-learning the piano, and I also have some knowledge of how to read music. But I am far from what I would consider to be intermediate-level pianist. I took a chance and bought this book anyway, and I'm really glad I did. I find the beginning lessons to be totally accessible to my skill level as basically a raw beginner.Now in saying this I don't mean that I can just sit down and play these pieces fluently. But they are certainly within reach with practice. In other words, they are pieces that I can actually play, but not smoothly without much practice. And this is mostly due to finger training and getting a feel for what Tim Richards calls \\"On-Off\\" rhythm timing. So I'm really pretty much starting from scratch here, yet I'm finding these beginning lessons in the Triads section of the book to be quite accessible.I really like the way he has his lessons laid out complete with many comments, tips, and special assignments to expand upon using improvisational techniques.So even as basically a raw beginner I find the book to be very accessible and useful. I'll be in the very early chapters for quite some time to come, so I can't comment on the more advance parts of the book. But for me, even just these early chapters are well worth the price. It's a super fantastic book, just filled to the brim with advice, explanations, assignments, and comments on every page. No wasted space in this book.Like some others have said, Just buy it. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I bought this book along with his Jazz book, and now I am thinking about buying his Latin Piano book as well. This is the best investment I've made for studying music. These books will surely keep me busy. You can enjoy playing the pieces as written but he also encourages you to improvise right from the first lesson and leads you step by step how to do so. Just about every page is a new piece to learn, instead of just boring scales. It's all very practical and enjoyable, and never boring."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This book has opened up a whole new word of piano playing for me. Grew up classically trained 15 years. Played Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin for my senior recital years ago. Just love how each piece builds on each other and you can put several of these pieces together to play a nice improvisional piece. Starts off simple and easy to play, but progresses to more difficult pieces rhythmically and with fingering, but keep practicing. Try not to skip because the pieces help build your skills to play blues. You'll sound like a pro. Bought a bunch of the other blues books from Amazon, but ended up returning them. This one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This incredible book has given me so much pleasure, excitement and renewed zest for playing the piano that I felt owed Tim Richards, and other would-be blues piano players out there, a review. After years of classical piano lessons and doing exams at school (over 40 years ago!), I dropped playing for decades whilst I worked. Now retired, I decided I wanted to build on the simple boogie I had learned from a friend at school. I thrashed around for a while with a few books which did nothing for me. Tim Richards' book gave me a framework and introduction to the blues which just struck the right chord (sorry). I have spent two years working through the book and am now devastated that I have come to the end....(Fortunately he has written two books on Jazz Piano which I will now work with.)I cannot recommend this book enough. For someone like me who was never strong at sight reading but needs to hear a piece before I play it, this book is ideal. The CD inspires and guides and the book progressively introduces simple blues theory. Tim gives simple explanations of the structure of each piece and suggests exercises in improvisation. I agree with one reviewer that I would have liked to hear more of Tim's improvisations, but I have turned to blues CDs and You Tube to be inspired for some of the more standard pieces e.g. Pine Tops Boogie and How Long Blues. The additional of beauty of working with this book (as opposed to a teacher) is that you can work at your own pace.I have a feeling that I will be revisiting the book many times and building on my favourite pieces. Sections in the back on which pieces can \\"borrow\\" from each other and a library of riffs will always be useful.Thank you so much, Tim. You given a 56 year old woman hours of musical fun and pleasure!"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This book fills the need for a good blues piano book.

I have been playing for 4 years and it is difficult for me. A great book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"Takes you into blues-specific stuff, especially rythmically, almost from the start. Fats Domino pops up in about lesson three or so, and you're doing triplets and a catchy left hand. And the author goes over the exact nature of triplet \\"feel\\" in several practice pieces. That rythm is very central to blues, and the author wants you to get it right. Also, my level of playing is intermediate, so I am learning from things like the suggested practice routine for chord inversions. Been practicing those for years, but this guy tells you a fingering and wants you to stick to it...which makes sense and is new to me. I've been buying blues books for years and this feels like the right one."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I have only just started into this book, but find it an excellent and informative product, by following every instruction step by step and constant practice, you can easily achieve the next playing level you desire, a good layout and quality product"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"..it's how to play the piano, period.I can't tell you how gratifying this book is. I played piano as a kid and adolescent, and was quite good at memorizing the notes and regurgitating them, but I never understood what I was doing, and that lack of understanding is what ultimately impeded my growth. How I wish I'd had this book!!I bought this book in September, and now it's June and I'm still working on the first chapter. Not that it's hard, but it's thorough. You're not just learning to play notes on a page, but you are learning how to understand and use those notes. Richards has great musical taste and shows you deceptively simple but really fun songs which you then learn to improvise upon. Now that I understand each of the songs in the first chapter (by understand, I mean, I can tell you note for note what is happening as far as chord changes, minor notes, etc.), I am mixing and matching top and bottom hands from each of the songs, transposing the songs into the 4 keys taught in the first chapter, and best of all, improvising! My husband and I can finally jam!! Hooray!!!!Each chapter builds upon the last. In the first chapter I have learned the basic blues progression, how to transpose among 4 keys, minor thirds and fifths, some great bottom hand accompaniments, and good ideas as to how to resolve phrases and songs. There is an endless amount of learning to be gotten from this book. Who needs a live instructor for $100/hour when you have Tim Richards for years for $25??If you are already comfortable with the basic music theory that underlies the blues, and already pretty adept at playing the piano, this might be too easy. I also bought Hal Leonard's Blues Piano, which assumes that you already have the aforementioned skills. It was too hard for me, however, I think I'll graduate to that book in a couple years. My husband, who is great at the blues guitar, is using it to find some cool phrases he can use in his improvisation.Bottom line: Best purchase I've ever made, in terms of happiness per dollar, ever. period."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I purchased Tim's other book \\"Exploring Jazz Piano Vol. 1\\" a few months ago. While that book is excellent, it assumes you understand a bit of Jazz so as an adult beginner studying classical piano that book is a bit over my head. So for the time being I placed the Exploring Jazz Piano book on my shelf and instead started with book \\"Improvising Blues Piano\\" which is supposed to be a \\"pre-requisite\\".The \\"Improvising Blues Piano\\" book really starts from scratch and assumes you know nothing about Blues or Jazz. There are 72 sections each starts with a tune followed by assignments then theory. Most of the sections also contains a bit of Blues history with pictures. It is suitable for self-study and supposed to be studied page by page.I have not yet finished the book which supposedly would take some time but could feel the book has put me on the right track. One thing I wish Tim would have done was to include sample improvisations in the CD. But overall this is an excellent book, actually this is the first book on Blues/Jazz that I can really use for self-study and I have several."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I'm new piano and have always loved the blues, so had been looking for some material to get me headed in the right direction and gain some solid footing.I purchased \\"Blues Piano\\", by Mark Harrison, as some other reviewers. That book contains a wealth of information, but left me feeling overwhelmed and felt it was lacking in the fundimental guidance I needed. The examples on the CD that came with it sounded like they were MIDI and lacking, offering little inspiration. For example, it presents all the scales and tells you that you should have a goal to learn all the scales, but doesn't really provide a program for learning these. The author just seems to fail to connect with me and to present material with good basic explanations, and tie these to the exercises he provides in a straightforward way.In contrast, and getting back to the real review at hand, I feel that \\"Improvising Blues Piano\\" is giving me the step by step instruction I need, with focused exercises to help me absorb the material. As a beginner keyboardist, I feel that the exercises are challenging enough to move you forward, yet not so challenging as to be a source of discouragement. I was extremely anxious to receive this book and was not at all disappointed with it once I was able to crack its cover and begin using it. I also feel that Tim Richards provides enough examples and alternatives, with a good measure of encouragment, to lead one toward improvisation... finding one's own unique song. I don't thing you would be disappointed if you decided to purchase this book and hope it will serve you well if you decide to own it!"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"Why is this book so good? Unlike most books, Richards takes the time to explain why each of the example pieces are important, and what you should pay extra attention to. He also really holds your hand in the improvisation practices by suggesting notes (and explaining why the suggested notes were suggested). Also very good is the use of different keys in the pieces. Some blues books tend to stick to C or G, but in this book the keys are varied (and Richards suggests going back through the pieces in other keys, which is a very good idea).My only wish is that Richards makes a sequel to this book. This does not mean that this book isn't completely jammed with material, or is too easy: no on both accounts. I found myself wanting to learn more of the advanced \\"cliche's\\" which make Blues sound like the Blues. Nonetheless, this book is the best there is on the market for blues or improvisation instruction."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"My background: 2 years of classical piano starting at the age of 10. I'm 60 now. When my 8 year old daughter took up the piano, it brought back memories. The one I remember is my piano teacher telling me I could only play music exactly the way it was written. That's when I lost interest in the piano.A year ago I decided to do what I always should have done: learn to improvise. This book took me there. I can't say enough good things about it. But actions speak louder than words. I actually sound like I can play the blues. And the best part is improvising.Lately I saw a video of Jerry Lee Lewis playing Great Balls of Fire. Hey, why not. Turns out, if you can play the blues, you can play Rock and Roll. As Jerry Lee says, What a thrill!I'm trying not to get sidetracked because I want to finish this great book, which will take a year or so, I think.Look, if you're already an afficionado, you don't need this book.

I know it will take a long time to work through the whole book but the later tunes are fun to listen to even if I never get there. The approach is to get the basics down and then suggest ways to improvise. I bought a few blues piano books a while back and this is miles above the others. It works well for me."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I have never seen a blues book so well written and supported with such a great CD when it comes to teaching the blues.

This book feels like a bunch of 3x5 cards grouped into chapters, a confusing arrangement. Richards doesn't address many basic blues piano techniques and never discusses soloing. The last part of the book wanders into jazz territory. I would recommend the book to jazz students, but not blues or rock fans.The \\"lessons\\" are a piece of sheet music (played on the CD) followed by bulleted points on parts of the piece and assignments for working on the piece. Frequently, the key and corresponding scale are reviewed before the piece, which seemed silly to me.I got so frustrated by the irrational organzation, I finally just put on the CD and listened for any phrase or riff that caught my ear, and referred to the book to find out how it is played. The CD is only piano, no band."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"If you can play a little piano say grade 2 or 3 and like the blues you will get a lot out of this book. Beautifully presented with pictures of the masters and different types of blues, takes a slow and easy progression from very basic triads to simple but really terrific sounding stuff to the more complex stuff. He encourges you to experiment and improvise and truely teaches ways to do this. Happily for my nieghbours I have headphones on my piano! CD has all the music on it with some different versions in triplet feel etc. Richards is a performer and teaches at a London music college. Certainly helped me.

I play drums in a blues band, and I've had some music theory for keyboard percussion, so I'm not a total musical-novice. I tried out some other books (Mark Harrison's \\"Blues Piano: Hal Leonard Keyboard Style Series\\", but it's still a little over my head, perhaps in a year or so it'll be good for me. Also \\"David Bennett Cohen Teaches Blues Piano: A Hands-On Course in Traditional Blues Piano\\", but it really didn't light my fire either, and if I recall correctly, didn't have finger markings which I still find helpful.) This book pulls it all together for me: some blues music theory, some blues history, clearly-marked \\"assignments\\", a CD included, (a spiral binding that lays flat on the stand!) ... I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I've bought several other blues piano books over the years, and in my opinion this one outclasses them all. The pieces sound great, and the pacing of the material is fantastic. The book does a great job of slowly introducing the idea of improvisation, by encouraging mixing and matching ideas from the different pieces. It also goes into ideas like horizontal and vertical improvisation without making it too intimidating, and introduces some blues &quot;cliche&quot; endings and turnarounds. It covers many different styles from barrelhouse to stride to jazz blues.The included CD lets you know how this stuff is really supposed to sound, and it's got a full &quot;Recommended Listening&quot; in an appendix if you want to explore further.

The example on the CD are also greatIf at first looks it seems expensive you will see that it is worth every penny"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"This is, by far, the best blues piano book out there. Mark Harrison's book is also good, but more as a quick guide for those who already have some chops and some understanding of theory.Richards' book is a full course in Blues theory and practice and as such, you have to work through it. I've been at it for 14 months now and have just finished the second chapter. The material is perfectly paced for a pianist of my level (about Gr. 2-3, RCM, 30+ years ago). The pieces are fun to play and jam packed with important ideas and blues cliches. I'm really starting to see the beginnings of true hand independence that works , not only when I play memorized pieces, but that I can invoke when trying improvisations!If you want to play professional-level blues piano in a month, then this is not the book for you. If, however, you live in the real world and are prepared to work at it, this book will do more than show a few riffs or tricks. It will give you a deep and firm foundation in popular piano improvisation in general, and blues in particular. I estimate I'll be another couple of years with this book and I can't wait to get back to it!This book is a work of genius. Thank you, Tim Tichards!"},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"There realy are not many great methods for the blues out there, but Tim Richards is thorough and goes into the required detail to show you how each blues style works.The examples are very playable, suiting more or less an intermediate level pianist. Richards is one of the few take-away instruction teachers to be concerned about fingerings, and takes the trouble to suggest good ones. His playing instructions work very well and add a dimension that you don't often get in these method books - he has a great insight into the chords, and the notes and the way they fit the music. The breakdown of theory is very well explained, if sometimes overdone. But he never floods you with scales without showing you how to apply them - that in itself is a good thing!Richards' choice of music is impeccable, and calssic blues standards of af all styles are presented from boogie, to funk, slow blues, and some jazzy numbers. And he shows you music in a number of keys so you aren't stuck to one or two and get a work out in the other keys. I found the music very playable, and well sounding, although I didn't always find the improvising instructions that intuitive.The historical background he gives is accurate and informative and the pictures of blues and jazz legends really make this book interesting.My criticism of the book is that it should have stretched up to the more advanced techniques of the blues - where the top players are, like Oscar Peterson, for example. That is its dissapointment - a teacher as good as this who dedicated the time to work a out a progressive and different course in blues shouldn't have stopped at the middle level. He surely should have stretched us, his interested audience up to the highest level.But this should not stop you from using this very useful and inspiring book - I Thank you sincerely Tim."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I'm an aspiring jazz pianist in Canada (I'm 32). I'm another one of the victims of the classical music education system that was taught to read the page and nothing else. I always thought that people who were good at jazz and could play by ear were born that way.When I was in high school I wanted to play jazz piano. Someone recommended the Mark Levine book to me. I tried going through it but gave up because I couldn't even figure out what a II-V was from his explanation. I figured jazz was this impenetrable language. I was sick of classical lessons by that time and gave up the piano.Fast forward ten years when I decided I didn't want all those hours of practicing (before school, even) to go to waste. I headed to a local music store and literally went through every piano book before I found IBP. It's pretty much been a revelation, from discussions of notations to chord types to ideas. I still suck at improvising, but before this book I wouldn't have even tried.I've got Tim's other two books on my shelf, patiently waiting for me to get to them. Seriously, his books are phenomenal. If I had found IBP back in high school instead of Mark Levine's brick wall of jazz accessibility, I might be ten years ahead. I can't recommend it highly enough. Rumour has it he's working on a fourth book about Latin piano, too."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"Now and then you run across a method book that makes you a better player and is great fun to work through. \\"Improvising Blues Piano\\" is one such book. It starts out very simply and steadily progresses to a pretty sophisticated level. The accompanying disk is well recorded and the author's playing, particularly his timing, is quite musical. On most examples, if you can make your playing sound like Tim Richards, you'll really swing.Starting in \\"C\\" and moving on to other familiar blues keys, the author mixes theory and practice in a logical progression of \\"bite sized\\" lessons that are very complete and doesn't assume anything about the student. At first, the experienced player may find the pace a bit slow but each section builds smoothly upon the foundation of the preceding material and I think it's worth while to patiently work on your weaknesses. When you can make those first simple exercises sound really musical, you've learned something valuable.The volume is accessible to beginners (this will take you a long way) while remaining useful for the more advanced because there is so much good content. I particularly like that he weaves in biographical information of known blues players along with examples of their style. The history of blues unfolds along with the student's expanding ability to play.If you are interested in the blues, I can't think of a better learning tool."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I grew up learning to sightread classical music; a pretty standard set of piano lessons. Unfortunately, those lessons were weak on the theory of how music is created. This is a great book for someone like me who now wants to understand how to start in a key and figure out how to combine chords and rhythm and the right notes to make music. The book has things like how the blues scale works, how to pound out a barrelhouse left hand while improvising with the right hand, turnarounds and endings, and much more. There are some tunes in here to learn (Blueberry Hill, Pine Top's Boogie Woogie, etc.), but that's not really the point--Tim Richards goes on to explain how those tunes were created, and how to change and improvise over them. The CD lets you hear the exercises, and is quite helpful. I looked around a lot, and bought some definitely inferior books, before finding this one. The author also wrote Exploring Jazz Piano, volumes 1 and 2, which basically build on this book. I recommend buying all three. No book is going to substitute for practice, but if you practice what's in these books you're going to love what you learn to do."},{"Title":"Improvising Blues Piano","review":"I am a classically trained pianist with 10 years of jazz study. This is one of the best instructional music books that I have purchased (definitely the best blues book by far). The material is logical and explained beautifully. What I really like is that the material is interchangeable. You can take ideas and mix and match them and create your own improvisations instantly. Tim gives you just the right amount of new material at a time. Perfectly paced and not overwhelming. I would and have recommended this book to anyone who is interested in improving their blues playing. I wouldn't buy this book if I were not a decent reader and familiar with basic chord progressions. More advanced players can get plenty out of the book. I enjoy putting the exercises into keys like Gb and C#, which provide a nice additional challenge. Thanks, Tim for taking the time to write a great book. I'm having a blast (50 year old mother of three)."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...do try the book. I had to read this at school at 14 (so often enough to put anyone off anything) but it has remained an absolute favourite which hardly anyone else seemed to have read until recently. It is a little gem. The episode where the narrator goes through a bundle of old letters is especially poignant and has remained with me ever since that first reading. You will know what I mean - but you'll need something to wipe away a tear!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It is fun to read the book from which the TV miniseries was taken. Seeing the people in print gives more to their on screen characterizations. I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time. But there isn't much of a plot. Far more worthy are Mary Barton, North and South or her others, I can't comment on Ruth as I haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Such a very pleasant read and gives a nice view into the lives of spinster/widow women of the 1850's in England. This particular Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This story is wonderful if you love to read about people, their quirks, their daily life. The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down. So far my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell book is North and South."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" like the village to which it refers (only 30 miles by train from the larger town of Drumble in which narrator Mary Smith and her father now live) offers multum in parvo as Rector Jenkyns might have said: much in little.Woven together in chapters that build quietly but skillfully on each other are the stories of Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matilda Jenkyns, their friends Miss Pole, Mrs FitzAdams, Mrs Forrester, Captain Brown and his daughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie, Lady Glenmire, the Honorable Mrs Jamieson, Signoir Brunoni and his wife, the requited and unrequited lovers, the servants Martha and Mr Mullinare and others sketched swiftly but memorable such as Mr ffoulkes who was so very choice and Mrs ffarington whom he married \\"...and all because of the ff's in her name\\" though being very genteel, pretty,and wealthy were no hinderance.Connected aned interdependent they are: had Signoir Brunoni not performed in Cranford, had he and his family not been sheltered during his illness by a kind innkeeper and his wife, had the ladies of Cranford not discovered his plight and come to the rescue, then Mary Smith would not have heard the story of the wife's journey through India to protect their daughter Pearl, of the kindness of a plantation owner,a Mr. Jenkyns....and she would not have written to him thinking he might be the Miss Jenkyn's long-lost brother, Peter, and more yet would not have ensued.We care about the little town whose portrait is drawn in \\"Cranford,\\" drawn in the watercolors of Beatrix Potter and with the same precision of observation. The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing. Found it in an odd lot in a Maine shop years ago, and it has been a good companion since, timeless as good stories and beautifully written work is, from Gilgamesh on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"There are rules and regulations at Cranford, and women, and a society of women. The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment. Harmony, reciprocity are the qualities clearly evidenced.The appendix contains an essay of Gaskell's,\\"The Last Generation in England,\\" which bears upon her knowledge of the sort of society portrayed in CRANFORD."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"What I like most about this book and the two related novellas is that the author is clearly someone who has little to worry about in her life. It shows in her writing style.These books are a relaxing read with very little that would upset a person.In my crazy, hectic life it's nice to know I can take out my Kindle and read a couple of passages about the idle lives of the endearing spinster sisters Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah.Don't read the Wikipedia article about this book before you read the book, it has major spoilers!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Although this book is well written & enjoyable it is a bit of fluff.

It is a story about a town and it's upper crust society among middle aged spinsters. The story has it's merits with good hearts and good intentions but the drawn out dialogue makes it hard to stay awake. There are times when I wondered why I continued to plow through to the end."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have the video and the book 'Cranford' and enjoyed both.

If you've seen the video, go ahead and get the book, you'll still enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Gaskell's plots are village and people oriented, something like Jane Austin's. Unlike Austen, she provides not only the humorous descriptions of characters' actions and speech; she will at some point explain how that character came to be the way he/she is. I bought this because I had seen a PBS series based on the Gaskell's books. The TV shows omitted some characters and subplots and shortened or combined some actions. Even if you've seen the Cranston TV series, the novels are enjoyable because of the depth. They are a really good read."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book was very entertaining. Just loved the Ladies of Cranford. It was a good story well told of days gone by. Very good"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is just to alert someone in Amazon that the book that came wasn't the book I ordered. I ordered the Penguin Classics edition, which was described as having 304 pages and included the two novellas besides the excellent \\"Cranford.\\" The picture on the book that came is the same as the one pictured on the website, but the book I received only has 257 pages and doesn't have the two novellas, which is why I wished to have this edition.Now I notice that the great reviews of this book are from some other edition -- strange and misleading. How can be sure to get the right one?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I hate to be a naysayer, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book. Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse. A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion. Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored. Some of the reviewers here have compared Gaskell to Austen. Sorry but not even close.I can't imagine this being a Masterpiece Theater selection. Did they film Judi Dench taking an hour long nap?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time. These are the 3 character-filled and -driven collections that the PBS Cranford series and Return to Cranford series were adapted from, so I recommend Gaskell's set here for any and all who've enjoyed the film versions.And this particular offering from Amazon is priced so frugally even Cranford's own Miss Deborah would approve. So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This paperback version is the one that the recent tv series fan will want, because unlike some of the other paperback versions, it includes the three Gaskell novellas that were the basis for the Judi Dench-Eileen Atkins miniseries. The three books were\\"Cranford\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions.\\"Mrs Gaskell stories are considered comedies, and this comes clear in the original texts. Some sadness of course in events, but mostly there is a clear comic, even sardonic voice in which we can fall in love with the characters and still laugh at their foibles, fashions, and foolishness which seem still so apropos today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that if you are thinking about reading this book only because of the BBC series, you will find it very disappointing. The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I was disappointed with the quality of the book (not the story). I had expected a regular-size paperback (I failed to notice the dimensions when I ordered) and find this size unwieldy and floppy. It also apparently is a \\"print on demand\\" version and contains errors. I have not finished reading the book because of this and would not order this particular item again."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Let me just say that I don't remember which cover is on my Cranford book so I don't know that this is the correct issue. I have read this work however and enjoyed it immensely. It is most amusing and I must say that some of Gaskell's works are deep compared to some classic novelists. I felt this had a little of everything. I'd suggest a read if you want to be ready for watching any TV adaptation."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford the book isn't the same as Cranford the BBC series--after all, the BBC series was based on three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, not just this one--but for me the book fills in details and answers questions I wished the TV show had time to go into. Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book. I will shop first at Amazon for everything I am wanting to purchase."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"delivery time and price of book where great, I just wish the deliveries to Australia werent so high!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Loosely linked stories (sometimes described as a novel) about a group of spinsters and widows living in a small English town in the first half of the nineteenth century. They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment. I did not laugh out loud or find it hard to stop turning the pages."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is the best book ever! Why don't more people know how good this author's books are?

The novel is very well written and first appeared as many of Charles Dickens works did, in the form of a serial in a magazine. In fact Dickens was the editor of the publication this novel first appeared in.I highly recommend this novel for those who enjoy Victorian prose."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Penguin Classics edition of Cranford, with a cover design by Coralie Bickford-Smith, is a beautiful book, a pleasure to hold and read. I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people.

The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies.

At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory.

Well, that's exactly what a reader experiences on picking up CRANFORD, when she's come to it after delighted hours spent with WIVES AND DAUGHTERS and NORTH AND SOUTH. Take one of those wonderful, wonderful novels, delete all the men, all the romance, and all the passionate class critique, and that leaves CRANFORD.All I can say is, this novel is like Barbara Pym's QUARTET IN AUTUMN or her EXCELLENT WOMEN, only more so. More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then.

Both students AND aficionados of nineteenth-century literature, you don't say!!!Another sign that this is a lesser classic is it's appearance in a Dover Thrift Edition. Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte. Even though this is a book putatively about small town genteel widows and matrons, the timely references to characters being enthralled by Dickens Pickwick Papers (one of the few men in the novel is hit by a train because he is standing on the platform, so enthralled by the latest installment of Pickwick that he is slow too alert a child stuck on the tracks.)Elizabeth Gaskell in fact chose to be known as \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\" to the point that contemporary editions of Cranford read \\"by Mrs. Gaskell.\\" Although Cranford is not exactly what you call \\"action intense,\\" it is well observed, and at 130 pages you can read through it in a couple hours. Gaskell's country matrons don't sparkle with the life of those of Stendahl's the Red and the Black, but she does an equal job of portraying a specific time and place (the 1830s) from a vantage point twenty years in the the future (published 1852.)In the end Gaskell's genteel spinsters come together to save the day in the manner of a book like \\"the Little Women,\\" it's a bit TOO pat of an ending but hey it's just a minor classic, nowhatimean?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A lovely book about a lovely village of lovely people. The inspiration for BBC/Masterpiece Classic's Cranford and Return to Cranford. I read this book in only a few nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The glossary/notes regarding material culture (clothing, terminology, expressions) are not always correct (based on my own research and experience as an historic interpreter), but most of the information was new to me and referred to books and events of which I was unaware. I'm glad I watched the tv series first, including \\"The Making of Cranford,\\" before reading the book; it made clear how and why the series was created as it was. That being said, the book is charming and should be read by all high school students, especially female students, to understand that they are not so very different after all."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"For those expecting the book and PBS Mini-series of the same name to mirror each other, your expectations will probably fall short. Although the book is very well written, it is definitely not light reading, and requires a great degree of concentration to understand the ins and outs of the plot - the characters are intertwined, but it is sometimes hard to remember how they relate to one another.Overall, this book is a good, classical tale, but not recommended for bedtime reading!

The show does not go strictly by the plot in the book but it is close. I liked it but not everyone would. It is English and interesting and the satire is sometimes not immediately apparent. It creeps up on you and you laugh later."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Having recently read both Gaskell's _Mary Barton_ and _Cranford_, I was pleasantly surpised by how humorous and pleasant I found the latter to be; gladly, _Cranford_ proves that not all Victorian fiction is populated with the unfeeling wealthy and the starving poor. A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century. It is said to be Mrs. Gaskell's most popular book, and the only book that Mrs. Gaskell herself would want to re-read again. This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford. If you are interested in Victorian Literature, this is one of the few relaxing novels belonging to that period that is definitely worth a reading!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Gaskills character sketches are delightful to read. Her descriptions of village life are spot on. I have lived in a small village all my life, and with the exceptions of technologies and British class systems, this is how a small town still operates. Loved reading it and followed with the other novels based in Cranford ASAP."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I bought this for my wife - but, after we both greatly enjoyed the BBC miniseries, I ended up reading it myself as well. Compared to the miniseries, as expected, the book expands into more details and can be savored in many more levels.Sometimes escapism may require an action page-turner. Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced. I read it very quickly yet I feel as if the tale will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It's true that the novel \\"Cranford\\" doesn't mirror the recent Masterpiece dramatization, however this is because the adaptation was based on a series of Mrs. Gaskell's works, of which \\"Cranford\\" is only one. The others are \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"The Last Generation in England\\". Taken together, all four give a complete -and more familiar- portrait of the delightful village we saw televised. I recommend each of them highly."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, follows the lives of a group of women living in a small English town.I enjoyed this book very much. More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life. A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on. A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of \\"Cranford\\" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A sweet, gentle story of a small English town not unlike Jan Karon's Mitford, only 150 years ago. No high drama- only caring people with all their flaws. I read it years ago and remembered it fondly. Reading it again recently, I was not disappointed. Don't miss this little jewel."},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"I found this book to be quite useful. It is indeed a beginning text on the subject but if you, like myself, have spent most of your time fishing on streams you will find this a good jumping off point for fishing small lakes. There is much useful information in this book covering the nature of small lakes and the trout that you will find there. Specific information is given on the insects found there and their imitations. Basic techniques are covered as well as fishing craft. I would recommend it for someone starting out with lake fishing."},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"Lately I've been having a ball going after native brookies and wild rainbows in remote Adirondack ponds. I've caught my share of both, mainly using # 10 freshwater clousers and other small streamers.Approaching still water trout is a daunting experience for the stream fisher person. Where to begin? How to read a lake? How deep is deep with a fly rod and how to get down there?I bought this book in the hopes of answering these and many other questions that had been keeping me awake at night (well not quite, but they did seem important).There's a lot of information here so generally I'm not disappointed. However, the book is definitely skewed to western conditions, and completely ignores fly-fishing with imitations of baitfish, presumably a primary food source for large trout at least in eastern waters. In fact, in the chapter, Insects and Other Trout Foods, the only \\"other\\" foods touched on are scuds and leeches.This major omission in an otherwise very good book results in the three star recommendation. But if you're OK with tossing all your streamers (with the exception of the odd Wooly Bugger to imitate a leech) then go ahead and give it a read just the same. The section on chironomid fishing may be worth it in and of itself."},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"As other reviewers have noted, the book is a primer for stillwater anglers, but surprisingly does not mention baitfish or streamers. It doesn't get into the details of how different trout species utilize different habitats or prey items in the same lake. And it doesn't discuss the different types of lakes and how best to approach each environment. Instead, there is a sometimes goofy, punchline-driven text that accompanies some good and not-so-good photos and color line drawings. Don't get me wrong, the information is solid and entertaining, but all of it has been covered before in much greater detail and with much better focus in Kauffman and Cordes's earlier work and Denny Rickards's more recent volume. If you're looking for a book on the basics of stillwater trout fishing, I would recommend either of those and Bernie Taylor's book on big trout fishing, as well as maybe Steve Probasco's book on high desert and alkaline lakes before you bought this one. Will this book help you catch more or bigger trout in a lake? Only if you've never read another book or magazine on the subject, or if you're brand new to lake fishing with a fly."},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"Wonderful, simple enough for the everyday stream figherman to gain the conifdence and some helpful techn. for lakes and ponds. and very informative im excited for ice out!"},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"This book is short, to the point, and answered my questions about fly fishing in lakes (what are the different kinds of sinking lines and which one do I use? what kinds of flies/nymphs should I use? what are some techniques for fishing deep? etc.). The authors did not add \\"filler material\\" as many fly fishing authors do: there is no long chapter teaching you all the methods of fly casting nor narratives of the authors' own fly fishing adventures. I did enjoy the smattering of humor throughout (another reviewer didn't appreciate the bit about the Moors and Spain). My favorite was the tip on fishing with two in a boat: \\"If your partner calls out and you are already casting...inform him of the potential problem: 'Oh my God - No!' is popular.\\""},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"&quot;With just slightly less vigor than that of the Moors when they took Spain, the chironomid-pupa fly fished deep on a floating line took western lakes.&quot;This is just a sample of the hair-pulling sentences that the reader must endure. While I give the book two stars for providing some useful content and a few inspiring photos, the nuggets of information are buried too deep in the poorly written chapters, superfluous paragraphs, wide text columns and amateur drawings. I have just one question: Where's the editor? I doubt that I'll purchase another book by Frank Amato Publications. It's just too frustrating a read."},{"Title":"Morris & Chan on Fly Fishing Trout Lakes","review":"If you are relatively new to fly fishing, particularily trout fishing this is a must have. I've been fishing for many years but just recently moved to an area that has primarely trout fishing lakes. Friends have explained certain things to me, but this book covers it all and more.

It delt with real beliefs that some people carry today and it told a valuable lesson. However, the \\"cinderella\\" ending is way too unbelievable for a story that is written so realistically. Many young people will read this story and I think it is wrong to send the type of message that the story's ending gave. The main character was lazy, dropped out of high school and refused to work. \\"Just let the system take care of you\\" was her motto. Most people who drop out of school, go on welfare expecting the system to take care of them and then refuse to work when they get cut from public assistance do NOT get offered a dream job as an actress, along with wealth and fame as a solution to their problem. And was the main character offered this opportunity because she was hard working? went back to school? got a job? changed her thuggish ways? NO!!!!!! She got offered it because she was \\"pretty\\" and had \\"guts.\\" GIVE ME A BREAK! The ending ruined what could have been a wonderful story. I cannot give this more than 3 stars.

Aisha's world is thrown into chaos when she receives a 60-day notice that her welfare benefits are expiring and she must enroll in the workfare program or lose her benefits altogether. In this novel, McDonald goes deep into the culture of the poor to bring understanding over the degradation they feel at having to participate in the menial government workfare programs. As Aisha frantically tries to find other methods to support herself, she encounters bigotry and racism not only because of her color, but primarily because of her social standing. McDonald also writes of the differing attitudes that exist between the unwed mother and that of the baby's father. These insights are great in helping the reader better understand the difficulty experienced by unwed teen mothers of any culture. Aisha's desperation, despair and determination lead her to a happy, fairy-tale-like ending, which accentuates the story's fictional element without betraying its value as a cultural milestone."},{"Title":"Chill Wind","review":"Aisha Ingram is a 19-year-old high-school dropout living in the projects with her two kids and no job.

Guillaumin is a materialist feminist, which means she is greatly influenced by Marxian philosophies that have developed in France in the last half-century and sensitive to the ideological bases of power with respect to &quot;minorities&quot; and women in society. Her analysis of race led her to extend analytical application of these ideas to gender, making her conclusions regarding gender more &quot;radical&quot; than her statements on race.Guillaumin's historical exploration of the rise of bourgeoisie as well as her analysis of naturalism as a worldview are important and deserving of reflection. I recommend this challenging (yet approachable) text to anyone interested in applying their critical thinking skills to the continuing issues of race and gender that are so pervasive in our contemporary society."},{"Title":"The Sceptical Chymist","review":"The Christian Chemist, Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was truly a great scientist. He is guilty for verifying and discovering the proportional relationship of Pressure and Volume for gases by holding the Temperature constant. He verified one side of the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT). This work is probably his most notable work. Here he discusses a necessity for uniform language for alchemists, since at the time and before many procedures had been done, but there was much disorganization alchemical language since it was often times secret or \\"occult\\". That, however, does not mean that alchemy was disastrous or chaotic, just often times ambiguous or unclear.Please note that The \\"Sceptical Chymist\\" (1661) is NOT the work where Gas Laws are discussed. His other work with the works of E. H. AmagatThe Laws Of Gases: Memoirs By Robert Boyle And E. H. Amagat (1899)would be the book to get to see how he derived PV = k.Boyle followed the Baconian method of induction, which was not that different than the ancient and medieval methods of natural philosophy (science), in the \\"Sceptical Chymist\\" since he constantly appeals to experimental evidence and systematic procedures to validate claims and numerical models on natural phenomenon. A big portion of this book is on the procedures and results of many chemical experiments. Here he does controlled chemical experiments with details on the apparatus used, observations made, and conclusions. Interestingly, there is also talk of the Bible and its influence on Boyle's views of nature and how it inspired his empiricism and objective search for truth in the midst of alchemy. He also asserted strongly that general experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four: earth, fire, air, and water. That is, there are more than four elements that make up matter. He also defines the term \\"element\\" and views substances as being made of primary particles or bodies (what the atomists more than 2000 years ago called \\"atoms\\"). Truly an awesome short historical work of the man himself and gives a glimpse of the progression of natural philosophy a few hundred years back. His legacy is still felt today in process design and chemistry of gases via \\"analysis\\". Truly he was following the nature of truth as propagated by the Christian lawyer and author of the formal \\"scientific method(s)\\", Francis Bacon. ReadFrancis Bacon: The New Organon and Related Writingsfor further reading on the scientific views near their times.The language of this book is not that bad, and you get used to certain spelling of words since this is simply a copy of an old copy of the \\"Sceptical Chymist\\" from 1661. Over all, this is an important work for any Chemist or Chemical Engineer who is interested in alchemy and how Chemistry rose from the Father of Modern Chemistry - Robert Boyle. No one should go without reading the works of this scientific giant.For other historical papers by notable historical chemists please readElements of ChemistryBy Lavoisier andMendeleev on the Periodic Law: Selected Writings, 1869 - 1905By Dmitri Mendeleev andThe Modern Theory Of Solution: Memoirs By Pfeffer, Van't Hoff Arrhenius And Raoult (1899)with almost complete papers of Raoult, Arrhenius; andFoundations Of The Atomic Theory: Comprising Papers And Extracts By John Dalton, William Hyde Wollaston And Thomas Thomson, 1802-1808 (1911)andFoundations Of The Molecular Theory: Comprising Papers And Extracts."},{"Title":"Microsoft Access/Visual Basic Step by Step","review":"You can drown in the information available regarding Access and Visual Basic, and yet not learn what you need to know.

Thus, twenty stories and twenty short commentaries comprise this useful anthology, representing writers as diverse as Kafka and Chekhov, Carver and Mishima, Reynolds Price and Barry Hannah."},{"Title":"Technical Support on the Web: Designing and Managing an Effective E-Support Site","review":"This book contains information that will be equally useful to call centers supporting customers and internal IT help desks that are exploring the benefits of web-based issue management via a corporate intranet. The previous reviewed has provided a comprehensive assessment of this book, so I'll address the highlights that I found to be useful:(1) The business-case first approach that the author takes is straightforward and provides step-by-step procedures for determining the true business value of web-enabled technical support vs. traditional call centers. I especially liked the discussion of first, second and third generation site models because it gives you a target model and shows both the business and technical value of each. I also liked the way ROI factors and ratings were used to determine ROI potential. The factors are management, functions and tools, and the ratings are a simple Good or Poor. This is placed into context with a table that shows the combinations of factors and ratings and their associated potential and gives you a structured decision tool at a glance.(2) Scope approach given in the book is complete in that it takes into account all stakeholder views (business, technical support and users/customers). This forces you to take a realistic look at goals and objectives and, using ROI information, begin making intelligent and informed trade-offs.(3) Site creation map is consistent with good project management practices in that it uses a task and associated details approach. The details provided include deliverables and what the deliverables should contain. Project planners and managers will find this section particularly valuable.(4) Support processes and procedures are well thought out and can be used as a benchmarking tool as well as planning and implementation guidelines.(5) I like the way the section on site management is goal-driven and traceable back to ROI. If this approach is followed you will have processes that are designed for continuous improvement.(6) The use of tables and lists throughout the book provides a wealth of information on nearly every topic.There are a few areas that were weak: no mention of portal technology, which can be employed to create user-customizable features and incorporate advanced knowledge management functionality into a web-enabled support system. Also, there was no discussion of configuration control over content or legal issues that need to be considered when providing technical support to customers (as opposed to internal end users).Overall this is an exceptionally valuable book that is among the best on the subject. Highly recommended to IT help desks and product technical support center managers."},{"Title":"Technical Support on the Web: Designing and Managing an Effective E-Support Site","review":"Ms. Czegel has produced another 5-star winner with a badly needed book on providing technical support using web technology. This book is more focused on internal IT web-based support vs. product support for call centers. It does address product-based support for external customers, but not in the depth or detail that internal help desks are discussed. While help desks and call centers employ many of the same processes and tools, there is a world of difference between the challenges, goals and objectives of the two. One of the key advantages of using web-based support internally is initial troubleshooting tools, knowledge bases and other self-help aids can be made available to preempt support calls. Both IT and the business win if the user can resolve his or her problem without opening an issue. Another big advantage is when a ticket is open users can track the progress of getting their problem resolved. This goes a long way towards aligning IT services to business requirements and improving customer satisfaction.As in her other books Ms. Czegel begins with an examination of business factors and a discussion of how web-based technical support has evolved quickly to what she calls a third-generation model. I like how she sums up the business factors with a compelling discussion of the business benefits, including an example cost-benefit analysis.The second chapter gives a roadmap for site creation and management. It provide a comprehensive list of necessary tasks that can be used to develop a work breakdown structure and project plan. It segues into the next chapter on establishing the scope, and leads you through the foundation of defining your goals and business expectations. Scope includes possible services to provide through web-based support, and which services are the most cost-effective to provide. I liked the examples, provided in tables, that rank requirements and the resources required to satisfy them. Ms. Czegel next addresses staff selection, providing roles and responsibilities and the necessary skills to move to web-based support. This information is valuable to help desk professionals because there are major differences between traditional help desk requirements and those of web-based support organizations.Functions, tools and implementations are covered in great detail and is must reading because web-based support brings with it specialized tools and requirements that will leverage a traditional help desk's tools to provide self-help to users. Because this book does touch on product support to external customers I felt that the lack of content management and change control tools was a notable gap. These are important to internal and external support, but are far more critical when you are dealing with external customers because out-of-date technical information or the wrong software for download can seriously detract from your company's image (or worse). If your focus is product support to external customers I recommend augmenting this book with Customer Service on the Internet by Jim Sterne.Designing your site is briefly covered with good advice; however, the heart of this book is process and implementation, and site management. Ms. Czegel thoroughly covers all issues and gives valuable information using tables, checklists and examples. These two parts of the book are essential to implementing and managing an effective web-based support function. I especially liked the metrics and examples given.Summary: web-based technical support is one of the most effective strategies to improve the level of support to customers using self-help and other preventative measures to reduce issues. It also gives users an ability to track their open issues, which improves their level of satisfaction as well as reducing follow-up calls to the help desk. This book provides a clear roadmap to defining a web-based support strategy, and its implementation and management. As far as I know there is no other book that addresses this subject for internal IT help desks, making it all the more valuable. If you are a help desk manager who is either exploring web-based technical support, or are in the process of implementing it this book with save you much grief because it lays out what needs to be done from business case development to daily operations. If you are currently supporting users with web technology the site management chapter will provide you with excellent advice on how to efficiently manage web-based support."},{"Title":"Draw Me Close to You: Daily Devotions from the Greatest Praise and Worship Songs of All Time (Songs 4 Worship (Hardcover))","review":"As soon as this book arrived I committed it to the nearest garbage bin.

I have used Mr. Lancasters' book to design many audio active filters. I am ordering another copy of the &quot;Active Filter Cookbook&quot; because I gave away my other copy to an engineer in Asia (while on a business trip) who desparately needed it. The math is kept to a minimum, but very accurate if good quality parts (Op-Amps, resistors, caps etc) are used. Each chapter is dedicated to a specific topic, which makes reading very easy. Mr. Lancaster arms the reader with the tools neccessary to understand, build and/or modify existing designs. I would only recommend this book to readers who have built previous projects, as Mr. Lancaster does not go into any construction details/techniques."},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","review":"I have used this book to design many active filters for audio applications. The book is non-mathematical in nature, many design tables are given, but most importantly the book connects theory and real world applications.

An excellent book."},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","review":"The design of electronic filters is usually seen as a complex and difficult task, best handled by specialists. Don Lancaster, with this durable treatise, has written a clear and easy to follow guide.

It does contain quite a few tabulated filter designs, and Mr Lancaster teaches a fairly straightforward approach to selecting from among them and scaling them to fit the user's needs. The print quality is good, too.On the other hand, it is a less complete book than I remembered it being from the days when I could still find my original copy. There are some gaps in treatment of notch filters, for instance, and less thorough coverage of some other types than I would have liked. I'm also not sure why he shunned everyday filter terminology like \\"Butterworth\\" and \\"ripple\\" in favor of dumbed-down alternatives like \\"flattest response\\" and \\"dips.\\" And, being yet another reprint of the Second Edition, there has been no effort to update information on better op-amps that are available now, or to modernize the active filter applications that wrap up the book.Add to that the downright HEFTY price tag for this relatively slim reprint! Taking those reasons together, if I'd had the opportunity to glance through this volume in a store before buying, I probably wouldn't have done so. I ordered it more for sentimental reasons than anything else, but now that I can once again see its limitations for myself, I realize I would have been far better off putting that money toward a newer filter design book, such as the latest edition of Williams and Taylor.On the other hand, if you need the easy to use cookbook kind of information this book contains, and you do not foresee buying more than one book on the subject of active filters any time soon, then this book might very well be worth the price to you. What it DOES contain would be hard to find in any single other book. You'd probably have to search through two or three other works, and who knows how much you'd spend doing that.So, bottom line, I think it's fair to say that if you're looking for an all-in-one general resource on electronic filters, this is the one to have despite the price. But if you already have some other filter handbooks and a background in the subject, this one might not be a very good dollar value for you."},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","review":"A great book for filter design and analysis.

Some authors use a lot of &#34;junk&#34; that really does not say much. It is well written compared to another author. This book is not confusing, or boring."},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","review":"Don Lancaster is a very good writer, and has focussed on what really matters for anyone designing analogue active filters. At 240 pages, this book has all the design guidelines, mathematics and practical tips for the popular single-amplifier biquad (SAB) circuits such as Sallen-Key and Multiple-FeedBack (MFB), and 3- or 4-opamp circuits such as State-Variable designs; it covers cascading multiple sections, with many practical examples up to 6th order filters; it covers bandpass, low-pass and high-pass active filters, plus \\"just enough\\" mention of notch and Cauer/elliptical filters, as well as filter applications and digital tuning, etc... but the edition I have - the 1995 - is a bit too old to cover some of the more recent developments. No mention of switched-capacitor filters (well, the MF10C has come and gone in popularity, so no problem there), but no mention of any digital filter techniques... even so, you probably want that in a separate book; this remains a good introduction, very useful as it is, providing an extremely good grounding in theory - such as damping (transitional Thompson-Butterworth an all that), normalization/scaling, \\"s-plane\\" equations, etc. The practical side is fully covered (e.g. \\"You can NOT build a stable, high-Q, easy-to-tune, single-[amplifier] bandpass filter\\"); sensitivity of component variation is covered well.The book is physically and conceptually the \\"right size\\" - with no \\"waffle\\"; many university textbooks may be larger, and cover a few obscure extra filter circuits, but 90% of designers will never need them in their work. It is much more useful than (although covers les filter types, and slightly less up-to-date than) Lenk's \\"Simplified Design of Filter Circuits\\", which is about the same size.It would be nice to see a new edition (although I am happy enough with what the 1995/6 edition has); it could be improved slightly by having some of the alternative/family names for filter circuits (such as KRC and VCVS) listed, and a few (very few) extra comments could be made as to why you would avoid certain circuits. It would also be nice if a bit of colour was used to clarify some diagrams, and perhaps have the chapter and subsection heading repeated at the top of each page. All that is relatively unimportant - basically: don't mess with perfection, this book would be worse if it tried to cover much more than it does (but it would be nice to see an end to the CD4016 being called a \\"new\\" development)."},{"Title":"Active Filter Cookbook, Second Edition","review":"Needed this book for an online class and now that class is over, it has found a place on the bench with just a few others."},{"Title":"High-speed math self-taught (Cardinal giant)","review":"I have several other fast math books.

Rodney is scooped up off the streets and given his big chance in life, but he must learn to do things the way the CEO of this venture wants things done, exactly how things work in the real world corporate structure. Will he go along with things, or will he retain his identity and return to the streets? I've read that you can't write a good novel without lots of tension and constant adversity, but Ms. Wobig seems to have done it. Maybe she wrote the story before Writer's Digest told us how it had to be done. Anyway, there is plenty of adversity in the story, but it doesn't go from crisis to crisis and it is still good reading.In the Pictures of Pravanne, by Lan Wright, a highly successful, but physically deformed, painter goes to Pavanne to paint the famous Pictures, artifacts left by an ancient civilization. His negative personality puts him on the bad side of almost everyone, until someone truly needs his help, and he undergoes a transformation.

The life we lived and where we fit in survives only in memory. After those who knew us are gone, there will be no one to repeat our stories. Entire populations will vanish, perhaps to make a brief appearance in accounts of war or disaster. Don't let that happen.The people in Chronicle Of The Seven Sorrows will never grace the pages of textbooks. Their very existence is almost lost to time. A culture rich in heritage, beliefs, and far too much suffering has vanished. Only ghosts and a few authors like Chamoiseau strive to keep the past alive.It is our loss, you'll realize after reading Chronicle Of The Seven Sorrows. We have cheated ourselves and we have been cheated.There was a time in Martinique when its people still listened to the voices of ghosts, dorlis, and zombies. The undead as much a part of their lives as the buyers in the marketplace, and often, the only verbal link to their past. Memories of slavery, brutality, and stolen moments of joy, remained only beneath grave soil. And, while not everyone stayed to hear the song of their history, there were some who were unable to tear themselves away.Pipi Soleil, king of the marketplace djobbers, was one of the enchanted. He was destined to become the master of masters of the wheelbarrow and to be lured away from that exalted position again and again by the spirits' voices. His life story forms the core of this spellbinding and animated account of a lost time and way-of-life.Chamoiseau's words tumble over themselves, and read like a late-night storytelling session. Each tale attempts to top the ones before it. The conversational style recaptures the oral tradition and, like truly great gossip, captures the reader, too. The voice of Fort-de France, Martinique's vegetable market people spills out in a irresistible tangle.The residents of Chronicle Of The Seven Sorrows speak in the distinctive Creole tongue. Coverdale's translation retains that flavour and sound, so you may spend some time flipping to the notes in the back of the novel. Some phrases may need translation, but the momentary pause is well worth the detour; there is as much history in the notes as in the story.The original words are essential; when you spy on Phosphore the grave-digger and Anatole-Anatole (father and son dorlis) listening to the sad murmurs of the burial ground's deceased residents. Missing the wrenching questions of Afoukal the zombie would be a deprivation akin to his own.Yes. Most of the population of Martinique was undead. But how much more life they embodied! How much more they had in the time before progress and government \\"assistance\\" banished them to fading shadows.The people and cultures don't have to wither away. Fight back.

It kept me enthralled all the way through, and all three of the shorter novels included are, by themselves, impossible to put down (especially King of the Swords, which is also the most fun to read since Elric and Erekose join forces with Corum to form the Three Who Are One).I have not read all of the Eternal Champion novels, but of the ones I have read, this is my favorite. The exposition of this book does not conform at all to the Lord of the Rings formula that has been copied and recopied in epic fantasy novels ad nauseum. If all the fantasy books you've been reading are Lord of the Rings clones, do yourself a favor and get anything, and I mean anything, by Michael Moorcock.Corum's struggle is easy to support and get behind. He doesn't come across as a psycho with a death wish the way Elric does; his motives are nobler and more heroic. The story begins when Corum's race, the Vadhagh, is killed off by wild Mabden tribes. They capture Corum and give him his characteristic missing hand and eye before he miraculously escapes. He reaches a castle held by civil, peaceful Mabden who bring him back to health and give him a place to live.At first, Corum's struggle is against the Mabden who killed his family, but he quickly becomes involved in a battle on the side of Law against the Chaos lords known as the Sword Rulers, whose cause is behind the destruction of Corum's race.This is a great book to read even if you have never read another Eternal Champion novel and had no intention of doing so. This was the first Eternal Champion book I read, and I had no trouble understanding it, or the concept of the Eternal Champion, which is explained in detail in Queen of the Swords. You don't even need to read this book's sequel, Corum: the Prince With the Silver Hand, to fully enjoy it, though I would recommend it since it is also very good."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"This is the first collection of Moorcock that I ever read, and without doubt it is my favorite. Elric seems to be the character fans like most, but for me Corum is the finest example of a heroic fantasy hero to come down the pike since Robert E. Howard's Solomon Kane. His motivations are realistic, he has personality and depth, he is a real and three dimensional character. The novels are fast-paced and fun, and I say without doubt that if all you know of fantasy comes from Tolkien or C.S. Lewis RUN do not walk to your nearest independant bookstore and order a copy of Corum: The Coming Of Chaos. This is prime stuff, and makes all that Unicorn-crazed, dragon-loving crap out there look like the Wright Brother's plane next to a phantom jet. I'm serious. Get it."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"I like Michael Moorcock's style and this book is no exception. The fantasy is fast paced and light and you can finish all of these books in very little time.The story: Corum is from a race of elf-like beings who have ruled the world for thousands of years and have settled into their way of life after centuries of peace with their life long enemies. Along comes man, basically an animal compared to Corum's race of refined individuals. Man is hardly a threat and mostly ignored. Well, centuries like this pass and man rises in power and starts killing off other members of Corum's people and finally they take notice.Well set up, well executed and a lot of fun to read.If you liked Corum, you'll like the other eternal champion books, I especially liked the Elric set, but enjoyed some of the earlier Eternal Champion works including the first book on Erecose."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Michael Moorcock's books have always enthralled me and I number his works among the finest in my collections. Corum: The Coming of Chaos, which I have just finsihed, does much justice to Moorcocks other books and is easily on par with his Elric Saga. The book is written in Moorcock's graceful fast paced prose which moves the story along at breakneck pace and keeps you interested. Moorcock shows here he is a master of plots and story progression and Corum is a joy to read about. As always Moorcock's book transcends traditional fantasy to become more than just a heroic adventure. Much philosophy and mythology is tied in with the story and this makes for a read that is unlike anything else. Get this book if you have any like for good fiction, but start with The Eternal Champion book if you are not familiar with his works. Moorcock is easily in league with such greats as Tolkien and Lovecraft and he should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"After reading the first six books in this series, it's a wonder how Moorcock can keep topping himself volume after volume and the Corum books are no exception. Moorcock introduces us to another fantasy warrior creation, but somehow keeps him separate from Elric, Hawkmoon, et al. Corum is just as good as any of these.Some general comments on the individual novels:The Knight of the Swords: Moorcock didn't use too much imagination this time when choosing a title, since except for one word all three are the same. This one is the first introduction to Corum, showing his maiming (ouch), and his ultimate fight against Arioch, who is the Chaos Lord Elric is serving. I don't know what effect this has on Elric, if any. Great start, though.The Queen of the Swords: Corum continues to blast his way through the ranks of the Chaos Lords, this time being joined by his Eternal companion, who's other names I don't quite remember. Nothing particularly distinguishes this one from the others, but it's still fun.The King of the Swords: All right! When I read the summary for Sailor on the Seas of Fate, I knew the other champions were going to show up. In fact, in that one Corum mentions a battle that he fought with Elric, though the albino doesn't remember it. That should have tipped me off. Here, without any fanfare, are the appearances of Elric and Erekose, and it's a very welcome diversion. This is the battle Corum mentions in the Elric books, and I hope Moorcock writes other meetings of the Eternal Champions, perhaps bringing in some others like Elric meeting Jerry Cornelius or Hawkmoon meeting Oswald Bastable. In fact, where was Hawkmoon in this one? The Runestaff appeared, but not him. What gives? Best of the trio.&lt;P"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Moorcock and Fritz Leiber have the same ironic vision which means they use language lightly to suggest rather than belabour their points and they almost never dwell too long on the emotions of their heroes, no matter how bad things get. That said there is a refreshing pace and clarity of writing to this book which, while not being one of Moorcock's finest, still gives more per page than almost anything else out there. Corum was the first of Moorcock's characters I read, so I guess I identify with him more than the gloomier Elric, and I also like this 'science fantasy' quality, which takes Corum through various incarnations of the multiverse in rapid succession as he tries to avoid the genocide planned for him by the Mabden (mankind) interlopers. As usual Moorcock defeats expectations and takes some odd twists to deliver a fine, nicely-flavored wine which is best drunk by the goblet-full and savoured when you're done with it. A soupcon of Paidraic Colum, maybe, a touch of Dunsany, perhaps, with a dash of Yeats echoing in the background, but none the worse for that. A great read for StPatrick's Day!"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Corum, one of Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champions, loses his family, a hand and an eye, and most of his race to the insurgent Mabden (Humans) who have divine assistance from the gods of Chaos. To protect the Mabden woman who heals him, Corum accepts divine assistance himself in the form of a god's eye and hand. He then travels many planes of existence to confront the Chaos gods and exact his revenge. Very imaginative and fast paced with excellent character development. Moorcock is not afraid to sacrifice characters to tell his stories. Highly recommended to anyone who likes their imaginations stretched to the limit in dark, fantastic and magical settings. Strong female characters add to the appeal"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"\\"The Chronicles of Corum were originally 6 books, but have been repackaged in various editions. Although less popular than the Elric books, I'd say the Corum series is equally good, perhaps better.\\"-- Glenn G. Thater, Author of 'Harbinger of Doom'"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Corum: The Coming of Chaos is a strong collection of three related stories. The theme is similar to the original story &quot;The Eternal Champion&quot; found in Book One of this series. In it the human race is the antagonist, and Corum, the last survivng member of the Vadagh race is the anti-hero. Corum becomes possessed with defeating the barbarians who tortured him at the cost of his eye and his hand. He finds himself in a world in which law has been overwhelmed by chaos and he becomes an unwitting champion for the cause of law. With the aid of the hand and eye of a god, which gives him mysterious and frightening powers, he sets out on three quests to defeat the Knight, Queen and King of Swords, gods who rule chaos, and eventually gains his revenge upon his human tormentors. Fans of Moorcock should enjoy this novel very much, and for the uninitiated it should provide an outstanding example of the writing and story style Mr. Moorcock has become famous for"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Unlike several of the volumes in this collection, the Corum novels are three linear, sequential adventures covering the aforementioned hero's struggle against a Chaos invasion of his home world. It's good old-fashioned sword and sorcery, complete with magic limb replacements, gods good, evil, and capricious, a wisecracking sidekick with a flying cat, a cardboard cutout love interest, etc. All the basics.It's solid stuff, although I found Corum himself a little flat - Moorcock hit a home run with the Eternal Champion concept, because it means he can put the same broody hero into any possible situation and have a ready-made conflict, but the heroes themselves, with the notable exception of Elric, tend to all blur together. But that multifaced hero has definitely grown on me."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"This is a gritty hardcore fantasy. Moorcocks best in my opinion. Corumn is of a world where Humans known as Mabden are a race of barbaric userpers who have decimated Corums people. They wound him, maim him and he asks the gods of chaos for revenge. He gets his wishes, although the chaos gods are a fickle violent bunch with agendas of their own. Everything comes at a price and Courum pays for the gifts he receives. Dark and wicked, as fantasy should be written. Get the book with all the tales of Courum in it, you will want to read more trust me."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Moorcock began his fantasy writing career young, in the 1950s, around the same time as Lord of the Rings and Gormenghast were published. His interest in fantasy predated his reading of either sequence. He quotes such writers as Twain and Cabell as influences. It's clear, however, that Moorcock writes more in the Peake tradition than the Tolkien and, if you want a combination of the virtues of both writers, you'll find it here. Moorcock loves language and his books are enriched by it. You don't need 800 pages to get the message across! In Europe he is honored as an important literary writer. These novels are a great writer enjoying himself. Moorcock has said that he only writes fantasy novels if he can enjoy himself. Even now in his new Elric books Moorcock is still keeping them short and fast. Why the books have depth is because of the superior writing, with characteristic ironies and elegaic tone, fresh quality of invention, strong structuring, using 'image as narrative', the underlying philosophy which is never shoved in your face, but makes you think, the characters, who have strong motivations and crises. Moorcock doesn't world-build, any more than he bothers with invented alphabets and other somewhat nerdy occupations. He is a story teller and nothing extraneous is allowed to get in the way of that first priority. (...)These stories are set in Cornwall, easily identified by the use of original Cornish (Celtic) names. This year I visited 'Moidel's Mount' and itswonderful, impregnable castle, which, apart from the town now on the other shore, is exactly as Moorcock describes it, only it's called St Michael's Mount and is across from Marazion in Cornwall. The Scilly Isles also feature, though in the Moorcock books they are still attached to the mainland. This is realArthurian territory, but Moorcock makes no reference to it. He is busy inventing his own mythology. He is steeped in Celtic and Norse mythology, which he also claims as a strong influence on Corum and Elric respectively.Moorcock says in his introduction that he came up with the Corum stories during a wet vacation in Cornwall. All I can say is, thank goodness it rains in Cornwall (and how it rains!). This is a fine, intelligent, fast read. It won't tax your mind, but it will leave it a little richer when you're done. I'm very chooseyabout the kind of fantasy I read and this, believe me, is amongst the very best you'll find."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"The Eternal Champion series consistently delivers excellent SF/Fantasy. The new editing really makes the entire series come together. Moorcock incorporates other personalities of the Eternal Champion to foreshadow other plots from books not yet published. This series is one of the best I have ever had the pleaseure to read. A definite thumbs up"},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Aged fourteen, The Knight of the Swords was the first Moorcock I ever read, in fact I read it before I read Tolkien. Moorcock remains for me the only fantasy writer who can compete with Tolkien in terms of the size and detail of the world he creates. In fact if anything Moorcock's world excels Tolkien's in its scope and weirdness.Readers of Moorcock will know of his concept of the Eternal Champion, that is that a series of heros who are all incarnations of each other and of his basic idea that the universe, or as Moorcock calls it the multiverse, is governed by the conflict between the forces of Law and Chaos. The idea being what is needed is a balance between the two.In this group of stories the champion is Corum a member of an elf like race who face extermination at the hands of humans. The story involves Corum in a series of battles for and against an assortment of men, demons, sorcerers and gods. The stories are fast paced and as usual Moorcock has the abilty to describe a person, a city or even a God in a couple of well chosen phrases.Remember this is fantasy do not expect any great truths about life to be explained but what you can expect is a great read from a writer who knows that fantasy writing is supposed to be fantastic."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"Moorcock is able to build a rich world through words and develop a hero you can easily identify with. As Corum's idealistic world is destroyed by the new evil lately come, you begin to desire revenge as much as the character. Moorcock explores many of the darker areas of the human mind through Corum who has never experienced such feelings as revenge and hatred. Although this is good solid fantasy, the shades of good and evil one finds in the best of Moorcock do not seem to be here. Good and evil are readily identified, the symbolism beats you over the head but this is an excellent contrast to &quot;Elric: Song of the Black Sword&quot; and &quot;A Nomad of the Time Streams&quot;."},{"Title":"Corum: The Coming Of Chaos (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 7)","review":"A good read and very pleaseing. The better aprts of the story are his &quot;no mercy&quot; attitude to the villians. That is a great example for ever fantasy and sci-fi writer. Not a perfect book cuz im so used to HUGE books that take 800 pages to finish so i zipped by this 400 page trilogy like there was no tomorrow.

It is a bit drawn out. I like Morgan, he is very interesting and I would say the same thing about Winthrop. But like Morgan sometimes does, he draws out Winthrop's story so much that you begin to forget what the original thesis was, a people striving to be perfect in an imperfect world. Morgan's thesis would have worked much more effectively as a Journal Article in the Journal of New England History. Although, Morgan's thesis might have been ground breaking in the 1960's, it is hardly earth shattering today. I didn't feel anymore educated about Puritans than I was before. It is a good book to reflect on how historians thought about 17th century New England before the 1960's but I didn't see much use for it beyond that. Morgan has made a fine argument, it is just too bad that it was so long winded that it could have been summed up in a journal entry."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This book was a requirement for my 11th grade gifted and talented english program.

They had to reconcile religious ideology with the day-to-day realities of governing a colony. The temptation to isolationism was one of Winthrop's challenges -- \\"We're godly so we can ignore the rest of the world.\\" In order to keep afloat they had to be practical -- selling salt cod to the papists -- first running Roger Williams out of the colony to Rhode Island and then helping Williams fight off the Indians, not because they wanted Williams to survive but because they didn't want Rhode Island to become part of the Dutch colony in Niew Amsterdam (New York)...Then all the difficulty of deciding how much of a role religion had in government, and the beginnings of a democratic process...

The world has thrown millions of immigrants onto American shores over the centuries, but those millions have never quite diluted out the foundational impact of those 20,000 that came during the great migration. Regrettably, most Americans are not born again, but because the founders of New England were biblically minded people, the United States has inherited the ideals of family values, education, care for the less fortunate, accountability in governnment, liberty of conscience, reward for hard work and honest business dealings. Among the nations, we still stand as a beacon of hope because of these ideals. God used a few people fully devoted to His Word to do marvelous works and a wonder.How exciting it is to watch the mind of Winthrop wrestle with the same issues that modern Christians wrestle with-how to best be salt and light TO the world without being OF the world. His response was to build a city on a hill, a New Jerusalem, a holy priesthood--and the world has never been the same."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"Edmund Morgan was an excellent writer, and it shows through in this book."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This book looked bring from the beginning, but a few paragraphs (and I do mean a few..) lifted up the story and made it interesting for the reader.

It was Winthrop who declared that the new colony would be as a city on a hill, a new example of community for the rest of the western world. Morgan shows that this statement masks the Puritans' somewhat melancholy desertion of the political revolution brewing back in England, and examines what the search for true community cost in terms of individual freedom as well. The contradictions in Winthrop himself mirror those of the entire Puritan colony and by extension America: what does freedom mean, and what is the proper role of the individual in society? How could a group looking for freedom of worship cast Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams out of their society? Morgan examined the issue of freedom many times, most definitively in American Slavery--American Freedom, but this short biography lays bare fundamental American problems with grace, concision, and a consistent point of view that debunks our culture's simplistic use of the &quot;puritan&quot; label. An intellectual bargain at only 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"I read this book many years ago for an American Literature class and am now rereading it for an American History class. I enjoyed it the first time and am enjoying it now. The writing is fluid, entertaining; the points made are profound. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about Winthrop and the early Puritan immigrants--a quick, pleasurable read."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This is an excellent overview of Winthrop and his Massachusetts Bay Colony. The author traces how John Winthrop struggled with the dilemma, first internally, as he dealt with the question of whether traveling to the New World represented a selfish form of \\"separatism\\", the desire to separate himself from an impure England, or whether, as he eventually determined, it offered a unique opportunity to set an example for all men by establishing a shining \\"City upon a Hill\\", a purer Christian community in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In this regard, it seems to have been of vital importance to Winthrop and his fellow Puritan colonists that they had the imprimatur of the King and that though they were physically distancing themselves from the Church of England, they were not actually renouncing it.The issues Winthrop faced are no different than what the Church still faces today (though perhaps seemingly less practical). That is, what is the normative and non-arbitrary basis for jurisprudence- Gods' law or autonomy? Gary North's books are particularly helpful in answering this, hopefully, rhetorical question. The sad reality is that most ecclesiastic officers and the Church as a whole are altogether unprepared to deal with the task presented to Winthrop because of their pessimillenialial views despite Christ's admonition that the (defensive!) Gates of Hades shall not prevail against His kingdom.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"Edmund S. Morgan is simply a wonderful historian and writer. As I get older I find I appreciate a writer who can get to the nub of his subject without blathering on for hundreds of unnecessary pages. This excellent short biography concisely tells the story of Winthrop's leading role in the Massachusetts Bay Colony established during the Great Migration of Puritans. Great books challenge us with new insights. Read this book and leave your preconceptions of Puritans behind."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"People often bemoan or praise the \\"Puritan work ethic\\" and the Puritan character as being judgemental (true), hardworking (true) and joyless (not true). For better or worse, the Puritans are so much at the core of the American character that it is fascinating to delve into the details of how they came to the New World and what they did. As an agnostic reader, I have no opinion of his religious beliefs, but John Winthrop's self-discipline, focus and all-round ability are fascinating. He was the original Go To guy, I suppose. I especially like the way they figured out how to govern themselves. I am sure if I was assigned this book in high school or college I would write similar reviews as many of the previous ones; but as a 50-year-old who is interested in American social history, I think this book is a winner, and Edmund Morgan is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This book recounts the struggle between Politics and Ideals, the Practical and the Spiritual. It isn't true that the ancestors of our country were incorruptible, etc. etc., that the old times were better. Not a bit boring for anyone who reads history. Fascinating and educational."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"An interesting look at the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the remarkable character who lead it for most of its first couple decades. It seems easier for many people to view the Puritans as stereotypes rather than real people, but they're more interesting as flesh and blood human beings living in the real world. Considering their importance to American beginnings, it's probably wiser to try to understand them as real people. They were amazing in some respects, misguided in others, but they got New England going, along with Harvard, Yale and a powerful commitment to literacy and education. They also started representative government in the New World, at least in the northern British colonies, and they had a leader of rare abilities in Winthrop. This is a part of American history that's perhaps more relegated to either caricature or the dustbin than any other, and that's to our loss in understanding our roots and their continuing effects on our society."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This book is a good overview of Puritanism in England and New England in the first half of the 17th century, especially the role of John Winthrop in establishing a Puritan commonwealth in the vicinity of Boston, Mass under the auspices of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1630. Little time is spent on day-to-day living conditions in the new Mass. Bay colony - and they were harsh.Much of the book is concerned with the subtle but explosive differences in Puritan thought that Winthrop was forced to deal with: Separatism, Presbyterianism (hierarchical, inclusive) vs. Congregationalism (flat, independent, & exclusive), or such deviating thought as Arminianism and Antinomiansim. In some cases, diffident residents were banned from the colony, such as Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.In addition, the author shows the gradual inclusion of adult male church members in the governance of the colony from the original conception of only the few members of the Company exercising absolute control. The author maintains that the basics of church-state separation existed, yet there is no doubt that both sectors were concerned with rooting out and punishing ungodly behavior. The author shows that the survival of the colony owed a lot to Winthrop as he resisted tendencies of some towards separatism and purity - in other words, fanaticism. At times he was voted out of the governor's office, but the colony always returned to him.A rather understated aspect of the book is any real feel for living in a totally religious community under constant surveillance and the superiority of those who wish to judge who had been saved or not (or worse). Somehow the spread of that mindset into representative government is not especially heartwarming. The myopic idea that a pure, godly community, superior to others, could be established plagues us even today."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"This brief and dense history of John Winthrop's Boston is a must-read for folks interested in colonial life in America. Beginning with the formation of the Massachusetts Bay Company in England, and following them to the new world and the new struggles that accompany their arrival, historical juggernaut Edmund Morgan paints an unfamiliar picture of John Winthrop.Often depicted as a fundamentalist zealot, Morgan's Winthrop is a more pragmatic puritan - one willing to make compromises in favor of trade, diplomacy, or popular support. Winthrop's struggles with his own people are also highlighted throughout the book, particularly in the roller coaster of on-again, off-again governorship between him and his rivals.The book also clarifies the objectives and different types of puritanism, which I, as a student of history, found very helpful in understanding the religious landscape of Englands both new and old.The one downside to the work is the style in which it's written. As an early work of Morgan's, he had not yet found the compelling, conversational voice which he is today known for, resulting in an academic tone that makes reading a bit tedious at times. Regardless, the thorough research and interesting subject matter more than makes up for it."},{"Title":"The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop (Library of American Biography)","review":"While this book is an excellent biography of John Winthrop, Massachusetts' first Governor, it is also an excellent review of the various types of Puritanism and the issues faced by Winthrop and others in their American experiment to found and develop a colony based on Scripture. Morgan gives a very balanced portrait of Winthrop: his genius and his foibles. While looking closely at the Puritanism of the Massachusetts colony, Edmund S. Morgan, also show the Puritanism of England and its leaning toward Presbyterianism and the dangers of seperatism that were very threatening to Winthrop and his supporters. Overall, this is a very readable and entertaining biography that looks at the development of Winthrop's thought from his youth in England to his great contributions to Massachusetts' survival."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"We are a certified mold remediation company. This is an excellent book for the home owner or property manager. If you ever had a water damage and noticed mold growing you need to read this book. It's an easy quick read and very understandable. The author has done a great job. Well worth the price and could save you thousands of dollars in remediation and repairs. Proper mold remediation by a qualified professional can cost from $3,000 to tens of thousands of dollars. It could also cost you your entire house not to mention your health. This book will put you on the right track to making an educated decision on how to proceed if you have mold."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"This book is an easy read, and I finished it in a few days. Part One - Introduction to Molds explains fungi groups; fungi reproduction; common molds found in buildings; and 'the enemies of mold'. Along the way, Richard Progovitz adds interesting historical facts about mold, such as the discovery of penicillin. I would compare this to an introductory text book, but it's certainly livelier than anything I read in college.Part Two talks about the health symptoms associated with mold and has a good description of allergic reactions to mold. The book has a good, but general, description of problem molds and some reactions.Section Three is Molds and the Home. Among the usual culprits for mold, did you know mold can enter your house attached to a pet? I particularly liked Mr. Progovitz' discussion of mold and recreational vehicles, an issue I never considered.Section Four discussed Mold Remediation Issues. There are plenty of photos showing collection techniques and laboratory testing methods. Mr. Progovitz clearly explains the difference between viable and non-viable testing. He is a strong proponent of borate for mold remediation."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"Book on mold should be required reading for all homeowners as well as those living in apartments. The serious health effects on mold are overwhelming . . . explains what mold is, how it it can effect you, and what to do about getting rid of it. This is an excellent book. I am recommending it to all my patients."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"I was expecting this book to be very technical and difficult to understand. To my surprise it wasn't. I was amazed at the useful information given about mold and the levels one must take to eliminate it. The author presents his topic in a very concise, logical format, and uses pictures and illustrations to aid the reader's understanding. The book is quick and easy and everyone will find it informative. It is obvious that the author is very knowledgeable about mold and has researched the topic extensively. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"This book delivers. Full of practical info for homeowners how to deal with molds and prevent them. And what to expect from professional remediation. But also plenty of scientific and amusing historical facts to make it a very interesting read. (I have almost used up my highlighter.) The writer's love for fungi in the form of mushrooms is counterbalanced by his crusade against household molds."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"This book is one of the best on the subject of mold and what to do about it. I have purchased other books on the same topic, but frankly they didn't impress me much. And after I finished reading them I felt like they hadn't really been helpful.But this book was a pleasant surprise. It's a quick read, and it's interesting. The author is knowedgable, and a certified and registered mold inspector. He provides very specific and practical information to the reader.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for good, helpful information on the subject of mold and how to deal with it."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"As an environmental professional, I am pleased to find such a well-writtrn and informative book on mold. This work gives the reader a clear understanding of the basics of the ocurrence, sampling, and remediation of toxic mold in enough detail to help home owners to avoid the serious mistakes often made by people when dealing with toxic mold. The author obviously knows what he is talking about and has a real concern for health and welfare of people with mold problems. I have no problem recommending this book highly to anyone needing to know about black mold."},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"I recently moved out of a house that was infested with Toxic Mold and knew nothing about how to deal with the problem. Now, I've done extensive research on the subject and keep coming back to this book for the right answers. Most research papers and books on this subject are not understandable unless you have a PHd. This book is written to be understood by every day people. In my opinion it's the best book on the market on the subject of Toxic Mold.Michael Dean"},{"Title":"Black Mold: Your Health and Your Home","review":"This book is informative while being easy to read and understand. It clearly lists the standards that reputable mold inspecters meet. I liked the sections giving behaviors that contribute to mold growth like opening windows when it's raining, not venting the humity from a shower outside, using a standard vacuum cleaner polluting indoor air, and keeping basements and crawl spaces unvented."},{"Title":"My Mother's Cookbook","review":"A fascinating, delightful and beautifully presented cookbook. Truly a work of art. This is pictoral, historical and culinary masterpiece tracing the journey of a family of European immigrants into full-blooded Americans over three generations, featuring the very recipes that fed them along the way. Intriguing, spellbinding and just plain scrumptious, this cookbook is a 'must have.' Often given as a gift (with great feedback). Creates high interest among my club members and friends. Now left out on the dining table as a 'conversation piece.' Never fails to fascinate. Excellect Choice!!!"},{"Title":"A treasury of Jewish humor","review":"This magnificent collection of Jewish writings contains much more than jokes. It also has short stories by such famous writers as the Nobel Prize winner S. J. Agnon, Dorothy Parker, S. J. Perlman, Heinrich Heine, Sholom Aleichem, Sholem Asch, I. L. Peretz, Chaim Nachman Bialik, Yehuda Halevi, and many others. There are short stories, poems, excerpts from novels, witty sayings, and a lot more.Examples of jokes are:Ma, can I wash my hair with kerosene and put on my sky-blue dress and go to the library? All right, darling, and see that you get yourself a young man, like the rest of the girls: it's about time.A disciple sought the advice of his rabbi. \\"I'm poor, rabbi. My wife is sick and my children are hungry.\\" \\"Go home. God will help you,\\" advised the rabbi. \\"Thank you, thank you, rabbi!\\" gushed the poor man gratefully. \\"I'm sure God will help me! But until He does, would you be good enough to lend me five rubles?\\"Examples of witticisms are:One always brings a good appetite to someone else's feast.A rich man's daughter is always a beauty.Some people grow tall by standing on the shoulders of others.He who has been bitten by a snake will be scared by a piece of rope.It is the way of a dog that if he is hit by a stone he bites a fellow dog.An example of good advice:What is the test of good manners?

Why do we need a sequel?"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Darci is supposedly on the look out for famous actor Linc's son, and has been in mourning ever since her husband Adam and sister in law Bodiccea have gone missing.The book is a total sham as both a mystery and as any sort of a love story.The hero Linc is African American, and there are so many racist remarks in the book even while the author is trying to be earnest about the terrible treatment of slaves in the past, that I found it totally offensive. And I am not Af-Am.Add to that the sex play between the two and her voyeurism as he has sex with the woman who supposedly murdered his friend, and we have a really revolting book.Even worse is again the premise in Forever of evil people kidnapping children to use for their own sick purpose, with no thought as to how offensive this is. This author should definitely spend some time working for a Missing person's/children's hotline if she thinks to make money from this as something 'etnertaining.'The end of the book is so rushed it does not tie up all the loose ends, only goes on to try to show how she can get the power to get Adam back-by becoming more evil herself. We never see Adam in the book at all, the supposedly happy marriage etc that we were left with at the end of the last novel, so the whole thing is just pointless drivel with a heroine with and an almost anti-hero in the constantly horny Linc even trying to have sex with various ghosts (including 4 at one time!!) who have all of the characterization of cardboard cut outs.This and forever were the first two books I tried by Deveraux; I will never read one of this author's novels again."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I have read almost every book by Jude Deveraux and have enjoyed them all, with the exception of this book and the first book in this series, Forever. I dislike this one so much, I haven't even finished it and I don't think I will. I would not categorize this book as a romance but science fiction. I admire her for trying something new,but she should stick with writing romances."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I was a fan for years, but I've found several of Jude's more recent books to be lacking in quality. Maybe I'm just getting older and my tastes have changed, but in my opinion, she used to be much better at making the reader connect with the characters. Most of her characters lately are one dimensional and boring, and the stories aren't believable. Sad as it is to say, I'm not likely to purchase any more of her books."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"it's by Jude Deveraux. The back cover blurb is rather hokey, and it's a sequel, but Forever and Always is by JD so I snapped it up. Jude does not disappoint in providing yet another scrumptious fairy tale for us grown up girls. While this is not my favorite of her books, it still makes an excellent bedtime story (if I start reading hours before bedtime that is, because a little thing like needing sleep is not going to make me put it down.)Note - this is a sequel, read Forever first.Also, don't expect a romance book, it is a well written, well paced, amusing, Jude Devereaux paranormal mystery.Fun light read."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I can't believe I am going to say this, but I actually want to burn these books. This is the worst trilogy I have ever read. I have read books by Jude D. before and that is why I bought the Forever Trilogy. These books have to be the worst I have ever read. I feel like a child saying this, but they are dumb. Save your time & money."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I used to love Jude Deveraux!

What happened to you Jude?DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I have read and collected every one of Jude Deveraux's books. She is the ultimate storyteller, and a gifted writer. I would love to see an end to this trend of late to write &quot;murder, she wrote&quot; type stories and have her return to the heartwarming and romantic novels of her earlier style. These included &quot;spirits&quot;, ghosts, angels and time travel themes - not a disappointment in the bunch!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"When I read Forever... I was a bit disappointed because it moved so quickly and Jude didn't really develope the characters the way she usually does. Not to mention the ending that just kind of left you going \\"that's all?\\" Well if I had known that it was merely the begining of a very complex and involved series I might not have felt so deprived. In Forever and Always we meet Darci again. Now, a lot of readers didn't like her in the first book but I thought she was adorable. I loved how she was in her own little innocent universe, and so child-like. Well now, years later, she's not so childish anymore after of all the pain she has recently been through. Adam is missing, but I'm not even going to get into that..... Darci soon joins up with Linc to help him find his son who, like Adam, has vanished. The relationship between Darci and Linc is highly amusing and very erotic though completely platonic of course. Jude wrote the book in the first person with the chapters alternating back and forth between Darci's point of view and Linc's. I liked this because it made me feel like I understood them better, and also kept me laughing at the way each characters mind worked. Now much like Forever there are many supernatual things that occur and stuff that doesnt get explained, though I have hopes that all of it will tie together by the end of the series. Even though Darci is the heroine of the series the star of this book is Linc. I loved him, and I hope he's in the next books as well or maybe even his own book. The ending let's you know just how complex everything will get before the Forever Series will end, and leaves you eager for the next book. To make matters worse there is a preview for the third book in the back, which only serves to confuse you even more then you already were. I hope you enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"We love Jude Deveraux's books and have strived to make sure we had them on hand for reading again and again."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I has been a while since I read this trilogy but I remember going crazy trying to find all of the books."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"The mystic appeal in this book is interesting. It creates a different story approach when at times stories can become the same old thing. There is more mystery than in most of the books by Deveraux. Excellent character development adds to the entertainment of the book.I do not care for books that require one to get the next in order to finish the story.People who like romance, mystery and mystic stories will enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I am never let down when I read her books- infact since discovering her writtings, I like the suspence and romance, I now have read all she has written as they come out. great reading material"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Another one of her great books.

As always service was great."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"The service from this vendor was great. The book gave me hours of great reading."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Normally I would not enjoy a book that is separated by two characters. Meaning that every other chapter is about Darci and the other ones about Linc. Usually this would be frustrating and confusing because my mind would cling to a particular character and would want to follow them. With \\"Forever and Always\\" I found that I loved both main characters and was able to keep track of the story and its twists and turns. This is an excellent book written by someone who obliviously knows exactly what she is doing!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I liked Forever - okay, I didn't love it, but it was a good book, interesting reading. With Forever and Always - things start to change.First of all, this is not even a tiny drop a romance novel. I don't like the hero (hero??) what is he exactly?? and I don't like the storyline.In this story, Darci is alone, Adam is missing - either dead or something, the book mysteriously hints something about being under ice. In my opinion, a romance novel is not supposed to end with the hero being under ice, and the heroine - that's Darci - being told that her marriage is not important, it's her mission in life that's more important. That's strike one for me - romance novels are supposed to be happily ever after, in my opinion.This book doesn't seem to go anywhere. There's a mystery, Darci has to use her psychic powers to solve the mystery. That's it. Along the way she gets to meet all kinds of ghosts and beings - who tell her that she has to solve this to go further in some kind of game. This book seems to me to be somewhat of a filler between two books - Forever - and presumably a third book. Nothing much happens in this book, at least to Darci and Adam. That's strike two.Strike three, this book is so unrealistic as to be ridiculous. In Forever, although Darci comes across as well, different, she seems normal, just a little psychic. Here, I feel like I fell down Alice's hole. She seems to have presumably worked on her gifts to enhance them (is that possible? I thought that psychics were like either born, or not, at least that's how they're usually portrayed). In this book, she does come across like a real freak. It's hard to believe that her psychic gifts have become so much more in just a few years - well, to me it's really unrealistic. The first novel, you get the feeling that it COULD be true - the things she does are not SO SO much out of the ordinary. And that she's also a real person, who just happens to have some gifts. In Forever and Always, she's not real anymore, she turns into a freak, or a heroine out of a ghost novel.Also, I really hated the hero - I forgot his name - plus, he doesn't seem to have any role at all except as a sidekick to Darci while Adam is missing - he doesn't turn into the hero or anything, so what's he doing there?This was the first book I have read by JD that I really didn't like."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I have a co-worker at work that lent me this book to read. After reading it I have determined that I can't wait till the next book to come out. my co-worker was suppose to lend me forever but has forgotten about it. Even with that I found it quite easy to follow the plot as well as the characters involved, without having had to read forever. if you like a little of the supper natural (ESP), with a little suspense thrown in then this is basically the book for you. Enjoy is all I can say. I couldn't put it down!!!!!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"This book is excellent...but you have to read FOREVER to understand it otherwise you will be completly lost. It kept my attention until the end. You have to have an active imagination for this book and a sense of humor. Without you will not like this book."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I really enjoyed Jude's first novel in this series, Forever, except for the ending. It fell a little flat. The second book Forever and Always, jumps around too much. It leaves us asking too many questions at the end of the book. I realize there is going to be a third book, but I'm left too confused about certain people and what part they are playing in the story. If you're looking for romance try A Knight in Shining Armour, or my personal favourite Sweet Liar (there's a little bit of mystery in this one)."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Well, I am a BIG Jude fan, I have read EVERY book she has ever written, however, I am here to tell ya, I am not going to buy another of her books automatically. This book promised so much, but delivered so little, yeah Adam and Bo are missing, nothin gets resolved with that. She doesn't get ANY information about them at all, just that her helping someone else MAY lead her to her beloved husband.That's another thing. If he is so beloved, what in the hell is she doin lusting after another man throughout the whole book? I mean seriously, I am married, I am NOT saying that I don't look at nice looking men, but I do NOT actively lust after them.I know she is supposed to be human, but sheesh, every other page? She was lookin at his butt, abs, shoulders, pecs, etc. If she wants him so much, then jump on him and just leave Adam to his fate. I did enjoy parts of this book but it just...stopped suddenly with nothing else happening. Wham!! And then the blurb about the next in the series. And, from what I can see, it has NOTHING to do with Darci, Adam, Bo, or even Linc. GRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I selected this book randomly off the shelf at the bookstore. I was really desperate for a good book. I was an avid reader of JD's earlier work (Velvet Series, Knight in Shining Armor)and loved them all. I've really tried to get into the new way she's writing with little success. So now I've read the book I chose and I was very surprised. I actually liked it. I love the way the whole story is written in 1st person. It's like you actually experience what the characters are feeling. With the 3rd person POV it's hard to *really* get to know a character. I absolutley loved Linc. This is the first &quot;romance&quot; novel that I have read with one of the main characters being African-American. It's quite refreshing to read something different than the norm. You get time-travel, ghosts, villians, and other characters wrapped up into one neat little book.Other reviews have stated that you have to read Forever first. This isn't true. I did not read Forever (I probably will go back and read it though) and understand everything that was going on. Not once was I lost or found something hard to understand.Just remember, so you won't be disappointed later on, this book, or any of her newer books, is NOTHING like her earlier work. The book's spine says romance, but it definately is not that. It's a really good story about a woman looking for her husband."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I wish I could have had some of that True Persuasion to make me like this book. If it wasnt' for the fact that I have never not finished a book I started, I would have thrown this in the fire. Now, Im disappointed that I didn't. A complete waste of my time. I have never finished a book and felt mad and confused at the same time. Horrible Ms. Deveraux! And I am a huge fan!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Jude D has always been one of my favorite all time authors but her last few books have been a total waste!

While I'll agree that the style is very different from the way she's written, I did think it was an excellent follow-up to &quot;Forever&quot;, which I also enjoyed. I wouldn't recommend reading this book without reading &quot;Forever&quot;, but I do believe that fans of Devereux's new writing style will find this to be an engaging and fun read."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"If you had not read this book before Forever... than you would have wanted to read it later!

Try that on for size!!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I didn't realize it was number two of a trilogy so I haven't read the first book, but I can't wait for the third. I like this author because she has more mystery than fluff. Her books are always a good read, they have mystery or completely heartfelt stories and characters. I thought that this novel was just as good. I think the switching back and forth between characters was different and took some getting used to but it did not detract from the book in the least. As for the story, i loved getting the next clue, and couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happened next. My only disapointment was that the story really didn't end, but then I didn't realize it was a trilogy, knowing that I can't wait for the last book. I don't know if this would truly be classified as a romance. i think that it would becuase she is being driven by love, however it does not follow the usual &quot;romance&quot; formula and I like that, a lot. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because at the end things happen so fast that it's a little hard to folllow and may need a little bit of re reading but just because it happened fast does not mean that it was not good."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I made the same mistake as a lot of people, started with this one first. I still got into it. Its part of a four book saga according to a couple Jude websites. People complain of no ending, because there isn't an ending. Forever and Always ended with her searching for her husband still, and she will in the next book. Forever and Always leaves you hanging wondering where her husband is. I didnt really like Lincoln. He was annoying. Its kind of frusterating being left hanging, I'd like to see her get her husband back, but I have to wait for the next books."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"This was a good book, a sequel to Forever. Picked it up expecting some conclusion, but there was none! I assume another in the series is coming, although it appears Holly was published next, which is not really a sequel at all. I wouldn't read this book until the next comes out as it really, really, leaves you hanging."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I have not read her first book Forever. I don't usually read non-historical romances, and I really LOVE Ms. Deverauxs romance historical romanance works-especially \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\". This plot looked interesting, so I asked for it for Christmas. The main female character has supernatural powers which include blowing people's minds up (happened in first book it says). The story starts off that despite having these powers, she can not locate her husband or sister in-law. In addition, due to a sleazy writer of a tabloid, she has been accussed in the media of killing them for their money. Though her family and the law know she did not, it does not make her less afraid to go out of her house-which makes it difficult when a TV celebrity asks her to find his son, which also has dissappeared mysteriously. The story has ghosts, lost loves, and some sexual tension between the two characters, but it is NOT a love story. It is a story about a quest and the self awareness of the main female character. It alludes to a higher power and the book does not end-she still needs to find her husband. The story is compelling, and worth a read, but if you are looking for a romance-pass it up. If you are looking for something else to give your brain, then give this a shot. Just be reminded that you may need to pick up her next book to find out what happens..."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I'm so glad I purchased this \\"book\\" used. I absolutely hated this book, it is one of the worst I've ever read.Darci is on a mission to find her year-long lost wealthy husband and sister-in-law. After their disappearance, the public seems to think, a money hungry, Darci killed the old boy. In response to negative public opinion, she has become a virtual recluse. Enter, a handsome young TV star who is looking for his \\"never before seen\\" son. He enlist the help of Darci, who among other things, has the \\"gift of sight\\". Darci feels helping the TV star will put her on the right path in her search. So off they go on their weird adventure. Most of the novel takes place in a depressing spa that is filled with old biddies packing a \\"hit list\\". Each one wants someone they depise to die from a horrible illness.(told you it was weird). The \\"spa\\" is actually a renovated plantation haunted by many, many, many ghosts. If you read this mess, you'll find out whether the handsome hunk finds his boy, and whether Darci finds her long lost relatives. The author tells repeatedly, how much Darci, old girl, is missing the \\"romance\\". I mean after all, it has been a year. She and all the other women at the spa are lusting after the hunk. The plot is so far-fetched, but the horrendous writing is the real reason I hated this book. Nothing flows, JD goes from one idea to the next. She's all over the place. Her writing style is extremely choppy. If you do decide to read this book--prepare yourself to be exhausted."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"is okay.I love the character of Darci.But, the book just lacks something.After finding the love of her life in FOREVER, he is nowhere to be seen in the second book.I like her relationship with her co-hort this time around, the gorgeous tv star Linc Aimes. She, like everyone else appreciates his beauty. I'm still not quite sure how appropriate that is for a woman whose beloved husband is missing. Aside from that their adventure is fun.Warning: nothing really is ever resolved in any of the trilogy.Still, the first two are enjoyable reads. I doubt if I will re-read them again, though."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I don't like the \\"trilogy\\" format, simply because there isn't a \\"happy ending\\" to the book - the format makes me buy 2 more books before there is a conclusion to the story line. In the 1st of this \\"trilogy\\", there WAS a happy ending, the book definitely came to a conclusion. (A conclusion that I, as a reader, enjoyed reading! As a reader, I didn't even realize there would be another and another until AFTER the 2nd came out.) Yet, here in the 2nd, Ms. Deveraux tossed away that happy ending, and then tossed the readers into the middle of another mess (notice that I didn't write \\"fine mess\\"?).I don't like her new formats. Give us more of the \\"old\\" Deveraux... good stories, good books, happy endings, or at least something to make the reader feel the price was justified."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"This lacks the suspence that the first book of this trilogy had.

When I first started reading this I was a bit apprehensive because I thought that Ms. Deveraux was goin to pair Darcy with Linc. Which doesn't happen.

Darci says she is not sure where they are, but becomes angry when Linc makes a nasty comment. She stops herself before she kills him for trashing her powers. Linc realizes she killed in self-defense the witches who feared her potential power but she didn't murder her husband or mother as the media insisted.Darci and Linc travel to 13 Elms, an Alabama spa that formerly housed slaves, as this is where the mother of his son last worked. Darci tells Linc there are ghosts of nineteenth century slaves who want to find their kin, but one particular essence is different. Devlin can fully manifest himself. He tells Darci and Linc that she will get closer to finding her husband Adam if she helps Linc and he must give the slave ghosts what they want if he is to succeed. Now the quest begins.Though reading ALWAYS would help in understanding Darci, this remains an intriguing paranormal tale containing ghosts, healing, and other psychic powers. The story line alternates first person narration between Linc and Darci, and is loaded with action yet still feels like a middle book. FOREVER AND ALWAYS is a fine tale that will enhance Jude Deveraux's already lofty reputation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I have every book Jude Deveraux has written. That tells you how much I love her work. But the last 4 books have been disappointing. &quot;The Mulberry Tree&quot; started out great but dissolved into a mystery novel. &quot;Forever&quot;, with it's take-turn \`voice overs' and a female lead that I found I couldn't really care about. (She was more annoying than anything else). Not the strong women leads Deveraux is known for. (This \`he said-she said' continues in &quot;Wild Orchids&quot;. Again a mystery novel rather than romance and nothing about the Taggerts or Montgomerys). Then &quot;Forever and Always&quot;. The same annoying her turn/his turn and just a filler novel until the third &quot;Always&quot; book comes out to finish the story. There seems to be a running &quot;I really want sex&quot; theme throughout these 4. I noticed in her biography bit at the back of the book she seems to be unmarried/divorced and lives with her small son. If that's what it takes to bring back the old Jude Deveraux writing, take Jackie Maxwell's advice in &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; - 'I decided I needed to start dating'."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I did.I found it very amusing, and not a serious story it was laughable. I like your books, this was very good. I read forever first like I hope everyone else who read this book took the time to do the samething.So Jude, now, don't let a little bad press, stop you from writing about how she finds her husband, and where is her Daddy? what happen to Lincoln? It was a cute story, but you have to do your thing on the next book cause I know how to be a disagreeable reader as well as next person. So Write away, Jude , Write away."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I won't go into the plot as several other reviewers have already done so. I just wish I had read a review prior to picking up this book, it was so not worth my time. If I had realized it was a sequel, I surely would not have picked it out. It's not even a sequel, just a middle stop in a series to come...I didn't like the heroine, she is an simpleton/idiot...seems weak...who can be this simple? Why would I want to read about her? Where is the romance? Where is the hero? Her husband is missing and that's it...she is pining and that's the romance story? She is a weakling who sends her children away to be raised by relatives.What is the point of this story? I read romances for escapism, and fun, not to be reminded of the pain and misery in society, children kidnapped for instance, for that I simply can turn on the news any day of the week.If, as a couple of reviewers have implied, this is a journey of a woman's growth story, we can do alot better than this. And it should not be characterized as a romance novel when I go to the bookstore.Linc? He was a travesty. A cliche\` on so many levels, the sexy black man, who is forbidden, and the women are lusting after his \\"beauty.\\" The oversexed/sexy black man cliche. He had sex with ghosts! Because he needed sex so badly, which she kept referring to, Darci read his sex vibes constantly, was titillated by them...what a loser! Spare me! And if I want to read about slavery and the injustices of it, I am not going to the Romance section of the bookstore. SLAVERY WAS A BAD THING. Thanks Jude Deveraux for pointing that out, I would never have known otherwise.Then there was no ending...I mean Linc finds his son, but to find out where her husband is, we have to read the next book, or maybe there will be one after that? If Jude D. wanted to have a heroine who went on adventures using her powers, she shouldn't have hooked her up and married in the first book...and the character should be more interesting and stronger than Darci...Anyway, I have digressed wildly here, the point is I would give it no stars and do not recommend this. I used to be a Jude Deveraux fan years ago and A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR is one of my all time favorite romance books in life. This book and character were just a simple waste of time/money."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I love Jude D. I even liked the first book of this series. Rememberance is my favorite romance novel of all time. The main male character in this book was simply horrible. A bundle of offensive stereotypes. Linc is the gorgeous black man with this cold hearted black girlfriend and he is secretly in love with white women. As a black women I was offended. I love romance novels Nora Roberts is great because she sticks with what she knows she is white and Irish most of her characters are the same. I love sci fi so I read Laurell K Hamilton who is female short and very pale most of her main characters are the same. I am not saying ones charcters cant be diverse but if you want to write about a character who you mostly cannot relate to at least do some research not what you see on tv and hear on the radio but talk to people."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I like many other have read all of Jude Deveraux's books. And I too agree that her latest books have not been good at all. Maybe she needs to start over with a new line of family or something. But definately more romance. I have now resorted to trying a different author.I am only 1/2 way through this book but I'm forcing myself to finsih it since I started it. I did read the first book. It was okay but still not like any of her other books.If anyone wants books like her try Julie Garwood...some of her are excellant."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I love this book I thought it was fantastic. people keep saying the characters were weak i don't understand how they were weak i thought they were great characters and Darci sounded very realistic. I like this story better then most of her books. don't get me wrong i love all her books i have read. expecially the new ones. Keep up the great stories i cant wait for the next to come out in the Forever series."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I always enjoy reading a Jude Devereux book and this one held my interest, but the story did not match the description on the inside cover. It said she was teaming up with the FBI in exchange for their help in finding Adam. What happened there?Also, when I read Forever, I did not realize it was going to be a series."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I picked the book before a long flight, because I generally like Ms. Deveraux.But this one was dissapointing and weak from the beginning. The way it is written, one chapter told by Darci, the next by Linc, is interesting. But the plot is lacking in structure. Darci's psychic powers are used as an explanation of the characters' personalities, but in the end, they come out boring, silly and utterly void.Not worth the price of the book, at all."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"True, it wasn't the typical JD romance novel, but I have enjoyed the way she has branched out over the years. If I wanted to read another Velvet series I would have reread them. If that's what you're after, skip the Forever series because they definitely are something altogether different. Forever and it's sequel Forever and Always are a refreshing new direction for JD."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Once again, Ms. Deveraux has provided a story that is both different and refreshing. I finished this book understanding a lot more about Darci's actions and why she behaves as she does in the previous book, Forever. Linc was a wonderful and interesting new addition to the story line, and I hope to see him again in the future. Hats off to the author for being brave enough to write a male lead of African American descent outside the Multicultural market.Like Forever, Forever and Always is a departure from the Romance genre norm, but in a good way. I love traditional romance novels, but I also think it's nice to read something different every now and then. The one thing I had difficulty adjusting to is the heroine lusting after a man other than the hero, however, I tried to keep an open mind and it didn't detract from the story as a whole. Overall, I thought Forever and Always was interesting and entertaining, and I am anxiously awaiting the next installment."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"First off, I love to read Jude Deveraux and didn't think Forever was up to her standards. The sequel, Forever and Always, is the worst material I've read from her. I'm very disappointed in these two books and don't plan on going for the next one. The story line jumps around between Linc and Darci. Linc's character doesn't develop well and Darci is on a goose chase while having no real presence in the book. At least in Forever, she had a little zip and chemistry. I think Ms. Deveraux is trying to expand her writing and is excluding what made her exciting to read."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Being a loyal Jude Deveraux reader and fan, I buy every book that she has written, but when I first bought this book I was a little skeptical because I don't generally like books in this genre that are written in the first person but when I started to read, I was hooked! It took me one day to read this book because I couldn't put it down. If you enjoyed Ms. Deveraux's new books, then you will probably like this book as well. It may not have as much romance in it, but what it is not lacking is Ms. Deveraux rioutous sense of humor.I gave this book four stars because some places in the plot were a little sloppy and Linc's obsession with [physical activity] had me rolling my eyes in a couple of places, but overall it was a very enjoyable story with very enjoyable characters."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Forever and Always is book two of the Forever Trilogy; the story of Adam and Darci Montgomery. In book one, Forever, Adam hires Darci as an assistant as he investigates his kidnapping when he was a child and the death of his parents. As far as Darci is concerned, she is there to raise money to get her hometown out of debt and thus freeing her from the obligation of having to marry the son of the wealthiest man there.Darci has always known there was something \\"weird\\" about her. She could locate things and people that were lost and sometimes could perceive what would happen in the future. These abilities shamed her and she tried to hide it.Once her and Adam were together, Darci discovered that her abilities made her special and she could use them to aid Adam in his investigation. Forever climaxes with the ultimate confrontation between Adam, Darci and the powerful witch who murdered Adam's parents. Adam also discovers that he has a sister, named Boadicea, who was kidnapped at birth and is being held captive by the witch.Darci kills the witch's minions and the witch herself with her abilities and saves the day. Forever closes when Darci and Adam, and Darci's Dad and Boadicea, marry and both give birth to two very gifted little girls.Forever and Always opens with the news that Adam and Boadicea have disappeared and Darci has been publicly accused of murdering them for the Montgomery money. In the midst of this, Darci's mother sends a renowned actor, named Lincoln Aimes, to Darci for help in locating his missing son.Darci, at first refuses to help, but then changes her mind when she senses that by helping Lincoln, she'll get closer to solving the mystery of Adam and Boadicea's disappearance.The rest of the story is really to pave the way for Darci to meet the most powerful human being on earth, psychically of course. His name is Henri and he's a very old man who has only a few months to live. His goal is to test Darci and see if she is deserving of his abilities.The story, of course, ends in a happy ending and with Darci passing Henri's test with flying colors, but she is no closer to discovering what happened to her husband. That mystery will finally be solved in the third book of the trilogy: Always.I, uh, was easily pulled into the story in the beginning. It was a bit slow going at first as Darci explains what happens in the first part of the Trilogy and the events that occurred since Adam and Boadicea disappeared. The pace picks up toward the middle of the big but then it begins to lag again, bogged down as it covers Henri's background and his purpose for testing Darci. There are also a lot of subplots that Darci and Lincoln have to wade through to get to their main goal: the recovery of his son and the discovery of the clues that point to what happened to Adam and Boadicea.This book takes some patience to get through and I highly recommend that you not start on it until you've read the first book. Despite the tedium, Darci did begin to grow on me. I realized what a strong character she is, simple yet complex, fragile yet strong. I only wish the story were better written to support such a great character."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"This book was ok. It wasn't as good as Forever but I loved reading about Darci again. Darci was in a funk in this book. Maybe that's why I didn't like it as well as Forever. Why was the book written as it was written with every other chapter first person alternating Link and Darci? Link didn't appeal to me. I missed Adam as much as Darci. I am buying the last book of the triligy because I am curious.I love Jude Deveraux's books. She has quite an imagination and isn't afraid to use it."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. The first book in the forever series was intriguing, suspenseful, and had just the right amount of romance. I was anxious to read Forever &amp; Always because I thought it would be just as good if not better than Forever. Wow, was I wrong! This book was horrible! It focused way too much on racism and the story itself was choppy. I'm not sure if I'll be getting the next book in the Forever series because, frankly, if it's as bad as this one, I don't want to waste my money!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Jude Deveraux gets more and more entertaining. I could sit (and have) and entire weekend and read all her books! She gets better and better (like a fine wine).This is a book that will keep you entertained if not poised on the edge of your seat. It is witty and well written.The suspense is well though out, but the end was too abrupt...almost an anti-climax! But she does set the stage for a third book."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"After enjoying the first of the Forever books, I was looking forward to this follow-up. However, the book did not fully live up to my expectations. Written in the first-person, the book confusingly switches from Linc's point-of-view to Darci's every other chapter. This makes following the story difficult and hard to remember who is talking. The character development is also very sketchy. However, the humor evident in the first book is also present in this one. There were many wonderful repartees between the two characters that were very funny. Obvious set-up for a series of Forever books."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I absolutely loved this book! After reading the first book, Forever, I was hooked. When I found Forever and Always, the sequal, on the shelves, I knew I was in for another great read. I wasn't in the least disappointed! Jude Deveraux's latest paranormal/mystery/romance is a page-turner that was impossible to set down. I was delighted to find out that book three is in the works. Darci's fans will be entertained from beginning to end as she uncovers more of her psychic abilities and her destiny begins to unravel."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"First, what happened to Adam -he is the only person from the first book I liked.

I fell in love with this storyline and can't wait for the next book in the series to come out."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I was interested to see what had happened to the main characters since \\"Forever,\\" so I picked up this book. It is a big disappointment.Darci's husband is missing, and someone supernatural has him since she can't get a feel on where he is with her psychic abilities. She ends up helping Linc find his missing child since she feels that will help her find her husband.Linc is a stereotype of a black man. All he thinks about is sex, and just about every scene he is in has him lusting after someone. He even has sex with someone he's never met when she wakes up while he is sneaking into her room to steal something for Darci. He really brought the tone of the story down.I normally enjoy Jude Deveraux, but it was like she was trying to hard to please everyone with this book- those who want a lot of sex, and those who want a supernatural story. In the end, she failed all of her readers."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Her famous actress mother sends popular actor Lincoln Aimes to see her daughter Darci Montgomery.

And the storyline was, as usual, interesting to read. However, I was a bit dissapointed in the book because in many ways it read like a chap book rather than a stand alone novel. Novels in a series should be interesting to read in themselves -- in many ways this was only interesting to read because of the book that came before and what we hope will come after. I must say though, if she drags this out indefinitly I probably won't bother finishing the series/chap book."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I hated this book. And that really surprised me because I love the character of Darci. But Forever and Always was by far the worst book of this series in my opinion.In Forever, Darci realizes just how special her True Persuasion powers are and falls in love with the WONDERFUL Adam Montgomery. Adam finds his sister Bo, who was raised by the witch that kidnapped Adam at age 3, Darci finds her father Taylor, and Taylor and Bo end up falling in love. Both couples get married and each has a baby girl. It seems as though everyone will live happily ever after. But then a few years later Adam and Bo leave town and disappear, and Darci is slandered as the Hillbilly Honey. That's where Lincoln comes in, asking Darci to help him find his son. Darci agrees, thinking it'll help her find ADam and Bo, and the two head to Alabama.My biggest problem with this is that the story focused around Linc. It would've have been PERFECT for Jude Deveraux to have Linc, or better the much preferred at least to me character of Jack, come in and actively help Darci find Adam, and then at the end of the series you get to find out HOW and WHY he and Bo disappeared. Instead Darci's the one that has to help someone. I know I know, she has to do it so she can meet Henry and get the Touch of God, which I loved that idea. I also liked how she came to terms iwth the Hillbilly Honey idea. But did we really have to be subjected to LINCOLN, who sat there with constant lustful thoughts about Darci, was the picture of him unsnapping the crotch of her teddy really necessary? And what was with DArci lusting after him! STOP CHECKING OUT THE HOTT ACTOR AND START SEARCHING FOR THE MAN YOU'LL LOVE FOREVER!Also, what was up with Darcy's powers? It made at least semi-sense in Forever, the way True Persuasion worked. But then you open this book and suddenly in a few years Darci's reading auras, seeing spirits, able to feel someone... what??? Where did THAT come from?To me it felt like Jude Deveraux had only planned 1 book - Forever - and written it so that Adam and Darci walked off into the sunset. But then when Fans loved the book, she said \\"hmmm let's do something else\\" and came up with this crazy story, very much like the Pirates of the Carribean franchise. As with Pirates, the third installation redeemed the series, but I could've done without the middle one.Badly done Jude, you can do so much better than this!"},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Forever and Always was such a disappointment, the story was disjointed and lacked direction. Deveraux's new writing style is at best depressing. This story is not a romance. It's safe to say fans of Deveraux should borrow Forever &amp; Always from a local library. Even the smallest public libraries usually have Deveraux's new releases. Forever &amp; Always left the reader hanging with the unresolved disappearance of Adam Montgomery and his sister Bo. The character of Darci is so ditzy that it's unbelievable that someone with brillant psychic gifts can be such a ditz. Slavery and racism weighed too heavily in the story. Deveraux should take a hint from Nora Roberts (JD Robb) and write under a different name when penning the depressing, little or no romance stories. True Deveraux fans want romance and sweet endings."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I may not have been a fan of JD's books for as long as another reviewer has been, but I have very much enjoyed her books in the past. This one, however, was not worth the time it took me to read it. I don't like that she switches from one character's point of view to another's. I don't like the characters, especially ditsy Darci. And the story line was difficult for me to follow. I regret buying this book and will definitely not be buying the next one. In fact, I hesitate to buy any of her books anymore. They're either too sad, or like this one, too disjointed."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"Let me start by stating that I have been a die-hard fan of Jude Deveraux for over 15 years. I've followed the Montgomery's, Taggart's and every other family/book that she has written. I purchased this book at the airport thinking that I had found the \\"perfect\\" book to read on the 4 hour flight from Chicago to San Francisco. I had more fun staring out the window (at night)than reading this book. Darci wasn't that great a character in the first book that she was featured in. And now there is a whole book that is basically dedicated to her. The only thing that I can say about the character of Lincoln Aimes is that he is Ms. Deveraux managed to cram just about every steroetype of the African American male into the character that she could uncaring father, sex crazed, etc."},{"Title":"Forever and Always (Forever Trilogy)","review":"I think that if you are looking for a typical romance novel you may be disappointed in this novel.

Then appears a man at her door named Link, a famous Hollywood actor with a missing son. Darci may be his only chance at finding his son alive. Will Darci over come her own greif and if so, will she do it in time to find a missing little boy?Ms. Deveraux has never ceased to amaze me. Her power of description makes even the most abstract thoughts and ideas seem real. Her character's are always believable, and original. It will be interesting to see how this triology pans out.

IF you pick this up and decide to read it because it a great STORY, the it is a real winner.

I was really hoping that Darci and Lincoln wouldn't forget her husband and once all was explained, it really shows Darci's full love for Adam. (There's your romance, critics!)This type of series is hard to read for me, since Ms. Dereraux is one of my all time favs, I am hungry for the next book as soon as I finish the last. &quot;Forever &amp; Always&quot; sure drops you into a full pit of questions. Some unexpected twists get you skipping ahead to the next paragraph so that you miss something and have to re-read the section. It's great and fast paced and a true original!!Kudos to Jude for writing outside the box! I can't wait for&quot;...Always&quot; to hit the market. Be sure to pick up the first book, &quot;Forever...&quot; before reading this one because there is just a full leap into this story and not knowing the events from the first book might be a bit hindering."},{"Title":"How Florence Invented America: Vespucci, Verrazzano, & Mazzei and Their Contribution to the Conception of the New World","review":"This book brought Amerigo to life in his times.

My favorite cookbooks are \\"The Professional Chef\\" by the Culinary Institute and \\"Culinary Artistry\\". With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am usually disappointed in my recent cookbook acquisitions. This book is a nice addition to any cookbook library if you have a vegetarian in your family or just want to add a few meatless meals to your family table.The book is subdivided as follows:IntroductionStarters and SaladsSoups and StewsSauteed & Stir Fried VegetablesBoiled and Steamed VegetablesBaked, Roasted and Grilled VegetablesBeans and LegumesPasta, Polenta & RiceEggs and CheeseBasic Recipes & TechniquesThis book is vegetarian, not vegan. However, there are many recipes in the book that are vegan or that can be easily changed to make them vegan. As a new follower of the mostly vegan \\"Eat to Live\\" plan I have been purchasing vegetarian cookbooks with abandon looking for new flavor ideas. This book has added a number of new recipes to my cooking repertoire.My overall observations about the book are as follows:Pros:1. Book covers many ethnic cuisines in its recipes2. Recipe directions are very thorough3. Covers many different techniques for preparing veggies (stir fry, baking, roasting, grilling, etc.)4. Many but not all of the recipes are healthy5. Color photographs of all the dishes are provided6. Small book, doesn't take up too much room on the counter7. Nice sturdy binding that will stand up to many years of constant useCons:1. No desserts2. Uses while flour where whole wheat would work3. Uses full fat-bechamel where low-fat bechamel would work and be a healthier option4.

Set in the depression, sportswriter Rosen takes a pick-up professional basketball team made up of six Jews and one goy cross-country in a renovated hearse as they play (and occasionally fix) games, run from the mob, and mature from boys to men. Mostly a comic novel, All-Stars consistently amuses, but is not particularly deep. To me, one of Rosen's attempts at \\"depth\\" falls particularly flat. The narrator, Aaron, joins the team essentially in flight from his wife who blames him for their stillborn child. Aaron, in his heart, can't help but blame itself. Rosen attempts to make the road trip cathartic, allowing Aaron to reach peace with himself. I'm sorry, but it just didn't work for me.

But as a psychiatrist, I appreciate the affect of his work. In a time of &quot;in-your-face attitude&quot;, there is quiet times in his book: in the story, and the paintings and (my favorite) the drawings. Sometimes the body language reminds me of times working with Taylor and my dad around our house (I know one painting has the sky from our backyard).

My father wants me to continue working with him in the shoe shop, but I want to be like Luigi Borghini, the greatest sculptor in Rome. Today I am going to his studio to ask him if he will take me on as an apprentice.\\"And so begins a wonderfully enchanting tale told in a mellow tone which is very, very informative, of a young lad's adventure as an apprentice in seventeenth-century Rome. Taylor Morrison has truly created a remarkable work here.We are taken via some beautiful illustrations and a very readable text from the streets of Renaissance Rome, into the studio of the sculptor; Luigi Borghini and then through the entire process of creating a most wonderful work of art. From the studio to the marble quarries of Carrara; we are treated to the entire process, drawing, study, designing, modeling, cutting to the stone, transportation, the shaping of a figure which is pulled from a solid block of marble, all the way through its placement in the Piazza Corsanini.The story is told in first person through the eyes of this young boy. This is one of those books/stories that are not only a delight to read, but informs and inspires at the same time.The author has used various techniques in creating his illustrations, from painting, to drawing, from swirling landscapes to extremely detailed glimpse of art pieces and work methods. This is extremely effective! This is one talented artist!Now I am not one of those people who wail and whine over the \\"good old days,\\" as I feel they actually never existed outside of nostalgic wishful thinking, but I happened to have been teaching a class of sixth graders for the past five days and I could not help but speculate how much better off some of the young folks would be if they could somehow experience three or four years in the world of the author's hero.I suppose that a book such as this will be the closest they will ever come, which while not perfect, is sure better than nothing.The author has included a very useful and comprehensive glossary in the back of the book.

The mystery takes an immediate turn to the personal when a strange clue links the murder to the very first homicide case Sloan investigated, back in 1962. Sloan himself narrates the 1962 segment of the story, which is a fine little mystery, and the reader comes away knowing more about what makes the crime solving doctor tick than before. Lee Goldberg (who wrote and produced several seasons of the Diagnosis Murder television series) has added an emotional layer to this mystery that makes it the best in the series to date. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"In the middle of a Southern CA rain storm, Mark Sloan finds a dead college student on the beach near his house. With hair died red and dressed in a mermaid costume, things seem weird. A vile is found inside her that contains pictures from Mark Sloan's very first case.In February 1962, during another huge rain storm, a dead woman is brought into the ER. Everyone assumes she drowned during the rain storm, but Mark thinks something fishy is going on. When they find evidence of murder, Mark just can't let it go, even when it puts him at odds with the detective, former friend Harry Trumble. Can an inexperienced doctor solve the crime? Even more intriguing, what does this 40+ year old murder case have to do with the present murder?This book is ingenious. About half of it is set in the past and half set in the present. Really, you get two mysteries for the price of one as we watch Mark solve both cases. Yet they interact in a way I never saw coming. Seeing glimpses of Mark's past was enlightening as well. I really felt like I was back in 1962 for those scenes. Once again, Lee brings events from the series into the book making me wish I'd seen more of the earlier episodes.These books are fast becoming one of my favorite series around. If you were a fan of the show, you owe it to yourself to pick up this great continuation. Even if you've never seen the series, the plots will pull you in and make you start looking for the reruns. Is the next one out yet?"},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"In Los Angeles, rain has made the area a flood stricken mud hole and when Dr. Mark Sloan walks along the beach he is shocked to find a dead woman in a mermaid's costume near his home. When he goes to work at Community General Hospital, his friend and medical examiner Dr Amanda Bentley tells him that the victim was injected with a drug to induce paralysis and in her stomach was a memory card.When they get it developed, it is a picture of a storm that happened in 1962 forty-three years ago in the same month. The killer is sending Mark a message because that storm began the events that led to Mark solving his first homicide. Five student nurses were killed because they were involved in a blackmail scheme headed by a doctor who was also murdered. The woman who was killed turns out to be the daughter of a patient he treated the night it all began in 1962. Mark is determined to find the killer who seems to enjoy taunting him even if it means putting his own life in danger.Lee Goldberg is a very visual writer so each scene comes alive in the mind of the reader, almost as of this were actually watching an episode of the television show. The author is great at creating characters that are three dimensional and life like and he sets up the who-done-in such a way so that almost anyone could be the killer. Readers will thoroughly enjoy this very exciting and complicated mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"This book starts with a bang, and goes back 43 years for a fascinating tale of Mark Sloan's early medical days. Then we jump back to the present, and the book begins to unravel. I liked it, but the ending was a bit too strange."},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"I enjoy this series because the mystery is always well thought out and it keeps you guessing and second-guessing right up until the big reveal. They aren't overly violent or filled with gory details. They are just clever, fun reads.This book in particular is a departure for the series in that the bulk of it is a flashback to Mark Sloan's early medical career and his first dabble in the detective world, told in first person. It mainly deals with new characters. With the exception of Dr. Sloan, the other regular characters from this series basically just bookend the story. Lee Goldberg really has the characters down, especially Dr. Sloan. You can't help but picture Dick van Dyke when reading this book. Overall, I would say that The Past Tense is my favorite in this entertaining series."},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"Lee Goldberg's \\"Diagnosis: Murder\\" book series, based on the Dick Van Dyke TV series, got off to a promising start with \\"The Silent Partner.\\" The books that followed in the series were entertaining but inferior. Now, Lee Goldberg has redeemed himself of \\"The Waking Nightmare\\", the previous entry that was mildly entertaining but mostly mediocre and disappointing, with \\"The Past Tense\\", a book that's even better than \\"The Silent Partner\\" and even the TV series that inspired it.\\"The Past Tense\\" begins when a young girl is murdered during a rain storm in Los Angeles. Her corpse is then carried by the tide to the beach outside of Dr. Mark Sloan's house dressed in a mermaid costume. Things become really interesting when Dr. Sloan discovers the murder is connected to a series of serial killings he solved in his earliest case as an amateur sleuth.This leads into the most enthralling stage of the book. Lee Goldberg retells the account of Dr. Sloan's first investigation in first-person from Dr. Sloan's point of view. This account is set forty years before the initial start of the novel. Imagine Dick Van Dyke as he appeared circa \\"Mary Poppins.\\" Readers are finally allowed a glimpse inside the main character's head. Dr. Sloan describes his early days as both a surgeon and a sleuth, as well as his relationship with his late wife and several old friends that take over the roles of the regular cast members of \\"Diagnosis: Murder\\" mysteries. The account fits well in its era, even involving the Red Scare in the plot.This section makes up the entire middle of the novel and, in Goldberg's tradition of providing two mysteries for one with each novel in the series, works as a self-contained mystery story with plenty of twists-and-turns. The approach also distinguishes \\"The Past Tense\\" from all of the previous entries in the series, but the novel doesn't run out of steam when it ends. Dr. Sloan and his son Steve, a baby during the time of the \`60's killings, spend the final third of the novel sleuthing the connection between Dr. Sloan's past and the murdered woman in the mermaid costume and attempting to catch another killer. These chapters are taut and suspenseful, and the climax is especially hard-hitting and will have readers on the edge of their seats. Lee Goldberg, a writer who worked on the \\"Diagnosis: Murder\\" TV series as well as several others, incorporates the quirky humor of the series into the novel, but, overall, this is the darkest and most suspenseful book in the series so far."},{"Title":"Diagnosis Murder #5: The Past Tense","review":"This is the first book I've read by Lee Goldberg but it certainly won't be the last.I thoroughly enjoyed THE PAST TENSE. In fact, I had a very hard time putting it down. When I should have been doing other things, I pushed those things aside until I was finished reading this book.If you're a fan of the DIAGNOSIS: MURDER tv series, then you should definitely read this book. Even if you're unfamiliar with the series, you should consider reading this book. It has a great story, great characters, and it's very well-written.This book gave me what I most look for in a book - it entertained me for many hours.Readers can't ask for much more than that."},{"Title":"Europe by Train 1999: The Number One Guide to Budget Travel","review":"This is the only book needed when travelling around Europe."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I got this book within days of placing the order, and it came in better condition than expected.

The characters are very well rounded and very entertaining with their different ideas about life."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Forester's A Passage to India is a masterful novel. True, to the unknowledgable reader it may seem to be a lacking indictment of the Raj. When this book is read with adaquete background knowledge of India though, it becomes something exquisite. The imagery and writing paint such beautiful pictures of a vibrant yet torn India. Forester follows in the third person narrative but is able to slip, unawares, into the minds of the characters at will. This provides the reader with amazing insight into all the characters involved. Aside from the writing, the story itself serves as a wonderful metaphor for India and the Raj. Through Mrs. Quested,Esmiss Esmore, Dr. Aziz, Mr. Fielding and the rest of the British, a painful picture of seperation is crafted. Seperation of love in the case of Ronnie and Adela, and Ronnie and his mother, and seperation of friendship as seen with Dr. Aziz and Fielding. These personal &quot;anecdotes&quot; broaden ones view of the bigger picture: India and Britain's inability to be &quot;friends.&quot; A definite must read!"},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This book displays the relationship between the British and the Indians during British rule in India in a fascinating way. I was amazed at how much this book can reveal about the Indians and British just through dialouge. I recommend this book to all and urge you to buy it."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This is a classic. I read it years ago and had forgotten the lush beauty of his language, the acuity of his vision and the wisdom of his conclusions. My daughter and I visited India more than 20 years ago, and it brought back the smells, the poverty and the lush beauty of the country. What I remember most is how kind Indians were to us. Incredibly giving, you never see a car or even a scooter that isn't crammed to the hilt with people. They share. Something we Americans seem to've forgotten. Anyway, it's a lovely book and, as I recall, a lovely film."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This tantalizing question provides the intense drama at the centre of Forster's last and greatest novel, which explores racial tension in colonial India.After a mysterious incident during their visit to the Marabar Caves, the charming Dr Aziz is accused of assaulting Adela Quested, a naive young Englishwoman. As he is brought to trial the fragile structure of Anglo-Indian relations collapses and the racism inherent in colonialism is exposed - a theme which still has powerful, dangerous realities today."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I've read and enjoyed several Forster books, but \\"A Passage to India\\" tops them all. The plot concerns the arrival in Chandrapore, India of Ms. Quested and her potential mother-in-law, Mrs. Moore. They come to visit Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny, who is engaged to Ms. Quested. Ms. Quested and Mrs. Moore are the typical new arrivals, and they desire to see more of the \\"real\\" India than they can see with their fellow Brits, who tend to gather in the state Club and socialize only with each other. They become involved with Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who promises to show them the famous, nearby Marabar caves. Dr. Aziz is solicitous toward the Brits and craves their friendship, but he clearly has negative feelings toward them also.At the Marabar caves, an incident occurs (or does not occur) to Ms. Quested that alters all of the characters and their town inextricably. There is a trial and a bit of a mystery, but the focus is always on the characters and their conflicts. In particular, the tension between the English and the people of India is beautifully portrayed. The characters are multi-dimensional, as are their motives, which makes for a fascinating read. I found the book to be quite moving and sad - a true classic."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"This is book is incredible, and one of my personal favorites. Its beauty is too easily overlooked, because it is so elegantly subtle. Every aspect of the storytelling is masterful: the prose is lush and nuanced, and every character is exquisitely drawn. Drawing from the slimmest of plots, Forster weaves what seems to be an isolated incident into a complex tapestry of emotion. The central focus are the characters, who are sharply realistic and utterly, utterly human. Another aspect that I liked very much is that it takes an era, the British Raj in India, which is otherwise interpreted only with the most hotly colored emotions, and presents it with a marked neutrality, presenting it only through the eyes of the characters. A marvelous read."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Britishers Mrs. Moore and her prospective daughter-in-law, Adela Quested, make the arduous journey to India to visit Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny Heslop. He is a magistrate in Chandrapore, India, during the British occupation of that country. The two ladies make the acquaintance of Dr. Aziz, a local doctor who offers them a chance to see the \\"real India\\" by visiting the Marabar caves. Hoping to please the British ladies, he plans a wonderfully complicated and expensive journey. However, an unfortunate misunderstanding erupts into a tragic affair that point up the cultural differences and seething anger between the two cultures.Was Miss Quested attacked by Dr. Aziz in the caves? This question becomes the central issue which propels the plot and lays bare the hostility and polarizing feelings of superiority and inferiority prevalent at the time. The reader is swept into the life of Dr. Aziz as more misunderstandings cause a permanent rift with his dearest friend and gives him a genuine hatred of the English. While the pompous Heslop contends his countrymen are in India to do justice and keep the peace, the appalling behavior on both sides explodes at a trial and lingers long after.Forster is adept at not taking sides, at showing both the British as well as the Indian side of the issues. In his fair and balanced telling, the reader can alternately sympathize with Dr. Aziz or Miss Quested. Neither wins when the truth is revealed and both are forever scarred by the incident in the Marabar caves.In 1984, David Lean brought this drama to the big screen and, in my opinion, actually improved on the source material by making the characters more sympathetic and capturing visually the beauty of India. Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested atop an elephant riding to the Marabar caves is a breath-taking scene and one any viewer will long remember."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"E.M. Forsters book &quot;A passage to India&quot; is indeed one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Forster shows great skill in bringing the tragic tale of an attempted friendship between Aziz and Fielding.The book revolves around what may be termed the secret understanding of the heart. This is an understanding of people, their feelings and their interaction with other humans.In a story which is not primarily political, Forster makes a political comment on what was happening in India at that time.The issue of the Marabar caves is not really an issue at all because even Forster says that it doesn't really matter what if anything happened in the caves, because it is the repercussions of what did of didn't happen that are important. I believe that the expedition into the Marabar caves merely amplified the emotions already inherent in the characters, for example Adela Quested tells us that she felt unwell since the teaparty with Fielding which took place long before the journey to the caves.Forster also presents us with well rounded characters except in the case of the Anglo-Indians, who are presented as tyrannical oppressors, and yet even they aren't all bad as they stand for values like honour and chivalry. What really annoys me about the Anglo-Indians is their high and mighty attitude, and pompous ways.I feel Forster uses character like Fielding, Moore, Godbole and Aziz to show us about true humanity.He doesn't pretend to understand India, it is a 'muddle' but through India he brings universal quandries and boundries to light.I recommend you read and reread this book as it is undoubtedly one of the best in english literature."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"I will not summarize the plot of this intricate novel, which is freely available through authoritative sites across the Web.If you love novels of character and theme, you will love and remember this painstakingly written novel of bigotry and colonialism before Indian independence. The concept which clothes the story: the Caucasian, very proper, very British Miss Quested accuses the Indian, Dr. Aziz, of physical assault in a cave. The facts of the event were literally invisible. The balance of the novel is a clash of cultures, biases and characters, all of which conspire to express \\"reality.\\"Forster is methodical in way he prepares his readers for the Event and its aftermath. He writes with the precision of a literary surgeon just as he did in A ROOM WITH A VIEW and HOWARD'S END.If you'd like explore Forster's writing, this is a fine place to start. Give it a little work and it won't let you down. The author was one of the great masters of the English language and an outspoken adversary of bigotry. Most of us have experienced bias at least once or twice in our lives. For that reason alone, I'd try it.Forster is also the great exemplar of the modern novel. Few were as consistently aware of form. Few had the ability to infuse raw emotion into such civilized prose.Go for it."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"First of all, I'd like to commend the reviewer G.B. Talovich (in the Spotlight Reviews as I write this) for his analysis of the archetype underpinnings of the novel. It made me reconsider the novel as a whole and appreciate it all the more.A Passage to India was written in 1924 and it bears similarities to some of Forster's literary contemporaries, most notably Orwell's Burmese Days and the short stories of Somerset Maugham. Here we have India, ancient, diverse, plagued with ancient schisms, a \\"muddle\\", under the authoricratic rule of colonial Britain. The British portrayed here conform to the rule: stuffy and prejudiced, with no love for their foreign station, maintaining a thin veneer of the Victorian role - to keep themselves \\"proper\\", warding away the dust and sweat and sweltering heat of an exoticism they can never truly understand, nor wish to incorporate. It's all about tennis and tea-time and the Club. As a contrast to these rigid expatriates, Forster introduces two arrivals, Mrs. Moore and Ms. Quested, initially starry-eyed and curious about the subcontinent, willing to taste the culture - if only taste, and nothing more - to satisfy the instinct for romance and adventure. This leads them into contact with the Muslim Dr. Aziz, who promises to show them India and ends up doing so more than any of them wish; \\"that incident at the Marabar Caves\\" results in explosively exposing the dichotomy of social conduct and temperament between disparate cultures, the superiority-wound ever-festering beneath the Western mandate to civilize and the East's own long-standing hierarchy establishment.To wit: \\"It was, in a new form, the old, old trouble that eats the heart out of every civilization: snobbery, the desire for possessions, creditable appendages; and it is to escape this rather than the lusts of the flesh that saints retreat into the Himalayas. (chapter 26 pg 235, old penguin edition)\\"At first I was a bit puzzled by Forster's approach, but as I read on it dawned on me that the author was displaying not just the discomfort and isolation of the British, but that of Aziz as well. As a Muslim, he is forced to inhabit three worlds: that of the dominant Hindu population, that of the snooty colonials and, deep within, that of his own faith and culture, marginalized by sheer population. Victimized as much by his own people as by the judgment-cry of the West, he eventually chooses exile, augmented in the final section \`Temple'. The \`Author's Voice' character, the atheist and open-minded Fielding, also capitulates to the home-town creed by the end of the novel, sacrificing his freedom for the reward of security, the buffer against the exile's loneliness, and his final meeting with Aziz - in which the earth itself seems to grumble that reconciliation between East and West cannot yet happen - is more powerful because of where these two characters have gone and what they have, in effect, given up due to outward pressures.A Passage to India is widely regarded as a masterpiece of the 20th century, highlighting the internal conflicts that would, in time, lead to Indian independence, casting a caustic eye to the irrevocable differences endemic to East/West relationships whenever superstition and racism rear their ugly heads... an all too common occurrence. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Wow. This book was written in the 1920's. Before Indian independence and before the separation of Hindu and Islam. When read with this knowledge it really is an incredible novel and explains (indirectly) the many differences between the Hindu and Muslim and British occupiers. It's essentially about the interaction of people from different cultures. I watched the David Lean film after reading the book and , although there were small differences, it was an excellend portrayal of the book. Why is it it in top 100 list? For me it's because of Forster's incredible descriptions and the way he paints a picture with these descriptions. Words to be tasted. Words to be scented. Sometimes the absence of description also adds to the mystery that is India. Wow."},{"Title":"A Passage to India","review":"Sadly, &quot;A Passage to India&quot; will probably never seem dated, because the racial and religious problems that plagued India nearly a century ago continue to do so today. That's a testament, though, to just how compelling E.M. Forster's novel was and is.Two English ladies, one young and strong willed and the other her elderly chaperone, visit India with the intent of fully immersing themselves in Indian culture--unlike their compatriots, who segregate themselves from the Indians and relegate them to little more than a slave class. However, during a cave exploration, something inexplicable happens to both of them and they find themselves unhinged from the experience. What follows is a sad story about the clash of two cultures that form immediate and unshakable assumptions about each other.Forster has been criticized for being somewhat one-sided in his portrayal of the English-Indian conflict, painting the English as belligerent, pompous bullies and the Indians as lovable and continuously wronged. I suppose that criticism is valid to a reader looking for clinical fairness, but as Forster himself is recorded as saying, he was sick of fairness at the time he wrote this novel and composed his story instead from the heart. I can completely understand this sentiment. In any conflict, when one side is so decidedly dominant and thus has all the advantages, fairness seems like an almost irrelevant concept. What Forster has done here is fashioned a compelling story populated by perhaps some of the most psychologically complex characters ever put to the page.Which is both good and bad. On the one hand, fully trying to understand the inner workings of these characters' minds makes for a very interactive reading session. On the other, Forster makes his characters almost TOO realistically complex, so that I feel that I can't fully understand any of them. Whether intentional on Forster's part or not, this pretty much works overall for the novel, since it is about people who can't fully understand one another. But I would be lying if I didn't say that it also makes the novel at times somewhat frustrating, and ever so slightly dry.Don't let this criticism overshadow the praise I have for this novel, however. It's a towering achievement of 20th Century literature and deserves the esteem it has won from the literary community."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],B={key:0},D={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=w("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,P)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e31e2c56"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/10.md","filePath":"guide/10.md"}'),N={name:"guide/10.md"},j=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{R as __pageData,j as default};
