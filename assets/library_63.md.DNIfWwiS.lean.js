I was not obliged to write a favourable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is a good book if your child is nervous about school. Mine is not so he really wasn't into it. He did think it was interesting that the animal was nocturnal and went to school at night. It is my understanding that lots of schools read this to the younger students the first day of class. My nephew was in kindergarten last year and my sister is a first grade teacher and both classes did read this, so if your school does this it might be a good idea to read it to your child as something familiar that first day of class."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I am using the Kissing Hand thematic unit which is very helpful for small children understanding transitions concerning leaving mom for a learning experience. I teach children or rather they teach me and it has been a very good social story type book for children who might not understand why they are going to school."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is in great condition and was delivered quickly! I would recommend this seller to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I bought this book after seeing severl postings and lesson plans by other teachers online. I read it to my first grade students on the first day of school last year. We then did a \\"folded/wrinkled heart\\" activity to go with it. It's easy, look it up and try it. It made an impression on my kids and we kept the heart up all year for everyone to see and we referred to it often. I'm thinking of reading it on the first day when we have parents too this coming year. It's a sweet story and it helps ease anxieties of little ones...and parents."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"A must have for children beginning school. For the past two years, (I think), I have read this book on the first day of Kindergarten to my students and their parents in the morning just as school is about to begin. It seems to have created a much calmer atmosphere for my students and their parents. I often see the kids hold their hands to their face during the day and I know they are missing home but have a link to their family."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Audrey Penn has written a fantastic book with superb illustrations about a young racoon starting school for the first time and how sharing \\"the kissing hand\\" with his mother made it much easier. This is a great book for preschool and kindergarten teachers to share with their students and parents on the first day of school. Just be sure and keep the Kleenex handy!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I read this book to my oldest sons the days they left for college. They were &quot;too cool&quot; as they listened, but after I finished, the younger one reached up and kissed my hand. I can tell you, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. A memory I will always cherish. I am ordering the book for my sister who is sending her first child to Kindergarten next week. I highly recommend this to be added to your family traditions."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is an excellent book. I first checked it out from our library and the first time I read it to my 3 year old son I could barely finish it because it touched me. My son is going through some regression right now as we are expecting our second child and he has shown a lot of increased anxiety away from me. This book was so appropriate for children who are feeling anxious about being away from their parents whether it be school or for any reason. Change is hard and this book reminds children that they will always have your love. I cannot recommend enough. We had to own this one!!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is about a young raccoon that is worried about his first day at school. His mother senses his anxiety and gives him a kiss in the middle of his hand to remember her by, while he's away.

Well with it he got to take this book home to read and then tell the class about his day with Robbie. Well I fell in love with this book! It is awsome. My son is always like oh thats for girls when something is mushy like this book but he loved it. Now we have just purchased the second one Pocket full of Kisses. Great as well. Especially if there is a younger brother or sister in the family and the older child is having a hard time coping. These are definitly must own kind of books."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Incredibly touching to a heart that couldn't be touched ...my Mother gave me this book 3 years ago when I went to college. To this day in the cruel world of uncensored thoughts comes a simple book that continues to touch my working class heart in a way that is simple and gentle. I absolutely love this book! This book is for anyone who finds things sometimes hard and strange to do for the first time."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Many of the reviews talk about separation anxiety and how this book is a wonderful way to quell those fears. I certainly agree, but beyond that - it is so much more.It's a story about the secret of a mother's (parent's) love for her child, passed down from generation to generation. However, it's the wonderful twist at the end that makes it a story for all ages.It's a story, specially told, and exquisitely illustrated, that can be shared with people of all ages. I've shared it with adults and seen the miracle happen again and again. I've read it to teens and talked about the significance of the message.While it's perhaps not as poignant as Silverstein's &quot;The Giving Tree,&quot; it is a heartwarming story, and a timeless reminder that somewhere within our inner child, we all need the same assurance from those we love... whether we're 5 or 105.----A father, husband and storyteller"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"As a veteran teacher with over 20 years in kindergarten, I love the story of the Kissing Hand!!! The story and illustrations are beautiful! I have used it for several years at orientation to begin our school year. The plot is simple enough for young children to understand, and they certainly relate to being anxious about starting school. We read together, parents and children, and discuss why parents want their children to go to school, like Mama Racoon wanted Chester to go. When the time comes for parents to go, they exchange \\"kissing hands.\\" The children are much calmer and reassured as their parents leave."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My daughter started Kinder this year and was promoted to first grade. She was having some trouble with the transition, after speaking with her new teacher, she recommended this book. It helps alleviate some of the childrens seperation anxiety. I read this book to my child as often as I can. Not only does it make the children feel better, it also comforts moms also. :)"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Such a sweet story which helped my \\"Mommy's Girl\\" 5-year-old daughter adjust to all-day Kindergarten this fall. I highly recommend it for those parents who also have little cling-ons. It will likely help them through their first days of being away at school \\"forever\\" in kid time (i.e., 7 hours in real time)."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is a marvelous book for any child worried about something new happening in their life! It paints a very real \\"picture\\" of how love travels with you anywhere you go.

I purchased it for my daughter who is a kindergarten teacher. Her students loved it!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My 4 year old daughter's new teacher read THE KISSING HAND to the class on the first day of school, and she was very taken with the story. She seemed to make an immediate connection with it. She talked about it so much, that I ordered a copy for home. And we have read this story almost every night since it arrived.THE KISSING HAND is the story of a young raccoon named Chester. Chester does not want to go to school; he wants to stay home with his mother. But his mother shows him a special family secret - THE KISSING HAND. THE KISSING HAND let's Chester know that his mother's love is with him always, no matter where he is.THE KISSING HAND is a perfect story for any child facing a new situation on their own. All any child wants to know is that they are loved, totally, completely, and always. It is that unconditional love that gives children confidence to face new situations with self-assurance and independence.The prose is clear and simple; the illustrations are lovely, detailed, and colorful. THE KISSING HAND is a charming, endearing story that will touch a chord with any young child and quickly become a family favorite. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"For young Chester Raccoon, the first day of school is scary indeed, and young children will be able to relate to the young raccoon who cries at the thought of being separated from his mother. But his wise mother sends him off with a wonderful secret to see him through and carry the memory and strength of her love with him always. The book's foreword says The Kissing Hand is \\"for the child within each of us who sometimes needs reassurance.\\" Love is truly the bedrock that sustains and reassures us on our path through life, and this book reinforces the importance of loving relationship for us all. Beautifully told, the tale may give youngsters the confidence they need to cope with whatever comes their way. In an unusual move, the author has teamed up two acclaimed artists (one a descendant of Sir Christopher Wren) with distinctive styles that nonetheless blend beautifully. These are endearing, luminous illustrations - Chester Raccoon has got to be the cutest raccoon in all of children's literature."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I use this book at my open house for Kindergarten. I really like it because it is as much for the parents as it is for the students. I have to admit, I even get a little choked up while reading it. Sending a child to school for the first time can be very emotional, this is a good way to help families cope w/ this milestone. We even do a little craft and make a kissing hand for parents on the first day of school."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book was purchased as a holiday gift for our grandchildren.

It is a reminder for children that the love you have for them is as close as their hand and the people they love are never REALLY far away."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is one of my favorite children's books, and even though my son is older now, I still think of it with much affection. Great baby gift!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is a must read for any child who will leave their family home for an extended time, whether it be daycare, pre-school or Kindergarten. I purchased this book long ago for my granddaughter who lives in another state, and whenever we parted we would leave each other with a kiss, and when I would talk with her on the phone she would hold her hand to the phone and I would leave her with a kiss. A great gift for grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I was interning at a preschool center and myself and several other students were looking for books to read during story time. I read this story and cried my eyes out. Its an adorable story about a mother comforting her child before his first day of school. Maybe I'm a big baby, but i loved this story."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My daughter (3 years old) loves this book. My husband and I both work so when we leave for work in the morning she always gives us \\"hearts\\" to get us through the day."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The first time I came in contact with this book, my oldest daughter was leaving for college. I bought the book and sent it to her so that is would arrive a few days after she had moved into her dorm. She loved the book and says she read it often and shared it with her new friends in the dorm. Now my second daughter is leaving for her first year of college and I will send The Kissing Hand to her and continue this &quot;tradition&quot; when my youngest daughter goes to college in 4 years."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Chester's mother finds the perfect way to calm his fears about going to school.This book is a life saver for mothers just going back to work, children starting a new day care or as, in my case, children who hate to be left alone in their rooms at night.The Kissing Hand has helped my daughter to feel safe and loved at night when I'm &quot;too far away downstairs&quot;."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My friend bought this book for my three year-old daughter as a present and every night I read it to her. This book is beautifully illustrated, but it also made me want to shoot every raccoon that came into our yard because my daughter wanted to play with them. She has a hard time sleeping sometimes and so I take her out on the deck and look at the stars here in Louisiana, though occasionally we're joined by these stupid raccoons. My daughter runs after them and tries to play with them. The other night she snuck out of the house while mommy and daddy were sleeping because she wanted to play with \\"Chester\\". She says \\"Chester\\" always come over to play because they're \\"best friends\\". Well, \\"Chester\\" bit her. I had to have her taken to the ER to get her rabies vaccination. Chester made a great dinner the following week when my husband shot him.Overall, this book is brilliant, provided your child knows that raccoons aren't these cute and cuddly creatures who can give you rabies."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I do not recommend this book for toddlers! The pictures are dark and dreary and the audio is very gloomy. The little raccoon is sad and scared to leave his mother and go off to school. It takes place at night, so the raccoon has to leave his mother and walk into the woods at night without her. My daughter was very upset at the end."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Would not have bought it if not for my 4 years olds pre-school summer reading . . cute and thoughtful books, she enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I do not recommend this book for toddlers!

And while the kissing hand concept is definitely useful for any child worrying about leaving their parents for the day, I thought it was presented in an excessively sentimental way. I always find too much sentimentality just encourages children to dwell on how upset they are, rather than comforting them.But if it works for your kid, great."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Some of us thought the book wasn't that interesting because children had to go to school at night and in a tree. Many of us liked the fact that you could sleep in and go to school at night. The story had lots of things that we thought were nonsense. We liked the part when the racoon kissed his mom on the hand to make him feel better. The racoon made many friends within the story that made him happy. Our class thought that the book needed another title. Many students would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I read a book called The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. It won a Distinguished Achievement Award from Ed Press. The book is about a raccoon who does not want to go to school. He is afraid because his Mom won't be there. His Mom told him the secret of the kissing hand. She kissed his hand. When he wanted his Mom, he could put his hand on his cheek and feel the kiss. That made him happy and he went to school. I liked this book because I can remember my first day of school and it was a little scary. I think this is a good book to read before you go to school. I think it will help other kids not to be scared."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I will ever be grateful to my son's kindergarten teacher for reading this book to her class. My son was having a hard time being away from home for the first time, as with most children. He came home one day with his scholastic book order in hand and asked me to buy him The Kissing Hand. That was it he wanted nothing else. After we read the book together and I started giving him his own kissing hand he felt better about going out on his own. Still to this day even though he is in second grade now I sometimes give him a kiss on the hand as he get out of the car, especially on those days when I am having a hard time going to school myself. This book is, in short, a perfect picture of a mother's love"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"We moved recently three hours north, leaving behind our friends, family and his Bioligacal father(he see's him once a month).

He was having a really hard time lettting me go, and having to stay in school 6 hours vs. 3 from KG. One of the other parents kindly suggested this book. I'm so grateful, it's helping my son grow and let go of the appron strings. There's also the new book Pocket of kisses by the same author--get it! It's not a instant fix, but it's working slowly.

I have a three year old and read it to him before his first day of preschool and there were no tears from him, he just asked me to kiss his hand and say bye."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is a good one to read to a child when a separation between parent and child is going to take place. I would recommend it to a family who has a child going to pre-school or kindergarten for the first time. It is also good for parents!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"While the story is a heart warming story, it is very difficult to read on the kindle 3. For the pages without the illustrations, you can change the text size however for the pages that have text and illustrations, you cannot enlarge the text which makes it very difficult to read since you have the text and picture on the same small screen. It would be better if it was text-to-speech enabled so you could have help guessing at the smaller text size. ;)"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Audrey Penn has written truly a great book. Not only for children, but parents will be moved also. A tremendous read. The drawings also are outstanding. My six-year old daughter picked this book out at a school book fair. It had been read to her class that day in her Kindergarten class. I read it to her upon arriving home. So moved, I couldn't wait to share it with my wife. My daughter did an outstanding job picking out this book. Truly moving, & certainly a classic."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The Kissing Hand was a very good book. It sends a good message not only to children, but to everyone who reads it. Here's what this book's about: This book is about Chester Raccoon who is afraid to go off to school on his own. He wants to stay home with his mother and doesn't want to try new things. But his mother insists that he goes to school where he will learn new things, make new friends {so on and so on}, although it may seem scary at first. His mother then shows him the power of \\"The Kissing Hand\\". I don't want to say what \\"The Kissing Hand\\" does because I don't want to ruin part of the story for you, so read it and find out what \\"The Kissing Hand\\" really is.One of the messages in this book was that new things can be exciting and fun, all you have to do, is remember that you always have people that love you and are there for you. Another is that you have to remember to tell people that you love them and you believe in them. You may not know it, but when you let someone know you love them and believe in them, it gives them the confidence to do what they feel they may not have the ability to accomplish. So send this message to your children today, and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This has to be one of my very favorite children's books.

My family recently had some experiences with Hospice. They used this book as an end of life tool as well. All I can say is Wow"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Chester is a character we can understand: one whose fear of going to school, and being away from the comfort of home, is counterbalaned by the loving and profound gesture of his mother. She truly is a heroine in children's literature, offering hope and solace in a time of need. Like Stillwater in Jon J. Muth's \\"Zen Shorts,\\" and again like the trees in Nila J. Webster's \\"The Gift of You, The Gift of Me,\\" the mother in \\"The Kissing Hand\\" is a loving wise figure and a friend for our journey. And like the characters in these other classics, Chester is deepened by this experience: he too seeks to give back, in this case to his own loving mother. This is a wonderful and truly caring story."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This sweet little book helps preschoolers with their fears of mommy leaving and not coming back. It gives them a tangible way to feel her presence when she's not at home. Our 3-year-old granddaughter even gives my hand a kiss, and I kiss hers, before she says goodbye. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My 2 year old loves this book. He chooses it almost everynight for me to read to him. He loves the illustrations of the animals and points them out on every page. Best of all we share kissing hands. He knows the last page says \\"I love you\\" and he reads that one to me! How sweet!!!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This story is very touching for both the child and mother. It can be hard on a parent and a child when the child has to enter school for the first time. This book explains the same sitituation with a little special love for both to share. My child and I shared the same moments on her first days of school, which helped her ease the fears of going to school."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I read this to my two-year-old and three-year-old most nights before bed. They both sit for the entire thing. I give them each a kiss on their hands as I read it. It has developed a special time for us in the evenings. It's an awesome concept and the book is beautifully illustrated. My kids love pointing out the different animals and talking about Chester."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This fabulous book is about Chester the Raccoon being afraid to go to school. To make him feel more comfortable, Mrs. Raccoon tells him about the kissing hand, which is when someone in the family gives him a kiss on the hand to let him know that he is loved.

I learned that even when I might feel nervous or sad, I am always loved."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I first read this book to my daughter when she was entering kindergarten 5 years ago and I bought another copy a few days ago to give to my son as he enters kindergarten this fall. It is a wonderful story and it has beautiful illustrations. The stickers that come with the book are a wonderful addition too! I stick them in with snacks or on a piece of paper in my childs pocket for them to find while at school. My son was very apprehensive about starting school and I really feel sharing this book with him had a very positive impact on his attitude about school."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is a great book for all ages.

Lee Lee loved this book and was talking about it all the time so I ordered it from Scholastic books.I LOVE this book. Little Chester is starting school but is sad because he is going to miss mommy. Mommy teaches him the secret of the kissing hand. She spreads his hand out and kisses the middle of it. She tells him that whenever he misses her to place his hand on his cheek and it's her sending him a kiss and saying \\"mommy loves you\\".I was smiling and bawling by then end of this book. I love when Chester gives him mommy a kissing hand too. Believe me, i think mommies need the kissing hand more then their little ones, Lee Lee agrees. She laughed and said, \\"maybe then you wont cry so much when I leave for school.\\" She's right, LOL.We also bought \\"Chester Raccoon and the Acorn Full of Memories\\" because it was the same author. It's a great book but please be prepared to talk with your little one about death. We had the unfortunate circumstances to have to share with Lee Lee about death about a year ago and this book would have been a nice way to work through it. Another book that had me bawling, but very good."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I got this along with Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for Kindergarten and Kindergarten Rocks. While my boy loved this book, it wasn't the best for him before kindergarten. The first week of class, however, they covered this and had a bunch of coloring. They also did little handprints over a poem. I felt like, although this is a great addition to the library, it wasn't until the first week AFTER the start of school and AFTER covered in class that this became useful.I understand that using this book in class is pretty common practice.Also, it comes will little heart stickers to go in the palm of the hands. Sorry, but my boy just sweats too much for a sticker there. But it was a great thought!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"As a kindergarten teacher, I use this book every year on the first day of school. With Audrey Penn you can't go wrong!

We used the \\"kissing hand\\" with our daughter for the first few weeks at her daycare and it helped limit the trauma and drama of morning drop offs. The best part was when she offered to give us a \\"kissing hand\\" of our own!Now that you're wondering what a \\"kissing hand\\" is, go read the book!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The first day of school for a kindergartner or first grade student is traumatic. Several books have been written to help the parent explain to the child that they will be waiting for them when the school day is over. Penn's The Kissing Hand belongs at the head of that list. The assurance that mother will be with Chester as he starts his formal schooling comforts the young raccoon. And the ending truly demonstrates that he understood. This is a must for every home library with young children."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The Kissing Hand is a story that I share with my preschoolers and their parents the first day of school.

He was very nervous about it. A friend of mine recommended this book with stickers to read to him. I read it to him every morning before school and placed the sticker on his hand so if he got sad in school he could look at the sticker and know I was thinking about him. This is a very special book for nervous little kids just starting their school experience. It is a gentle and reassuring book. I plan to take it out again when my youngest child starts kindergarten in 2013."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"[This review also appears on Andi's Kids Books.]The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn is a classic children's picture book that has been around now for several years. Chester Raccoon is scared to go to school. He would rather stay home with his mother, play with his friends and use his own things. Mrs. Raccoon does what she can to reassure him that he will make new friends and find new toys. And then she teaches him an old secret known as \\"The Kissing Hand.\\" Mom opens his left hand and spreads his fingers into a fan. She kisses him in the middle of his palm and then wraps his fingers around it. She tells him that any time he feels sad and misses Mommy, he can touch his hand to his cheek and feel her love. He takes the time to think about it. Then before he leaves for school that night, he asks for his mother's hand. He gives her a kiss in the middle of her palm and folds her fingers around it. That way she can feel his love while he is at school.As an early childhood educator, I see this story being used time and time again. Mommies kiss their children's hands as they walk into the classroom. Children feel sad during the day and press their hands against their cheeks. They truly believe in the power of the Kissing Hand and it comforts them.This book is a perennial favorite in the classroom. Children sit in a rocking chair and read it over and over again. Many of them also have it at home.Reading it with your child does not guarantee that there will be no tears when going to school. But it can help you start a new tradition that you both will cherish forever.I received a complimentary set of galleys from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my review."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Wonderful book for parent and child!

What a great message: Mom's love will always be there."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I bought this for my five year old to give to him before going to Kindergarten. He wasn't afraid to go, but he really enjoyed the story and the sweet sentiment. He made me a little Kissing Hand picture with the stickers in the back, and I made him a little Kissing Hand note with one of the stickers that he stuck in his pocket for the first few days of school. He even gives his little brothers kissing hands from time to time - very sweet book."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"On my sons first day of kindergarten, the parents were invited to attend with the child. His teacher started out the first class with a project and then had all the students help her read this book.Since then my son has kissed my hand every day and not had one bout of sadness at all. This book is a great way for a child learn that its ok to spend some time away from mom and that it can be fun time. I'm glad his teacher read this book while the parents were there.I recommend this book to anyone with a child in kindergarten that is having a hard time or a child just starting school after being home with mom."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I teach preschool and have read this book to my class for years. It seems to calm children's hearts as well as Mommy's hearts. At the end of the story the parents give their children a kiss as do the children kiss their parents.

His mom kisses Chester's hand so when Chester feels lonely, he can put his hand on his cheek and remember his Mommy loves him. Chester kisses his Mom's hand because he wanted to give her warm thoughts. Chester went to school and his Mom remembered he loved her.I like that Chester would get to make new friends, play with new toys, read new books, and swing on new swings. I liked learning the sign for I love you. I think the pictures were just right. I think all kids would like to read this book."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My daughter was having problems with the transition of starting Kindergarten and being away from home and her parents. This book helped alot and everytime she is said we read it again!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Our daughter had been attending preschool for a few months with no problems at all. In fact, she was so excited to go everyday she wouldn't even want to kiss me goodbye. Then, she started saying she didn't want to go. Everyday was a struggle to get her in the door of the classroom. I found this book and bought it for her for Christmas, and it has been a lifesaver. I make sure that is our bedtime story each night before a school day, and she loves having her own kissing hand. I remind her each morning when I drop her off that she has a special kiss from me that she can put on her cheek if she starts to miss me. The only thing she thought was a little weird, was how the raccoon wen to school at night instead of during the day. But that gave me an opportunity to teach her about nocturnal animals. Two great lessons in one great book!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is fantastic for when you have to leave your little one at the doorstep of a babysitter or at school.

My oldest has had some separation anxiety and the kissing hand has helped him realize that we are always with him."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I found that when a children's book becomes a National Bestseller or wins prestigious awards they all happen for very good reasons and they have always been accurate in their assessment. \\"The Kissing Hand\\" is no exception.This is the story of a child raccoon who must leave for school but the separation anxiety has already taken over the youngster as he must leave his mother. His mother kisses inside his hand so that he may remind himself that his mother's never far away but right there in his palm. The real impact of this story is what happens next. The child understands that his mother's pain is not any different than his own. So, he kisses his mother's palm, too.This is a very powerful story that reminds an adult like myself that symbolism should not be ignored for it can serve to shield us from our fears at any age."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is filled with love, joy, and humor.

I bought it hoping he would take the idea of having a kiss on his hand all date. Unfortunately, we read it once and he didn't relate to the book.

My now 2nd Grade daughter had trouble separating at the start of Kindergarten and 1st Grade. This book was recommended to my husband to help her through it.

Not impressed the the audio portion of this package.The book, however, was heartwarming."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The kissing hand is a loving, beautifully illustrated tale by Audrey Penn and illustrated by Ruth E. Harper and Nancy M. Leak. The book was short and has a big font along with some easy words-- making it perfect for young kids or new readers.The book had a very cute story. The time and setting are beautiful. Every illustration shined with lovely detail. Definately this book took lovely spirit to work on.The book has 33 pps, 13 of them being the storie's words (excluding the Foreword, the Dedication, and the Title page). Most paragraphs are rather short, others being long. The rest of the pages consist of pictures, the Foreword, The Dedication, etc.I should end like this-- it i a sweet loving tale, the illustrations being absolutely unbelievable, and by unbelievable, I mean well done. I can say I very much reccomend this book. Happy reading!Review by Gina Bertaina, age Ten"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is so touching.

He is a little apprehensive, and, of course, he wants to stay home with his mom. Mrs. Racoon shares a secret with Chester called the Kissing Hand. She kisses Chester's palm and tells him to put it to his cheek when he begins to feel lonely at school. This book makes a great gift for a child entering school or going to camp for the first time, or for any occasion where a child will be temporarily separated from home and loved ones. It can also be used to help a child through the death of a parent or special loved one, and for children placed in foster families and residential facilities. For teachers, this book would be super to read the first day of school. It could also lead up to wonderful science, social studies, and reading/writing activities."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My kindergarten son brought this home from school. I think it's one of the sweetest books I have ever read. I read it to my teenagers and the senior in high school began to cry. I am sending it to my college daughter for her birthday, as it will be the first time in her life we are separated on her birthday. A must for every family who has a college-bound child as well as any time of separation."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Poor little Chester, the racoon, it's time for him to go off to school and he doesn't want to leave his mother. Mother knows that Chester will love school once he gets there. There'll be new friends to meet, new toys to play with, new books to read and even a new swing to swing on. So she tells him a special secret about the &quot;kissing hand&quot;. She takes his little hand, spreads the fingers and places a kiss right in the middle of his palm. Now when he feels lonely and needs a little love from home, he can press his hand against his cheek and know his mother's love will be with him. And, before he scampers off to school, he gives his mother the kissing hand too, so that she won't miss him too much, while he's away..... Audrey Penn has written a sweet, endearing story to help little ones face those scary feelings on their first days of separation. Her gentle text is complimented by expressive, detailed illustrations and together will let youngsters know that they're not alone out there in the world. The Kissing Hand is the perfect bedtime story, pre-schoolers will want to read again and again and makes a wonderful addition to all home libraries."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book touched my heart and brought back so many fond memories. I came across this book lastnight while babysitting and loved it. In elementary, my siblings and I moved schools. Every morning as my mom dropped us off at school she would kiss our hands. She told us that when we needed her and missed her so much, to squeeze our hand so that we could hug her kiss and know that she loved us and was there with us. Time passed and we began asking for those kisses, those comforts, less and less. Until days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, and it became the time that we no longer asked for those kisses. I am now 18 and will graduate in May from high school. I will leave my comfort zone soon and will need her comfort again. Sometimes I know that I will long to be so young again and want to have those kisses from my mom. When I came across this book a few days ago I was, well, I was speechless. I had no idea that this was not just MY mom's jesture to sooth her children, but another mother's jesture to quiet their fears. I haven't told my mom about the book yet, instead I have decided to buy her a copy and give it to her after my graduation, because I know that she is going to need those kisses in her hand for comfort."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I just came back from a parent teachers meeting for the up-coming school year. The teacher pulled from her bag of show and tell &quot;The Kissing Hand&quot;. I thought &quot;Wow I did something right. We have this book!&quot; I always knew it was a great book, (my daughter loves it) but the school sees it as a way to send your child off for the first time to school or daycare. In keeping with the theme of the book the kids all get stickers to put on their palms to press on their cheek for a kiss from their parents. It's a wonderful, loving book about sending your child off to school with an everlasting kiss from mommy (or Daddy). I highly recommend it. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The story of little Chester the raccoon, his fear of going away to school, and how his mom gives him a kissing hand so he'll know her love is with him is a priceless story. I've read it to my son and daughter often over the last few years.On Sunday afternoon my wife and I took our son to his first overnight camp. Three days away in the Carolina mountains at Camp Grier, a Presbyterian church camp. As we were about to leave the camp after dropping him off I called my son over and said \\"I have 3 things that I want you to remember while you're here.Number 1 is to be respectful of your fellow campers and the camp counselors that are here.Number 2 is to remember that if you get tired, or scared, or frustrated to say a prayer and God will be with you.Number 3 is,\\"I took his little hand in mine, kissed his palm, and closed his fingers over it,\\"Whenever you feel like you're missing your mom, or your dad, or home. Hold this up to your cheek and remember that we love you and we'll be with you again soon.\\"We then sent him off to his cabin and his camp mates and he skipped joyfully away. We headed back to the car to leave and found that he had forgotten something. I quickly carried it to his cabin and found him talking with one of his counselors. As I handed him the item I asked him what he was going to do if he missed his mom and dad. He smiled a sheepish grin and held his fist up to his cheek.I walked away knowing that for the next three days he was going to be fine.I highly recommend \\"The Kissing Hand\\" by Audrey Penn for you and a child that you love.Kevin Decker"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"My daughter had a very difficult time going off to first grade. I would have to pry her off my leg for the first week. A friend recommended this book and it really helped. She held the kiss tight in her hand and she she told me she used it several times during the day and she just liked knowing that it was there. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a young child going off on their own."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I'm a 24 year old soon-to-be married woman. When my parents moved me into my college dorm room, they left little presents wrapped up in all of the boxes I had to unpack. As you can imagine, once they left I was eager to get situated and began unpacking boxes and filling drawers one-by-one. One of the little presents I came across was this book. Of course, I wasted no time reading it, and soon found myself with tears streaming down my face. I was on my own for the first time, but I knew I knew I wasn't alone; nor was I ever far from my parent's love. It brings tears to my eyes just remembering how touched I was reading that for the first time. This is a fantasic book for everyone- whether you're 5 years old and starting kindergarten for the first time, or 18 and in college."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Short, sweet, and too the point. This is a story about a little raccoon about to start school. He talks about his fears to his mother, fears that most children have before starting school. Then his mother comes up with a wonderful solution to help her little raccoon remember that his mommy loves him and is thinking about him, even though she isn't with him. A heart-warming story, but be warned -- it might make you tear up the first time you read it."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book is so wonderful. Shows children that even when you are not with them, your love will always be there. I love this book, highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is one of the sweetest messages ever! We bought this book for our daughter when she was almost three. She is now almost seven and one of our nightly bedtime rituals is the Kissing Hand. Although we no longer read the book every night, I still place a kiss in her palms, and she places one in my palms right before we way goodnight."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I bought this on recommendation from my 3-year-old son's therapist about two-three weeks ago. His daddy and I are separated, which means I no longer can remain a stay at home mom. So taking my son to daycare was really hard on him. I bought this book along with a stuffed animal, Chester, the raccoon. Both items have helped to make transition from home to school to even dad's house so much smoother. I let my son take the stuffed animal with him to his daddy's house so he sleeps with it every night. Then when he is home with me we read the story every night before bed."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This story is a sweet, simple story - my kindergartner loves it, so I bought it for him. The problem isn't with the story itself, it's with the format. This story was obviously rushed into ebook production, and it wasn't done well. The story and pictures don't match up. The text changes size and is grainy in parts, clear in others. I wish the publishers would've invested more time into changing the format of this nice story - scanning the pages into pdf format just doesn't work. Picture books as ebooks can be a lovely thing. This one simply doesn't work as it currently stands."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"We adopted my son just before his first birthday, and as a result he struggles with severe separation anxiety. We worked so hard to prepare him to start school, but nothing seemed to help. Every morning he thought his little world was coming to an end. A family friend bought us this book and I read it to him one morning before school. That day he had me kiss his hands before getting out of the car, and it went a little smoother. Each day, from then on, he asked me to kiss his hands and he kissed mine, and each day we saw a bit more improvement. Nothing we said or did up to that point had gotten us anywhere, until the day I read him this book. It was truly a turning point for him. On hard days, he would get in the car and say \\"I'm so glad you kissed my hand this morning. I really needed it today.\\" Or \\"I had to sit in the settle down chair today, but I was okay, I don't think anyone saw me put my hand on my cheek.\\" I am so grateful for this book!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I read this book to each of my children the night before they started Kindergarden and it remains one of their favorite books (and mine to) to this day. I think this book makes it easier for younger children to adjust to new situations like starting school, daycare, or any other situation that requires the child to be away from the parents for most of the day. I think it helps the parents also....it is hard to drop your child off at school for the first time and watch her cry when you leave. It helps to remind her of the book you read last night. I think this book is a must for anyone with young children. I love it."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I used to work at a major bookstore chain. It was a lovely job. I never had kids, but I love to collect kids' books. I'm constantly amazed at (some) books, their strength, their honesty, and their ability to pass on something incredibly valuable to their readers.This one has a particularly prominent place on my bookshelf. The story is simple: a little one has to face a challenge and is reassured by the kiss his mom gives him on his palm, and it made him feel brave and cared for. Then he gives his mom a Kissing Hand, too.My mom used to do the Kissing Hand for me when I was little, but we didn't call it anything special. She worked long hours and before she got me off to school she'd kiss my forehead, when I had a test or anything at all to face by myself. When I needed her love and warmth, she whispered in my ear all I had to do was touch the kiss and know she was with me. She's long gone now these many years.Even though the Kissing Hand was written in the early 90's, mothers all over the world have given their little ones a loving touch whenever they needed it. She took my face between her warm palms and kissed my forehead, and that stayed with me all this life.Little Chester and countless kids all over the world have made this a better place because they were loved and they passed it on.Thanks, Mama."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter when she left for college.

I highly recommend this book for any age."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I absolutely love this book! My son had this read to him in K-4 and kissing each others palm became a sign of affection & soothed him when he had to be away from me.

What a treasure!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"As a mother I was very touched by \\"The Kissing Hand.\\" This is an idea mothers can share with their little ones and easily implement creating both confident kiddos and childhood memories to treasure.Here's the breakdown:Characters: Chester and his mother quickly resonate with the young reader especially in their dialog where Mother Raccoon is soothing and reassuring, wise and nurturing.Events / Story Line: It's Chester's first \`night' of school and he's nervous and wants to stay home with mother where everything is comforting and familiar. Mrs. Raccoon shows him a special way to keep \`in touch' with her throughout the night by teaching him about the kissing hand.Illustrations: The illustrations are wonderful and remind me of the old Golden Books. Filling the page, detailed and comforting, they underscore the warmth of the narration.Reader relevance: This is the perfect gift for a child starting school! Little one's will relate to Chester's feelings and love the concept of the kissing hand.Reader Excitability / Overall Presentation: Moms will absolutely be touched. Little ones will immediately take to the idea of a kissing hand - if they haven't already been doing this at home."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This book touched my children like no other.

The screaming scenes were just horrendous and heartbreaking as the children begged not to go. I found this book and although I can't say it was the end of the nightmare this book absolutely empowered them to deal with just that one day each month. I honestly feel this book should be known to every family court, law guardian and anyone who is in a court ordered visitation situation that is not welcomed by the children. This book was a godsend for us."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I absolutely loved The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. In 1975 my children and I had this thing where I kissed the palms of each of their hands and they kissed mine.

What a wonderful surprise when this book was published and given to me by one of my daughters."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This is such a sweet, and charming little tale for wee ones!

I ordered it as soon as we returned home. It is a heartwarming story. I especially love it and have used the story for saying good bye at preschool and when I have to travel for business.

This book will become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Like many teachers, I used this book on my first day for my kindergarten class.

This will be an heirloom book for my other child as well as my grandchildren"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I bought this book because my daughter bought one at her school for \\"us\\" when she was very young(separated because of divorce), it was lost in a move and it had sentimental value for both of us...it's not \\"the one\\" she bought, but it's just as good and in great condition."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The Kissing hand is a wonderful book that show's how strong the bond is between a mother and her child.

Does focus on the child going to school so I think we will be reading this one for a few years to come."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I bought this book hoping it would help my nearly three-year old feel more comfortable with me leaving when I go away for the weekend, etc. We have used the \\"kissing hand\\" and he seems to connect to it. However, the book is really about making kids feel comfortable going to school, so it would be even better for that."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"This has been a favorite book in my house for about 11 years now, coming out of the closet with each child. Now Princess A is old enough to understand and enjoy it and I am rediscovering why I love it so much.The illustrations are gorgeous and eye catching. They have kept all of my children enraptured every time we read it. Most important is the storyline. A mom reminds her child through a simple act of kissing his hand that her love goes with him where ever he is. What child would not benefit from that?

This book is applicable to all the things children may fear at one point or another; school, camp, sleeping at a friend's house. It has beautiful pictures that sparked my children's interest and kept it until the end of the book. They wanted to talk about what they saw. When the book was done my son opened my hand and kissed my palm, so adorable!"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The \\"Kissing Hand\\" is a prize-winning book with good reason. In addition to its obvious application to anxiety that a child may have in going to school for the first time (or to a new school), it is a genuinely touching story for the child hearing the story and for the adult who shares the story.As a Lutheran pastor, I used it as a children's sermon in connection with Isaiah 49:16 (\\"See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;...\\"), as well as sharing it with my four-year old granddaughter who had recently movedaway; for both the children at church and for my granddaughter, it was meaningful and special."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"Saw this book at the \\"Welcome to Kindergarten\\" seminar and had to find it.

It shows the relationship between a son and his mother, and shows that missing someone is okay, but they are always near your heart (or hand in this case).Summary: Chester Raccoon does not want to go to school. He loves his mother very much, and would like to stay home with her. His mother tells him that he has to go to school, but gives him a kiss on his hand to help him remember how much she loves him. When Chester was at school the next day, his mother's gift made him feel less lonely. Chester returned the gift and kissed his mother's hand.Critical Review: This is a great book for little kids being separated from their mother for an extended period of time. The illustrations (by Ruth Harper and Nancy Leak), and kind of fuzzy. They appear like they may be textured. The illustrators use bright colors, which add to the beauty of the forest. They also use lighting and shadows to show the transition from day into night. The images do support the story. For example, when Chester is crying in the beginning, even though it is a rough image, you can tell the raccoon is crying. Penn uses repetition to entice the reader's attention regarding Chester's mother's secret. The word secret is repeated four times in three sentences. There are some complicated sentences, for example:\\"Now,\\" she told Chester, \\"whenever you feel lonely and need a little loving from home, just press your hand to your cheek and think, \\"Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you\\" And hat very kiss will jump to your face and fill you with toasty warm thoughts. (p. 11)This would be very difficult for an early reader to read. There are also some very simple sentences, for example:I want to stay home with you. I want to play with my friends, And play with my toys. And read my books. And swing on my swing. (p.1)The complicated sentences are said by the mother, and the simple sentences are said by Chester. This is very accurate. The final page says, \\"I lOVE YOU\\" and has Chester doing the sign language sign for I love you. This is a very subtle way to introduce sign language to children."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"I had a hard time finding this book in the stores.

Although he had been attending Day Care since birth, this was still a new experience for him and he was naturally nervous. So now, each morning we kiss his palm and send him off on the bus. It's a wonderful new ritual.September 11, 2001 began a tremendously difficult time in our country. Our children are 4 and 5, and we have been reading this nearly every night since then. A friend's daughter was having terrible nightmares and great fears about not seeing her Daddy (he's a Police Officer currently assigned to Ground Zero). We lent them the book to read to her.

The book's foreword says The Kissing Hand is \\"for the child within each of us who sometimes needs reassurance.\\" Love is truly the bedrock that sustains and reassures us on our path through life, and this book reinforces the importance of loving relationship for us all. Beautifully told, the tale may give youngsters the confidence they need to cope with whatever comes their way.

These are endearing, luminous illustrations - Chester Raccoon has got to be the cutest raccoon in all of children's literature.[...]"},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"The illustrations are beautiful; however, we have changed how we read the book.

The reviewer below who remarked that &quot;if you already have Love and Friendship and a copy of the Symposium you might feel gyped [sic]&quot; has missed the mark; the prize here is the translation itself.

On that note, it is one of the best translations around."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"Plato's Symposium is a discourse on the nature and origins of love and eroticism. This is done through a lengthy dialogue at the dinner party at the home of Agathon, where he and his guests, including Socrates (his lover), partake in wine and take turns eulogizing Eros, the god of love and desire. Each does his best to praise the god, while Socrates comments on them afterward through speech and dialogue. In the end, the party is joined by the intoxicated Alcibiades, who speaks of Socrates's honorable traits while also confessing his love and desire for him.Symposiums in Greek society were a chance for men to recline on couches and drink, converse, debate and party with one another. They were usually held to celebrate a young male entering aristocratic society, and normally these youths would attend as the companion of one of the adults with whom we was involved in a pederastic relationship. The arguments and topics presented in the Symposium can be difficult for the average modern reader to comfortably comprehend, as nearly each speech somehow turns inevitably to the subject of, and ultimate praise of, pederasty. This physical and emotional love between a man and a youth is held in high regard in the Symposium's reasoning, often being seen as more pure and more desirable than one between a man and a woman. The latter is more bent on procreation and physical attraction, while, in their eyes, pederasty deals more with souls and the love of that which is alike. It is these assumptions, which arise in each speech, which can make it difficult for one to agree completely with one of the character's arguments. Nevertheless, it is possible to find persuasive elements in each of their various speeches that can reveal valuable insight into the ways and reasons that human beings love and are beloved.The young Phaedrus is the first to honor Eros. The value of his view lies in his belief that a man who loves is a man who cares, and thus a man who strives to do good and not bring about shame to him or the ones he loves. Pausinias is next to speak, and he is persuasive in distinguishing the two manifestations of Eros, or two types of love: the love of the physical (Pandemus) and the love of the spiritual (Uranian). He then correctly places the spiritual love higher, for those of the other kind \\"are in love with their bodies and not their souls\\" and they can be \\"in love with the stupidest there can be, for they have an eye only to act [sexually] and are unconcerned with whether it is noble or not\\" (Plato 10). He decrees that one must love both the body and the soul, for if one loves only the body, \\"as soon as the bloom of the body fades - which is what he was in love with - \`he is off and takes wing'\\" (Plato 13).The third to speak is Eryximachus, whose speaks rightly of loves impact upon art and beauty. Aristophanes next gives an amusing, although no less romantic, portrayal of primordial balls of flesh rolling around, and being split into two parts, and searching the rest of its life for its other half to finally complete itself. It illustrates the loneliness one feels when without their lover. Agathon then gives an eloquent speech, the highlight of which is Eros's power to bring humans together in happiness.Lastly, the wise Socrates speaks. At first he uses what has presently been deemed \`Socratic dialogue' by asking Agathon a series of questions in order to bring out inconsistencies in his argument. By doing this, he is able manipulate a conversation to his liking, and convince the person he is conversing with of his own opinion by making it seem as though they arrived at that idea themselves. In this instance, Agathon originally said that Eros was by nature good and beautiful, but when examining the nature of love through Socrates' interrogation, he concludes that Eros is neither good nor beautiful. Socrates furthers his explanation by recounting a dialogue he had with a wise woman named Diotima of Mantineia. The genius of this instance is the realization of procreation being a way for an individual to seek immortality, and the need to create, in general, things such as art or great ideas or laws are driven from this need to be remembered. Human beings not only generate but also nurture to further the guarantee that their mark will be made lasting, whether it is a child or an epic. This could certainly account for the passion in humans for fame and/or reproduction, and gives terrific insight into the ultimate purposes of most human actions. (However, Diotima seems to fall short in one part of her argument when she says that man \\"will never generate in the ugly\\" for he desires beauty and good too greatly, yet infamy through death and fear has certainly been a motivating factor in many men's actions through their course to fame and remembrance).In this publication by The University of Chicago Press the reader is given Seth Benardete's beautiful translation along with the Allan Bloom's insightful \\"Ladder of Love,\\" which offers an analysis of the ancient text (although some background knowledge of the historical Socrates would ensure getting the most out of this essay). Plato's Symposium proves to be a wonderfully philosophical discourse on desire, although some of its ideas, as identified earlier, are justly outdated. Nevertheless, it provides a glimpse into the inner workings of man's heart and the forces that propel him to go on each day."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"In this review I will compare 5 translations of Plato's Symposium:1. Alexander Nehamas & Paul Woodruff (Hackett Pub Co, 1989).2. Benardete (University of Chicago Press, 2001).3. R.E. Allen (Yale University Press, 1993).4. Shelley's Translation (St Augustine Press, 2002)5. Sharon (Focus Publishing/R.Pullins Co, 1997)I have given all translations 5 stars for their own unique perspectives. Each of these editions has its own strengths and weaknesses, and because of this, none of this edition is complete in itself. Inevitably, if you are serious in undertaking this work, you need to pick up more than one edition. I will give a recommendation on which one to use, at the end of this review.Symposium consists of a series of speeches on love (Eros), culminating in Socrates' and then Alcibiades'. What I am looking for is, first, ease of understanding the central concept of the book, this is obtained through different types of translations. My bias is toward a translation that is fluid, natural, and conveys the concept in a straight forward way. Second, I am also looking for helpful insights and philosophical explanations of some key thoughts. You get this from the quality of commentary/notes as part of the book.Both Sharon's and Nehamas' editions are similar in their lucid, straightforward, and current translations. I find that these 2 editions to be the best and easiest in understanding the text. On the translation side, I give these 5 stars. However, the commentaries in both editions are basic, and unsatisfying in my mind. For this, I give 4 stars.Benardete's edition has a superb commentaries both written by him and another (which is the gem here) written by Allan Bloom. You may or may not like Bloom's style, but he does give you a lot of background especially in ancient Greek pederasty culture, and valuable insights in each of the speeches. I give this a 5 star. I will recommend buying this book just for those 2 commentaries. On the translation itself, however, I am not a fan of Benardete's style. I have commented this in other reviews for his other translations, especially the \\"Sophist\\". For some reason, I find it more complex, long winded, and harder to understand. For this I give this edition translation 4 stars only.Allen's edition is superb for both translation and commentaries; this is a 5 star book for me.Finally, on Shelley's translation: this is a unique edition for a couple of reasons. It is a translation of a masterpiece work, by a master in literature himself, Percy Shelley. So, you are reading not only Plato's works, but also a work by one of the most influential literary figure in the English world. Secondly, there is an extensive commentary by David O'Connor, not only on the Symposium, but also on Shelley's process and motivation of doing the translation. A superb edition.My final recommendation: pick up either Sharon or Nehamas' book (personally I prefer Sharon's, it is beautifully done) for the translation, and then pick up Stanley Rosen's \\"Plato's Symposium\\" for the commentary (I have a separate review for this superb book). However, if you must read 1 and only 1 book, I would stay with Allen's."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"What this book contains:- Bernadete's translation of the Symposium (54 pages)- Bloom's essay on the Symposium, &#34;The Ladder of Love&#34; (122 pages)- Bernadete's essay, &#34;On Plato's Symposium&#34; (20 pages).This is a difficult book to review, as I don't have the specialist knowledge required to assess the quality of the translation or truly appreciate the essays. So with that in mind, the Symposium as translated here is very readable and has some interesting ideas to ponder. The essays were far less enjoyable and provided only limited assistance with understanding the text. Bloom's essay, with its sweeping generalisations and failure to define terms, did not convince.As this edition is described as having two commentaries, I was expecting it to lay out the context (historical, philosophical and literary) of the Symposium in detail, but it doesn't; some information can be picked up here and there within the essays, but nowhere near enough for those unfamiliar with ancient Athens. This isn't the edition for novice readers like me.Four stars for the translation."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"This is a wonderful translation that stays as close to the Greek as one could expect from a 'readable English' translation. Off-tone idioms are kept to a minimum, giving the text an authentic Greek feel. I would call the added essays a grab bag. I'm not a fan of Bloom's ranging, presumptuous style, but it does lead to a variety of stunning observations I might have otherwise missed. Benardete has a similar habit of expanding on the text itself, but he's more reigned in. Prepare to disagree with them often, and the commentaries will prove very useful."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"Plato's _Symposium_ is essential to understanding, insofar as that is possible, the allure and rewards of philosophy. Benardete's translation is accurate and readable, and his essay is helpful in following the action and bringing out some of the more important features of the dialogue. Bloom's &quot;Ladder of Love&quot; is reprinted within, and helps to situate the _Symposium_ within the broader question of philosophy and philosophy within our world."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"What you get here is 1) a new translation of Symposium by Benardete 2) Allan Bloom's Ladder of Love, which was previously published in his book Love and Friendship 3) a short, though not unworthy article by Benardete. Bloom dominates, so if you already have Love and Friendship and a copy of Symposium you might feel gyped because the only new thing is Benardete's small article. If however you don't have Love and Friendship and don't really care for Rousseau or the nineteen century novel, this book is a definite option. Bloom's book is rather unwieldly and unfocused. This book is most certainly focused."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"I found many of the ideas about love in the Symposium very interesting and the Ladder of Love that followed was also good to read."},{"Title":"Plato's Symposium: A Translation by Seth Benardete with Commentaries by Allan Bloom and Seth Benardete","review":"I purchased this for school and on the amazon site it was listed as in good condition.

As I read on and on, I recognized this gift to be the very best gift she has ever given me.Yes, I am a Baha'i; I recommend to seekers, people who weren't really seeking but knew something was missing or just the curious who love to know everything.A light bulb went off in my head that I have never had until reading this book on top of all the other books about death. Between the back cover to Page 121, I finally get what &quot;this&quot; is all about.What I realized from reading it is that heaven isn't somewhere out there in the stratosphere, it's here, next to us, another dimension. We have no concept beyond our dimension or time. That was so easy to read just from the Christian Scriptures that state: &quot;In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you so.It has given me so much piece of mind to have that clear picture. It's this life that I have zero clues about. My mom always called this life was the life, the other being the real life.It's about dimensions when mansions is mentioned. Perhaps its different for everyone of us. For those who feel like they need Pearly gates and streets paved with gold, who am I to say that is not so. For me it is about crystal clean water and trees, loads of Redwood Forest trees. It's about color.I really haven't a clue how many dimensions, I just hope I hook up in the right one. It forces me to wake up each day to be a better person and get outside of the box."},{"Title":"The Glorious Journey to God","review":"This book is so special to me.

So many people know the story of her childhood, and how she overcame being deaf and blind, but that's not her real achievement.

I just bought my third copy of Mr.Lackey's opus through Amazon.com, recently. He is the product of a one-room school house. His diction is ridden with errors. Nonetheless, The Almighty endowed him with an inborn expressiveness that makes his piece a good read. Thank goodness he undertook writing it; if he hadn't, much of the colorful lore of this unique area, an area which is a vestige of early-twentieth-century America, would have been forever lost!"},{"Title":"History of Newton County, Arkansas","review":"At the age of nine, I actually met the author, Mr. Lackey, during a childhood trip from Texas to take my grandfather back to his birthplace in Newton County, Arkansas. During the early 1960's, Mr. Lackey so generously gifted my grandfather with an original copy of this book...because my grandfather and his family were cited in the book, depicting their role as owners of a local gristmill in the 1800's.Walter F. Lackey may have been poorly educated, but he had a vivid desire to collect, preserve and record the history of his homeland. His office/study was a spacious building, separate from his house, where he collected, catalogued and displayed his vast and varied collection of artifacts gathered from the Newton County area. He patiently and proudly showed us various items in his collection, including musket balls and cannonballs from the Civil War that he had found on his own property. There were numerous pieces of dinnerware fragments, utensils, farm implements, tools, etc., on display...even fossils he had found. My father was especially intrigued by a cast iron pot and a molding tool that had been used to melt lead and make \\"lead shot\\" for muskets. There were even baskets woven by early Native Americans.For anyone, like myself, who has ancestors in their family tree that resided back then in Newton County...Mr. Lackey's book records a wealth of genealogical history. I am deeply grateful for the curiosity of Mr. Lackey and his desire to preserve a little piece of Arkansas's Ozark heritage. Thanks, Walter!Since the book was originally published on a very limited scale and hard to find, I was very pleased indeed to learn, here on Amazon, that someone had reproduced/reprinted Mr. Lackey's book, so others could benefit from it as a regional history and genealogical reference."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Dogs","review":"As a kid I would raid my father's bookshelf of paperback books from the 1940's and 50's and this li'l wonderful collection of fantastic cartoons by America's own James Thurber was one of the earliest volumes that caught my attention. This 25 cent Bantam book is from 1946, and it is set in a world of just what that title explains as here you will find funny men, wild women and a few sleeping hounds on the pages of this volume. This is classic Thurber magic of simple lines from his inkwell as found on yellowing pages from so long ago.Some of these single panel cartoons read like a Broadway play in only a few sentences and the humor is sly and sarcastic as only this master of words could produce. I tend to agrue that like the films of the Marx Brothers a certain James Thurber was miles ahead of the times he lived in decades ago when these cartoons were created. The closing section of this book is entitled: \\"The War Between Men and Women\\" and it is my favorite narrative from this artist that I have ever come across as this is of Civil War epic proportions as wars tend to go. This one is an all-out battle that even the hounds cannot stop!James Thurber, was and will always be one of our nation's greatest humorist-type persons and I feel lucky to have had the good fortune to have been able to enjoy his books for almost all of my life.Four & 1/2 Stars!"},{"Title":"Men, Women and Dogs","review":"This &quot;classic&quot; book, revered and collected by so many, by the great humorist and artist.

There are also accounts by journalists who never fired a shot and were responsible for no military decision. But they were present and necessarily are excellent writers. Hugh Lunn has an additional qualification - he is an Australian journalist and had no ax to grind. Much of his chronicle occurs in and near the Reuters office in Saigon. He interacts with many people, some very important and others whose individual efforts have little effect on the war's outcome. He attempts to reach the field and witness the most strenuous fighting. He succeeds often enough to encounter a reality at odds with that of the American high command. This presents the challenge of dancing his way around censorship to present his version of the truth. What makes this book outstanding are the observations of an outsider about how Americans made war; even details of the PX are scrutinized. Lunn's take is fascinating, refreshing, and unique. Fortunately Lunn was in country for the Tet Offensive. His return to Australia shortly thereafter destined that offensive to be the crescendo of the book as it was of the war.In short, this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Investigations of the State Capitol grounds: (16EBR79 and 16EBR 25)","review":"Vietnam: A Reporter's War is the 5th book by Australian journalist and author, Hugh Lunn. In it, Lunn details his year in Vietnam as a reporter for the Reuters agency. With his conversational style, Lunn presents a vast amount of information in an easy-to-assimilate form. His first-hand view of the US military propaganda machine in action, and the alternative sources a reporter might find, makes for interesting reading. He describes the intricacies of reporting from the field, sometimes under fire, and in a third-world country long before the existence of mobile phones, email and the fax machine. His description of the process by which newspapers get their stories from the wire services, who decides which story and which version will go to print, and how vastly this may differ from the facts, is quite a revelation. Other interesting subjects Lunn touches on: the attitude and behaviour of US servicemen towards the Vietnamese (brusque, insulting and completely lacking cultural sensitivity), and how this lost them credibility; the bravery of the troops under fire; the acceptance of 10% mortality due to friendly fire; the impossibility of discerning who was Viet Cong; the laughable tactics the US military used to scare the seasoned Viet Cong guerrillas; the US idea that they could win over the Vietnamese by good works (dams, schools, bridges) whilst at the same time shooting, napalming and defoliating them or their country; the completely ridiculous barrier planned to keep the Viet Cong out of South Vietnam. Some of the statistics were mind-numbing (4000 choppers lost by the end of '67!). The extent to which the US Administration was out of touch with reality on the front was staggering. Lunn's comments on the differences between the American troops (an army of university students) and the Australian Army (well-drilled schoolboys) and their behaviour and tactics was interesting, as was the effect on the complexion of the war of the North's use of Russian weaponry. Lunn's Vietnamese colleague, Dinh, said many insightful things, summing up the war with \\"...the Viet Cong, they are not afraid to die\\". This book has moments of laughter and joy, but also moments of drama and sorrow. A great read."},{"Title":"English Speech Act Verbs: A Semantic Dictionary","review":"This is one of the most important books in the English language. It is imperative that it remains in print.Wierzbicka gives a detailed semantic breakdown of all the English speech act verbs she can find, more than a hundred. Each is discussed in depth, contrasted against others, then broken out into her English pseudo-code language.A critical reference.Will only be useful for advanced researchers in pragmatics, linguistics, and higher-level computational linguistics. As speech acts sit on top of semantics / syntax / grammar / lexical items, the book mentions but is above these layers. Speech acts are also similar to illocutionary force. If you do not already know what pragmatics and illocutionary force are, there is no reason for you to open this book. Otherwise, it is an extremely chewy reference, with tough, valuable meat on every page. Invaluable for the right person."},{"Title":"Butterfly Valley: A Requiem","review":"I'm shocked to learn that Inger Christensens \\"Sommerfugledalen\\" (ie. The Butterfly Valley) has been translated. Because that's impossible.However, someone here claims it has happened, and, unable as I am to rate or review the result, which I have never held in my hand, I can only recommend that someone with English as their native language checks it out. The five stars go to the Danish version.\\"Sommerfugledalen\\" is the most beautiful book I have ever come across. It is full of poetic logic expressed both beautifully and stringently within the chosen form.I don't know \\"Poem on Death\\" as well as I do \\"The Butterfly Valley\\". But I see how it has already lost the double d's of \\"Digt om dden\\"...It would be miraculous though if not only the Danish-speaking could read Inger Christensen."},{"Title":"Butterfly Valley: A Requiem","review":"\\"Butterfly Valley: A Requiem,\\" by Inger Christensen, has been translated from Danish by Susanna Nied. This 70-page volume contains four poems: the title poem (pages 1 to 17), \\"Watersteps\\" (19 to 37), \\"Poem on Death\\" (39 to 48), and \\"Meeting\\" (49 to 70). The back cover identifies the author as \\"one of Europe's most revered poets.\\" This is a monolingual volume, with only the English versions given; I must say that even though I can't read Danish, I wish the editors had presented a bilingual edition so that readers could at least see what the Danish versions of the poems look like.I must admit--I found this book very hard to connect with on my first reading, but I stuck with Christensen and began to get more out of the book upon repeated readings of the poems. The back cover features a quote from Eliot Weinberger, who describes Christensen as \\"a formalist who makes her own rules, then turns the game around with another rule.\\" Indeed, I found Christensen's polished use of varied forms to be the most striking aspect of this volume. Each of the four poems has a precise structure that is totally distinct from those of the other poems in the book.The title poem is described on the back cover as a sonnet cycle. Although the English versions don't have a discernable rhyme scheme, each division of the poem does have a precise 14-line structure. The overall cycle is masterfully designed, and the full unity and complexity of its structure is powerfully revealed with the final section. It's a real triumph of form. The poem seems to envision butterflies as a complex and multifaceted metaphor. The language is often strikingly beautiful, and often has great visual appeal. The next poem, \\"Watersteps,\\" blends suspense and surrealism as it takes the reader to the fountains of Rome. It is structured as a sort of staccato prose poem, and has an odd, unsettling rhythm. The language in \\"Watersteps\\" is precise and matter-of-fact, drawing from the language of history and architecture; it's a stunning contrast with the lush, sweeping language of the previous poem.\\"Poem on Death\\" is divided into dozens of short, haiku-like stanzas. This poem is not just about death, but also about writing, writer's block, and words themselves. The final poem, \\"Meeting,\\" is written in a sort of prose-poem form that reminds me of Allen Ginsberg's classic \\"Howl.\\" \\"Meeting\\" contains some striking and disturbing imagery. At points in the poem Christensen seems to be deconstructing the use and nature of words themselves. Overall, I did not find this book wholly satisfying. I found the final two poems in particular just too obscure. Still, there is much in this volume that is appealing and thought-provoking. Christensen's is a skilled and intriguing voice; I recommend this book to serious students of poetry."},{"Title":"Butterfly Valley: A Requiem","review":"Her new book, \\"Butterfly Valley a Requiem,\\" contains four sequences from (apparently) different decades of her production, all of them sharing in the crystalline utterance that distinguished ALPHABET, which New Directions published a few years back to introduce the famous Danish poet to English-speaking audiences.While lean on content, the new book has a certain symmetry. A sequence of sonnets begins in the butterfly valley itself. We have one here just south of San Francisco in Santa Cruz, and anyone who has seen one of these resting places for weary butterflies will recognize the perfection with which Christensen's poem is etched. \\"Here gooseberry and blackthorn bushes grow;/ whichever of the words you eat, they make/ your life butterfly-easy to recall.\\" Hats are off to translator Susanna Nied for supplying the neologistic \\"butterfly-easy.\\" A 15 part \\"Watersteps\\" which uses what seems to be a very restricted methodology, shows off Christensen's formalism and gives us something to chew on intellectually. The sources of the five voices perplex until the mystery resolves itself into a wonky question mark. I did not care for the \\"Poem on Death,\\" until the end, when the stunning revelation arrives that \\"the dead lift the living/ up to drink.\\"The final poem, \\"Meeting,\\" is a bit like the lesser poems of the French poet Anne-Marie Albiach, and a little like the new track by Australian pop superstar Kylie Minogue, \\"Last night I lost my head/ And fell right back into your love./ I lay intoxicated / While angels circled high above.\\" While Christensen remains on a branch of her own, in the tree of poetry, thank goodness for New Directions, bringing her to English so that they can begin to sketch out her entire taxonomy, for she has an oeuvre worth exploring in extensis."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"So I finally ordered SMAX, a 5 issue miniseries that comes right from the pages of Alan Moore'sTop Ten, Book 1. I know I should review Top Ten but that will have to be next month. Suffice to say, though, that Top Ten is about Precinct Ten, about a group of police officers that have to deal with an entire world of super-powered beings, a world with aliens with strange powers, ultra-technologically enhanced citizens, magic based creatures and even a few divine pantheons. So, of course, in this planet, and in this city, being a cop is extremely complicated.The officers in Top Ten represent a very rich and unique cast of characters, with different powers and very distinct personalities. One of the main characters was Jeff Smax, a tall, blue-skinned alien with super strength, invulnerability and the \`strong light', an energy projection ability. In the first issue of Top Ten he's paired with Robyn, AKA Toybox. She is just a normal girl but she possesses a box filled with super-advanced miniaturized robots, shaped like toys, which function like a small army in battles.I don't know why it took me so long to order SMAX. Top Ten had been so wonderful that I guess I was afraid that this spin-off wouldn't live up to the level of quality of the original series. A reasonable preoccupation, after all, most spin-offs are rarely good. But I'm glad that I finally read it. Yes, it's a wonderful series and it works precisely because it's different from Top Ten: you don't need to read any previous issue to connect with the characters or understand what's going on.In the first issue Jeff Smax must return to his home planet, to assist to his uncle's funeral. Robyn, probably his only friend on Earth, decides to tag along. One of the things that I loved the most about Top Ten's artistic approach was the amount of details and hidden homages / references to comics or movies hidden (or in plain view) in every frame, in every page. Here artist Zander Cannon manages to accomplish the same feat. Take a look at the splash page of the first issue: we have Mick Anglo's classic British super-hero; an obviousThe Matrixreference in one of the billboards (\`why didn't I take the blue pill?', it's an ad for a pharmacy); Rorschach fromWatchmentalking with Steve Ditko's The Question from Charleston Comics / DC Comics, and many more (in fact, who else can find other references / homages in this page?).Smax feels ashamed of his world, he describes it to Robyn as an underdeveloped planet, outside the commercial interstellar routes. It's world of magic, outside the boundaries of science: it's a world in which transportation takes place thanks to wizardry or mythical flying creatures, a world inhabited by gnomes, elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, fairies, talking animals, dragons, etc. A world absolutely charming; and here, very much like in Top Ten, there are constant references to the literary genre of fantasy as well as fairy tales. It's a quite a delight, not only as a metatextual insight of literary categories and therefore unyielding structures and clich&eacute;s but also as a metaphor of Smax's own necessity to fit in a certain role, an specific classification. His understandable urge, of course, comes from his own hybrid condition: he's the son of an ogre and a powerful, magical female warrior. And so is his sister.The folklore and the magical creatures of Smax's home leave Robyn in awe. But as they seek for a suitable lodging they find themselves trapped in a very peculiar situation. They stay in a tavern that works according to every genre convention of children's narrative, Robyn is given a bed with dozens of mattresses piled up and a pea underneath them, as if she were the princess from bedtime stories. And Smax finds himself in a typical dungeon with torture instruments. However, it's the food what shocks them the most: mermaid, unicorn, cherubim, the goose of the golden eggs, the three piggies. Like I said before, the more you remember the stories your parents told you before going to sleep, the more you can laugh about the irony in Smax's pages.The evolution of the characters is quite rewarding. The perpetually silent and serious Smax from Top Ten gives way to a more communicative albeit insecure and guilty man. Robyn is stunned as she finds out one revelation after another. Back in Earth, Smax would barely say his full name; in his planet, though, he ends up confessing his innermost secrets.Guilt, according to Jacques Lacan, disassociates the concept of the self and the superego. Guilt comes when one gives into desire. To give in means not to carry out that which is represented as our desire. Smax feels guilty for his incestuous relationship with his sister. But at the same time, he blames himself for failing miserably as a dragon-slayer.Top Ten had superb art by Gene Ha, but I think Zander Cannon was just the right artist for such an extravagant and yet funny and fantastic miniseries as Smax. With a very clean, \`cartoony' style, Cannon delivers both the horror and the humor, the light and the darkness, the perennial dichotomy inherent to all bedtime stories. At the same time, he also manages to provide the reader with plenty of visual details, insinuations and jokes that make this world of fantasy more cohesive than anything else.\\"Isn't it good to be lost in the wood...and isn't it bad, so quiet there, in the wood?\\", is what you get if you combine the titles of the first and second issue of this miniseries (coincidentally, every issue is titled following the lyrics of Syd Barrett's Octopus, check the 5 splash pages I've posted and see for yourselves). And certainly it's a nice way of helping the reader to get in touch with the protagonists dilemmas.Smax is a troubled man. He's lost, but at the same time he cannot reclaim his own identity. He's Jeff Smax, respected police officer from precinct ten, but he's also Jaafs, the infamous dragon-slayer. He abandoned his home world for several reasons, chief amongst them the remorse he feels for failing in his most important quest as a dragon-slayer. In world populated by magical creatures, killing dragons can be quite a profitable career. You rescue the princess and you get a percentage of the gold that is found in the dragon's cave. Again, Alan Moore plays with genre conventions, in such a witty and refreshing way that one can burst into laughter at the turn of the page.Robyn convinces Smax that in order to vanquish the ghosts from his past, he must go on another quest. Ominous signs are bequeathed, presages are foreseen. He has no choice but to obey the dictations of fate. That's when Smax decides to go to town and reactivate his license as a dragon-slayer. The town displays many of the typical vices that one would find in any large city. Just like it was seen in the first issue, this is not a \`happily ever after' reality. You can see a tooth fairy buying drugs, magical creatures prostituting themselves to earn enough to survive, alcoholism and so on. But Moore only shows us this as peripheral activities.There are some hilarious scenes there, as Robyn meets one of the many iterations of Death. If anybody has read Terry Pratchett's book about Death (Mort) then a lighthearted, humorous and yet enthralling portrayal of Death will be familiar... In Smax's world, death is a part of the bureaucratic machinery. There is a personification of death for each instance and species, there is a death for animals, another one for elves, another one for dwarves; there is a death for minor characters, there is a death for epic, glorious and larger than life heroes. Robyn meets one of the most insignificant deaths, one that deals only with the most irrelevant demises. Nonetheless, they get along, and thanks to their conversation, Robyn learns that she only has one Death to fear, the dark one called \`Dennis'.Once their quest is approved by every office and every functionary, Smax, Robyn and a fellowship of elves, dwarves and others travel across the woods, in search of Morning Bright's lair. Morning Bright is one of the original dragons, one of the most powerful creatures that planet has ever seen. And although Smax is indestructible he lacks the power to defeat such a powerful foe. And that's when Robyn offers her help. In a world of magical talismans, secret potions, ancient spells and magical solutions, she offers one whacky alternative: science. Now, for the elves and dwarves, science is as uncanny and incomprehensible as magic to Robyn. And precisely because of that, science is their only alternative, after all that' the only thing that Morning Bright will find unpredictable.But despite the results of the battle, there will be one very delicate matter to attend: Smax incestuous relationship with his sister Rexa. He knows once he comes back to Earth he must do that alone, as incest is forbidden by Earthly law. Surviving the monstrosity (literal monstrosity) of his father, a vicious and cruel ogre that would rape his daughter constantly, meant that at a young age Smax had to kill the ogre and run away with Rexa. He has shared a live with her, and it will be difficult to leave her behind once again.Why is their relationship so important? They seem to surpass the idealized brotherly relationship as seen in Sophocles Antigone. Smax and Rexa are 'autadelphos' (Greek term: autos- \\"same\\"; adelphos- \\"sisterly\\", related to delphus- \\"womb\\"), not only have they shared the mother's womb but they also share every physical trait, except for gender they're identical to one another in physical appearance and superpowers. According to Saussure's linguistics, brother and sister would only be able to articulate themselves into the symbolic order by functioning as mutually supplementary properties. Here the signifier (the body) is the same, but the signified (the personality) is not. If they see themselves as irreplaceable, if they actually complement each other, what should they do? Live together thus validating incest? Or part ways again, perhaps forever?"},{"Title":"Smax","review":"i picked up Smax as a continuation of Top Ten. it does pick up from the end of volume two.one of the great pleasures of Top Ten was all the visual humor in the backgrounds. perhaps it's that the fantasy setting of Smax's home is less rich, but the sight gags are flat and repetitive. i miss Gene Ha's touch here, and i don't feel the same desire to reread and take in all of the details.the book pokes fun at high fantasy and is much more of a comedy than an adventure story. because it was a short run, the pace feels rushed. i was glad to know what happened next to Smax and Toybox, but i was disappointed in the development of the characters and failed to get emotionally involved.recommended if you are a completist."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"Or maybe I should say Conan parody?

Smax takes his partner, ToyBox, with him and we get to learn more than we could have hoped for about the previous life of Jeff Smax, or Jaafs Smackson, the dragonslayer. It is funny (there is a bureau that oversees all kinds of quests; quotas must be met, so Smax has to take with him some dwarfs, elves and sorcerers!), it is smart, it is Alan Moore! The art is cartoony, but it works."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"I was never that much of a fan of the original Top Ten series. But I really enjoyed this fun and engaging spin off. In this series we follow Top Ten character Smax back to the \\"Sword and Sorcery\\" style parallel universe where he grew up. This book is fairly different from Top Ten - this is pretty much Alan Moore doing humorous fantasy in the style of Terry Pratchett's \\"Discworld\\" novels - although Moore can be a little bit more dark and nasty than Pratchett. Readers who haven't read Top Ten should be able to pick this one up and enjoy it, although they may be slightly confused the first five or ten pages. But after that this is completely its own story. And it's all very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"Once again, Alan Moore for the win. Like The Forty-Niners, this is a spinoff of his excellent Top 10 series. Smax and Toy Box head to Smax's homeworld, a place brimming with all the hallmarks of a fairy tale world, as well as wink wink, nudge nudge fantasy humor. Essentially, it's a fairy tale in a fairy tale land filled with all the tropes of fairy tales, but with Moore's little twists. Entirely different than Top 10, but just as enjoyable.Despite having a very childish, cartoonish look, just like Top 10 the art is bursting with references to everything under the sun, from Harry Potter to Winnie the Pooh to Bob The Angry Flower to Star Wars and lots more. Great fun (though don't let the look fool you; the story deals a bit with rape and incest, so this isn't for kids)."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"SMAX is a spinoff from Moore's wonderful Top 10 series. Moore is the only comic book writer who can make me laugh out loud and shudder in fear (and in the same book!) and SMAX certainly doesn't disappoint; it's a mostly light-hearted and hilarious story with moments of true horror. Moore's take on the dragon seems very fresh and interesting; Moore, as is typical, seems to know what he's talking about. It's also a nice exploration of people who leave their backward homes for the big city and what happens when they return.The artwork is good and suits the generally light and \\"magical\\" story, although I prefer the more realistic artwork on the original Top 10.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Smax","review":"One of the better stories from Alan Moore I read. Really liked it, it added a lot to the whole Top 10 saga. If you like top 10, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Smax","review":"If you haven't read any Alan Moore, start! This book is a follow up to Top Ten Book 2. I won't include spoilers, and you don't need to have read Top Ten to appreciate this novel. Watch the panels closely - there are so many nods to pop culture that it would be hard to start a list! It's funny and sad and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Smax","review":"A knight off to kill the Dragon, and sleep with his sister, or a knight off to sleep with his sister and kill the Dragon.

I mean it was funny, had nice atmosphere and setting and overall everything was decent, but... Well, the plot seemed a little thin for all the build up. There's this whole big secret problem Smax has and then, well they walk around for a couple pages find the dragon, Robin thinks up a gimmick, and there you go. And the fact that the whole Smax and sister thing is solved so quickly, well. I guess I expected more from the fact that this was a mini-series and all. I'd say it's about as good as one of the side-stories in Top Ten, but not as good as the main plot arc in those books."},{"Title":"Dynamic Loading and Design of Structures","review":"The book contains contributions from 9 authors (from the UK, Greece and Norway) on all important types of dynamic loading on structures. Apart from the load models, as described in the Probabilistic Model Code, part II, of the Joint Committee on Structural Safety (available on the JCSS site), the book also includes chapters on wave loads (by Torgeir Moan, NTNU), and human- and machine induced vibrations (by JW Smith, Bristol University), which the reviewer found very interesting to read."},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"I read Marrying McCabe(my personal favorite) and once I did I had to hunt down the others from this series. Blade and Anna have been connected since she was 11 and he was 17. She's been running from her step-father for the last 10 years since he was trying to kill her to collect her inheritance. Blade has had &quot;flashes&quot; and dreams of Anna but has always thought that they were in his mind. Now he's found her and he's determined to keep her but first they have to solve the problem of her step-father. Fiona Branda's books remind me of early Linda Howard(Mackenzies espcecially) They are sensual and fun to read. It's very rare that I find a &quot;new&quot; author that goes right to the top of my favorites list. This book and other from this series are heading right for my keeper shelf and I will be waiting for more by her!!"},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"Anna, a lost heiress, has been running for years. During that time, she dreams of a fantasy man.

But one night, one of the nightmares lead him to his dream lady. Now he takes up her fight, to protect, save, and love her.The sensuality rating is high and the action gripping. What a man! If you like Linda Howard's writing, you will love this author. She's definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"I love this book! I've read it countless times and it never bores me. Blade and Anna have been connected psychically since Anna was 11 and an attempt was made on her life. Several years later, Anna is still in danger when she and Blade finally meet after another attempt on Anna's life. When they meet its kismet and their romance is ignited. Although Anna has been on the run for years, you do not pity her; rather admire her strength and route for her. Blade is the ultimate hero: loving and gentle with a fierceness to protect what he loves. I travel with my job, and I always bring this book with me. The characters are wonderfully written, the plot is great, and there are moments that just enrapture me. There's a scene where Anna figures out that she's in love with Blade. Every time I read it, I love this scene more.After reading Blade's Lady, I hunted down her other books Cullen's Bride and Heart of Midnight. They were both well worth the hunt. If you love Linda Howard's Mackenzie books or Suzanne Brockmann's Tall Dark &amp; Dangerous books, you'll adore Fiona Brand's books."},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"Blade's Lady is one of the best books I've read this year - definitely a keeper. The characters are strong and interesting, and the suspenseful plot keeps the action moving. Anna Tarrant dreamed of a gallant knight for years, never imagining he was real. Blade Lombard heard her desperate cries in his dreams for years, never quite believing they were real. The coming together of these two characters was exciting and realistic. There is a brief appearance by Blade's brother Gray and his wife Samantha, (from Heart of Midnight) and Cullen and Rachel (from Cullen's Bride). If you like Linda Howard's novels, you will LOVE Fiona Brand! I can't think of enough wonderful things to say about her writing!"},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"It's always difficult to find good books, but I'd definitely recommend this book.As a first-time reader of Fiona Brand, I was not disappointed.I thought the writing style was reminiscent of Linda Howard.It is a sexy romance that contains a slight paranormal element, mixed with the right dose of action. If you've read anything by Linda howard you're sure to enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"August 2000 was a great month for the Silhouette Intimate Moments line. Linda Howard's A Game of Chance and Fiona Brand's Blade's Lady are 2 of my favorite SIM's and each would make any month memorable.Blade is a yummy hero, the strong, protective alpha that many of us dream of. His determination to get Anna into his life as well as protect her from her step-father and his goons is wonderful. He is loving and gentle with Anna and has no jerk moments. Anna is also a great heroine. She's a strong woman to have survived life on the run, but she's never bitchy and best of all, she doesn't fall apart as soon as the hero is there to lean on.The plot is great, there's some good suspense, the villain is suitably slimy, and the writing is very good. Blade and Anna share a psychic connection that's essential to the plot, but even if paranormal isn't usually your thing (it isn't mine) it's unlikely to put anyone off. The rescue at the end may surprise if you're expecting an American-style shoot-'em-up. Blade goes for strategy and stealth instead of firepower. There's some lovely sensuality, you can feel the connection between Anna and Blade. So romantic and sexy *sigh*"},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"I loved the psychic element in this book, it really gave the story something extra! Blade is my favorite kind of take charge hero who is also sensitive to his woman's needs and feelings. I am really looking forward to reading more by this author!"},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"If you want suspense, rescues, hot romance, then this is the book for you. It is the best book I have read in quite awhile. This is a book you read from cover to cover without putting down, because you have to know how it ends, then you want it to go on because you feel like you are a part of their lives. BUY THIS BOOK, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"After reading McCabe's story, I had to see if any of the others would compare. This one was even better. It almost had a Twilight quality to it, but more of an adult version. If it hadn't been written first I would have believe Stephanie Meyer inspired it. Though, not because of vampires or even the supernatural element so much, but because of the characters. Anna and Blade remind me very much of a mature version of Bella and Edward. Though Anna's accident-prone behavior is more due to people always trying to kill her than clumsiness. And much like Bella, Anna is more concerned with bringing other people into her dangerous world than she is worried about herself. She's willing to risk herself to keep Blade safe. And much like Edward, Blade goes a little nuts trying to keep Anna safe. Because of the fact that Anna has the ability to link to Blade through their minds, he's in love with her from the beginning and will do anything to protect her and keep her for himself. A truly beautiful romance story.This is a book you must pick up. Wonderful characters and an amazing story. I will definitely be getting the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Blade's Lady (SIM 1023)","review":"I only happened to pick up this book by chance but what sold me on it wasn't the storyline or the author (I'd never heard of her before)---it was one line, a recommendation by my all-time favorite author Linda Howard. Anytime I see a book endorsed by Ms. Howard I'll buy it, won't even bother reading the synopsis on back. I was blown away! This book was hot and sexy and incredibly romantic. I LOVED IT!! I also quickly purchased her other two novels Cullen's Bride and Heart of Midnight. This author is really talented and I can't wait for her next book. She ranks right up there with Linda Howard and Stephanie Laurens. Fiona Brand's heroes are sexy and dangerous and very tender."},{"Title":"Basic Mathematics","review":"Serge Lang's text presents the topics that he feels students should understand before commencing their study of college mathematics. As such, working through this text is a good way for you to supplement what you learned in high school with material that will aid you in studying mathematics in college. Therefore, I particularly recommend it for prospective mathematics majors.The material in the text is well motivated and clearly presented. While Lang explains how to perform routine calculations, he focuses on the underlying structure of the mathematics. The material is developed logically and results are proved throughout the text. However, the presentation of the material is marred by numerous errors, most, but not all, of which are typographical.The problems range from routine calculations to proofs. Many of the problems are challenging and some require considerable ingenuity to solve. Answers to some of the exercises are presented in the back of the text. I should warn you that if you are used to artificial textbook problems in which the correct solution is a \\"nice\\" number, you will find that is not the case here. Also, it is useful to read through the problem sets before you begin solving them so that you can do related problems at the same time.The first section of the book covers algebra. Properties of the integers, rational numbers, and real numbers are examined and compared. There is also more routine material on linear equations, systems of linear equations, powers and roots, inequalities, and quadratic equations.A brief discussion of logic precedes a section on geometry. Basic assumptions about distance, angles, and right triangles are used as a starting point rather than Euclid's postulates. This leads to a discussion of isometries, including reflections, translations, and rotations. Area is discussed in terms of dilations. The treatment here is different from that in the high school text Geometry which Lang wrote with Gene Murrow. I found the material on isometries quite interesting. Be aware that the notation and some of the terminology in this section is not standard.The third section of the book covers coordinate geometry. Distance is interpreted in terms of coordinates. This leads to a discussion of circles. Transformations are reinterpreted using coordinates. Segments, rays, and lines are presented using parametric equations. A chapter on trigonometry covers standard topics, but also includes a section on rotations. The section concludes with a chapter on conic sections. Of particular interest is a proof that all Pythagorean triples can be generated from points on the unit circle with rational coordinates.The final section of miscellaneous topics addresses functions, more generalized mappings, complex numbers, proofs by mathematical induction, summations, geometric series, and determinants. The text concludes by demonstrating how determinants can be used to solve systems of linear equations.The eminent mathematicians I. M. Gelfand and Kunihiko Kodaira have also contributed to books intended for high school students. Those of you planning to study mathematics in college would benefit from working through their texts as well."},{"Title":"Basic Mathematics","review":"Serge Lang died September 2005, and it was a great loss for many people; he has been a prominent mathematician, who has published many book and articles. He had a very good memory, and it is said that he wrote a book in the course of one weekend on a bet. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true, but you can sense that he feels at home writing about mathematics.Basic Mathematics is suited both for the younger readers who hasn&#8217;t begun high school yet, and for older readers who needs to refresh their skills. I believe that many people would benefit working through this book before starting in high school, as it will ease and speed up things. The book is structured in a way that it clearly brings the most important of the mathematics which later is to be used.The book has four parts: Algebra, Intuitive Geometry, Coordinate Geometry, and Miscellanous. There are 17 chapter spread over these four parts, which each deals with an important mathematical subject. Of mention are &#8220;Functions&#8221;, &#8220;Operations on Points&#8221;, &#8220;Distance and Angles&#8221;, and &#8220;Linear Equations&#8221;. It&#8217;s mainly basic mathematical subjects, which are dealt with in an &#8220;advanced way&#8221;, so the author doesn&#8217;t look down on his reader. Nothing is dwelt upon, but nothing important isn&#8217;t absent either.Exercises is included in nearly all sections, so that the reader can train himself in both a manipulative and a theoretical level. Som sections has many exercises (which can be tough at times), while some has only three or four. The difficulty is raised, of course, but if you just do the exercises, you&#8217;ll notice how well the book is structured in that basic techniques are used later in more advanced subjects.Recommended."},{"Title":"Basic Mathematics","review":"Serge Lang's Basic Mathematics is an excellent overview of algebra and geometry. If you are in high school needing a tutorial primer, or an adult continuing their education after some years, this book will provide through its clarity, examples, and exercises (selected answers are in the back of the book)the refresher course you need for more advanced mathematics, such as calculus and linear algebra."},{"Title":"Basic Mathematics","review":"Lang's Basic Mathematics is a famous mathematician's look at everything a well-prepared high school student ought to know about math before starting calculus. The exercises are thought-provoking and the solutions are enlightening. There is just enough but not too much drill on each point before moving on, and throughout there is a wonderfully mathematical attitude about the material. Recommended for anyone who has had algebra once and wants to know a lot more about what mathematics is really all about."},{"Title":"Basic Mathematics","review":"This book is ultimately for creating a strong foundation for calculus. \\"Basic\\" mathematics can be used lightly, as it's still relatively challenging, but by no means difficult. You'll spend time trying to understand proofs (by the way, he doest an excellent job of incoorporating proofs into the learning process, which is extremely necessary if you want to fully understand math) and figuring out some of the more challenging exercise problems, but the book is by no means painful to go through.I'll be a junior in high school next year, and was recommended studying this book by a math professor in Belgium (yes, really). The biggest thing to know about math, at least in the earlier levels, is that it is cumulative. You will be absolutely and forever f'ed if you go into Calculus with hardly any knowledge of algebra. That's why, if you find yourself struggling in math, or need to strengthen your foundations, you need to go throuh this book.It's excellent for self studying, which is what I'm currently doing this summer. When you take this book on at your own pace, and can spend more time on each section as required, and breeze through other sections that you have a firm grasp on, you'll find yourself enjoying the book. Serge Lang was an excellent mathematician (was... only because he is dead) and his books are well written and devoted to helping you understand the material.Remember though, that just because the book claims to be covering basic mathematics, that you won't be challenged. It can be tough, and especially when you're at the high school level, the mathematics won't seem like they're \\"basic\\", but more like, \\"hey, I just learned that last year/this year/whenever.\\" It's ultimately a wonderful book if you're looking to strengthen the foundation of your mathematic ability, and Lang also includes a brief section after the first chapter about how you should logically examine math, which is invaluable.Math, to a lot of people, is pointless and not fun. It's that way because of botched U.S. public education, a lack of good/inspiring math teachers, and partly due to a lack of motivation in students. Pick up this book, maybe make a schedule for it, and just sit down and DO math. After a while, you'll start to see the beauty of something that is so logical and amazing, something that has been the collective work of various genius human minds, collaborating to further mathematics, that you'll pick up a passion for math. Math is almost like a language. You can choose to go through life in ignorance, sitting by and listening to others communicate with eachother, looking on in awe, wondering what beautiful and inspiring things they could be saying, or you can sit down, get to work, and be right there with them, able to communicate in a logical and correct language that governs the universe."},{"Title":"The Scrambled Word and Anagram Finder","review":"For those of you that like solving puzzles or playing with words you will probably find this book quite helpful. This book should help you solve anagrams, and puzzles more easily."},{"Title":"A catechism for small children","review":"This is a well written, well researched text which includes a great deal of material drawn from the author's own notes, taken as a reporter inside Germany and a number of Eastern countries just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Like his contemporary, William Shirer, Leonard Mosley brings a professional eye to the major events of the period leading up to the start of the war, and the fact that he was often sur place, gives the book a most authentic ring. The book raises a number of seemingly minor but possibly vital questions such as: would Hitler's attitude to Chamberlain have been different had the British P.M. not turned up in Berchtesgarden with a staff of only four people? Certainly he began to develop a degree of contempt for Chamberlain from that meeting onward, and when it came time for the fateful meeting on the Rhine some months later, Hitler was openly contemptuous of the British P.M.Would things have also been different had the Czechoslovakian President, Eduard Benes, had more sleep just prior to the events of September 1938? Would he have seen things more clearly and called in the Russians, as he probably should have done (and, it is believed, nearly did do)? And would it not have been much more favourable for the British and French to fight Germany with Czechoslovakia in 1938, than without her in 1939? Mosley is very good at asking these sorts of questions, which, so many years later, may prove to have been very decisive indeed.How many odd events seemed to influence the mood of the leaders of that time. How many messages failed to get through to the right place. Sometimes they were inexplicably held up en route (Mosley suggests it may have been due, on occasions, to Communist spies in the British Secret Service - like Donald McLean). At other times, well placed people (like Paul Stehlin, the French Air Attach&eacute; in Berlin), tried to warn their governments repeatedly that things were hotting up, but were not taken seriously. As for the extraordinary series of errors committed by the Anglo-French military and political delegations to Moscow just prior to the invasion of Poland, Mosley covers them in detail and highlights many points hitherto overlooked.These and many other forgotten issues probably exerted a far greater influence at the time than has been thought since. Yet in the end, it was the personality of Adolf Hitler himself, although set off and to some extent complemented in exactly the wrong way by the French and British leaders of the period (and one might add, the Italian), which proved decisive. From the very start, it was undoubtedly Hitler's war, and Mosley brings this historical imperative more firmly into the light of day than ever. It nevertheless leaves one quite breathless, to see in detail how it all came about."},{"Title":"A catechism for small children","review":"Of all the books I have read about this period, On Borrowed Time, is without a doubt the best. Well written, tension filled and full of outrage. This book explains how the democratic states lost their way in the shadow of Hitler's evil. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A catechism for small children","review":"This book is about the lead up to World War Two in Europe. It details much that went on in Europe from the rise of Nazism in Germany, thru the secret pact between Germany and the U.S.S.R. to divide Poland, to the beginning of the war itself. It details many of the problems with the governments of Poland, France, and Britian that allowed them to think that agreements with Hitler would be more than the paper they were written on.Good book.

We all know about how Chamberlain famously proclaimed that he had \\"secured peace in our lifetimes.\\" What most do not know is that he was attempting to create an alliance with Germany and even after the invasion of Poland was still trying to organize a conference.

Composed to express author J. A. Jance's anguish at being married to an alcoholic, they chronicle her realization that her unwitting denial and co-dependence was only serving to further condemn herself and her spouse. After The Fire is an insidious portrait of addiction and its terrible costs, hard-hitting to the core, and each page further draws the reader into the experience. Fog: I walk in fog / Its velvet touch caresses me / And hides the hurt. / Beyond the fog, the sun / Shines clear and bright. / I must keep moving, / I have earned the light."},{"Title":"After the Fire","review":"The author talks about each of the poems before she reads them. In that way we get a kind of autobiography of J.A. Jance's early years, focusing especially what she went through while in a disastrous marriage to a hardcore alcoholic (9 rehab stints in 7 years!). Still, she never makes it clear why she stayed for so many years, and there is nothing new in her experiences or revelations."},{"Title":"After the Fire","review":"I loved this book.

If this isn't horrifying enough, she finds out she is pregnant. Claire and her husband, Dan, have two children, a daughter, Katie, twelve, and a son, Spencer, seven. Both children came to the marriage after many miscarriages. That Claire would become pregnant after rape is against all odds. If there is such a thing as a blessing in a situation like this, the fact Claire can't remember the assault is a gift from God.This novel delves into the inner feelings of each of the family members as they decide what to do with the baby. Katie is old enough to understand how the baby came to be, but she doesn't want her parents to give it up. Spencer is too young to realize anything except his mom's belly is growing. Dan decides he can't love this child and because of this, Claire agrees to put the child up for adoption. The word goes out and a childless missionary couple is picked to adopt the baby, now known to be a girl.They come to meet the Holland family. Mixed feelings tear Claire apart. She loves her baby, but she doesn't want her raised in a home without a father who truly loves her. Katie can't understand why they can't keep the baby. But, bravely, she hands the little girl over to Rosemary and Ed the day the baby and Claire are released from the hospital. Years go by. The Holland family doesn't speak of the baby named Lara. They move to another town where Dan, a veterinarian, sinks his teeth into a new practice. Claire opens a bookstore. Katie and Spencer grow up, do all the things kids do, but Claire never forgets her daughter. She prays for her constantly. Unbeknownst to Claire, Katie, now called Kate and married with children of her own, wonders what has become of her sister. One day, while Claire is away at a business conference, a letter comes from Rosemary. Kate doesn't trust her mother to share it with her, so she opens it. Rosemary is dying of cancer. She wants the Holland family to raise Lara, now sixteen.This book is a study in human emotions I found hard to put down. Bottom line taken from the book, Love is not blind--it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to see less.\\"I give this book two thumbs up.Janice Williams"},{"Title":"Why the Sky Is Blue","review":"Bad things happen to good people.

She has a wonderful life with God at its center. Claire loves her husband, Dan and children, Kate and Spencer. The Hollands dreamed of a large family, but several miscarriages left them emotionally wounded. To prevent further emotional pain, they decided on a vasectomy.One night, leaving a mall, Claire is the victim of a heinous crime. Claire's faith, marriage and family are changed forever.Why the Sky is Blue by Susan Meissner is told from the perspective of Claire and her daughter Kate. It is a story of personal sacrifice, healing hearts and redemption.Meissner is fast becoming one of my favorite Christian fiction writers. She is a master storyteller who can deftly weave a thought-provoking plot with realistic, fully developed characters. She explores difficult subjects in a compassionate manner and that adds immeasurably to her work. Her fiction compels me to think, really think, about my faith and what would I do if a 'bad thing' happened to me. Would I follow God's direction, which might include personal sacrifice?

I loved the Biblical truth it taught as well-- we may not understand all the whys of what God allows in our lives, but if we embrace the difficulties and choose to love the people He sends into our lives, we will be fulfilled and content. I enjoyed the two perspectives-- first part from Claire's and the second from her daughter Kate's... so glad I purchased this book.

Scharle (Studies in Religion and Culture)","review":"This 1990 book contains three essays by Charles W. Winquist, Mark C. Taylor, and Thomas J. Altizer (yes, the \\"Christian Atheism\\" guy), followed by a \\"Response\\" by Robert P. Scharlemann, and then commentaries by the three essaysists on the others' essays.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"(W)e can identify several distinguishing features of the postmodern in its significance for theological thinking. One of these features ... is a questioning of the transparency of the self, or a challenge to the notion that the self which is conscious of itself is also fully transparent to itself, clear about the nature of its actions, motivations, thoughts, and feelings.\\" (Scharlemann, Pg. 1-2)\\"When I call my love 'pumpkin,' I am not using words literally. When I call ultimate reality 'God,' I am not using words literally.\\" (Winquist, pg. 16)\\"In foundational theology there is no return to a point of reference that is criteriological for the further development of knowledge. There is no centering around a subject that can unify diverse discourses. There is, however, the formation of a nomad subjectivity that is neither exclusively female or male, white or black, east or west in its multiple manifestations but is, instead, socially located in the specificity of its situation of origin.\\" (Winquist, pg. 25)\\"(A) new agenda for theology is ironic. Extreme formulations that populate theological discourse convolute within the symbolic order so that they are instantiations of a transversal negativity implicating the other of the unthought and unrealized.\\" (Winquist, pg. 38)\\"If God is, in effect, a stopgap measure, then the death of God would seem to leave gaps gaping. Instead of leading to the total presence constitutive of the actualized Kingdom, the death of God might subvert the very possibility of the arrival of the Parousia by forever deferring the realization of presence. From this point of view, to declare the death of God is to affirm the impossibility of the end.\\" (Taylor, pg. 63)\\"That final releasement now occurs in the actual event of the total self-embodiment of I AM, a self-embodiment which is not only a self-negation of the totality of the past, but a self-reversal of that totality, a self-reversal which is historically actual in the French Revolution, and interiorly actual in the new and radical realization that God is dead.\\" (Altizer, pg. 93)\\"Yet the total realization of the Crucified God is the final actualization of the silence of God, that silence is nothingness and nothingness alone, but a new nothingness, a nothingness which is the fulness and the finality of historical actuality.\\" (Altizer, pg. 108)"},{"Title":"Genetics and the origin of species (Columbia biological series)","review":"Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) was a famous geneticist and evolutionary biologist. This book (originally written in 1937, and revised in 1941 and 1951) was one of the more famous statements of the Neo-Darwinian or \\"synthetic\\" theory of evolution.Dobzhansky says that \\"The greatest achievement of biological science to date is the demonstration that the diversity (of organisms) is not fortuitous. It has not arisen from a whim or caprice of some deity. It is a product of evolution, an outcome of a long historical process of development....\\" He adds, \\"Biology can not fathom whether life may be part of some Cosmic Design. But biology does show that the evolution of life on earth is governed by causes that can be understood by human reason.\\"He asserts that The terms \\"microevolution\\" and \\"macroevolution\\" have \\"only descriptive meaning; they imply no difference in underlying causal agencies.\\" \\"Gene mutation and chromosome changes are the sources of variation ... there can be no reasonable doubt that the same agencies have supplied the materials for the actual historical process of evolution.\\"Mutations are the source of evolution, notwithstanding that mutations are most often harmful to the organism, since \\"Mutations which are unfavorable in a given environment may be valuable in a changed environment,\\" and \\"Since natural selection augments the adaptive value of the genotype as a whole, neutral, and even slightly deleterious, traits may be promoted by selection if they happen to be connected with useful ones.\\" He minimizes laboratory experiments intended to create mutations, since in corn experiments, \\"mutations produced by X rays are different from the spontaneous ones, the former being chiefly minute deficiencies due to destruction of genes.\\"Dobzhanky rejects Richard Goldschmidt's \\"hopeful monster\\" proposal on the grounds that \\"the number of mutants produced in any one generation would be so small that they could hardly find mates among masses of unchanged relatives.\\"Dobzhansky waxes philosophical towards the end of the book: \\"Darwin's affirmation that man is a part of nature seemed to many of his contemporaries, and still seems to some misguided souls, downright blasphemy.\\" He concludes with the statement that \\"The evolution of life has only one discernible goal, and that is life itself.\\"This is a significant book for the development of evolutionary thought."},{"Title":"A Penny From Heaven","review":"I read this rags to riches story twice, having found a second hand copy of the Garden City Press edition. It traces the career of Romanian immigrant Max Winkler in New York City and his emancipation from his autocratic father. He literally worked his way up from the basement of Carl Fischer's music store, eventually becoming the co-founder of Belwin Music (the \\"win\\" part comes from \\"Winkler\\").I was fascinated by how hard he and his brothers worked to make his father's grocery store a success. I was spell-bound by how he organized and finagled his way into sheet music selling, the commissioning of arrangements, and forging a successful partnership as a music publisher."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Between 1963 and 1964, Harry Patterson, aka Jack Higgins wrote 8 books. This was one of the authors most prolific periods of writing, as well as one of his most interesting. He wrote crime novels, a western (Thunder at Noon), a romance (A Phoenix in the Blood), World War II novels (Seven Pillars to Hell, later published as Sheba) and Pay the Devil, a book which is set in 1865 and follows the exploits of Confederate Colonel Clay Fitzegerald. The Colonel has just ended on the losing side of the Civil War and returns to Ireland for peace and quite. He instead gets caught up in the 'troubles.' Like most of Higgins' early novels, this book is an entertaining, fast-paced story full of one-dimensional characters. If you want a fun and quick read for the holidays, this book is it. Although, if you want better Higgins' try Valhalla Exchange, Touch The Devil, A Prayer for the Dying, Thunderpoint or The Eagle has Landed."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I've read a number of Higgin's works -- On Dangerous Grounds, Drink With the Devil, The Eagle Has Landed and A Season In Hell to name a few. This short novel however, did not share the depth and intrigue that I found in his other efforts. The boy meets girl; boy gets girl plot was shallow and the storyline had an ending that was predictable after the first three chapters. Needless to say, I was disappointed in this most recent effort. It was almost like the author was behind in a deadline to get a book out and this was it. I can say however, that I do have a better understanding of the origins of the Protestant/Catholic conflict in Northern Ireland."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"This is a Higgins title that was first released in 1963. And as an avid reader of Jack Higgins I truly enjoyed this one. It has a touch of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; to it. And characters I would like to see Mr. Higgins use again. The setting of the American Civil War and the early Irish uprising were a break from Higgins recent run of Sean Dillon works."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I thought this was a new book until reading other reviews stating that it was actually written back in 1963. For all that, however, it is still classic Higgens. Actually, I thought the plot line was kind of refreshing as he does tend to get stuck around WWII and Brigadier Ferguson scenarios. Still, all in all, if you like Higgens, you should like this one."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I could not believe Jack Higgins actually wrote this insipid book. I kept looking at the cover to verify the author. I am glad to find out this was first written in 1963 therefore should not be an indication of author's current abilities. The plot was shallow. Boy meets girl..everything works out rosy. Seemed more like a cheesy romance novel. I have read numerous Jack Higgins works and loved them all.......until this one. Take my advice and skip it."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Clay Fitzgerald, a survivor of the US Civil War returns to Ireland to find peace. Instead, he gets embroiled in the feud between the stereotypical English lord and the noble Irish peasentry. Clay is not only a CSA cavalry combat veteran but a trained surgeon. He's the type of hero who can't be kept down by mere beatings or gunshot wounds. He takes a licking and keeps on ticking. It also doesn't help that all the book's action is compressed into a few days. All Clay seems to do is fly about the countryside on the back of his faithful steed from one confrontation to another.One of the other reviews mentioned that this story was originally written in 1963. In fact, after getting halfway through the book I checked the copyright date because the story gave me the impression of being written by a rather green author. However, the copyright on my book only shows 1999. Perhaps it's one of Higgen's earlier stories that sat in a drawer for 30 years.In any event, I don't think the book measures up to some of the author's other works. Unless all you want is a time filler I'd suggest a pass on this book."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I agree with several of the reviewers that said that you could easily predict this plot. The only thing that saved this book is the underlying theme of the mistreatment of the Irish by the British during the 1860's.The character of Joanna is a mystery as to why she helps Clay even before she knows him. Why she hates what her uncle does but still supports him is another mystery. How she shows up in the neck of time at the beginning of the book to save Clay a couple of times and then becomes a hinderance to him the rest of the book is grating. The romance between them is very awkwardly written.Clay is very reckless am seems to have Indiana Jones's luck for getting out of tight spots. He becomes the legendary Captain Swing and it takes quite awhile for anyone to figure out that Captain Swing is him (really?). Even though he has the best horse around, nobody can figure out it is him from his horse. That is like accepting that no one can see that Clark Kent is Superman.Clay has a servant named Joshua. We are not sure if Joshua was a slave or what and why he stays with Clay. Some of the dialog exchanges are very stereotypical and annoying.It seems like the author saw The Scarecrow of Rumney Marsh, Batman, Zorro, Indiana Jones, and the Green Hornet and then tried to combine all the plots and make a book.This is my introduction to Higgins and I understand that some of his other titles are more superior. I do not know what he was thinking when he wrote this one though."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, as the story seemed stolen from a Disney movie (&quot;Zorro&quot; or &quot;Scarecrow&quot;). It was rushed at best and made no attempt to explore the history of the English occupation of Ireland. Nor did it deal at all with the Finnians in North America (their attempt to invade and capture Canada, and negotiate with England for its exchange for Ireland). I only noted one interesting fact, and that was that an acre of land planted with potatoes can feed many more people than if planted with wheat. If a potential reader is a fan of Sean Dillon, he/she may better spend their time elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Take another stereotypical Confederate gentleman soldier, honorable to the point of ridiculousness, his black valet who is treated with respect and affection and you have just one more bit of unbelievable historical adventure. Higgins takes this hoary old convention and moves it to Ireland where our hero finds himself taking the side of the Irish versus their English oppressors. From the predictable culture clashes to the even more hilarious \\"masked rider\\" bit, (Zorro, anyone, or perhaps Dr. Syn, The Scarecrow) this book moves briskly from one clich&eacute; to another. Higgins has written some fine thrillers, but this is almost their exact opposite."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I was very disappointed in this book -- unlike most of the Higgins' novels, it read like a cheesy romance paperback. The hero arrives in rural Ireland, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and becomes a Zorro-like secret hero. Really, now, how gullible do you think we are? No one puts two and two together, when Clay's (famous blood line) horse is part of the action?"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"This is an interesting story set in the Ireland of 1865, but a bit rushed. The main action is crammed into a few days. One gets the impression that the author dashed this off to have yet another book for his publisher. The story is one of Irish tenants exploited by English landlords, at least some of whom are attempting clearances to turn the land into pastures for their sheep. The story would have been better if it had spanned a little longer time period, but it is passably good."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"We all know the spy thrillers Higgins has become famous for. This one is a great and entertaining departure. The dark hero, who would rather just be left alone, leaves his war torn Southern Confederacy to find solace in Ireland, only to end up in another civil war. Good at violence but despising it, wishing to not get involved but needing to in spite of himself, and the entire time quietly conflicted underneath by the morality of it all, Higgins designs a great character in Clay. I wish there were more books with this character as it would have made a great series. Stretching from the US Civil War to the beginnings of the troubles in Ireland this book is a little bit military thriller, a little bit spy book, a little bit social commentary and a lot entertaining."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Its a fun story that I recommend for light weekend reading. This would be a great book for middle school or High school book report. It would easly capture the attention of young readers as well. Its a fun read"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"So, Pay the Devil was the first of Higgins novels that I have read, and I loved it! Since then I have read over 20 of his books. Higgins is a master. I would recommend any of his books to everybody if they enjoy to read."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"This is a Harry Patterson novel of 1962, revised and reissued. It's quite a departure from the usual Higgins. Set at the end of the American Civil War. Surgeon-soldier Confederate Colonel Clay Fitzgerald ends the war in disillusionment and heads for Ireland to claim his inheritance and find a bit of peace and quiet. He's accompanied by his manservant Joshua.Soon Clay realises that he isn't going to get any peace and quiet after all. He encounters inhumane treatment of the locals by the landed gentry. When he meets Joanna, who is against the establishment, particularly her uncle, Clay is smitten. He joins in the cause to fight the injustices heaped upon the villagers.This would make a good TV movie. Plenty of action, clear-cut characters, and a nod to history. It's the kind of material for a film Mel Gibson might have made in his English-bashing days. The English-bashing in this case seems quite justified. An interesting fast read."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"A former confederat calvalry soldier goes back to ireland just in time for an uprising. Its perfect the character is totally believable and the story is amazing. It pulls history into it enough to make it solid but doesnt feel at all like a history book"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"One of Jack Higgins' earlier novels, &quot;Pay the Devil&quot; is nevertheless an entertaining if uneven read. Unlike his later novels, &quot;Pay the Devil&quot; weaves not the same level of intrigue, but this is tempered by frequent bouts of action.The narrative involves the return of Colonel Clay Fitzgerald to Ireland following the American Civil War to inherit the house left by his Uncle. Once in Ireland, however, Clay fast becomes outraged at the unfair treatment of the tenant workers. Adopting the mantle of the legendary outlaw Captain Swing, the Colonel sets out to avenge the peasant workers.Unfortunately, for all its pace, the novel has its fair share of inconsistencies. Firstly, the syntax is simple and often without sufficient description. Secondly, the plot is uneven and often unsatisfactory, with the reader left without the knowledge of &quot;Who was the original Captain Swing?&quot;All facets considered, While certainly an interesting diversion, &quot;Pay the Devil&quot; has too many flaws to recommend."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"If you enjoy seeing unusual combinations of characters and locales, this book will intrigue you.A son of the old South, born in Georgia, accompanies General Lee just before he surrenders to Grant. Learning of the impending surrender, Colonel Clay Fitzgerald (formerly temporary brigadier Fitzgerald) heads out to escape the Yankee net. He discovers that he is an heir, and decides to take a break from four years of fighting to see his family's home in Ireland. He dreams of a land of peace and respite. But his hopes are dashed when he and his black servant arrive there. The English and Irish gentry are cruelly abusing the Irish peasants, and the Colonel is warned that anyone who stays will have to take sides. He finds his heart stirred by a young woman and by the injustices that are occurring all around him. Like Superman, the Lone Ranger or Zorro, he takes on the wrongdoers and makes gallant gestures that inspire the downtrodden.His opponents are some of the most despicable villains you will ever meet. One is driven by a raging lust vented at girls. Another has a desire to destroy as many peoples' lives as possible. Few will have any sympathy for the villains.The book's heroine is one of those amazingly capable female characters, having all of the good features of women and men and fully being worthy of the hero's affections.As the title suggests, this is an old-fashioned morality play with the forces of good and evil squaring off against one another. The conflicts mostly occur out of chivalrous instincts by the hero.The book's strengths are in imaginative action scenes. The book's weaknesses are in portraying the characters too purely as all good or all evil, and the hero and heroine are just too perfect to be fully believable. In addition, the book labors under an overuse of the same incidental actions. How many times do you want to read about someone smoking a cheroot, or taking a swallow of whiskey?You will feel emotionally rewarded to see evil trumped by good. I suspect you will also come away with a better sense of the basis for the groundswell behind Irish independence from England in the 19th century.After you enjoy this story, perhaps you would also enjoy acting from your heart and playing a heroic role in the life of another person. Someone out there needs a helping hand today who will not get it unless you act from your heart. Look around, and act on your true feelings! I applaud your heroism!"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"A different subject (in a way) for a Jack Higgins novel, starting out in 1865 war-torn America with a Confederate officer who, as luck would have it, comes out of the war with the ill-gained riches of a 'ruffian' father. At first I questioned whether I was actually reading a Jack Higgins (Harry Patterson) novel or not as I was used to reading of Sean Dillon or Liam Devlin. I at least expected to be reading a novel set in a European or Asian setting, perhaps WWII so I was at first cautious. I soon became so engulfed in the book that I couldn't put it down and read it in just over a day. (Working full time, I might add!) I am looking for a sequel, surely there must be one? How could a writer leave us stranded with the hero and his girl aboard a ship bound for France and ultimately California? (where I hail from?) It left me wanting more! Where can I find the sequel? If it has been written? Although simple to read it leaves you wanting more! Thanks again to Jack Higgins...I'm really only beginning to discover the great Dr. Harry Patterson!"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Pay The Devil, by Jack Higgins, is the story of Colonel Clay Fitzgerald, a Confederate army surgeon turned field officer, who travels to Ireland to claim the family estate after the death of his Irish uncle. After living through the horrors of the American Civil War, he goes there hoping to find peace and quiet. Instead, he finds a country embroiled in its own war, a war for Irish independence. Though he would like to remain a neutral party in the hostilities, he finds that he is pressured to choose a side to support.I enjoyed this story. Though it was a quick read, it was well written. It had characters that were very likeable and others that were deplorable. If it was a little predictable, so what? It was fun.Colonel Fitzgerald is like an Irish Zorro. Five stars from me."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"This was my first book by Jack Higgins and it certainly will not be my last. I read it in two days while on vacation and enjoyed it very much.

And we need airport stuff, beach stuff, whatever you want to call it. James Patterson is a great beach writer. Ken Follett. A fun read. But like a marathon runner forced to walk up one flight of stairs, you're not going to get too much of a workout.Colonel Clay escapes incarceration at the hands of the evil Yankees, dodges a lot of slow moving musket balls, performs operations in the field, and with General Lee's blessing, slips through the Yankee lines at Appomatix to head for his father's homeland and meet his destiny, ah yes darlin', in Ireland. Erin Go Bragh. Ireland forever.Clay has a trust fund there and also an estate. But Ireland suffers the same fates as his beloved south and Clay is caught in the middle. Eventually he sides with the tenant farmers and chooses to fight against the intolerance and ignorance of their English masters. Which is an interesting flip-flop from his war years 1861-1865, if you choose to think about it. Mr. Higgins chose not to.All in good fun. A lot of longing looks and flutteriing eyelashes from the equestrian knockout Joanna Hamilton. Don't take it seriously. Enjoy it for what it is. Three stars, Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I read this book in two days. The story is very quick. Higgins introduces the main character very quickly. They are easy to identify with.This is the classic story of good v evil. Might v Right. The lowly Irish peasants against the aristocratic English gentry. Into all of this is thrown a Confederate cavalry officer with American ideals about freedom and liberty. He must choose sides.A good book if you are in a hurry. Not a lot of depth to the story or the characters. Higgins has left the ending open for a followup with some of the same characters if he so chooses."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Clay thought that he was going to have peace and just enjoy that money he had just inheritied...he was wrong. Clay is drawn into a conspricy of arrogant Irish landlords and hard working (and hard headed) Irish rebles named the Rogians.As the book heats up, Clay takes sides and goes dashing around the country in the gise of &quot;Captain Swing&quot;(he looks like The Shadow).I recommend this to anyone who loves a good book."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Higgins' storytelling shines here throughout this top-notch story of intrigue. Wonderful characters, great locales, and a huge way to end this this great first rate superthriller! A rare accord. I will not stop reading Higgins until he finally retires. A truly master storyteller. Every book is a monster hit and this is his best! Caution: Do not read this one and put it down, You probably will not anyway! This reader is a higgins fan. UNDOWNPUTABLE! that is the one word or phrase I simply have to say about every book Higgins has written."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"Set in Ireland in about 1865, Higgins gets the tone largely correct and doesn't trip too much over Zeitgeist anachronisms (though one could quibble on that point). The story takes forever to pick up -- like about three-quarters of the way through -- but when it does it becomes a good ride -- and a good read. And Higgins does an awful job of cleaning up after himself at the end (not to ruin it, but what happens to all the real estate?). Oh, well. Made the miles pass by in its Recorded Books incarnation. There's lots of better Higgins out there."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"This book waivers between 2 1/2 to 3 stars. While the books was written a long time ago and rereleased in paperback form its hard to tell if the rerelease had any finishing touches. If you read Higgins, then you know the formula. Everytime the main character walks into the room there will be an encounter with some clear villain oppressing the weak or taking advantage of a woman. Even if you haven't read him before I am sure the story is predictable. As far as a historical representation this book falls short, but happens to be set in Ireland during the late 1800s. What's the positive. It is a quick read and if you don't look at books with a critical eye, and just want something that doesn't involve that much thought, then this book is for you. If you want to read the best of Higgins then I recommend &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;. If you are already a fan of Higgins don't expect any different from the reissuing of all his other stories &quot;East of Desolation&quot;, &quot;Sheba&quot;, &amp; &quot;Night Judgment at Sinos&quot;."},{"Title":"Pay the Devil","review":"I have read a lot of Jack Higgins books - I am always been into them from the first paragraph. This one, however, I found very difficult to get into and nearly gave up. Most unusual, but then I found that it had been written nearly 40 years ago, under the name Harry Patterson, and never made it to a paperback. So, I suppose the publishers are in order to call it 'His NEW paperback'. Bit of a con really. Anyway, found it most enjoyable once it got going - unusual to have an Irish story without Devlin or Dillon. I was totally engrossed by the end. Set in Ireland in the 19th Century, it precedes the IRA stories in his later books.

It edits your content, aggregates news feeds from other sources, and publishes the content to your hosting service. It also does scripting for building specialized tools to work with your content. Rogers' examples are easy to follow, and help you to understand exactly what types of tasks you can build on your own. Regardless of whether you're a blogger who can't program or a techno-guru who wants to start sharing thoughts, you should be able to benefit from this book.The statement is made that Radio Userland has no official documentation manual and that the author hopes that you'll consider this book the next best thing.

Often throughout the chapters, Lutzer refers to the opposing directions we must choose between: either continue to live in sin and thus enter further into darkness and despair or opt to change course and enter God's light and discover His very best.Throughout the book, Lutzer does not offer senseless pop psychology frills. He instead gives accounts of what some have had to go through in order to repent of their past mistakes; among these testimonies are recollections of the peace that many reformed Christians are now experiencing, thanks to their ability to trust God enough to admit to others the ugly truths about their pasts and present situations and ,in result, come into the light.Lutzer points out the consequences of our choices. He says that if you want to experience the joy of being a Christian, you may have to admit some very painful truths that you are ashamed of. He goes on to express that if for the sake of God telling the truth or just being honest is squeamish, it is not going to be so painful in the long run in comparison to what we will otherwise endure."},{"Title":"Why Good People Do Bad Things","review":"I've not only read the book, but I was part of the worshipping congregation at Moody Memorial Church in Chicago when this sermon series was preached in the Fall of 2000.Pastor Lutzer is at his all-time best when he is preaching God's Word, and addressing the &quot;issues&quot; of humanity.

In general, the medical researcher of any kind is at a severe disadvantage in dealing with professional biostatisticians because often the two do not speak a common language. This very readable, interesting and clearly written book gives the scientist enough knowledge to deal with most relatively simple cases in a language that we understand. With the basic principles of medical statistics made comprehensible, we are able to understand many of the simpler software packages well enough to perform basic statistical analyses and, more importantly, are able to converse intelligently with biostatistical professionals and to design studies that will pass muster. Unlike another reviewer, I do not feel that not covering SAS or other software programs is a disadvantage. No book can cover everything, and this book covers the basics and intermediate levels far better than any book I have seen, certainly better than any biostatistics book written by biostatisticians intended for other biostatisticians. This book understands that biostatistics is a tool, not a fundamental discipline, for the vast majority of scientists and is written to them. The book serves as a ready reference and review if one does not perform these analyses on a daily basis. This book should be on the shelf of every life scientist."},{"Title":"Using and Understanding Medical Statistics","review":"Want to get beyond primers and introductory texts but lack the background and expertise for the advanced texts. Here is a truly intermediate text which covers a broad range of topics and permits the reader to advance to the next level. This book is chock full of insights without getting mired down in technical detail and nomenclature. It delves just deep enough to give the arguments a foundation and extends them up to the point of clarity without undue complexity. It can be read by anyone with a basic understanding and is a good text for epidemiologically oriented medical scientists. I wish that it was paired with an advanced text that explored each one of the topics in more depth since many of the techniques are not described in enough detail to perform the analysis without refering to other source material. Some greater attention could also be given to the well established statistical software packages such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA. It does repeatedly make the valuable point that if you proceed through an analysis without professional biostatistical consultation you are likely to be short changing your study or even commiting errors. Take heed. It is important to know enough biostatistics to understand the techniques but in almost all cases it is better to work with a professional biostatician than to go it alone. I only wish that there were more medically savvy biostaticians like Matthews and Farewell."},{"Title":"Using and Understanding Medical Statistics","review":"I have had the first edition of this book for decades.

Often those who are linked with the left or the communist party are thought of as being aligned with the fascism of Hitler. This is a grave error! Many were involved in the fight against facism. These people were concerned with fair working hours and wages for the working class who were often abused by the steamroller of industrialism. We do not realize that the eight-hour work day we take for granted today was something these people fought for. This book does an excellent job recovering a lost chapter in American history. Nelson writes this history with incredible fluidity and grace. It is filled with many pictures of the poetry documents from his own collection. And despite the political poetry of this period being marginalized and forgotten for decades, it is powerful and moving poetry that serves wider purposes than just its historical context. There is a lot that people of our modern generation could learn and relate with to our current societal struggles. Open your mind and read. You will learn an incredible amount of information about these unsung heroes of our past."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Memory: Recovering the Poetry of the American Left","review":"In part because so many important documents and texts now appear to be lost irretrievably, through careless indifference or malice, Cary Nelson tells us right upfront there that is \\"no one story to tell\\" in the history of American poetry of the Left during the first half of the twentieth century, but he insists that there are many stories that might still be told.Without a single narrative arc, Nelson's book isn't as dramatic a statement as his groundbreaking volume Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politcs of Cultural Memory, 1910-1945. He begins with a sampling of poems, beginning with Markham's once famous \\"The Man with a Hoe,\\" that (he claims), the New Critical establishment wanted to will away, and from the patchwork assortment he moves on to a striking test case, a poet called Edwin Rolfe and the vicissitudes of his career. I had just about heard of Edwin Rolfe and had no idea of the extent of his involvement in various causes and poetics, but Nelson is not really interested in reviving the reputation of any one forgotten poet. He is more keen rather on presenting Left poetry as a whole, and the third part of his book really had me quarreling in my head with some of his decisions. He suggests that a good way to understand the poetry of the left would be to take various lines from various poems and make your own poem out of it. and he does this on several occasions.I found the results singularly unconvincing and, of course, \\"nervy\\" isn't the word for it. A monkey, no, even one of my cats, could have constructed a stronger poem than the \\"poetry chorus\\" Nelson makes out of scraps and lines from a few dozen poets. I think emotionally I believe in what he is saying, but there must be a less self-serving way for him to go about it. (In this light, why, why, why on every page, whenever there's an illustration, must we get the same tag, \\"From the collection of the author\\"? Just put it in the front of the book and have done with it. Otherwise you're just asking for burglars to come to our office and take what must surely be the largest collection of left-poetry-ephemera ever publicized in one book.)Part III dealt with left causes in general and how to make one poem out of them, but Part IV ups the ante by narrowing in on a particular body of work, the poetry of the Spanish Civil War (not all of it by Americans, in this chapter). Nelson is a brilliant scholar and the things he does with language are astounding, and never more so than the way in which, here, like dominoes, one simple flick of his pen causes hundreds of scholarly and popular misconceptions to fall down in sequence... he should be in the Guinness Book of World Records for two reasons."},{"Title":"Peanuts Every Sunday","review":"Remember when Snoopy was just a crazy dog?

The title hooked me to read it. And it worked well: I not only read the book and remembered it for 30+ years, I just bought it again, here. Worse (or better, depends), I have wanted a peacock ever since that first reading (the neighborhood still objects, because a peacock's \\"song\\" is a scream like a woman being murdered. No joke. And they do it in the dark. Often. No joke. So, still don't own one :( .This was the book that put 'faces' to the voices of the organic gardening movement for me in at time and place I now treasure as \\"the good old days\\". And from the look of it, Janet Gillespie hasn't stopped calling us back to those times, to remember what social grace looks like with her other books,Growing Natural,A Joyful Noise, andWith a merry heart.The information in the book is still good, if a little dated. I still plant marigolds amongst the vegetables to kill nematodes and garlic with the roses to deter rose pests. The nice part about organic gardening is the slowness of basic change in the movement. It is basic in a way that needs refreshing by reminders of the old, basic ways not refreshing by fiddling with the basics. The strength of this volume is not the information though. It is the presentation--the ability to show the commonsensical nature of gardening organically. This kind of gardening is for anyone who stops to think about something longer range than the neighbors recent comments on how their lawn is looking better than yours.The writing style somehow seems to have changed. It was a far more interesting read back then, fresh and new. Now, to my ear, it sounds stilted and distant. But in the intervening years (has it really been almost 40?!) writing styles HAVE changed.So, why did I buy an out-dated, second-hand stale-writing-style gardening book? Nostalgia, first and foremost. It speaks lovingly of my past and \\"the past\\", of a social gracefulness we sadly lack. No harsh reprimands for ignorance or political insensitivity, just anecdotal humor, authentic laughter and real life. Additionally, I wanted to review what it taught me: was the information still \\"true\\"? Yes it is, with reminders of the horrors of DDT and chlorinated hydrocarbons most of the movement has never had to fight against, it was so successful then, so long ago. And one more thing: I bought it to check: do I still 'believe' like I did or have I drifted? And the answer is... So far, still on track.Peacock Manure & Marigolds (Mass Market Paperback)"},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"George du Maurier's Trilby (1894) is famous for being a pop culture phenomenon at the turn of the century. It was adapted into dramatic form, spawned sequels, and even branched out into merchandise (a Trilby leg, anyone?). The trilby hat got its name from an actress who wore this style of headgear in an adaptation of the novel. The term Svengali has entered into everyday discourse. So, we know it's popular - but is it any good? For a modern audience, this question has to be answered at two levels: the political and the aesthetic.The political level mainly derives, of course, from the fact that Svengali is Jewish. There is a long-established tradition of questionable Jewish characters in English literature: Shylock from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Fagin from Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist are the two most famous. Both Shakespeare and Dickens use the Jewishness of their characters, however, to turn the ethical tables on the hypocrisy of the Christian societies that hold them in contempt. Svengali, by contrast, has no such qualities. Du Maurier's portrayal of his villain is unambiguously and unforgivably the product of a deep-rooted anti-Semitism that, unlike Shylock and Fagin, evinces not a single redeeming feature. In addition to its anti-Semitism, the novel bristles with dubious sexual politics, with nauseatingly idealized depictions of women, including Trilby, that stand in contrast to the proliferation of interesting female characters that populate the literature of that century. Finally, du Maurier's depiction of his equally-idealized British (male) characters is so utterly jingoistic that it, too, is grating. On a political level, then, Trilby is offensive to most modern readers and, in this respect, is a failure.That said, I'm no prude. Sometimes works that are offensive can be interesting in other ways. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Trilby. The characters are incredibly flat and dull. There are no shades of gray: the good characters are nauseatingly good, the evil characters are irredeemably evil and petty. Du Maurier may have been drawing on his own memories of \\"la vie boheme\\" in Paris, but it bears very little resemblance to the prevailing artistic moods of the time (1850s and 60s) when the novel is set. This period, after all, is defined by poets like Baudelaire, novelists like Flaubert, and painters like Courbet, dark visionaries who relentlessly questioned the society of their time. Du Maurier's artists, by contrast, are little more than rich, upper-class buffoons, sentimental tourists whose ideas about the artistic life seem about as realistic as Quixote's chivalrous hallucinations. Just as bad is the shapeless narrative, in which the narrator tries desperately to come off as witty but instead comes across as shallow and narcissistic. Very little happens in the course of almost three hundred pages. There is lots of French dialogue, often written to convey a heavy German or English accent, most of which I could follow and none of which was worth reading. In fact, for most of the book I felt as though I was sitting next to a drunk, obnoxious stranger who was giving an elaborate account of a wonderful party they had once attended - wonderful, perhaps, if you had been there, but utterly dull to hear about secondhand. As such, Trilby is poorly written, and so also fails, in my opinion, at the aesthetic level.Now that the smoke of its popular success has cleared, it seems to me that du Maurier's text does not hold up well at all. Not only was I repeatedly frustrated by its tedious plot and flat characters, I couldn't help but see in Svengali's manipulation of Trilby a foreshadowing of the anti-Semitic accusation that marked the twentieth century: the idea that the Jews have engineered a conspiracy to keep the world under its thumb, using the banks and the media to keep us, their helpless victims, in thrall. It is a work, I suppose, that ought to be read by scholars in order to understand fin de siecle culture, but that doesn't make it any less politically repulsive, nor does it improve the quality of the writing."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"I was assigned this book for a class on Aesthetic and Decadant movements in Victorian British literature, and had never heard of it before then. However, I did enjoy it. It has a sardonic but good-natured tone that is winning, and it's not surprising that Du Maurier was greatly influenced by Thackeray; they share the same subtle sting in their prose.Unfortunately, contrasting with the entertainment value in the novel, there is little of substance, unless one wishes to dig back into the social mileau of the time, which included many anxieties expressed in this book. It is interesting in this context, but I don't know if I would have done the work on my own without the class to guide me.So, if you want some light entertainment of the Victorian variety, I definitely recommend this book to you--otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"Trilby is the popular 1890s novel which introduced the word &quot;svengali&quot; into the English language. Simply stated, Trilby is story of three male British artists living the carefree life of 1850s bohemian Paris. Amongst their clique of artists and musicians is Trilby, a peasant girl with a heart of gold but no artist (or musical) talent, and Svengali, a talented yet sinister character. Svengali, through mysterious means, &quot;possesses&quot; Trilby's mind/soul and transforms her into a operatic zombie. Although a bit contrived by today's standards, this &quot;evil man possessing young, innocent girl&quot; theme has been repeated in such enduring pieces as Dracula (written only a couple years after Trilby) and Phantom of the Opera.Unfortunately, Trilby is not fine literature. The portrait of bohemian life is definitely viewed through rose-colored glasses, and du Maurier's anti-semitic descriptions of the Jewish Svengali is rather vulgar (by today's standards).Overall Trilby is a curiousity piece which probably won't appeal today's readers. It's decline into obscurity is justified."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"I have to disagree with the reviewer who commented that this novel is at best a curiosity and that it deserved to fade into obscurity. I read this in a course on 19th century novels and fell in love with du Maurier's writings and his drawings. He uses such wonderful devices to flavor the text and in many ways this satirical view of the aesthetic movement informs the period as much as Oscar Wilde's work does. That the work has some anti-Semitic sentiment it is no more worrisome than anything in Shakespeare (meaning that you must take the work as a work in a period of time). The character types are common enough and the message of the story is timeless--I'll leave the discernment of the message to the reader. Reading this was like uncovering your grandad's favorite toy in the attic and realizing it was still fun to play with today."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"Set in bohemian Paris, Trilby is the name of the artless and innocent Scot-Irish girl who stumbles upon a group of artists who call themselves the \\"Three Musketeers of the Brush.\\" The orphaned daughter of a drunken scholar, she is fluent in English and French, but speaks them in slang, has an unaffected air and thinks nothing of posing nude in front of a roomful of artists. She is the prettiest, sweetest and most wistful creature they had laid eyes upon. Little Billee is her biggest admirer. He especially loves her feet -- artists' feet, perfect feet. There is one big drawback: the girl cannot sing a single note, and this is most noticeable with Svengali, an ambitious and horrid German-Jewish musician. He notices, with great amusement, that she cannot tell one high note from another. An attraction ensues between Little Billee and Trilby, but circumstances tear them apart. At the same time, she becomes the object of Svengali's obsession. He takes every opportunity to seduce her, but she fears him, especially after he cures her headache by way of mesmerism. So imagine everyone's surprise when, some time later, she becomes a local diva with the voice of an angel, with Svengali as her manager and mentor. What could have caused such a transformation? Why is she under Svengali's protection? The secrets behind her success are quite sinister, and so will be the outcome if she doesn't free herself from Svengali.First published in 1894, Trilby is a disturbing and tragic gothic novel centered on mind control and ruthless ambition. Pygmalion, The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Phantom of the Opera sprang to mind when I read this. The writing is quite good (with an interesting second-person narrative style), the characters flawed, and the plot is both bewitching and beguiling. The relationship between Svengali and Trilby is surprisingly brief. The novel concentrates more on the backdrop of bohemian Paris and of various characters. (In fact, the first half of this book is extremely slow and boring. I read The Other Rebecca by Maureen Freely along with this one and actually enjoyed that one more on most occasions.) Yet the Trilby-Svengali relationship is the central storyline. Very interesting. The way Svengali controls Trilby, turning her into his puppet, is what intrigues me the most about this story. Various passages might strike some as anti-Semitic, for Jews are described in a not-so-flattering light in this book. Also, the constant quotations, stanzas and dialogues in French, German and Latin detract from the storyline. After all, I couldn't understand a word of it. Other than that, I enjoyed Trilby. George du Maurier was a good writer as well as an accomplished caricaturist. He drew the characters in this book, all of the pictures are found in the Oxford World's Classics edition. He passed his writing talent on to his granddaughter, Daphne du Maurier, who wrote Julius, a novel about a sinister, ambitious and manipulative man not unlike Svengali. (But the plot in Julius is quite different.) All in all, this is a memorable Victorian classic. Not the best I've read, but definitely worth rereading (at least the second half of the novel is worth giving a second go). Recommended if you're into late-Victorian gothics."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"Three British artists go to paint in the Bohemian Latin Quarter of Paris, in the 1860s. Taffy Wynn, a reserved and good-natured English giant, resigned his cavalry commission after missing, by mischance, death or glory in the Charge of the Light Brigade. Sandy, the Laird of Cockpen, is a Scottish lawyer's son. Little Billee Bagot is the youngest, slight of build, of almost childish innocence, and yet the others realise that as a painter, he may someday tower above them.The life and characters of the Latin Quarter are marvellously described, and we can only guess, nowadays, at some of the identities. Whistler the painter was much aggrieved. The three strike up a friendship with Trilby, daughter of a deceased Irish drunkard and Scottish barmaid, who is a laundress and artists' model. She is deeply unsettled by the sinister Svengali, a Jewish pianist with hypnotic powers.The book is often accused of crude antisemitism, but &quot;crude&quot; seems unjust. Du Maurier claims that Little Billee has some proportion of that Jewish blood which is best diluted, but adds something to all others. Svengali's cruelest jest - they think - is to encourage Trilby to sing, saying she has the finest voice he knows. For she is tone-deaf, and the exhibition is grotesque.Billee proposes marriage, and Trilby, who loves him, is induced to flee Paris. For besides being a laundress, she sits for &quot;the altogether&quot;, and would destroy Billee's life in respectable society. She disappears, and only many years later is she discovered, as Madame Svengali, the singer whose fame is taking Europe by storm. For Svengali spoke nothing but the truth. She did indeed have the finest voice in Europe, which she was entirely unable to use, and that consummate but warped artist, by skill as much as hypnotism, has taught her to be the nightingale of her age.The story ends tragically, as Victorian melodramas do. But high tragedy arises when a great and noble hero comes to grief through some fatal misconception. Trilby, in her last years, is highly enough respected to have elevated even the great William Bagot, rather than dragged him down. Suppose he and his family had realised? Suppose Svengali, although partially redeemed, had been unselfish enough to tell all, and teach her in Paris?Joseph Heller wrote of a character whose girlfriends had to wait until a play was over, to know whether they were enjoying it, and then they knew at once. The literary establishment does not like sentiment, because the ordinary reader does not need any help to know if he likes it. But if you want to sample Victorian sentimentalism at its best, this is where to start."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"The book which put \\"Svengali\\" into the English language. I had heard of this book long ago, of course, though i can't remember whether it was first from learning about Svengali or finding out that du Maurier was Daphne du Maurier's father. But i had never read it. In a way i'm glad i didn't, becuase that has given me the opportunity to read it now, for the first time. It has taken me a little longer than i might have expected, but was well worth the time. The story of the tragic Trilby, who cannot sing a note to save her life, and how she is moulded into the singer who takes Europe by storm, by the evil (?)(i'm not sure) musician Svengali, who uses mesmerism of some kind to play her as an instrument. The story is told from the persepective of three Englishmen who lived in Paris during the time Trilby was an artists' model, before she fell under Svengali's spell. The three, Taffy, the Laird, and Little Billee, who was her fianc&eacute; at one point, briefly, are artists, of a sort; they love Trilby for herself, and are devastated when she is removed from them by events. Naturally, they are shocked by her reappearance in the world of Culture. But they are delighted at the possibility of renewing her acquaintance.I could wish that du Maurier had not been so cute with his French as \\"spoken\\" by the English. I could wish that there is less French altogether, as it does slow down the reading ~ perhaps one reason \\"Trilby\\" isn't read any more (is it?). It does generate an atmosphere, though, and you begin to know what Western Europe was like in the middle years of two centuries ago.

But if you were (or wished it to be understood or thought you were), you seized the opportunity and you scored; and by the earnestness of your rapt and tranced immobility, and the stony, gorgon-like intensity of your gaze, you rebuked the frivolous--as you had rebuked them before by the listlessness and carelessness of your bored resignation to the Signorina Patti's trills and fioritures, or M. Roucouly's pretty little French mannerisms.\\" Over a page later he returns to these earnest listeners: \\"He could sing both high and low and soft and loud, and the frivolous were bewitched, as was only to be expected; but even the earnestest of all, caught, surprised, rapt, astounded, shaken, tickled, teased, harrowed, tortured, tantalized, aggravated, seduced, demoralized, degraded, corrupted into mere naturalness, forgot to dissemble their delight.\\""},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"There were times when I was laughing at the characters and at the plot of the book. For instance there is plenty of filler and then comes the wait to find out who the great new singer taking Europe by storm is.

Little Billee is some type of enamoured artist and Svengali is a demonic master of music, a simple sort of lovably dumb love interest, there's a disapproving worrying mother worried about social rank and you plug them in to the formula and you get a classic novel.Sometimes I wonder where the art is in a book like this. In this instance it's mostly in the balance of the plot and the timing of suspense and the way the truth all unfolds at the end.Like I said Svengali and Little Billee are a little one dimensional and at that their images are basically used as a plot device, and for the most part the author just tells you what the characters are like more than showing. So my main complaint is that Svengali wasn't as wicked or as mesmeric as I anticipated, basically he's just cheap and spits on Little Billee. Take it up another level of vagueness (hard to call it abstraction) and you've got a guy with a messed up face, a mask, and a protege calling himself the phantom of the opera.These are the shortcomings of the book as I see them, but I can see why it's a classic the story/plot is well done, and the filler is well written, and occasionally entertaining, and occasionally you or I sort of laughed and identified with the the character-introspective passages, but I rarely felt for the characters genuinely."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"Reading \\"Trilby\\" is like listening to a lively, friendly raconteur taking you into his confidence. All the characters are interesting and lovable despite their faults. Ultimately, du Maurier even has a soft spot for Svengali. Sentimental, yes...but effervescent and with a broad tolerance for life and human weaknesses. It's a fun, memorable read and easy to see why it was a huge hit of the 1890's."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"It may not be possible to find a more cultured and pleasant novel than this. Victorians were full of admiration for French language and culture, even as they abhorred the French for their foreigness, and this novel capitalizes on that hate/love relationship. The novel depicts the life of bohemian artists in mid-nineteenth century Paris, something which I imagine must have been incredibly attractive to victorians. It was the life that a lot of people wish they'd had at a time when most people had to settle for drudge work in factories. It is a life a lot of people wish they could have today, when you consider all the romantic comedies produced by the film industry in recent years that are set in Paris, and depict a similar lifestyle.The author has a sense for atmosphere that is difficult to find a match for. The only author I can compare him to in this regard would be Elizabeth Bowen, with that sense for evoking setting that is almost cinematic. The cinematic settings alone place this novel ahead of its time when you consider that it was written when films did not yet exist. In fact, reading this novel is a little like taking a holiday to a Paris that no longer exists because, the Paris of today is a very different city from the Paris of the 1850's. I have never been to Paris myself, but after reading this book I had a feeling like I knew something about it: that I had gained a perspective on that city that is only available, perhaps, to students of literature and to readers of this great novel. When I do go to Paris someday, I will be looking to go on the \\"Trilby\\" tour.But I think that, rather than go into the many literary merits of this book, it's main achievement is that it just evokes the enchantment of Paris like no other novel before or since. And I think that is high praise and enough reason for me to recommend this book to you, because Paris is a magical city."},{"Title":"Trilby","review":"Trilby is a story based on the life and times of the mystical Svengali. This particular edition, published in 1894 is magical. The cloth bound hardcover is etched with an intricate green spider web design. The spine on many of the volumes is darkened which gives the book a beautiful contrast to the cover. My fascination with this story began when I read that Dr. H.H. Holmes, aka Mudgett, the serial killer who ravaged Chicago in the late 1890's, during the Chicago Worlds Fair, read this book in prison while awaiting his hanging for the horrific, slayings of innocent people during that time. I wanted to read the words that a depraved sociopath would find interesting. This well read killer was documented to have also been seen reading Melville while imprisoned. His hanging ended an era of killings, of maybe upwards of 200 people or more. He was well known to have dissected, and incinerate many of the victims, so the true number was never known. For more on H.H.Holmes, read \\"Depraved\\", and or, \\"The Devil in the White City.\\" This was a fascinating era, one in which the Mysterious Svengali played a bizarre role in."},{"Title":"Nets & Doors: Shrimping in Southern Waters","review":"A photograph is much more than just a piece of paper, especially if Jack Leigh's touch is on it. Then it becomes art - - photographic genius. As he captures the shrimping industry near his coastal home, his perspective is awe inspiring. Leigh manages to portray the mystery and beauty of the sea, while at the same time capturing the humanity and realism of the arduous life of the shrimpers. After setting the story with his introduction, Leigh keeps the written commentary brief; allowing the reader to be enfolded into the story told in the pictures. Though only still frames, each photo has a fluidity as if in motion: the sea's waves, the reflections of a boat, the flight of the gulls. The textures and shadows provide a clarity which might be lacking, had Leigh chosen a format other than black and white photography. By the end of the book, one knows that not only is this story over; but an entire Southern family heritage is also passing away."},{"Title":"Nets & Doors: Shrimping in Southern Waters","review":"Perhaps I was thinking I was getting something I wasn't. However, the book did not impress me. The photographs were quite nice, but I didn't think they were anything extra special. The main thing I missed was information about the people/places in the photograph.As an ex-photojournalist for some (small) newspapers, I always thought the photograph told the \\"who\\" and as much of the \\"what\\" as possible. The caption and the story accompanying the picture filled in the blanks and told you the story.Mr. Leigh's book introduced me to several who's and what's without any details. I missed the story behind the 3 generations of shrimp fishermen -- should be brief, but his was non-existent."},{"Title":"Nets & Doors: Shrimping in Southern Waters","review":"Jack Leigh has another winner in this collection of nautical photos.

Amazingly we had barely encroached on this area just 50 years ago, a fact he bears witness to. He passed away just a few years ago, but left us several good books before he departed. This one relates the story of his life as a stockman (cowboy) and croc hunter, of the people &amp; cattle stations which began to spread across the territory, and attests to the difficulty in establishing their viability."},{"Title":"Hell West and Crooked","review":"Hell West and Crooked derives it's title from an Australian stockman's term to describe cattle and livestock scattered far and wide all over the Outback countryside.This book is part biography, part adventure, and part history. Tom Cole was the real deal, a son of the great Australian Outback, and a keen observer of what it was like to live in the Northern Territory of Australia in the 1920's and 1930's. It is an easy and entertaining journal of this young man's life in those wild times. He was a stockmen, horse breaker, consummate horseman, buffalo hunter, and crocodile hunter long before Mick Dundee.Tom Cole's writing style vividly presents what it was like to live on the frontier of a still sparsely populated land even today."},{"Title":"Hell West and Crooked","review":"This is a great true story about a 17-year-old English kid who becomes an Australian cowboy, horse breaker, buffalo and croc hunter, etc. in the 1920s and 30s.

Tom Cole gives us a no nonsense insight into a remarkable life of buffalo and crocodile hunting."},{"Title":"Wild","review":"I would recommend Patrick McGiligan's biography because it has the research and detail one would expect of a biography. This book, (I assume written by an Englishman since it was published in England and uses words like \\"chum\\",etc) is a composite of what has already been published on Jack Nicholson. Its even balanced and focuses on seminal events in Nicholoson's life and his movies..What is very annoying about this book is the excessive description of the cultural context that surrounded Jack's 60's days...Way too much setting, frankly because there is not any new content here...If you don't know much about Jack, this is not a bad introductory piece....Oh, yes the other thing about this book is way too much (previously published) information on Warren Beatty, Roman Polanski, Marlon Brando, and Robert Evans...the writer goes into great details on the problems in their lives...not central to subject of this biography..."},{"Title":"Wild","review":"This is a very interesting look at Jack's life from childhood on - including his friendships and how these friendships affected his life. I enjoyed this thoroughly, so much, that I am reading it a second time!"},{"Title":"Eyeheart Everything","review":"I could go on and on about the stories that I loved in this collection- from the insane personal ads to the tale of the man who was born typing, the guys who trace a phone call with their television to the crazy Mykle Systems Labs advertisements urging the reader to send a dollar to what is presumably the author's address in Portland- but that would be too easy. Instead, I'd like to focus on the afterward.See, these stories were written by Mykle Hansen before he became famous. These were the things he composed when he wasn't in the international spotlight, before he began considering the perspectives of cannibals and bear hunters. Mykle Hansen may not have always been famous, but he was always awesome.Eyeheart Everything is a zine. It was originally photocopied at Kinko's and given out to whoever wanted it. It sold some copies at Powell's and caught the attention of a few people. This book is the physical manifestation of one man's vision. A man who was unwilling to wait for the publishing industry to take note. A man who was too hardcore for Dave Eggers.Dave Eggers. Freaking Dave Eggers. I swear to Jesus, I will kick that man's butt one day.But I digress.I love this collection because it represents the humble beginnings of a brilliant mind. Some of the stories are weird, others are hilarious, but all are endearing. This is a book that you want to keep with you, stuffed in your backpack for emergency use. I liked finding the tidbits that would evolve into his later work, the experiments with voice and narrative that would, one day, inspire me.The afterward is the story of this book and, arguably, is the best part of the collection. The tale of a guy trying to get his work out there at his own expense will always be inspirational to me. And, if nothing else, this book is a testament to the fact that just because it's free doesn't mean it's bad. Look at what this thing has become. Seriously, fifteen bucks for a freaking zine? That's highway robbery.But I'd pay it again.P.S. The Kindle formatting of this book is really great. Nice and clean."},{"Title":"Eyeheart Everything","review":"Mykle is a great guy and his book is a keeper. I always enjoy picking it up to read and reread the anecdotes/stories.

I actually bought two copies, just in case one goes bad, and I encourage you to do the same."},{"Title":"American philanthropy (The Chicago history of American civilization)","review":"This is great overview of philanthropy in the United States. You come away from this book understanding how much the idea of charity has morphed, and how much of an impact it has had through history. There is a lot to cover, and while I think it is largely done well, it does jump very quickly from one point to the next. Bremner spends adequate time on the biggies like Carnegie, but sometimes I wanted a little more details on the lesser known movements/philanthropists. But if you are looking for a comprehensive survey that's easy to read, this is it."},{"Title":"The descent of man: And selection in relation to sex","review":"As a Christian, I struggle with the Bible on a daily basis - is it the Inspired Word of God or just some stories about the Creator made my men?Well, as someone willing to look at all view points, I read Descent of Man and Origin of Species (again - I read parts of it in school years ago - perhaps it was a first edition - but then I'm showing my age. What struck me this time was how 'up to date' Darwin is. Considering how long ago it was written it seems very clear, profound and leaves one with a believe in natural selection without feeling that there still is a Creator of some kind.I think that Descent of Man should be read by ALL people to get a better understanding of why religious wars are so unnecessary.10 stars for this history making book - one that changed the world, not just by bringing science to our world, but by shaking the shackles of bad church leaders who want to keep the masses in the dark."},{"Title":"The descent of man: And selection in relation to sex","review":"Darwin's, \\"The Descent of Man\\" and \\"The Origin of Species\\" introduced to man the power of observations and gave the world the conclusions of this remarkable man.

How fun to find a book that is just a an exciting fun read with glamourous settings and a murderer who wears up-grade cashmere. (My last Boston set mystery was a Dennis Lehane - this is a completely different version of Boston, thank heavens).Oh, there's blood and gore but there's also champagne and romance. I often don't care for the mix but Adler does a terrific job of the blend. Fundamentally, there's enough chemistry between Mallory and Harry that the pages turn. And, unlike many romantic suspense novels where you simply want to skip the suspense pages, Adler writes a engrossing who dunnit. The writing isn't top-notch but it goes down easy. It was good enough to be a nominee for Romantic Times Romantic Suspense book of the year. A good book for reading at the beach or when you're home sick with a cold."},{"Title":"Now or Never","review":"I often find romantic suspense silly and not worth reading. But Elizabeth Adler gives her characters such depth and backstory that I was hard-pressed to tear myself away from this one.Mallory Malone appears to be the woman who has it all. She is attractive, rich, and host of a program which appears to be as popular as Oprah's. When a series of grisly murders in the Boston area occur, homicide detective Harry Jordan enlists her help. Naturally, Harry is not your average cop. He comes from old Boston money and society, was once a lawyer, and lives in a glamourous home plus has an equally glamourous getaway place and drives a Jag.When the two meet, he begins to fall in love but cannot get past the hard and brittle veneer Mallory has encased herself in. The reader knows these two are destined to be together and the trip there is well worth it.Fast-paced action, a psychopathic killer that wears Gucci loafers and expensive cashmere sweaters, and a retrospective look at Mallory's past that endears her to the reader, all combine to make this a most-appealing and quick read.And did I mention the dog. Squeeze is about as lovable as any canine in fiction and lives up to his name in a thrilling climax.The plotting is quick and exciting, the romance is electric, and the total package makes for a highly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Now or Never","review":"It was the first Adler I read and was a bit tentative at first but I must admit it was riveting.Great plot, believable characters and gory murders. I found myself praying for th women and enjoying the main characters. I had a lot of fun seeing Mal and Harry's relationship develop.

I particulary liked the chemistry between Harry and Mallory and I found it to be refreshing. I couldn't wait to find out what the secret was that kept poor Mallory feeling so lonely and out of touch. Harry was a true gentleman and I'm thinking that all women deserve a man like him. I am planning to buy Sooner or Later.

He swallows his pride and goes to Mallory asking for her help. It's obvious the picture of the alleged killer has affected Mallory in some way. She tells Harry she doesn't like &quot;rich cops&quot; (this from a woman who wears expensive designer clothes) and refuses to help him. She tells her assistant it's because he &quot;doesn't have his act together&quot; and then jets off to a spa in Arizona.Granted Mallory has been through some terrible things in her past which had left her haunted. However, she had the opportunity to prevent another murder but didn't.I liked Harry and loved his dog. The plot was great and the murderer a surprise.

Her sarcasm toward the main male character got old quick. Then, in a flick of the pen, in one page and a paragraph shift, she becomes, frightened and needy. I know this is fiction, but it has to be somewhat believable. The other problem I had, and I have this with several authors, is E.A. compares her character's physical traits with a well know actress or actor (both books). I don't want a picture of Harrison Ford in my mind as I read about the main character. There were small details that were out of place and this annoyed me also. I did appreciate the plot.

It took us into the mind of one who seemed to have a life full of love and wealth, yet, was not content. The meeting of these people was explosive. One may think the plot to be predictable, however, Adler, did put bizarre twist in this story to keep one guessing. The story conveys how three people, who appear to be such stronge individuals, deal with their past. It shows how the past affects the future of these individuals. Hence, showing how it is possible to be stronge for the world to see, and so weak on the inside for no one to see, unless truly looking....It is so easy to portray to the world...someone we are not...."},{"Title":"Now or Never","review":"The author had many good points about this book - she got into the murderer's mind and thought process well.

This is a MUST READ for every female!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"The book is nothing like I expected. His devotional book with the same title is great. I read it first, and expected the book to be more like that. It was not enjoyable to read and often had to feel embarrassed as I read it on my Kindle at the fitness club...and see the person next to me reading the sexual scenes as well. Little Christian, a lot of secular. Sorry I paid for this book."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"This book was very upsetting to me...first because it addressed several serious issues and in my opinion, left them open-ended at the end of the book. So if as a child or teenager you went through any one of those situations..it didn't do anything but dredge up old tramautic memories without any way to let go of that pain AGAIN. Secondly, I'm not a very spiritual person and I'm not sure if thats the reason I didn't get the message from it that I was hoping to...but I think it would have been a lot easier to do so if he wouldn't have touched on those painful and touchy subjects and then brushed them off so lightly. I think T.D. Jakes needs to stick to ministering in the church and leave that subject material to the professionals."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"While I can see why so many people have recommended I read this book since I had a past with abuse, I found it a little chauvanistic and written from a man's point of view, but since the author is a man, that shouldn't be surprising. I give it a mixed review...helpful, but puts people into stereotypes sometimes. My neice has attended his church and was very blessed so maybe its just his expression through writing that put me off a bit."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Woman thou art loosed assaults your emotions. You are gripped with the reality of both the difficulty and necessity to forgive no matter what has been done to you in life. The story is constructed by a series of flashbacks in the life of the main character Michelle Jordan. The story shifts rapidly back and forth between the past and the present. I was amazed at how i was able to keep up with the story even with the jostling back and forth. It is a well constructed story and i even caught myself hanging on the character Bishop Jakes' words. The characters are so real that i found myself being tempted to hate some of them. I couldn't understand why Michelle Jordan's mother was so blind. But i was sharply reminded at the end that we are all sinners in need of a saviour. We must forgive as we have been forgiven. This was not just a story but a hard and important lesson. Thanks to Bishop TD Jakes for this masterpiece of essential and extremely unique story telling."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"This book opened my eyes to a lot of baggage I was carrying around inside of me and bringing into new relationships. It made me aware of not giving another man a fair chance. I now have a loving, promising, relationship with a man I wouldn't take a million dollars for!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Woman thou art loosed I believe has great pointers. It's a book with one focus and not to necessarily teach you the \\"how's tos\\" as an instructor or Pastors do today (which is wonderful to do). This book is catered directly to deliverance or \\"letting go\\", it speaks to your Spirit to the Holy Spirit within to unloose a believer from things I must learn to communicate to God my healer to, and allow the Spirit till heal these covered wounds that never healed. It preaches to the forgotten hurt but hurt we unknowingly carry around that causes us to fall short in relationships and Love for others in various ways of loving people. That's why I would recommend it to those who have already started their personal walk with the Lord and are hungry to learn and have accepted Christ. I wouldn't recommend it to those who are still critical, and unforgiving regarding Son of God and God (Adonai), but those who want to believe in the delivering power of God as far as first \\"letting Go\\" Second getting the healing, seeking his face in your spirit of who he is to Desire him like no other desire you had before!! God is so vast you have to search him out in so many forms. That's why we're always satisfied with the WORD the BOOK the BIBLE in constant learning in many gifts and TD Jakes teaches, he preaches, he sings, he raps, he demonstrates, he provides movies, The Potters House for your home church growth, and to find your own home church for personal one-on-one development. If you want a more teaching style that help bring you to more of an understanding you can still get it from Bishop Jakes another book I highly recommend for deliverance and teaching is \\"The Battlefield of the Mind\\" by Joyce Meyers, WOW too!! In this mind state the person is open to not just one aspect of searching God since he's so vast and his spirit resides in different gifts and ways of communication. Basically this is a deliverance book that must keep it general as Bishop states for every situation requires specific advice, seek counseling from your trusted Pastor and find a church home."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"This book is not for someone who is in the process of overcoming a situation. If you have resolved yourself to the idea that you will not overcome an issue, then TD Jakes may be able to motivate you. This book appears to be a man's opinion of what a woman should do to overcome problems that only women face. The advice would have been better received and written if it had come from a woman who had actually experienced the life situations that were discussed. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I never got the book I sent an email, telling me it was sent out and the postal service had it well my mail lady didnt have it, I WILL NEVER order from a different company unless its straight from amazon and not a different store posted I would rather pay the more expensive price than not get what I ordered"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I see that there are no \\"negative\\" reviews regarding this garbage, so let me be the first.T.D Jakes is still stuck in the bedroom in regards to women. We are \\"recievers\\" because we are like sockets apparently. UH? What is that??? And WHERE in the Bible does he get that?Basically there is a lot of extra Biblical crap here that has no place in the Christian community.Secondly, this man is NOT an orthodox Christian, in the sense that he does not believe in the Trinity. So..why is this book being sold at Christian bookstores?The only positive thing that I can take away from this book is that at least someone is TALKING about female sexual abuse. I most definitely DO NOT agree with his paternalistic attitude regarding women, but its a START I guess. But frankly, this kind of paternalism he epouses, in my opinion, only makes the problem worse BECAUSE when you still say that MALES RULE, well, they get to do whatever they want with their women.so, I would most definitively LEAVE this one alone."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"TDJakes is a fan favorite, but let me introduce you to this best selling novel that was highly recommended to our book club and ultimately became our bi-annual book of the year. It's called &quot;WAITING TO EXIT HELL.&quot; This novel is a real-to-life book. We were blessed to be able to get this powerful sistah to speak at our luncheon and she is really real. She showed me how serious it is to seek the kingdom of God first and then he will truly add the rest. This book really affected me personally and I know that it will reach you too in one way or another. It took a tremendous amount of courage from this exciting novelist. I'm looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"T.D. Jakes has gone directly to the soul of women in WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED!In what can only be described as a spiritual love sonnet to women, Jakesspeaks to all of the hurt and pain that has been experienced by women sincethe beginning of time. Using taut Biblical examples like Sara, Eve, andEsther, Jakes ministers to women in a way that convinces you that divineintervention was in play when he penned these words.WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! delves into women's roles as ordained by God and howoften these roles have become confused due to old hurts, pain, and abuse. AsJakes covers a plethora of issues including incest, premarital sex, rape, andpromiscuity, he speaks directly to the reader. You often feel you are sittingin the room with him as he discusses these topics and the biblical insightinto his views. He prays with you as you read and he encourages every womanto reach for her individual greatness in God.I have read this book twice and both times I was in very different places inmy life. Each reading brought me a very different and personal message.Jakes describes the stages of life within the text and I found myself easilyin his metaphor. I was so moved by his words that I dismissed my reading ofthe book for a second time as coincidence and acknowledged it as the \\"God-incidence\\" that it certainly was.WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! is a book that should be on every woman's nightstandbecause no matter what you are experiencing, Jakes has a message for you timeand time again.Reviewed by Diane Marburyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"T.D. JAKES HAS A WAY OF MAKING YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE WAY YOU CARRY YOURSELF AS A WOMAN. THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO THE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY OR SEXUALLY. IT FORCES WOMEN WHO USE MONEY, MEN AND THEIR BODIES AS A WAY TO GAIN SELF-ESTEEM, RESPECT, OR LOVE. THE BOOK POINTED OUT THAT SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN USED SEXUALLY AND DISCARDED,UNKNOWINGLY SEND OUT VIBES THAT SAY TO UNSAVED MEN &quot;I'M DESPERATE, ABUSED AND LONELY. I'LL TOLERATE ANYTHING TO BE LOVED.&quot; THAT'S WHY SOME OF US KEEP MEETING THE SAME TYPE OF MEN. SO NO, ALL MEN ARE NOT DOGS. SOME OF US JUST HAVEN'T LEARNED TO LOVE OURSELVES ENOUGH AND TRUST GOD TO BLESS US WITH OUR HEARTS DESIRES. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY WOMAN WHO IS TIRED, READY TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH(E.G. BAGGAGE FROM THE PAST, UNSAVED MEN, ETC.), AND READY TO START HER NEW LIFE IN CHRIST."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"After reading this book,I was totally convinced that T. D. Jakes is annointed and has been prophetically impressed upon by God to reach &quot;women&quot; in a manner in which no other man has done thus far. I would be remiss if I did not give hommage to Bishop Jakes for having the divine wisdom and indepth conscienceness to caringly touch those secret places of a womans' psyche that only God himself knows about. This book transcends all barriers such as ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. When it comes down to facts, women are women, and many of us are faced with similar challenges throughout life. I would recommend this book to every woman! It is healing, and powerful. Though &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed&quot; will often bring tears to your eyes, those tears will inevitably be the water which surfaces the pain and washes it away. After reading this magnificant work by Bishop T. D. Jakes, I believe any woman would be on her way to recovery from whatever hinders her spiritually, physically or emotionally. I, personally, thank God Bishop Jakes!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I have read this book three times. The first time I read it, I had just come home from the a mental hospital following a suicide attempt. My husband left me for another woman following 17 years of marriage. I was at a complete loss. A friend of mine recommended Woman Thou Art Loosed and I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. It was like this book had been written for me because Bishop Jakes knew me personally and could feel my pain. Once my mind was clear, I realized that Jesus knew me personally, knew my pain and wanted me to come back home. HE wanted to be the man in my life. I needed no other. To make a long story short, I read the book, renewed my faith, embraced My Lord and life, picked myself up, dusted myself and here I am three years later, loving My Lord, loving life and proud that I AM the Daughter of A King. Give God the Praise!!!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"In this book, T. D. Jakes speaks to every woman and more especially those who are dealing with the depressing results of abuse (physical, emotional, verbal and spiritual) and battery. I recommend this book to all women, for as he notes, many women will not admit to have ever &quot;been there&quot;. This book will help you to restore your spiritual feet and a positive self-image!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I just finished reading this book about 5 minutes ago and, even though it is aimed at women, men should read it too. Why? Because it can give men a better understanding on women's attitudes, perspectives, moods, and over all, spiritual warfare. It is a well written book and is anointed by the Holy Spirit of God. I recommend this book for women which are still bound by the past and cannot see beyond today. This book will encourage you to be the woman God wants you to be. It is great for counselors, widows, single women, and women which have been sexually raped and molested. I am planning to buy two copies of this book to give to two wonderful people I know that can get something good out of it. Buy it and read it, you won't be disappointed. Woman, Thou Art Loose!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"How a person can overcome the pitfalls that come to you, in life, on a day to day basis.

It was a book which had such a profound annointing on it; you could fill the power come through the pages. Bishop T.D. Jakes is to be commended for such an enlightening interpretation of God's holy divine Word. Thank you for allowing God to use you to touch young women like me."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"No woman should miss out on the wonderful messages the Holy Spirit has for their healing and encouragement. Bishop Jakes certainly ministers to hurting woman through the power of the Holy Spirit in this book. Most women that read it feel that God is speaking directly to them--and He is! The Love and Mercy of God are evident in each and every word delivered by Bishop Jakes in this vital spiritual work. The wounds are exposed, &quot;oil&quot; is applied by the minsitry of God's love, and healing ultimately takes place. God is a good God and through this book, I truly realized how special women are to Him. Although society does not always see women in a positive light, this book will be a refreshing and liberating message to women all over the world, confirming to us that we are precious to God and He cares about how we feel. Don't miss this book, it will set you free!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"The book is great and it certainly meets the needs of women and children. Bishop Jakes knows women and he understands their unique needs. We could also appreciate the sensitive interpretation of the Scriptures relating to women and children. Yes, we are rereading the book and passing it on to others for them to recieve the benefits of his wisdom.God inspired the writing of this book and hopefully his other books that I have yet to read will have the same effect."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Interesting and there are many who can relate to this situation.

It's all that I expected as it teaches how God is with you always and will bring you through anything."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Overall, it's pretty good. However, this particular ebook does not use the voice of TD Jakes as the narrator, so you lose the potency in his usually &#34;on fire&#34; messages because of that."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Sometimes I am really surprised by the condition of the books I purchased on here.

It brought me out of the shell which I have been holding inside for many years. So glad I brought this book. Thanks Pastor Jakes."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Purchase of book is disappointing due to size of book. It is more like a pocket size than a sit down book. While I expected a soft cover, I didn't expects the smallest of it. Will not buy a book again unless it is clearly sized on advertisement. Or maybe I will look more thoroughly."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"A book to help women to know themselves and also how to handle themselves in certain situations.

Jakes that I have read and will not be the last. This inspiring book seemed to talk directly to me. The struggles that every christian woman encounters daily is discussed and all I can say is Jakes does an excellent job of giving us incredible role models from the bible. He makes the bible sing in a new way."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Mr. Jakes gave me hope of healing.

Coming out from under the influence of a lot of garbage in my life and finding a new way to live, this book inspired me, woke me up and helped me to get to know why I did the things I did. In my journey to get closer to our Lord, this book helped me to get connected and in tune to where my greatest source of strength lies. May God continue to bless you T.D.

In the meantime -- please keep on keeping on. :o)"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Once again, Bishop Jakes has written a book for women regarding the healing of past and present wounds.

Get this awesome book and be blessed!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"T.D. Jakes, is once again on target with this novel. You could feel his compassion and the SPIRIT of GOD in his words. This book allows you to look into the mind of a young woman who is tormented and feels completely alone. You see who helps her and who harms her.Thank you for writing such a moving novel."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I liked this book, chiefly for its ending. The brilliance of the book is not its readibility, not the back-and-forth movement of the plot, not the stark realism, but the realization that salvation is a messy affair.We tend to think too clearly on the matter of our redemption. Too neatly categorical. Too rank and file...who will be saved, and who will not. Jakes' genius here is to show how things come down to unpredictability, to release in tragedy, and the tragedy that underlies that release; to missed opportunity, and how a found opportunity misses the larger picture. Salvation-in-process is very messy, and I praise God that it is not on my desk.In the end, reconciliation can lead to redemption. Re-kindled relationships can lead to shared grace. It is necessary to keep on keeping on."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I love the grittiness of this book. I saw the movie first, a year or two ago, so I was glad to snag the book for later reading. The level of desperation and defeat in the heart of this young female, Michelle, is sadly captivating through the whole story, and is very realistic, as well. The author takes a subject matter that is brutally common in our culture and shines a spotlight on it, making it oh-so appropriately painful to read. There are many more people out there than we realize who believe that God has given up on them, that their lives are just meant to be this ugly. Jakes, as the minister who visits Michelle in prison and as the book's author, chooses to disagree."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"THE BOOK MADE IT TO ME BEFORE THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE & WAS IN BETTER CONDITION THAN I EXPECTED. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"What a book. I saw the movie with the same name, and what an experience. Thanks for the seller and fine delivery. A++++"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I just want to say that this book has paved the way to my journey of healing. As I read this book it was like TD was up on the pulpit preaching it. The words are annointed and the message is tailored to any woman that has lost some of her femininity and identity. Buy it... even if you don't think you need it- every woman should have a copy!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I would recommend this book to all women. It is a guide into the deep corners of the mind,heart and spirit."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I think this is a book all women need to read. It was interesting and let me know how parents just don't listen to their children. It was really sad for this young women to go through so much and had a mother that did not believe her. Now her life is just a mess and she has no hope for life. It really bothers me when I hear or read things like this but, it also let's me know that I am on the right track. I talk to a lot of young women. It amazes me sometimes the response I get. A lot of these young women today have no one to support them and the few that do, their parents are strung out on drugs or men. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to write about this."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Ilike this book it was so real, It go to show how little faith, can at times cause a person to lose sight of good judgement. And some times you have to be watchful of the people you choose to bring around your children. Good book"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Things like this go on everday. There is so many kids that are in jail, on drugs, or messed up in the head. This book sends a message to so called mothers who put a man before there kids."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Someone gave me this book at a very dark and dispair-filled time in my life. I was reluctant at first, more into wallowing in self-pity. But I came to know myself through the pages of this book and will always be grateful to the angel that gave it to me. She was almost a stranger and never got to know how much it helped me. This book can't &quot;change your life&quot; but if YOU want to change your life, it will remind you of how you cannot fail with God, and that God helps those that help themselves. Do yourself or a loved one a favor, READ THIS BOOK! I refer back to it - even though I got it many years ago!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I know this is just a book, but somewhere there is a real-life Cassey, Reggie, and a Michelle. This book was very emotional to me because there is some truth behind this. Cassey needed her a$$ kicked. Reggie needed to be shot down. Michelle needed a mother to tell her that she is somebody and she is worth something. I have never been molested by my mother's boyfriend(s) because she never had one to bring around. Her life was all about me, and she didn't want to bring me around different men. Being a mother myself of a boy and a girl, and another on the way, I couldn't understand why Cassey could just brush this under the rug like that. I know from being around other females and talking to them and knowing other social workers who work with families like that, these things are common -- the molesting and the mothers taking the boyfriend side because they don't want to face it and/or the child is scared to tell anything. Statistics state that 1 in 3 females are or have been molested in some time in there lives. It amounts to 33% according to my calculations, but it's way too many and I think it goes higher than that. Child molestation is too taboo, and this goes across races, socioeconomic statuses, religions, etc. We need to talk more to our children, and listen to what they are saying no matter how bizzar it is because it may some hidden truth behind it. As a mother, a single one at that, rather be lonely and have my children love me and feel protected rather than having some sicko as a man molesting my babies. I will date, but if my kids don't like him -- HE'S GONE! In the book, Cassey was just as responsible as Reggie was in the lost innocence of Michelle. If I ever knew a real-life Cassey, a mother like the one in the book, there would be no hestitation in me kicking her behind! In the book, Cassey's bestfriend Twana, was gooooooooooooooooooooooooood!T. D. Jakes sent little hidden messeges in the book. Well, they weren't hidden inconspicuously, but they were there. For example, when he is in the cell with Michelle when she killed Reggie and when Michelle was recalling scenes from the revivals, his words hit home, which was another reason why I got so emotional with this book. When he stated something like, \\"where you have been doesn't define where you are going,\\" he hit it right on the nail. I said, \\"amen\\" to that. I am not a \\"Holier-than-thou\\" person, but I do believe that everyone you meet and everything you have went through serves a purpose and it makes you who you are today. I refuse to let everything I have ever went through go in vain. You are not promised anything and you may not have a choice in certain matters, but I do know this; you do have two choices in life. Whatever you are going through, you can either just sit there and do nothing or die trying to change it. At least you would be doing something.This was a well-written book for everyone to read, and the messeges that J. D. Jakes send can be understood by anyone. I would recommend this book to anyone -- whether or not you are Christian and you really don't have to be. However, his words will make you think, and it may bring up some painful memories. Or, you may be able to confirm what he has said. EXCELLENT WORK!"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I often asked the question, how could a man have such an understanding and so much insight to what many women have or may currently be experiencing in their lives. This book is a must read for all women of any race and culture, because it ministers to the unresolved issues, hidden scars, offenses and to the depths of our souls. This is a starting process to bring up and out all those old things to allow them to pass away."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"T.D. Jakes has been preaching this message for 20 years. I hope that it has sunken into the ears of those women who are/were bound. This time, he has put his message into novel form to reach those who may only be interested in reading this message that way. However God gives it to him, let him tell it. Woman, if you are in bondage, you need to call on the name of Jesus from your heart so that he can loose you and set you free!I also recommend WOMAN TAKE YOUR POSITION--an excellent profoundly written book to help women understand their position with God and in their marriage, with their children and in the church and workplace."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"There are no words to describe TD Jakes, unless of course you say-Blessed beyond measure!

His words are releasing women from bondage all over the US, thank you, Bishop Jakes."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"Through the pastoral guidance of Pastor Jakes and the Love of God, I challenged--and defeated!!--the demons of my past. Pastor Jakes has a unique approach in that he rips at and exposes your wounds while providing loving guidance to support you in your healing. Because of this book, I will never be the same.

He truly has a heart for the woman that has been hurt, and as for me this book has open up my eyes and set me free from my dark past the inter child that was lost, hurt, and missed used is found and now my confidence and my faith has been renewed so I thank the men of God for letting the Lord work though him. Just to add to what I said because of the book, Iam free indeed there is no devil in hell that can take from me any more I think every woman should read this book they will be set free the Lord thy God is faithful I could go on and on about this book because It is powerful and eye opening a new life will emerge and truth will come I say woman forget about your past.

Washington"},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I find it amazing how God uses a man to deliver a message of healing for women. This book is truly inspired by God as it speaks directly to the heart of women. I read this book at a time when I needed healing from a relationship and found it very helpful. I am going to read it a second time, this time I have other things I need to be loosed from and I believe in Jesus' name that the book will have a total different meaning this time around and will in fact help me to overcome this as well. I love the fact that the book is full of scripture."},{"Title":"Woman Thou Art Loosed","review":"I just recently learned about this book after visting T D Jakes' website. I am blessed to only live a few minutes from Bishop Jakes' church in Dallas, TX. I have been wanting to attend his church but I didn't know why I had such a strong feelings about T D Jakes until now. I couldn't even get past the first chapter without bursting into tears! I felt like this message was just for me. I have been struggling for years with the secrets that I thought were just unique to me and had just gotten use to things being the way they were. I didn't know they could be any other way. When I was growing up and things were &quot;bad&quot; I always felt like I had someone watching over me because things never got as bad as they could have been.

At the end of the book, a photo shows the author with the Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band in 2003. Between these pictures are over 20 stories and 33 other photos that provide extraordinary recollections from this musician's years of professional experience. Amatneek refers to these stories as unamplified tales, largely because of his love of acoustic music. Moreover, he certainly needs no additional reinforcement, expansion or exaggeration of them to make his charming points. In fact, each story reads quickly, and they come across more as entertaining anecdotes that are both interesting and humorous. For the most part, they are based on real occurrences although the author's preface indicates that some are \\"told from their facts but to their hearts.\\" Like picturesque mountain scenery, each story is suitable for framing. The author writes with a vivid freshness and vigor that capture his unique experiences.Amatneek grew up in New York's Greenwich Village in the 1940s, and his connections eventually led to him becoming a \\"string-bass poppin', banjo-pickin' Philadelphia folkie.\\" His short vignettes from the 1960s through the 1990s include tales about meeting Bob Dylan, being \\"used\\" as a prop by Mary Travers, interviewing Aretha Franklin, having Dionne Warwick sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to him on his 21st birthday, and being inspired by Mimi Farina to make the world a better place. Throughout the book, the author intersperses a few song lyrics amidst the narrative.Acoustic musicians, especially in the folk genre, typically include stories into their presentation. Most are based on personal experience and relate thoughtful and honest portrayals of life on the road and the people they meet along the way. Many of Amatneek's yarns revolve around well-known music personalities. In one situation, he might be auditioning tortoiseshell picks with Tony Rice in Paris. In another, he and the Rowan Brothers might be picking with Bill Monroe at the Wintergrass Festival in Tacoma, Wa. A couple of my favorites are about a panel discussion of the meaning of Monroe's song lyrics in \\"Little Girl and the Dreadful Snake.\\" Other favorites are his description of the 3-ring circus of Beach Blanket Babylon, and the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994 in Ranville, France.The emotional impacts of death creep into the stories. The author becomes introspective when talking about the passing of Mimi Farina, Kate Wolf, Jerry Garcia, Steve Gorn's father, Steve Silver, Al \\"Jazzbeaux\\" Collins, and the New Orleans horn player Buddy Bolden. Amatneek claims to be \\"basically shy,\\" but this book shows, in writing, his more social and extrovert side. His \\"Acoustic Stories' are affectionately told, and anyone who can appreciate a few slices of music-related folklore will enjoy this book. Not only will you get to know the reserved bassist, author and storyteller better, but you'll get a taste of what it's been like for Bill Amatneek to cross paths and play with many luminaries in the music business. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)"},{"Title":"Acoustic Stories: Playing Bass with Peter, Paul & Mary, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Monroe, and Eighteen Other Unamplified Tales","review":"Each short story is a wonderful recount of the author's life as a musician and of the famous and infamous people who have left a delible impression on him. Some stories will make you laugh, some will make you cry with joy, and others will leave you reflecting on life. Stories you can read to your children."},{"Title":"Acoustic Stories: Playing Bass with Peter, Paul & Mary, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Monroe, and Eighteen Other Unamplified Tales","review":"Acoustic Stories is a unique and impressive anthology of true personal stories about musical legends such as Jerry Garcia, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, and many more as witnessed, experienced, and regaled by string bassist Bill Amatneek. An engaging recollection of personal memories, of tunes that transcend time, and offering contemporary readers with a tiny peek behind the surface of great entertainers, Acoustic Stories is most especially recommended for those legions of fans whose musical icons made and played decades of popular and unamplified music."},{"Title":"Acoustic Stories: Playing Bass with Peter, Paul & Mary, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Monroe, and Eighteen Other Unamplified Tales","review":"Bill Amatneek is accomplished musician and an equally accomplished storyteller, which is what makes this book such a great read. Just what what was it like to hang with Jerry Garcia? - well read on. Or plucking with Peter, Paul and especially Mary when they breezed through town. He talks about that, too, and even brings in Dion Warwick and an unexpected birthday serenade. His book is personal, musical, intelligent and full of back-stage scenes that you can only get through someone who's on the inside."},{"Title":"Acoustic Stories: Playing Bass with Peter, Paul & Mary, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Monroe, and Eighteen Other Unamplified Tales","review":"I bought the book for the Jerry Garcia and David Grissman stories but was pleased to find lots of great stories about musicians I did not know. This isn't a typical &quot;fan&quot; book but fans will like learning more about these famous, and not so famous, musicians from a backstage point of view. It's worth it for the Peter, Paul and Mary story alone.

A long list of people with famous names appear here, and are given faces, voices, and the quirky mannerisms that make them people, told by someone who has sat in the same room with them and breathed the same air with them.Best of all, running through this work as steadily as a flowing river is a deep reverence for musical expression at its most personal, its most intimate. A treasure of a read."},{"Title":"Acoustic Stories: Playing Bass with Peter, Paul & Mary, Jerry Garcia, and Bill Monroe, and Eighteen Other Unamplified Tales","review":"Requiem of anecdotes.

I was looking for something that was more in line with how I train, that is without drugs.I'm not even remotely a competitive bodybuilder and bodybuilding training is something I do in addition to doing other physical disciplines like Pilates and Yoga (which I do every day including the days I hit the weights), so my focus is on building strength and some mass, but health is the most important bottom line for me so using any types of bodybuilding drugs isn't even something I'd consider. I think the bodybuilders that use drugs are making a mockery of what bodybuilding should be, that is it should be a reflection of a healthy lifestyle rather than a bunch of \\"buffed up\\" and \\"Juiced up\\" guys who \\"look\\" fit and healthy when in truth they are poisoning themselves with all sorts of illegal and life threatening substances.Anyway, regarding the book:)The good point is that there is a lot of food for thought on training without the use of extreme drugs. There are very interesting articles about trying to induce the body to use it's natural resources to create muscle mass by triggering it through various means. I also enjoyed some of the chapters that featured various \\"natural\\" bodybuilders. Whether they are completely natural or not, these guys still look human compared to the freaks out there (in a large part thanks to the IFBB whimping out and failing to test bodybuilders all these years not to mention all the press given to the juicers)The less good point is the constant mention of various means of \\"supplements\\" which may not be as extreme as some the chemical substances out there, but these still seem a far cry from what I consider to be truly natural bodybuilding.To me, true natural bodybuilding should focus of course on training and definitely on nutrition, including supplements. However, the types of supplements that I would consider really natural would still be very much food based. Things like soy protein, whey proteins etc. I don't know enough about creatine to know if that should be in the same category as whey and soy. Of course vitamins and minerals would fit into this category.But so many of the things mentioned such as \\"cort block\\" and the like seem to be in an in between realm between what I consider natural and the types of insane staks many of the modern bodybuilders are obviously on. For anyone to think those IFBB bodybuilders aren't taking loads of drugs is an insult to anyone who has a clue about what a body can naturally look like.Still, all that being said, I'm glad I purchased this Ironman book because at least most of the guys in the book do look considerably more human than the guys who are obviously juicing and that was a relief.Also, I think the fact that natural bodybuilders have to learn not to overtrain is a critical point that I wish I learned many years ago back in my late twenties/early thirties when I was definitely pushing myself into an overtraining zone. Back then I was reading articles and books that had routines that really only are effective if you are using drugs. A natural bodybuilder couldn't recover using those programs and therefore overtraining was inevitable. Of course they never mentioned the fact that drugs were a pre-requisite for those programs.I am a lot wiser thanks to books like this one and I'm not beating myself up to the point where I can't recover. Plus at 46 years old, I need to be especially careful about letting my body recover after training.So, if you're looking for a book that is a welcome relief compared to much of what is out there, yet one that still touches upon the many new supplements being used by what are considered natural bodybuilders, then you might really find this book useful."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Natural Bodybuilding","review":"I would have thought that \\"Natural Bodybuilding\\" means bodybuilding without chemicals, including exotic supplements. But various participants in this book describe substantial supplement routines, including one fellow who says he took (at date of writing) androstenedione and a staggering 453 grams of protein daily(!!!). Another contributor describes Cort-Bloc; yet another talks about taking effervescent creatine, insulin mimickers, androgen precursors, HMB, etc. This is \\"Natural\\"???Too much of the bodybuilding industry rides on profits made from pitching exotic substances whose long-term effects on human beings is unknown. The hard reality is that truly natural bodybuilding will not make you look like the full-time fitness models (who always look vaguely ill to me), unless you have incredible genetic gifts.Save your money."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Natural Bodybuilding","review":"Not a bad book on natural bodybuilding but if you have read Ironman magazine this book is really nothing new. And it contains a lot of pictures of bodybuilders that are oviously not natural."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Natural Bodybuilding","review":"This text is an invaluable resource for keeping track and building plans for natural bodybuilding. This is a recommended buy for anybody's library whether personal or public."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Natural Bodybuilding","review":"I take exception with the claim that: &quot;Continuously published since 1936, Ironman is the dean of bodybuilding magazines. It has been showcasing every major bodybuilder, training technique, scientific advance, as well as other aspects of the iron game, longer than any other bodybuilding magazine.&quot;That statement would be correct if the writer was referring to the old &quot;Iron Man&quot; magazine, edited by Perry and Mabel Rader, from Nebraska. It was a tremedous resource for accurate and helpful training advice, without the Hoffman/Weider bias. It introduced the writings of Arthur Jones and other notables, as well as the supplements of Rheo Blair. However, for whatever reason (probably the lack of advertising) it went under. The new Iron Man magazine, from which this book usurps it's name, is no more connected to the orginal, than the resurrected Muscular Development is to the old York publication. They appear to be more showcases for steroid/hormone users; as well as supplement and equipment catalogs, than sources of helpful information.I would be more interested in a reprint of Vince Gironda's &quot;Unleashing the Wild Physique,&quot; or Steve Reeves &quot;Building the Classic Physique.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Guide to Natural Bodybuilding","review":"THIS BOOK HAD SOME VERY GOOD BASIC INFORMATION ON TRAINING, NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION. THE INFORMATION WAS VERY UP TO DATE. WHAT I ALSO PARTICULARLY LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK WAS ITS PROFILES OF SOME OF THE NATURAL BODYBUILDERS OF TEAM UNIVERSE. IT ALSO PROFILED SOME BODYBUILDERS WHO AVERAGE PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE EXTREME IN BODYBUILDING WITH THE USE OF DRUGS OBVIOUS BUT UNSPOKEN,LOOK ELSEWHERE. BUT IF YOU ARE INTO BODYBUILDING NATURALLY THIS IS &quot;THE BOOK&quot; FOR YOU."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"I spotted this book in the book store, and grabbed it because the cover looked interesting. I absolutly could not put it down. It is fast paced and the prose is excellent. I love Russo's sense of what the future could be. This is my favorite of his novels and I highly recommend it. I bought it in 1993, and have read it at least ten times. It is what I consider to be a nearly perfect novel."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"Destroying Angel is a fun stroll through the deadly neon-lit concrete jungle of a sinister dark future of the 21st century. Scary and depressing while at the same time hopeful and thought-provoking. Realistic charaters and believable setting make this novel a must-read for fans of cyberpunk! WARNING: contains graphic violence, profanity, sadistic behavior, and nearly every psychopath, oddball, and misfit you will find in a real city! reader's discretion is advised."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"The first novel of the Carlucci trilogy is less about Frank Carlucci than it is about retired officer Louis Tanner, but it shares the same locale, wild thrills, unexpected turns and taut writing. Russo creates a believable near-future, fully fleshed-out with characters who continue on through the rest of the trilogy. Carlucci is introduced and appears, but he plays only a &quot;second banana&quot; role. The story in this book sets up the remaining two novels, and if you read one you'll want to read all three of this excellent set. I only wish I'd been able to read them in proper order.Let's hope this novel is back in print shortly and becomes easier to find. It deserves it!!!"},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"The entirety of cyberpunk may qualify as a hidden gem, but Destroying Angel might be the best novel that the genre ever produced.The award-winning Russo has a lot of great books to his name - Destroying Angel may be the best. Russo doesn't make the mistake of losing his story in the joy of world-building. Although his cyberpunk San Francisco is a gloriously grim setting, the book is about a man (Tanner), a mystery (a serial killer) and a theme (DOOM!).For those that argue cyberpunk is \\"SF noir\\", this is valuable evidence to prove their case. It spawned two sequels, neither as good."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"This is such a wonderful series of books. I picked them up at a used bookstore and I can't believe they are out of print. Working in a bookstore myself I read all the time, and these are some of the best novels I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"If you like detective fiction in your sci-fi, then Russo'sbook will certainly please. It has a gritty cyberpunk edgeto it and paints a vivid if depressing picture of San Franciscoin the future. For a similar but much more stylish worktry William Gibson's _Virtual Light_."},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"A great novel, and a lot of fun. You have to read it"},{"Title":"Destroying Angel","review":"I'm surprised at all the gushing reviews. There's absolutely nothing special about this book, which bears some of the sadly typical flaws of much of the genre, including wooden characters and a plot that's going nowhere. A lot of the \\"action\\" revolves around the main character going out to eat, with poorly made coffee as an ongoing theme. If I had a dollar (quarters don't amount to much anymore) for each time one of the main characters utters the following lines--\\"I don't like it at all. But what the hell else are we going to do?\\"--I'd have enough to buy something more engaging. Also, while I realize this book was published in 1992, there's nothing to really warrant calling it a \\"cybershock thriller.\\" It's not even thrilling. The only reason I'm sticking it out is because it's set in my hometown and at 230 pages it's short enough that the time I'm wasting is limited. I apologize to all the Russo fans, but I just couldn't deal with the unchallenged glowing reports. Maybe some of his other stuff is better. I can think of four books off the top of my head that I'd recommend instead: if you're into disaffected youth and futuristic urban decay try Samuel R. Delany's Dhalgren. If you're looking for an \\"exotic\\" futuristic thriller, try Greg Alec Effinger's Gravity's End or David Mack's Kabuki. And if you want to read a more original suspense thriller set in San Francisco's Tenderloin, try The Magician's Tale by David Hunt."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The very best account of the life of Christ that I have ever read, aside from the Bible. This author brings a seemingly eye-witness perspective to this work. The characters come to life in amazing detail. It makes reading the Bible itsself more understandable. This book give the reader a feeling of &quot;personal contact&quot; with the Man whose birth divided time into BC and AD. Who was / is Jesus? I am so glad that I read this book. Like a magnifying glass to The Gospels."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"There's a reason why the Library of Congress holds this as their best book on the life of Christ, and also why my personal copy is in tatters. I simply have never read another book, besides the Bible, that made God's love so clear to me. We are bathed in His love every moment of our lives, whether we acknowledge this or not. The ultimate proof of this divine love is revealed in the life and death of one Man -- Jesus. This book will make Him real to you."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"This book is a must read! It is the best book on the life of Christ in my opinion. It shows God's love at its very best in the gift-Jesus Christ. It goes into so much detail on Jesus' life, and the best thing is-it's based 100% on the Bible! I found no faults with it, no contradictions, nothing that goes against what the Bible teaches, etc. I encourage you to get it if you want a fuller relationship with Jesus and understand His mission better. You'll never be the same! It goes along a story format so it's very interesting reading. Right now is a good time to read it, because &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; movie with Mel Gibson has just been recently released, and this book is good to read after watching that movie for the whole story-the part the movie leaves out. God bless all and the USA! I also highly recommend the book, &quot;The Great Controversy,&quot; by Ellen G. White, who was the author of this book."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I began reading this classic and could not put it down. I can only say that it made the pages of the Bible come alive. In my opinion this book enhances many of the stories of the new testament in such a way that can never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"This book was given to me by a co-worker and it's probably the best book I've ever read. The book goes right along with the Bible. This book is a reflection of the life of Jesus and will rev up your spiritual life and will bring you closer to God. Yes, it's that amazing! In some editions, Bible verses are noted at the beginning of each chapter so you can read the story in the Bible and then read what Ellen G. White has to say about it. If you want to strengthen your relationship with the Lord, this book will deliver.It's also interesting to note that the last five or six chapters have been made into a book called \\"The Passion of Love\\" which you can buy at Wal-Mart. I love how this book tells the story of Christ's betrayal, trial and conviction, his death and resurrection. If you loved the movie \\"The Passion of Christ\\" this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Ah, this is one heck of a book. This book primarly talks about the life of Christ. Yep, its an auto-biography dealing with his first advent, life, teachings, death, and ressurection. The wonderful author Ellen G. White wrote this awesome book plus tons more of Bible stuff. I strongly reccommed this book if y'all are Passion of the Christ fans. Now my defense for this inspired lady. Now, of all the false accusations about her are false okay..After reading this book, i have found no contradiction with the holy scriptures oh yeah by the way The Holy Bible is your primary book. I agree with the other reviewer about Joe (JC father). I think its obvious that he had kids from a previous marriage. I think that should not be an issue at all cause we are all children of God no matter what. When you read any book about religion or the Bible, you should check the Bible to be sure it's biblically correct. Remember The Bible is written by God himself through Holy Men only..I rate all Ellen G White writings 100 stars ++++...MAD PROPS!!!!"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages is a great book in addition to the Bible. It provides detailed insights into Jesus' life by giving background information and particulars of many events. For the most part it was like reading a story book that you just can't put down.I believe there are many more strengths than weaknesses so I will start with the weaknesses which should be easier. One of them which did not apply as much when the book was written is the use of somewhat older English. People who are not used to it could benefit from a more modern version. Other than this, I cannot think of any other weakness. The strengths are that since it is written as a story it is very enjoyable. Also, the fact that you can use it as a study guide and follow most of it with your Bible adds to the learning.The story of Jesus, the God of the Universe, coming to this world as a human to save those who have sinned is in itself very intriguing. It makes you want to know all the possible details about who Jesus was, what He did, and why He came. The Bible explains the fundamental facts along with some other information not specifically important. The Desire of Ages is that book which tells the minute details and instead of satisfying your curiosity it makes you want to know even more. Jesus' life comes alive as you read about his extraordinary life. It explains why Jesus had to come to Earth and even what the purpose of our life is.Someone mentioned that it contradicts the Bible, that Mary was a virgin and therefore Jesus could not have had any brothers. The Bible doesn't give many details but it is possible that Joseph had sons and daughters from a previous marriage. Just a thought, I'm sure all the other &quot;contradictions&quot; have a possible explanation."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The dramatic description in this book of the life of Christ has been lifechanging for me.

As if one were stepping into the world of Israel 2,000 years ago. Even into the various individual lives themselves. A great companion to that greatest of all books, the Bible. We find a real Jesus, with a real man's body, and a real man's voice, yet with the compassion of God Almighty. For He was also God in the flesh. The true God He came to reveal. Not the one shrouded in superstition and tradition, but the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah. For the honest reader looking for a blessing, the Prince of Peace will touch the soul, after the reading of this inspired commentary of the Holy Gospels."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Very good, inspiring.

It was written by Ellen G. White before the Civil War as a literary expansion of many of Christ's events while on this planet.

The Bible references validate the author's writing and shows that she was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit. A blessing to all who read it."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Ellen G. White wrote an excellent commentary on the life of Jesus in her book the Desire of Ages. White was one of the founders of the Seventh-Day Adventist denomination. I do not necessarily endorse all of her doctrinal views. Her claims to experience visions have been a source of controversy. However, this book on the life of Christ was an outstanding read.White wrote this book with beautiful prose. She communicated the teachings and ministry of Christ in a compelling manner. Her literary style was very pleasant and richly descriptive. The commentary was masterful from a literary standpoint.The theology of the book was sound and most Christians would be happy with the message and interpretation of pivotal points in the ministry of Jesus. I read the book from cover to cover and I did not identify any major doctrinal errors. This book is written at a level where laypeople and older children can get a lot out of reading the work.White was able to coordinate the accounts of the four Gospels and synthesize them into a coherent manner. This is not always an easy task to pull off. She comes across as a very knowledgeable and compassionate writer on matters of the heart and the basics of the Christian faith.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was a gift from my grandparents. The quality of the writing was outstanding and I walked away with a better idea of the incomparable goodness of Christ. This is a literary devotional classic."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Presents comprehensive thoughts by detailing to the reader the life, events, emotions and challeges ever present in the life of Christ.

Have you never wanted more from life? Why, and what hope have you? The book is a series of stories from the life of Christ expostulating and illuminating the final causes of these events. Ellen does not spare her opinions. She serves as our preacher. Each story is illuminated by a full color repro of a painting by John Steel, or Harry Anderson, with spot illustrations by James Converse. The art is a feast for more than the eyes."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I was disappointed with some of the other White e-books because of poor control to jump through the book. This version from the White Estates fixes that problem. The 5 way control button on my Kindle works to jump through the chapters without needing to go to the TOC. That is a big help when I'm jumping back in forth between a few chapters.Caution: The D of A Kindle version that says it has an active TOC/ and has a picture of EGW on the cover; it doesn't jump through the chapters using the 5 way control button... This version from White Estates functions better.Desire of Ages is fantastic reading in any e-version. :)"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"If I were forced onto an island and told I could take only one book with me, it would be Desire of Ages by E G White. I say this because I have been reading it for about 40 (yes,forty) years, still read it very often and plan to read it until I die. If you want to learn to love Jesus more than ever before, read this book. Don't let its length intimidate you. Read a page or two here and there every day ... for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"This book gives the story of Jesus' life in a way that answers all the questions surrounding him. Why did Jesus come here in the first place? Did he fulfill ancient Hebrew prophesies? Was he really who he said he was? Why did people treat he the way they did? Did he have to die? Did he have a larger purpose? Why did he speak so mysteriously sometimes? If you really want to come to know Jesus as the person... as he truly was, this is the work for you. I have read it three times and never come away without being inspired, awed and humbled."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Rarely do you find a book with such insight as to draw the conclusion that a writer was truly inspired in what they have written. My library is full of Christian literature and this writing ranks with the best of them. My favorite chapter is Chapter 31 The Sermon on the Mount. I highly recommend this book and Peace of Soul by Archbishop Fulton Sheen to anyone seriously wanting a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and Him Crucified ."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages will create in you the longing to beclose to Jesus of Nazareth.

I am seeing Jesus through not only new eyes, but I am learning about him like I would want to learn about my best friend and or mate. I really am enjoying this book it has stirred a new fire and closeness with my Savior. The book is an account of the bible and his life, only expounded with thought provoking details that you would never had thought. I feel so close to Christ. I am reading it each day. It is written in such a way that completing a chapter has become my devotional time, I pull out my most beloved book, my bible and study along with the story... AMAZING"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I have read and reread this book and have never found a better work on the life of Christ!! It grabs your attention and takes you into the reality of the awesome Savior we all can have. I'd rather believe in creation and God and be wrong than believe in evolution and be right!! I also had a look at some of the works White probably borrowed from and can say that this is far more powerful, lifelike, and inspiring than the other authors mentioned in the feedback."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"This book is 5 stars but the modern Language rewrite by Jerry Thomas is even better seeMessiah"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages is a book that has changed my life. It made Jesus Christ come alive for me. The accounts of Christ's life are vivid and real and Ellen White mixes his story with personal day-to-day applications and lessons for us. Anyone that has a desire to know the Savior should definately read this book. It doesn't matter what religion you are, because it is a book about Jesus and you cannot help but be drawn to him through its powerful message. It will inspire you to be a better person, make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all it will make you long to see Jesus."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"This small hardcover book is a delight to read for all Christians. Using direct references and quotes from the New Testament, this book poses a very interesting biography of Jesus Christ. Though this book was written in 1940, its subject matter is still applicable to today's Christians who may want a detailed account of the Lord's life without having to read through the Gospels. Black and white reproductions of scenes from the Lord's life add to the appeal of this great, little book. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I ordered \\"The Desire of Ages\\" and received \\"The Great Controversy instead.

While reading it, I kept running into issues that conflicted with the teachings of the Bible. The first deals with references to Jesus having older brothers. Jesus was born of a virgin, thus there could be no older brothers.I was also told that this book was promoted by the Library of Congress. I have since found that this is not the case, but that it was recommended by Pastor Wells E. Bement who went to work for the Library of Congress. It was never recommended by the Library of Congress."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"Much of this book is copied from \\"Night Scenes in the Bible\\" by Rev. Daniel March and is not even White's own original thought. Why not just read the original?"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages is a definite must read and re-read, as it demonstrates the life of a true Protestant and Christian. Many details within this highly descriptive life story of Yeshua, point readers undoubtedly back to the Holy Scriptures. While reading and re-reading, new ideas emerge, as new light emerges in a sanctified Overcomer's mind. I highly recommend this book, as it draws believers closer to our Great Magnificent Redeemer, now acting as High Priest in the Holy of Holies (Hebrews 8:1-5, 9:12-28)."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages (1898):An excellent book paralleling the Bible on the life of Jesus as portrayed through the imaginations of several authors and compiled, or borrowed, by Mrs White. Two of the Authors were the minister, Robert Boyd, who authored \\"The World's Hope; or The Rock of Ages(1873)\\" and the Rev. Daniel March who authored \\"NIGHT SCENES FROM THE BIBLE\\"(1872). These are excellent books. Amazon had a couple, but were rather expensive. I found mine on another site. The rumors that I had heard of Mrs White lifting much from these books proved to be altogether true. Anyhow, the book does much to draw the reader into a great appreciation of our Master's \\"way\\" and leaves deep impressions of His love toward man by the way He interacted with the many persons of all stations of life that he encountered based, but adlibbing upon the biblical record. This book is filled with hope and warning, as is the Bible, but presented in a way that leaves you with a strong desire to maintain you connection to heaven, or to begin one if you have never had one."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I received this book about one month ago. I am still reading it, and I am known for being a voracious reader. It is not one of those books that you can skim through quickly.

If you want to know more about Jesus Christ and His walk here on earth, PLEASE read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"I have read this several times. It is an EXCELLENT commentary on the life of Jesus Christ, replete with Scriptural references. You see what God is REALLY like, not an opinion expressed by someone who has never studied the Bible, but an account shared by the Bible itself and spoken from one who served Him and saw Him as Lord and best friend.Beware, after you read this, not only will your life be changed but you will want to study the Bible for yourself to become close to Him !It is a book that I purchase and give to friends, strangers and anyone who is searching for truth and meaning in life."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages is an interesting book that gives information above and beyond what is given by the Bible. In that it was written by someone who claims the prophetic gift, that is understandable and expected, but it can be unsettling for those who don't know about, or believe her claims.Even for those things that included in the Bible, the author gives a unique twist, for instance Pilate's question to Christ -- \\"What is truth?\\" the author gives a different interpretation of Pilates motives and attitude in asking the question and why the question is never answered by Jesus than any other author I have ever read.Also, the author gives little golden nuggets on how differences between the gospels are harmonized that is exceptionally compelling while not doing violence to the text like many other authors do.All in all a beautiful book that thoroughly uplifts people to Jesus.Now I wish someone would do a review of the narrator of the audio recording of the book!"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"In my struggle to draw further away from worldly things and come closer to God, I was recommended to read this book.It has not only been an eye opener to me, but also a wonderful blessing.

When I began to read it, I couldn't stop. This is the kind of book you can easily read in one sitting.The most amazing aspect of this book are the emotions it evokes. The truths are so powerful and nourishing that I can only urge you to read it. I promise that the life of Jesus will make a lot more sense after reading this book. It has been a blessing for me and I'm sure it will be for you as well. (:"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The story presented in this book is so cool! Really gives insight into the time Jesus spent here on Earth. One gets to see Him for who He really is, not what people have made Him out to be.

The book was delivered quickly and without any issues. I would recommend this vendor to anyone."},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"The Desire of Ages remains one of my favorite books on the life of Christ. I am not concerned about where Ellen G. White derived her material. Her Conflict of the Ages series, of which The Desire of Ages is one volume, stands on its own as a sort of Christian \\"midrash\\". As many of you already know, a midrash is a process that has been practiced for thousands of years within Judaism to interpret the Biblical stories in such a way that many gaps that are left out the biblical narrative regarding events and personalities are filled in. Numerous rabbis worked on the midrashim and no single rabbi is generally considered the author of these in-depth, incisive retellings of the Bible stories.Mrs. White would have made a dandy rabbi -- and I mean that as a compliment. Her role in the Seventh-Day Adventist church closely paralleled the rabbinical role in that she interpreted and advised the church in its halachic or religious-legal practices. Within the church, she is regarded as more than this -- as a prophetess whose inspiration came directly from God. However one chooses to regard Mrs. White and her work, one of the results of her endeavors was The Desire of Ages, which is one of the most compelling presentations of the life of Christ that I've seen.Debra Anne Wintsmith,Author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga"},{"Title":"The Desire of Ages","review":"\\"Desire\\" is a terrific commentary on the life of Jesus Christ. But it is too heavy-duty for the new Christian or the thinking of becoming a Christian. A good E.G.

It's also your book if you want to deepen your relationship with Jesus Christ.But... if you are not interested in having Him revealing/rooting up your character defects and pet sins, you'd better pass until you're up for a spiritual deep clean."},{"Title":"The Christmas Poodle","review":"This little book was a gift to me in more ways than one. My aunt gave it to me because I am a professional dog handler and I specialize in showing Poodles in AKC. I delayed reading it because of the Juvenile Fiction moniker, but carried it with me on several trips out of respect for the giver. Finally, with nothing else to read on a particularly long flight, I pulled it from my briefcase and gave it a read. This is an amazing little story and the author must be an amazing human being, else I would not be writing my first review ever. The Christmas Poodle stirred every emotion I have and constantly pummeled me with the plight of two homeless children. It made me realize just how fortunate I am and how unfortunate so many people are. This is a story for all seasons, a story that will most certainly bring anyone our of their shell into the realization that magical things happen during the month of December...things that have been happening for centuries. Obviously, I fell in love with Maximus, the \\"great Poodle\\". As a handler, I immediately recognized the attributes of this magnificent beast and recalled fondly so many Poodles I have had the pleasure of showing in the ring. The author captures so much of the breed in so few sentences that he must be certainly know the breed well. There is no way I can express the emotions that I went through as Jamie and Tessie endured hardships and victories in this very short book. I have to recommend it for any age group as it reads very well."},{"Title":"The Christmas Poodle","review":"I purchased this book for my granddaughter for a Christmas gift. Being an avid reader and an exhibitor at dog shows for many years, I decided to give it a \\"skim\\" just to make sure it was appropriate for her. This is a delightful and touching read and NOT JusT FOR KIDS. I found myself completely immersed in this tale and of course fell in love with the poodle!"},{"Title":"Tiger Woods","review":"Sports Illustrated put together a collection of some of its articles chronicling the rise of Tiger Woods from the years 1992 through 1996. Writers such as James Garrity, Jaime Diaz, Tim Rosafore, Rick Reilly, William Reed, and Gary Sickle share their special insight on this young golf phenomena. Everyone has their say in this three act drama.Act I is aptly titled The Kid. Here we are given a snapshot of the young Tiger learning his trade while moving up in the ranks of golf history. Act II concerns itself with the young man on the rise as an Amateur. The reporting tracks his comebacks, successes and the never ending question of when he will turn pro. Act III, The Pro, introduces us to a new Tiger. Tiger has moved beyond his peers on the amateur circuit and now has debuted as a professional. How he does and what he will do in the future is yet to come as we read the articles concerning his progress.This is a good picture book. If you want to start a conversation about Tiger Woods and his rise to golf fame, this is a fair start. The articles aren't all that exciting unless you love to hear the same old jargon and statistics about Tiger, time and time again. The book's photography is good and enjoyable. Sports Illustrated threw together a picture book of a rising star. The magazine could have done better but what you have is decent coffee table reading."},{"Title":"Falcons and Foxes in the U.K: The Making of a Hunter","review":"Chichester has a witty, conversational tone to her writing that I found most pleasant. FALCONS AND FOXES is a rare glimpse into the intricate process of raising and training falcons that are used by the world's elite to hunt from horseback. It was such a fun experience to be a behind-the-scene participant. Silly as it sounds, I have such a fanciful imagination that, while reading this delightful book, I transported myself into an historical romance as a noble trainer to the King's falcons.Chichester recounts day to day living with a group of falconers chosen from around the world to apprentice as trainers who raise these majestic hunters from embryo to adult. Fascinating read."},{"Title":"Falcons and Foxes in the U.K: The Making of a Hunter","review":"Something is missing from American falconry, something old.As you hunt the doomed woodlot behind Wal-Mart, imagine this: You're on a horse, on a windy crest of high pasture bordered by a stone wall two thousand years old. Your great grandfather was born three miles from this spot in a farmhouse that still bears his name. Tiny white flecks of sheep graze in the valley below. Above them, a mixed flock of jackdaws and crows forms a tight whirling spiral evading the efforts of a young falcon, moments ago released from your glove.In Northumberland, the far border of England and Scotland, this could be any day in the last eight hundred years. It could be yesterday. For all our modern improvements and vast open spaces, American falconry has nothing like it.For Virginia writer Lee Chichester, the lure to see and take part in such ancient sport was irresistible. In the Spring of 1995, she saw a notice in the Hawk Chalk calling \\"junior falconers\\" to intern at the National Avian Research Center, a falcon breeding operation run by Dr. Nick Fox in Carmarthen, United Kingdom. Applicants would assist in all facets of falcon rearing and training. The latter half of this five-month engagement would be spent hawking crows in the rolling border country far to the north. Chichester had at that time flown three passage red-tails, mostly at squirrels and mostly alone, so counted herself a junior falconer and applied.Falcons and Foxes in the UK: The Making of Hunter is the story of this \\"one time only\\" falconry experience. As a freelance journalist twenty years in practice, Chichester weaves an engaging, full-length narrative around what for lesser writers would be another essay on \\"How I spent my summer vacation.\\" Chichester skillfully supplies her story with moments of suspense and with well-drawn characters, of which she herself proves complex, sympathetic and believable: a falconer young in the sport though older than her fellow interns; far separated from her husband and close friends; a reluctant ambassador of America and American falconry; a woman seeking experience and respect in a sometimes condescending masculine culture.For the student of falconry, there is plenty of detail in Chichester's vivid accounts of the perils of wild hack, the meticulous job of captive propagation and the raw thrills of the haute volerie, the high flight of the falcon as seen from the back of a galloping horse.If you share even a twinge of Lee Chichester's spirit of adventure or her fascination with this beautiful and ancient branch of our sport, let her lead you through the pasture gate and on to the chase."},{"Title":"Falcons and Foxes in the U.K: The Making of a Hunter","review":"This captivating book weaves the technical details of modern falconry with historic lore and the author's personal journey into the world of hunting with raptors. Chichester brings falconry alive. An informative read for birders or anyone interested in the fascinating world of falconry."},{"Title":"Falcons and Foxes in the U.K: The Making of a Hunter","review":"Being in the novice category, I applaud Chichester's ability to capture my attention and hold my interest. I found the story-like quality quite appealing and informative facts offered in managable doses. The characters have charm and create connections that leave the reader wanting more. I would imagine more experienced falconers could find common story themes in Chicester's work. A good read aloud for the younger set when offered in segments. Where is the next adventure?"},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"Although Sting did not co-operate or contribute to the biography Sandford's book is really very good, and the author has clearly done a great deal of research. It helps that Sandford is a good writer. The stunning analogy he draws in the first few paragraphs of the book between 60's supergroup Cream and the Police was one of the best introductions to a book we can remember. Very few people - understandably - get really close to Sting, so Sandford has sought out old friends, colleagues (and enemies) to help fill out Sting's life. Sting of course has lived the second half of his life in a media glare so bright it would have blinded and broken lesser men. Forever in the news and always available for a media friendly news-bite or always 'arms-length' interview, all of the attributable quotes in this book are recognisable to fans. It is in his examination of career-defining points, that Sandford digs up anecdotes and stories that have you glued to the page. Whether t! hese are details of Sting's legal case with Virgin which resulted in the return of ownership in his songs (and later guaranteed royalty income of millions of pounds), the decision to go solo in 1985, the visit to the Brazilian Rainforest, or his well publicised \\"missing millions\\" legal case in the mid 90's, the stories are told objectively and not in the tabloid friendly sensationalist manner of Wensley Clarkson's poor biography from 1996. There are of course errors which keen fans will see - The Police for example played no concerts in 1985, the show referred to was on the Blue Turtles tour (we were there at the Newcastle show he describes) and this story appears to be cribbed from Clarkson's book which makes the same error. There are one or two other factual errors - at one point Sting is described as past 50, when he won't hit that landmark until 2001! On the whole though, the book is well researched and it is clear that Newcastle Library has been graced by a visit or! two as the Newcastle Journal archives have been extensivel! y trawled. For example, \\"On the morning Gordon Sumner was born the weather broke in a shawl of rain.\\" Sting comes out of the book with great credit, and as something of a conundrum - the shy man for example, who thinks nothing of performing in front of 200,000 people but quakes at the thought of playing to a few hundred. A perfectionist who toils late into the night mixing tracks or choregraphing shows, but who shows his accountant a picture in Country Life whilst walking on the beach and says \\"I want this house\\". Sandford also recognises that Sting, despite being is a star of huge proportions - selling out concerts from Croatia to Hong Kong - is also a journeyman, happily dueting with rapper Puff Daddy, trading licks with his peers at the Montserrat benefit, playing guitar for crooner Julio Inglesias, or donning a bootlace tie and adopting &quot;Maverick&quot; mode to play at the Country Music Awards. In short, the book is bang up to date, and is without questio! n, the best biography written to date on Sting."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"Upon completion of this book, I put it down, and made a silent, futile wish that the time I wasted reading it might somehow be returned to me. It was informative in some respects, such as shedding a little light on Sting's background and the rise of the Police. But I found myself slogging through all too many paragraphs which were full of editorial comment about Sting's psyche. And let me say, there were more than enough of these paragraphs to skip over time and time again, until the book became an amazingly fast read. Granted, I am interested in learning more about Sting, the individual, which was why I bought the book. But I could really do without the author's consistently negative opinions of his chosen subject. This book contains 25% fact, 25% interviews from people who may or may not even know Sting, and 50% editorial comment and snidely worded jabs from the author. So even though it SAYS &quot;Biography,&quot; it's more like 352 pages of unadulterated cr*p. I should have listened to the man himself, when he said &quot;Go over everything in my C.V. - you'll still know nothing 'bout me.&quot; Then I wouldn't have squandered my money - and my time! - on this most unsatisfactory book."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"Let me put it this way: If you thought THE SOUL CAGES was a bad album lyrically and musically, why oh why would you take the time to write a biography of the man who wrote the album? DEMOLITION MAN is useful in many respects, but the one thing I couldn't escape was that Christopher Sanford cannot praise Sting without adding in a criticism, and usually a pin-headed criticism at that. The above is a perfect example; CAGES was the most heartfelt, autobiographical album Sting has ever done, and Sandford TOTALLY slags it off. I'm sorry, but if you didn't like CAGES, you'll probably have trouble with Sting, and Sandford has a lot of trouble with Sting. He constantly criticizes him for being pretentious (musically and politically), writing bad songs and generally being a cad-- and yet, sometimes on the same page, he praises Sting unabshedly. Sometimes, when talking about politics, the praise and condemnation is on the exact same topic! I don't mean to say that only fans should write biographies; this book is good in many ways. It's a virtual how-to guide to being a wealthy pop star, and the business stories are really fascinating. The facts are also solid, and it's a good story. But you can't help noticing that Sandford really hates about half of Sting's music. It's one thing to be an independent observer, and quite another thing to take shots at someone for sport. Sting fans should buy this book, but they will be irritated by it. Oh, and also, the prose style is utterly insufferable."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"After reading this book, I feel that I have gained additional insight into Sting's life and, in that respect, don't consider the effort spent with this book a waste of my time. However, I feel that any additional time invested in reading it a second time WOULD be a waste.Mr Sandford spends too much time editorializing on his thoughts and beliefs about the man and not enough telling the story. He has his own perceptions of Sting and, instead of those perceptions merely coloring his prose, they completely overshadow the story being told.One factual error - Mr Sandford states that Sting was the culprit behind Henri Padovani's departure from The Police once Andy Summers had been tapped for guitarist duties. Message In A Box (even Sandford states that Sting had no part of this box set release) contains an essay written by Mr. Summers himself where he specifically states that HE, Andy, was the one that laid down the ultimatum that he was the guitarist-of-record for the Police and that Henri had to go. The Police played ONE gig as a quartet and Andy told Sting and Stewart that there would not be a second with Henri. Sting and his 'overwhelming self-important ego' were NOT the reason Henri left The Police.That error alone makes me discount many other statements made by Mr. Sandford. Demolition Man is worth one (and ONLY one) read, but remember to bring a grain of salt with you when you do because, in this case, you definitely can't believe everything you read."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"The book is heavy. It's about 400 pages and tells you everything about him, you almost think you'll learn what his favorite food is. Most of the complaints about the writer are angry concerning how he puts Sting down or critiques his music. They are not about the quality of the writing. I think rather than a fan write a glory book that makes him God, this approach is better; it's neutral. When Sting has accomplished good he is praised by the author and when he's in a slump the author hits him hard as though &quot;he could have done much better&quot;. I loved the book because it tells you how he rises from the slums to the mansions the way it happened. I wished I had a dictionary at times as the writer uses very descriptive upper English, but you realize it couldn't be done any other way since Sting is also a former English teacher and intensely literate. What I got out of it was a look at how Sting came to be what he is and how he has continued it beyond The Police."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"When I first purchased this book I was really excited because Ihad never read a Sting biography before. As I ventured into the lifeof Sting through the words of Christopher Sanford, I began to wanna vomit with disappointment. For six years, I have been a devoted Sting fan and Mr. Sanford's words felt to me as if he was bashing Sting throughout the book. I do not recommend this book if you love Sting. Mr. Sanford makes Sting out to be an egomaniac catastrophe that has turned the rock and roll generation into a bottomless pit of narcissism. I was very dissspointed and could not even finish the book. I was sick to my stomach! The end."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"Sting can truly be called a 20th Century Rennaisance Man which this thorough and well-researched book points out several times. Full of facts and anecdotes about a fascinating and multi-talented man. It is a book, not just about Sting, but about the music and entertainment business in the 70s, 80s and 90s. It is a book well worth returning to again and again."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"I could barely finish the introduction without putting it down completely. There was no way I would read such verbose writing - the writer is in love with his own text, making the book almost unreadable. I decided to skim through the book reading a few bits here and there, but I don't think I'll get far (I just started it and felt so strongly I had to write this immediately)."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"I have not purchased this worthless piece of trash, but I have read it. First of all, it is unauthorized, which usually mean that certain sources will not be available to the auther, such as the person they are writing about! Secondly, the writing is dismal, and rather like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. I gave it one star because there was no lower rating.If you are a Sting fan, or curious, I would highly recommend &quot;Broken Music,&quot; Sting's autobiography. It is beautifully written, and painfully honest."},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"First, a confession--I'm a Sting fan for several years, and a die-hard one at that. As much as I love his work with the Police and his solo material, I also know he isn't infallable--there are several instances where a different path might have reaped larger artistic dividends.Still, this is a hard read. It's interesting from a factual standpoint, as I learned a number of things about Sting that twenty years of fandom had failed to impress upon me. But the way Sanford writes is just so darn annoying that it approaches worthlessness at times. At times he's insightful, and you're pleased at how much sense his views make.

And its with sincere regret that after much careful 'investigation' - talking to 100 or so people (no less) about Sting* (*his music)- The 'facts' are as follows:Having read some first-hand 'evidence' of Stings childhood , ie. \\"A Sting In The Tale\\" by James Berryman (a better book- highly recommended) \\"Chris\\" (Mr. Sandford) falls short of delivering any unbiased information, however well informed by the Tabliod sheets (see back pages for actual references) and therefore, in no uncertain terms, makes himself 'look' (and I say look as I'd never intend to bias my reader) like a self-congratulating hypocrite. Indeed if I read about it in a Tabloid- i'm sure it would be true.Chris, my dear friend, you were once a journalist now you are little more than a 'pretentious git' in my eyes... at least Sting has the sense of humour to appreciate that some people will always see him that way for whatever reasons.You however - don't.\\"ah, thank you kindly &lt;bow>well if you're still interested - just don't believe all the stuff he sprouts!"},{"Title":"Sting: Demolition Man","review":"Mr. Sandford gives an insightful look into Mr. Sting.

Told exclusively from the viewpoint of Baron Scarpia, chief of police, this extraordinarily elegant tale recounts the consequences of people who are driven to go to far: people who cross the line, step over the threshold, give way to dark passions that might be better served if held in check. Although Floria Tosca is an erotic tale of sadist and masochist, Capriolo's rendering is so perfect we cannot fail to be amazed at the balance she strikes between love and hate, abstinence and desire, pleasure and pain. Everything about this book is perfect: the characterizations, the pacing, the restrained melodrama, and most especially, Capriolo's elegantly archaic prose. She writes in such a way that we can't help but believe we are truly reading the words of Scarpia, himself, words he set down in his own hand on a mid-summer's night in 1860s Rome. The fact that Cavarodossi never appears &quot;onstage&quot; is a credit to Capriolo, for he is never missed. It is the erotically passionate interplay between Tosca and Scarpia that forms the real heart and soul of this story. Opera lovers can't fail to fall in love with Floria Tosca. And even those who've never seen an opera will be astonished at the eloquence of Capriolo's style. If I had to sum this book up in only one word, the only word I could choose would be, perfection."},{"Title":"Floria","review":"Would that Puccini had based his opera on Paola Capriolo's brilliant rendering of the Tosca story rather than on Sardou's Grand Guignol melodrama! Even in the opera, though Cavaradossi has the most beautiful arias, he is a nonentity compared with Scarpia and Tosca -- imagine him completely off-stage, as he is in &quot;Floria Tosca,&quot; take that grinding, inexorable crescendo of horror in the second act music and hear it in Scarpia's &quot;Paradise,&quot; and enter the tortured mind of that brilliant villain as he pursues not Cavaradossi or Angelotti, but the Madonna/whore he sees in Tosca. Capriolo has perfectly captured the language, tone, and philosophies of time of Napoleon, and Liz Heron's translation rings beautifully true."},{"Title":"Floria","review":"Warning: Capriolo's &quot;Tosca&quot; performs open heart surgery on melodrama, pulls back the scrim, dries the blurry tears of sentiment, to show that the core appeal of Puccini's opera is to the death-wish. The author must have composed the novella with her ear on Callas and her eye on Nietzsche and Freud. This is a diabolically beautiful novella, which can be read in about the time it takes to listen to the final act of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; -- but read preferably by candlelight."},{"Title":"Floria","review":"Baron Scarpia is not the only evildoer in this story - Tosca is not much holier.

Bodecker, and charmingly illustrated in black-and-white ink drawings by his friend Erik Blegvad, this little book is a tiny overlooked jewel.The story follows a beetle and his new community of ladybugs, crickets, ants, moths, caterpillars, and other insects as they repair the damage done to their cozy community of mushroom houses by litter dumped in their little corner of the woods. It's a hopeful, none-too-serious tale about recycling and making the best of a bad thing.A great read-aloud for kids aged 4 and up, and a good short read for ages 7 and up.

I love Blegvad's illustrations, and the story is neither too long nor too short. It's about the same length and of a similar inspirational quality as \\"Elsie Piddock skips in her sleep\\".

These people come from all walks of life and backgrounds. Dr. Ettner gives the reader a chance to see that transgendered individuals are people - just like anyone else. An important thing to remember - we all are different and that is okay. I couldn't recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Gender Defender : A Psychologist's Reflections on Life Among the Transgendered","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book because it does not even mention autogynephilia much less distinguish between autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals.

So another used to cross dress fetishistically and be turned on by transseuxal pornography. So another is a distinguished electrical engineer, which is one of the most masculine occupations.

Her book patronises the transgendered and it is clear that she really thinks of them as suffering from a mental disorder. Her website promotes all sorts of psycho babble that is clearly not legitimate psychological counselling. It is as bogus as the church of scientology.

She pretends to be our advocate but calls us gender dysphoric and considers us diseased. She speaks of her relief that her own child did not show gender confusion.

(Autogynephilia is the eroticization of the idea of oneself as a woman.) Although it is true that lots of transsexuals deny autogynephilia, their stories are not convincing. (Yeah, I was a football-playing economist, but I hid my inner femininity inside.)

But you could just read fairy tales instead."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Gender Defender : A Psychologist's Reflections on Life Among the Transgendered","review":"Having recently come to the realization that I was seriously transgendered myself it was with a fresh viewpoint that I read this book. What I found in reading this work was something that truly touched my heart and soul. The descriptions,both through Dr. Ettner's and her patient's eyes, put into words the feelings and emotions that I have just started to come to grips with. Dr. Ettner shows the love and compassion that seem to be missing in so many of the books written about transgender people. Rather than filling the book with dry clinical terms and emotionless analysis of why these people are who they are she instead chose to show the depth of both her own feelings towards this group of people and the depth of the client's emotions as well. As a result, in the land of stodgy works that treat transgender people more as lab rats than people ,thus choking out all emotions or spiritual matters, this book reads like a breath of fresh air. Since emotions play such a big role in how someone with a gender identity issue lives their lives and sees themselves a book without them is missing a large part of the story. Some people might criticize the lack of &quot;scientific objectivity&quot; in this book; personally, I find that in eschewing this the book is much better at getting information to people than if it were full of clinical methodology and analysis.The book, due to its very nature, is an easy read and yet is so compelling due to the viewpoint and style of its author that I think most readers will find it hard to put down. The mix of sadness and joy that fill this book will touch the heart of almost any reader, whether transgendered or not. I will caution readers that if you get embarassed easily by crying in public don't read this book in a public place; I don't come to tears easily and I cried several times while reading this book.Overall this book does a big service in trying to describe what has been a very difficult and often shame filled subject and make it into just another facet of human expression and existence, with all the highs and lows and joy and sorrow that come along with any form of being human. It demystifies who transgender people are and helps others understand that they are just trying to find happiness and live the way they strongly feel they must. In addition to helping those who are not transgender understand better the book also helps those of us who find ourselves to be this way to better understand who we are and why we feel the way we do and that we are not alone.This book is the one book that I would recommend without hesitation to anyone either trying to come to grips with their own gender status or for those trying to understand others in this situation.

I picked up Randi Ettner's &quot;Confessions of a Gender Defender&quot; and read it in one night....... I simply couldn't put it down&quot;&quot;Randi's 'Confessions...' is not just another good read. Sure, its a page turner, powerfully written and full of humor. But it's more than that. 'Confessions of a Gender Defender' is a book:&quot;&quot;-About Sex. As Randi chronicles the unique lives of transexuals, we begin to understand that human beings, not freaks. We wonder. 'What is sexually normal anyway? Do only married 100% pure heterosexual men and women who have sex in the missionary position 1.5 times a week qualify? What about transexuals, transvestites, sado-masochists, dominants/submissives, gays, and people who have affairs? The number of people who qualify as sexually &quot;normal&quot; may be exceedingly small.' What a shocking thought.&quot;&quot;-About Dealing with Adversity. Until I read this book, I never realized the mental and physical agony transexuals endure. Randi describes their humiliation, ostracism, and mutilation: she also paints a picture of their heroism. People who initially attempt suicide end up standing up for themselves. People who hide out for years find the strength to risk their job, their, their marriage, and their family to be integrity with themselves. Their courage inspires me.&quot;&quot;-About Ourselves. 'Confessions' is not just about the unique behavior of transsexuals. It's about how we can better understand ourselves. On pp.99-100, Randi poses the question: 'Should we accept ourselves exactly as we think God made us -- or should we do whatever we need to do to be happy? If a transsexual needs hormones, surgery, electrolysis, or a new wardrobe to feel alive, instead of suicidal, is s/he wrong? If we need to get plastic surgery, leave our spouse, become bisexual, or have an affair to fully enjoy life are we wrong? Who are we to judge transsexuals? Who shall judge the judges?' &quot;&quot;Yes, you'll spend about three hours reading the book -- and at least three weeks fully digesting its message. It's well worth it. Confessions of a Gender Defender is required reading for anyone who seeks a Ph.D. in 'understanding life'.&quot;I couldn't agree more :"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Gender Defender : A Psychologist's Reflections on Life Among the Transgendered","review":"Gender dysphoria is the medical profession's term for the belief that one's gender does not align with one's biological sex.Those who cross the divide (from male to female or female to male) are called transsexuals or transgendered by many, but, sadly, are called freaks by some.Estimated at affecting 1 of 30,000 individuals, gender dysphoria is certainly not common, but neither is it unknown. Currently transsexuals are the staple of tv talk shows and Leno jokes, but these people are simply attempting to life within society on society's terms.Dr Randi Ettner is a psychologist who has devoted her life to counseling those with gender dysphoria, helping them to adjust to society's rigid rules when possible and, when not possible, helping them to cross the rigid barrier we call gender. She has written a sensitive, caring book about her experiences, humorous at times, heart breaking at others.Ettner's book is a wonderful antidote to the cruelty of talk tv, but, more importantly, will provide an important window on this condition that, unless addressed can easily result in mutilation, victimization or suicide.Kristin Hayward www.umeais.maine.edu/~hayward"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Gender Defender : A Psychologist's Reflections on Life Among the Transgendered","review":"Confessions of a Gender Defender - Dr. Ettner's first book - is an easy, quick read.

Not written to be a text book. I will say the freeform was certainly different, but had unique flow. I have a glimpse of what a gender therapist experiences from there perspective, and I am grateful for that. I cannot believe the negative reviews of one star JUST for not mentioning autogynaphilia, which has been well known for 20 years(OLD HAT). Randi mentions sexual motivation components in her books while stating that it is not productive to focus on them. She does not refer to autogynaphilia directly, because it has mostly been abandon as a \\"cause\\". Read Transgender Care as well, even better. She seems to take more the symptomatic approach. Bailey resurrects 20 YEAR OLD two type model ideas by Blanchard with some careful distortions. It is this two-type narrow scope that is controversial (aside from Baileys ethics). Randi Ettner IS aware of it (read her comments on the internet and you folks would know). So are members of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association, of which she is a member. What they are NOT doing is blowing something out of proportion that research indicates IS NOT the only cause or motivation for transsexualism. Do not let people like Bailey try to use Junk Science to label TS's as a sexual driven fetish, your rights will disappear much faster than you can imagine based on junk science and old festering inflamed phobic hysteria. The right has already jumped on the Bailey ban wagon because his non-scientific slanderous insensitive transphohic narrow attitudes align with theirs and they can't wait to get \\"scientific\\" credence for calling transsexuals sexual deviants so they can get on with thier well documented hateful attacks on transgendered people. THINK. Autogynaphilia exists and no one is trivializing TS's that have this motivational component. Junk Science like Baileys book promotes a narrow two type model and simply avoids FTM's. So many MTF TS's cannot be in \\"denial\\". If anything Baileys book has DIVIDED trans people, very much like the red and blue armband experiments. Autogynaphilia is NOT a catch all nor is it a characterization or a cause of transsexualism. It is also this reviewers OPINION that it is only a COMPLEX symptom of some TS's, perhaps many, but does NOT define the cause. Bailey, aside from being a simple hard head who seems to be educated beyond his own intelligence, subtly admits [to modern research] the cause has genetic or biological underpinnings while promoting autogynaphilia as a motivator and more a characteristic definition, very vague and surreptitious in his writing. He is quite obvious and arrogant when it comes to his books title and cover art for which he is steadfast unapologetic, in spite of his own supporters complaints/offense. Not to mention his degrading comments about what TS are qualified for. Look it up. Very sensitive indeed...NOT! Don't get caught up in this Bailey book, which seems to be designed from the beginning to cause controversy and divide. Please read Baileys position on eugenics.

Few people are aware today but mine warfare, both on land and in the water, saw great advancement, mostly in the hands of the Confederates as mines are primarily a defensive weapon. Charleston saw considerable use of mines to keep Union soldiers at bay and landmines made the assault of some rebel forts almost prohibitively expensive. Offensive mines (spar torpedos) encouraged the development of submarines, torpedo boats and destroyers. Unfortunately for the Confederates they were never able to effectively use this slight technological advantage to defeat the Union."},{"Title":"Infernal MacHines","review":"This is a beautiful little book on a little known subject, Confederate submarine and mine warfare. Here we read discussions and see little known drawings of some absolutely remarkable contraptions including mines the likes of which destroyed the Union warship, \\"Cairo\\", on the Yazoo river. At the end of the book is a table, tabulating all the Union warships damaged and sunk by Confederate 'torpedos' [in fact, mines]. There are a total of 43, an incredible number, and most of these were significant ships that sunk.We also read the description of the first sucessful submarine in world history, the 'Hunley' and how heroic crews volunteered to service the dangerous vessels. All of her crews died but not before sinking the Union Battleship 'Housatonic.'There is also a discussion of one of the most 'infernal' machines of all. It was a bomb made up to look like a lump of coal. Most ships of the time were steamships operating on coal power. One lump of this stuff into the boiler room and the whole thing blows up...and the ship goes down. One of the greatest losses of lives during the war [actually just after the war] was possibly due ot one of these devices. A paddlewheeler taking thousands of Union troops and Union ex-POWs blew up unexpectedly, taking hundreds down with her.It's fascinating to think that a nation--any nation, really--with its back against the wall, can really become innovative...more innovative than the more powerful enemy has to be.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Pop, Your\\" Poifect\\"!:AThree Stooges Salute to Dad","review":"This was a cute little present I recently got for my birthday.

The book I read wasn't exactly the book that I thought I had bought. The subtitle, \\"How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea\\" gives a pretty good clue, though. There are essentially two parts to this book. The first is the story of a woman who experiences a mid-life crisis at work and in relationships, and goes forth to seek true happiness. The second is the story of this same woman looking for that happiness in buying a boat and going to sea. I had thought the book was really more the latter, but the story turns out to be more the former.THE CURE FOR ANYTHING IS SALT WATER is competently written, as one should expect from a former book editor. The book is interesting, and the story told without artifice. When Mary South tells of her sudden, almost irrational interest in boats while living well inland in Pennsylvania, her experience will strike a chord with every boatstruck reader. But South's book is not likely to meet the needs of the boat or sailing enthusiast. It's not that she doesn't take her newfound interest seriously--nobody who quits her job and sells her house to buy a boat should be regarded as simply a dilettante (even if she doesn't take traditional methods of navigation seriously)--it's just that she doesn't write about boating with much passion beyond her love for her particular boat. What should be the centerpiece of the book, her voyage up the Eastern Seaboard, is reduced to a series of good days, bad weather, mishaps, bars, and some occasional local color. When it comes to boating, her prose fails to capture the poetry of the experience.The reader learns that the real point of this book is to describe Mary South's midlife crisis, in particular, her losing interest in her career as a book editor and her being troubled by a lack of permanence in her intimate relationships. This in itself might be the clay from which a story might be shaped, but the effort falls short, clodlike. South, despite her humorous turns, tends towards the ad hominem comment: \\"My boss was a micromanager with an imagination that was significantly smaller than the stick up her butt\\" (p. 5). A Christian school administrator of the boating school South attends makes her wonder \\"what kind of crackpot school I had committed myself to\\"; this is followed by a rather poor joke on theodicy (p. 35). A boating classmate is described as a very intelligent guy \\"though a smart Republican is an oxymoronic concept to me\\" (p. 56). When an elderly couple out rowing express concern for the author's dogs, they are disdainfully dismissed as \\"Biff\\" and \\"Muffy\\" (p. 176). South's tendency towards personal attack, combined with her refrain of seeking isolation on her boat, leads one to think she's a misanthrope. But here's the thing: I don't think she is; she just gravitates to ridicule as a literary tool of humor. However you slice it, though, it's not very appealing.In the last part of the book, South, who describes herself as a lesbian, discusses her surprising affair with a man. Her boat at this point is but a piece of inconvenient furniture. You may, like me, find yourself at this point happy that your voyage with South is nearly over."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"This book is a testimonial to the concept that we can create our own possibilities. If you are looking for the confidence to pursue your own dream, The Cure for Anything provides one ordinary woman's account of how to pursue the extraordinary.In addition to being inspirational, the book is extremely witty (it made me laugh out loud a couple of times)and filled with interesting tidbits and true gems of wisdom. And along with all the troubles and trevails at sea that Ms. South shares with us is a love story with all the twists and turns that only real life can hold.This has become one of my favourite books of all time."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"I enjoyed Mary's story VERY much. I was surprised to learn she had been a book editor because I was distracted in the beginning chapters by many sentence fragments and run-on \\"sentences\\". I learned it was bad form, if not poor grammar to begin a sentence with the word \\"And\\". I was also confused at some points while trying to follow the story line: Mary skipped the family Thanksgiving for a warm weather trip South...but later in the story, she claims to have visited her aging grandmother in upstate New York over that same Thanksgiving? Maybe I'm reading too literally. I greatly admire her spirit of adventure and her courage in sharing her emotional life with us. I'm left wondering, though: what if Lars had invited her to sail to Europe? Would she have accepted that challenge/invitation?"},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"I continue to find that first time novelist are the best and Mary South is no exception. She is an excellent writer with a compelling story to share with us all. I could see myself having a similar adventure and laughed along with her. A good read."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"On the surface, The Cure For Anything Is Salt Water is about a fantastic voyage, fraught with risk and full of excitement. But for me, it was really about trying to make sense of your life so far, especially when it comes to love. By sharing her own true stories of childhood, family, relationships and work -- interspersed with Perfect Storm-like adventure -- Mary South makes you think about your own emotional life and try to find peace with the journey so far. Whether you are an aspiring mariner, a hopeless romantic or a wandering soul, Salt Water is a funny, heartfelt book that will help you find your own inner compass."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"Ms. South has a true knack not only for words, but also for conveying the everyday unspoken feelings we all have. Her frankness is inviting and comfortable. I am a sailor, so enjoyed the nautical undercurrent to the book. However, knowledge of the sea is no prerequsite to thoroughly enjoying this little book. I devoured it in three short nights and I predict you will also. GREAT WORK \\"Mare!\\""},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"Be sure to have plenty of time when you start reading this book because you won't want to put it down! Ms South writes in such a way that you can picture what she is writing as if you were standing next to her experiencing what she did. If you've ever had a dream of living a different life you can live that dream vicariously through this book. I would recommend this book to everyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"Whilst not being quite your average 'going to sea' tale, Mary South has written an engaging story of her staid but not quite straight life on land, decision to leave the steady shores for a life afloat; and the trials and tribulations of learning to handle a powered vessel at sea.As she moves through new passages in her life and works at becoming a competent mariner, she reflects on her inability to manage relationships on land.

It's the good habit of always asking yourself the right questions in the right order and answering them thoughtfully.\\" - Mary SouthEvery woman, at some point or another, considers the possibility of doing a complete overhaul on her life. The idea of pursuing something more adventurous and less predictable than regular carpools and office casual Fridays can be both riveting and relieving. But with age often comes complacency, and there is a human tendency to accept and settle into the comfortable and the commonplace. This is exactly why Mary South's book, The CURE for ANYTHING is SALT WATER is so inspiring and jaw-dropping for the audacity of her decisions.Mary is a successful forty-year-old woman with a significant career in publishing and an impressive home in Pennsylvania. By all accounts she is living the great American Dream. However, South feels there is something missing in her life and she musters the courage to go out and find it - at sea. She revamps her life by quitting her prestigious job as an editor, selling her secure house and embarking into the unknown; and hence, an amazing adventure begins.South heads to Florida to spend nine weeks (and $6,000) in seamanship school and when she encounters her first set back (she fails her mid-term exam) she stoically renews her determination and completes the course. She purchases a 40 foot, 30 ton steel trawler christened the Bossanova and starts her journey along the eastern Atlantic seaboard with her two Jack Russell terriers and her friend, John.The story is about finding meaning in life and relinquishing the \\"tried and true\\" for the romance of unknown. South encounters many unexpected adventures, even a heterosexual encounter; South is for a confirmed lesbian. Well-written, honest and engaging; the account proves that any woman has the capacity to be, \\"The master of her fate and the captain of her ship.\\""},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"Overall this is a very good read and allows people who might be interested in purchasing a boat some courage and some direction on how do it."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"What happens when a 40-ish book publisher chucks her career, buys a 40-foot 3-ton steel trawler, and takes to the sea?

She did not read the synopsis at all. I read a lot of different kinds of books so I figured this would have some value. The story actually is very well written. The adventure was not all that adventurous but I did learn a little about trawlers. I really did not care for the interjections about her personal life, but not because she is gay. I found her, personally, to be whiney and quite full of herself. Maybe it's normal for East-coasters to be rather snobby. She certainly sounds like someone I would rather avoid. She drinks way too much and I think instead of salt water she may want to try plain water. Jeesh! More boat, less Mary. I wonder if she even goes out in her boat any more."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"as a sailor who sails with sails and our whole family does it was still a very fun book to read and know that some of the things she had to do were very hard and sometimes scary and ver dangerous....but she did them and that is something she will carry all the rest of her life."},{"Title":"The Cure for Anything is Salt Water - How I Threw My Life Overboard and Found Happiness at Sea","review":"This was a terrific book on many levels and while Iwould not hesitate to recommend it, parts offended me.Why was it necessary to contaminate its freshness withyour politics?

I have extensive experience with word so I didn't learn much from the material in this book.The target audience of this book is the individual who knows very little about computing in general or has never seen a Word Processor.

The protagonist is a cardboard cutout, the lone Good American among hordes of Nasty Americans who have not achieved his level of enlightenment. The Afghans, Iranians, et al whom he meets on his travels could all be interchangeable, and everyone spends far too much time yammering self-rightous screeds and not actually doing anything.The sad thing is that with the settings and time period, this novel could have been fascinating. But the author has taken golden material and turned it into junk - reverse alchemy, if you will. I'm sure that this book was fascinating to live, but unfortunately that fascination was not translated onto the printed page. Don't waste your time.One star."},{"Title":"Looking for the Summer","review":"American David Thompson is a Vietnam War conscientious objector. After spending a year in military prison, during which time he became estranged from his family, he travels around Europe, not really sure where he's going or what he's doing. In Paris, he meets a man named Hasan, who encourages David to accompany him back to Iran, his homeland. David is assured that plenty of jobs for foreigners are available. Their paths diverge for a while, and they meet up again a few weeks later, and undertake a harrowing journey to Iran by way of southeast Europe and Turkey.The mountains of southeast Turkey are full of the sort of people who shoot first and don't bother with asking questions later. The two pass many disabled vehicles along the way, but don't even think of stopping; the philosophy is &quot;every man for himself.&quot; They eventually reach Teheran, the Iranian capital. It's a dirty, noisy, congested place, like a city that's grown up too quickly. They continue to Mashad, Hasan's hometown, a much cleaner and nicer place.David is invited to a meeting of an informal group of young people to discuss political philosophy; they have heard about his political rebellion. It's during the reign of the Shah, whose secret police, the SAVAK, are everywhere, so many precautions are needed. A few days later, the leaders of the group are arrested, and David is told to leave Iran immediately. He continues on to Afghanistan.While there, he meets some Westerners who are more interested in drugs than in getting a different perspective of the world around them. He is told that he must continue on to India, to experience it first hand. Emotionally, it will hit him harder than anything in his life, but it's something he must do. Throughout his whole trip, and expecially in India, he experiences great kindness from total strangers. He also witnesses poverty and misery on a scale inconceivable to the average American.This book is short, but it works on several levels. It's a good travel story, it's a good political and personal philosophy story, and it's a fine tale of an average person looking for his place in the world. It's well worth reading."},{"Title":"Mask of Passion","review":"Plot Synopsis: \\"Danica Morgan had fashioned her own success. First as a top model, then -- secretly -- as a best-selling novelist. She had had enough of the limeliight. She swore she would have nothing to do with Bay Spencer. She would not take the leading role in his movie. She would not be a star. And she would not be one of the women he used so casually and cast aside so brutally.\\"But from the moment he appeared at her isolated Oregon beach house, his blue eyes flashing fire and ice, her resolve began to weaken. And before she knew it, she had walked into his trap. She loved him! Had she hidden for so long behind a mask of indifference only to be deceived by a man who wore a mask of passion -- who would go to any lengths, determined to have his way?\\"I picked this one up because I've been going through Kay Hooper's back catalog. This, like many of her earlier works, is a category romance. Many of her earlier stories hold up well to the test of time; they are charming, whimsical, fun little reads. This, however, is not one of them.\\"Mask of Passion\\" is straight along the guidelines for early 80's romance. Lots of passion and intensity, both good and bad, and very little of anything that I would describe as \\"love.\\" There is almost-forced sex (\\"overcome by passion\\" -- bah), and lots of jealousy and misunderstanding. It's not -bad-, but it is dated, and for anyone, like me, that has been raised on more modern sensibilities, it's a little tough to take.A lot of Hooper's early works are worth picking up. Along the lines of her recent trio of reprints, \\"Enchanted,\\" many of them are amusing reads worth a lazy summer afternoon. This one, though, isn't really worth the money you'll pay for it."},{"Title":"Mask of Passion","review":"Kay Hooper writes a story about a beautiful young model, whose disillusionment and reluctance in the modeling world has been transferred to a novel she wrote which echoes her life. This puts her in the path of a director when the movie rights of her novel are sold. Unbeknowst that he is seeking the actual author of the original script (i.e book), the director (forgotten name) attempts to persuade Danni to play the lead female role. Danni shies away from this, not wanting to be in the limelight and aware of the similarities between her and female lead that she based on herself could be identified to others and expose her as the secret author. Cynical about females, due to his mother's behaviour, this director wrongs every which way when it comes to dealing with Danni. Reknowned for her \\"innocent eyes\\", Danni is a recluse - she is enigmatic and does not show her feelings - thus the \\"mask\\". She falls in love with the director but many misunderstandings separate the pair when the director fights his attraction to her fiercely and cruel in his treatment, he does not believe Danni is as innocent as she acts and looks. Believed that he is played for a fool and skeptical of her male friendships, he cruelly sets aside Danni. Driven out of control, he tries to force himself on her, despite her pleas in a near-rape attempt, leaving her with bruises and abused emotions. This particular scene was very ugly and damaging to the male's character. It is believed that the author's creation to \\"hurt\\" the female lead was waay overdone and distasteful. It smacked of Diana Palmer's style of writing: \\"Absolute ruthlessness/cruelty when ripped away leaves absolute tenderness\\" - in her male protaganists. It is hard to see why Danni would love this brutish male after he scared her and the happily ever after is too contrived to be true. However, for those who like Diana Palmer novels (as I do, for the most part) this is another \\"good\\" read."},{"Title":"Rizpah","review":"\\"And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah...\\" II Samuel 3:7 the story is fictional with a Biblical setting.

Personally, I like the \\"discussion-based\\" approach of this course. I'm new to memory-improvement courses, so everything here seemed novel and intruiging to me. However, the voice acting is sooo bad...you might just starting counting the times they ~don't~ use a contraction, the corny chuckling, the way one voice actor uses the same expressions over and over...the way they 'almost' seem to have a natural dialog going on...except that they really, really don't.So, if you're willing to put up with the voice acting, and you're interesting in memory-improvement techniques...this seems like a reasonable choice. Personally, I was interested in this particular course because Paul Scheele was involved with it, and I've been impressed with his work before; it's a shame he played such a minor role in this course (from what I can tell, anyhow). I'll probably keep looking for something better...and you may want to do the same."},{"Title":"Memory Optimizer Self Study Course (10 CD Set)","review":"The discussion on the CDs is about the theory and practice of this approach to memory development.

Archy McNally is the Son in McNally and Sons, Attorneys At Law. Not a lawyer, not really a detective, more of a bon vivant who dabbles in crime. The stories (7 to date) take place in Palm Beach, FL and expose us to the upper class life style there. You can at least learn about wines and clothes and fancy food. There are a continuing cast of characters in addition to Archy and some crime. Here the crime is the murder of an elderly parrot shop owner.

It's one of several in a series of mysteries featuring protagonist Archy McNally, the \\"son\\" in the law firm of McNally & Son, who looks after the investigative chores of the firm.In this story, one of his father's clients, Hiram Gottschalk, the owner of a pet parrot store, requests an investigation be made as he feels someone is trying to kill him. The evidence - a picture of he and his deceased wife is destroyed, his favorite record is broken, his pet mynah bird is found strangled - is not something he can take to the police, especially since it's apparent the person doing this is either a family member or store employee.Before Archy can reach any definite conclusions, Gottschalk is found dead, stabbed through the eyes with a stiletto. Digging deeper, Archy finds odd things going on at the pet store, and a net search for info about endangered parrots results in the firm's computer system getting hacked.Sanders, a veteran crime writer, weaves a good yarn, and Archy's unique manner of expressing himself (\\"leaving me with my flabber totally gasted\\", \\"plussed I was non\\") injects chuckles throughout the tale.I did find a few holes, some items that I can only assume were meant to be red herrings, but were never explained at the end, which indicates some weakness in the plotting. I might have found that more annoying, but because I am such parrot lover, I find it difficult to dislike any mystery story that involves a parrot. I tend to cut such stories more slack than I would stories with similar flaws that do not involve parrots.Even with those flaws, it still makes for an enjoyable read, whether you're a mystery buff or a parrot lover - or even better, if you're both!Would I buy another McNally novel? Probably not. Would I recommend this one to a casual mystery reader? Yes I would."},{"Title":"McNally's Puzzle (Archy McNally)","review":"I am reviewing this from the perspective of having heard it as a book-on-tape.Archy McNally, the self-proclaimed 'Bon vivant' narrates an odd story that is made all the more odd by his continual need to turn a clever expression - nearly in every sentence! It gets to the point where it is distracting! The characters are pretty two-dimensional. Some seem like they were stolen right out of a high school production of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" - stereotypes of what we might suspect the rich and famous might be like. Heck, the only rich guy I liked in the book was killed! (on the other hand, I liked the cop and the dog.)If it were not for the absolutely great voice work of Boyd Gaines it probably would not have been palatable for me. If I could give a seperate star for voice work,his would be a 5."},{"Title":"McNally's Puzzle (Archy McNally)","review":"This is an Archy McNally murder mystery. It follows Archy's investigation of threats to Hiram Gottschalk, one of his father's Palm Beach legal clients.

Archy works on his investigation mainly by wining and dining the suspects at parties and clubs, and manages to discover who is behind Gottshalk's eventual murder without working up a sweat.Archy's character, with his unrelenting focus on fashion and the finer things of life, makes the book rather amusing. However, the story isn't entirely believable, since Archy, is of course, able to dictate to the bad guys where and when he will confront them. These weaknesses aside, the book makes an enjoyable light read."},{"Title":"McNally's Puzzle (Archy McNally)","review":"I say substandard only because Lawrence Sanders' standards are very high. This caper involving the death of a bird shop owner is not terribly intriguing. Too much effort is made to describe gourmet meals, and not enough crime drama is presented in this tale. Silly Binky Watrous gets a girlfriend and a new career entertaining geriatrics, while Archy deals with airhead twins, a pothead son, and a very shady pet shop manager. I found this the most burdensome of several McNally books to read."},{"Title":"McNally's Puzzle (Archy McNally)","review":"Usually I know why a book keeps me reading; I know exactly what the capture cons are. In the case of McNALLY's PUZZLE, I kept reading with my own puzzle to saw with a jig. It had something to do with a jazzy writing rhythm and with the tightly focused, First-person-Narrative pushing Archy's socially elite slang.I found myself wondering where I'd left my dictionary; didn't want to lose the frequent opportunities to learn new words. Yet, I realized that some of the expressions Archy chewed and spewed with polished abandon were not only beyond my repertoire, they wouldn't be found in a published \\"literary academy\\" of American English. Whom does one approach for information on colloquialisms and slang which slip-slides around in socially superior swamps causing nose-in-the air neck kinks?The book continued to draw me in, in spite of the mild irritation at Archy's dynamically driven dialogue and sensual soliloquy, doused with words I somewhat grasped in context, phrases which nudged me forward as I felt I should stop reading to research, and really digest every nuance of prose ... maybe that's part of the draw. Sanders does have a knack for creating a cajoling rhythm which carries me along, whispering to let go of whiffs of undone details as I fancy forward, wondering what Archy will say and do next.I'm in Archy's mind, even if it is a dramatic dichotomy to my own sloppy thoughts. Archy, even if his speaking patterns irritate me, is feisty-foot-dragging fun to be with.McNALLY'S PUZZLE is my first taste of this Lawrence Sanders series. I was initially brought to it by readers' complaints about Archy's obsession with food, and Lawrence's including every tasty bite in the plot. In fiction I seek stimulation of the senses, though most often my moods prefer to go beyond and before the abundantly available ploys of the shock syndrome, and gregariously graphic sex. What else is there but solitary, tongue-in-teeth tangos with the manna of the gods? Well, yeah, there are mountains and streams, street lamps and bed springs ... these are a few of my favorite things ... huh?For me, the statement, \\"Archy bites off a big piece of bread,\\" might work up a hint of saliva. That's what I usually get in a work of food fiction, when I'm lucky. But, the descriptive luxury of, \\"His teeth sink into the delicate texture of a soft, yeasty, French baguette, edged by the crunch of a crusty cover,\\" could get a stomach growl out of a full balloon. That's how I write the description of taking a bite of bread. I could use much more of that brand of sensual prose in my escape fiction (in my reading of it, that is; my writing's usually saturated with appeals to the senses). Yet, I'm not puzzled about the natural tendency of some readers to have their tongues in their toes (shoes), wanting to go get ON with the fancy footwork.It is the rhythm of the syntax, though; it is. And the tight focus on Archy. That is what kept me reading long enough to get beyond my minimal irritation at the pondering push of the word dance.Once the rhythm had me going, and going, and picking up the book each time I had the time to read, I began being led by the nose, as well as the tongue, into the mystery developing with the precise timing of a master at a modern dance studio.Then the pace picked up slightly, plateau-ed, picked up a little more, and so on, to a perfect conclusion. That's all I'll say about that, not wanting to sing the secrets, or sling them around.Sanders exposed true confidence as an author in the pacing pauses of Archy's daily routines in this novel and especially in the succinct, crisp style of the picked up dance of denouement. I laughed out loud in cheering glee several times during the final five chapters. Archy's father's heated question to a brouhaha which brought him out of his night sanctuary was classic, heart-healing humor.Okay. I see why Archy lives on and on, even though Sanders now has wings and flies with exotic birds of paradise, bless his heart and soul.Still have another puzzle, though. My copy of this novel, an early version hardback, has the jacket with a gorgeously glamorous, multi-colored parrot glossed against a bright yellow sun. During one of my first few reading surges, I had stopped for a solitary lunch at a fun caf&eacute; near a boss bookstore, in Hotchkiss, Colorado. Lifting spectacles up on my nose, I noticed that the decor at my booth included a large, fashionably-framed print of a parrot, a twin to the one on my book jacket. In fact, the restaurant was plush with parrot paraphernalia, parroting the swampy mystique of Palm Beach, sister to New Orleans in oozing mysterious muchies. Was this an omen of some sort? A message from the miasma of muses meandering off Florida's Gold Coast? Splash!Okay. No puzzle. Synchronicity. Jung.Thanks, Sanders, for the satisfyingly snippy side-trip to Florida. I really don't know if I like your style, exactly, yet it's puzzlingly appealing. I have a feeling I'll one day be able to honestly say, \\"I do like your style!\\" Already, I admire and enjoy it. And, I like your subtle development of Archy, all the way through the book, especially the warm, simple, real way you enhanced the exchanges between Archy and his new Terrier, Hobo. Love the way this spirited canine was brought into the family.I'll be back! Bank on it. I won't spit in the eye of the parrot who feeds my soul!I'll bow to a master and say thanks,Linda G.

I enjoyed several of his picks like k.d.lang, Divine, Grace Jones, Alain Delon, Madonna, etc. I highly disagreed with his picks of Jeffrey Dahmer, Francis Farmer, Roger Moore, and Liberace. Some of his picks are meant to be controversial, and they are. This is just one of a series of books put out about 20th Century Icons.

Probably my favorite--maybe partly because it's the first of his I read. It's a pivotal novel in De Vries's oeuvre. Coming out around 1965, the book is a gallant attempt at an amalgamation of his straight comic stuff (See Comfort Me With Apples and The Tunnel of Love) and his newfound darker black humor/gallows humor bent (that would see ultimate fruition in books like The Vale of Laughter and The Cat's Pajamas & Witch's Milk).There are two protagonists in Let Me Count the Ways: Stan Waltz, father, atheist and blue collar type with intellectual pretensions (something De Vries's nails precisely), whose wife is a meat and potatoes religious fundamentalists, and who narrates the first half of the book; and Tom Waltz, the son, an authentic intellectual type who is professor at the local university, whose character reflects the unresolved issues he has choosing between his father and his mother, who narrates the second half.It's a great novel, original, even unique, with wonderful set pieces, such as the funeral procession that goes awry, the fireworks factory holocaust that results in religious conversion of a sort, the capture and arrest of a husband for peeping on his wife as she undresses before bed, a man whose broken leg in a cast maneuvering to get food and drink in his boarding house room, which is forbidden, without his landlady/concierge finding out. Not to mention the great Xmas hymn/ballad, \\"Christmas in the Whorehouse\\".Unlike in his earlier books, De Vries doesn't lightly dance his characters off the stage. The resolution is somber, slightly dark, more complicated, but witty and comically inventive nevertheless."},{"Title":"Principles and Guidelines in Software User Interface Design","review":"Good book.

I have used it for teaching HCI for several years now though not as a text book. One fault is that the lists of guidelines are endless.

I was looking for some good Catholic examples and advice on mothering, and for the most part that is what this book contained, but I still thought it was lacking. Each of the twelve chapters contains an essay written by a Catholic mother, with a brief description of her just before her essay beings. While interesting, not all of the chapters are particularly useful. One is just a short poem. And many of them have negative views or at least references to Vatican II, which, unlike the other reviewer, I did have a problem with. Most of the stories talked about the self-sacrifice of motherhood and the trial and tribulations of taking care of a number of children (all of these mothers had four or more children), which was somewhat depressing at times, but also inspiring. This book was delivered to me at just the right time, as my 18 month old was sick in the hospital for nearly a week, so it definitely helped me as I read it. The best story in there is \\"Shannon\\" which the editor admitted that it has been previously published before in numerous sources.Overall I feel a bit mixed about this book. I was let down, for some reason I was expecting more, but I am not sure what. I was bothered by some of the negative views of Vatican II. Mostly I feel that it could have been so much better, I hope that there will be a revised edition in the future with more modern stories to add additional wisdom, especially for the present times. I would really only recommend this book to those Catholic mothers who are isolated and are looking for good Catholic examples of real Catholic mothers and those who are going through hard family times, for any reasons."},{"Title":"The Art of Catholic Mothering: Twelve Catholic Mothers Speak about Motherhood, Child Rearing and the Faith","review":"I found it good (in the sense that it wasn't boring to read and kept me occupied) but depressing. Definitely too much focus on the struggles and not enough on the joys of a large family life.For those who complained about its \\"anti-VII bias\\"; the book was clearly marketed and targeted for a traditional Catholic audience. It was released through Angelus Press first. Its mission- clearly stated- was for moms who are trying to keep the traditional Catholic faith as opposed to the novelties of the last 40+ years. You may not agree with that, but that is who the book is targeted for and therefore it can't be said to be a flaw."},{"Title":"The Art of Catholic Mothering: Twelve Catholic Mothers Speak about Motherhood, Child Rearing and the Faith","review":"I read this book with my friends at our Mothers Group meetings.

It is a very easy read. Kind of like listening to a friend share valuable memories from their life. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Art of Catholic Mothering: Twelve Catholic Mothers Speak about Motherhood, Child Rearing and the Faith","review":"I saw quite a few reviews elsewhere about this book putting it down for it's heavy anti-Vatican II bias and preference for the Extraordinary Form. That didn't bother me a bit. I was looking for some traditional Catholic wisdom. There is one beautiful story in this book, \\"Shannon,\\" which is very moving and worth reading. On the whole, though, I have to confess that I found it rather depressing. It gave the impression that homeschooling is just too difficult for most Catholic families, so send the children to Catholic boarding school. And, the stories emphasized too much the heartaches and the trials of motherhood. I am aware that this is a Vale of Tears, but as a young mother just beginning, I hoped for something more encouraging and uplifting."},{"Title":"Amrica","review":"Kafka drives the reader crazy by this epic narration about the adventures of Karl, an adolescent sent to America at the beginning of XX century.

He is in charge of one of the numerous elevators and works almost sixteen hours a day just to be dismissed due to a new misunderstanding.At times hilariously, the novel crudely describes the situation of many Europeans who might have dreamed of America as an oasis to later realize they were just joined as a little part of an enormous and unspeakable machine."},{"Title":"Amrica","review":"Poor 16 year old Karl is send to America,because he has been seduced by a maid.Hardly a reward.

Relativism proclaims that there is no absolute moral truth, just differing opinions, all of which are equally valid. For example, Somalis cut off the women's clitoris before they reach puberty. They think it is right. In the west, we think it is wrong. A relativist will say that they are both right. Again, Law cites Robert Simon, a professor of philosophy, quoting despairingly of a student: 'Of course I dislike the Nazis', but who is to say they are morally wrong.'Law goes on to say: \\"Relativism, it's often argued, has also poisoned our homes. Parents no longer feel they have the right to force their own values on their children. Adults no longer confident in their own moral authority or the objectivity of their moral judgments are standing back and allowing their children to run amok.\\" In another passage he points out that in schools \\"...teachers reach for relativism to get them off the hook. That Jesus is true-for-Christians but false-for-muslims. Relativism saves educators from having to admit that any religion might actually mistaken, or even (heaven forbid) that they might be all mistaken.Law trenchantly observes: \`politically correct' arguments for relativism, while seductive, are muddle headed nonsense'.Law points out that debates about child education focus, erroneously, on only two alternatives: what he calls \\"Liberal\\" and \\"Authoritarian\\". The Authoritarian approach simply tells children what to think. Many religions are authoritarian for example. The Liberal approach is to guide children to question critically and think for themselves. (Personally, I would prefer him to use a term instead of \\"Liberal\\" that is not so politically loaded: \\"Free-thinker\\" perhaps?).Law says that there is a second dimension with two alternatives: \\"Relativist\\" and \\"Non-relativist\\". In many people's minds, Relativism is the automatic handmaiden to Liberalism. Law's insight is to point out that it ain't necessarily so: education can be BOTH Non-relativist AND Liberal. He arrives at this conclusion after meeting all possible objections and defusing them with a philosopher's clarity of logic. Stephen Law writes with admirable simplicity and his philosophical arguments are readily understood.Law, naturally enough, approaches his topic as a philosophical argument. In passing he mentions that some moral stances are found universally in just about every culture. That opens a very interesting subject: many moral fundamentals are hard-wired in the human species. One common one is \\"Thou shalt not kill\\". Just about every culture has this kind of moral position but, just as with the Hebrews, it was only supposed to apply to one's own tribe. It was quite acceptable to kill people from other tribes. After all, Moses had hardly descended from the mountain with the Tablets when he gave orders to \\"save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites...\\". But the same attitude is a found in all cultures to the extent that anthropologists call it a Universal Human Value. It is found in the San Bushman, Aborigine and any western country at war with an enemy. In other words nature programmed us with certain behaviors in order to function healthily in our local society.The idea that some moral values are hard-wired - and not the result of cultural conditioning - is a powerful one. In my book Deadly HarvestDeadly Harvest, I explain more on this fascinating subject and in particular how life on the savannas of east Africa programmed our instinctual behaviors for survival in a forager band of some 50 people. When we understand that, we understand much more about where we should be going with our children and society in general."},{"Title":"The War for Children's Minds","review":"Stephen Law has produced a fun read on a very controversial and serious topic. His arguments are solid in defense of liberal education. He tells how authoritarian education, in both theistic and atheistic forms, is bad for children. He tells how critical thinking does not lead to moral relativism, and gives a convincing case for the defense of critical thinking in schools.Law is a gem among philosophers in that he provides his lucid arguments in readable form, which can be followed throughout the book. He provides numerous anecdotes and witty writing to provide a good, fun, enlightening read.A well-timed and excellent book. I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are with or without kids or whether you are in or out of the educational system."},{"Title":"The War for Children's Minds","review":"Stephen Law has written a very informative book on the importance of liberal education for children. He argues persuasively that liberalism does NOT entail absolute moral relativism or the education of children without behavioral standards.Nevertheless, I did not find his book to be particularly enlightening. Being a liberal, I found that Law simply comfirmed what I already suspected or knew. I also doubt that many who adhere to a more \\"authoritarian\\" model of child rearing will be convinced otherwise by this book.If you're looking for a book that provides justification for liberal education, this is a good place to start. If you're looking for a guide on how to provide a liberal education for your child, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"A fine adventure story for boys - survival, combat, heroism etc. A non-PC tale of warring Comanches of the mid 1800s. Worth seeking out."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"The book is nothing if not passionate. I can still feel Pedro Pavon's magical, sensual relationship with his guitar and with his music. As a child of 9 or 10, I was stirred by his anger, Catholic righteousness, and fraternal love when, after being kidnapped by a raiding Comanche war party, he encountered his younger brother Roberto, who had also been kidnapped, rapidly adapting to Comanche life and ideals. But, of course, it was a beautiful woman that inspired Pedro to risk his own notion of self and fully enter into Comanche life. In doing so, he not only won the woman, he found personal liberty and the new, open world in which to exercise his humanity.Quite a read for a 10 year old! To this day I'm an aficionado of Spanish music and culture - and I've spent a fair share of my life exploring Native American cultures and languages. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"I read this book when I was a young boy.

My son tore through this book. LOVED it. He's begging me for the sequel, despite the tepid review we saw elsewhere on the Web. This is a riveting adventure book."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"I read this book several times when I was a kid but I haven't seen it in used book stores or libraries since I grew up and moved away from my hometown. Keith did his homework and while he gets some things wrong (by the time of the novel's setting the \\"writing was on the wall\\" as far as the impending end of the non-reservation way of life, and the novel seems to gloss that over) overall he succeeds. He succeeds in portraying a surprisingly \\"Other\\" culture in deep transition yet right at home in the economy of the turbulent Southwest.There are some bits that may remind us of more user-friendly \\"Dances With Wolves\\" Plains Indian philosopher/shaman/ecologist portrayals, but overall I think this is a good exercise in realism (or maybe even naturalism). Thanks to this book I developed an interest in the history of the Southwest and Native cultures/issues/languages in general.I can imagine librarians flinching at the following non-standard juvenile fiction ingredients: warfare and massacre, kidnapping, looting, cruelty to animals, butchering animals for food, thievery, slavery, torture, polygamy, wife-beating, infanticide, and purchasing a bride. If I remember correctly Keith omits mass death by smallpox but the lack of modern sanitation and medicine are duly noted.Out of such forbidding raw material Keith creates sympathetic characters: the downtrodden woman who helps Pedro survive his early captivity; the old man who teaches Pedro the arts of hunting and war; a girl who plays the role of a boy; an old woman who appreciates Pedro's musical gifts; Pedro's comrades in raiding and horse-stealing, and Pedro's lovely and intelligent (and clean!) romantic interest. Certain characters appear and disappear without preamble or explanation, and Pedro's relationship with his younger brother could have been better filled out. But overall this is a fine adventure tale with interesting looks at a society with different mores than our own."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"I read this book as a girl in 5th or 6th Grade. It kept me up until 2 AM the first time I read it. I can't believe it's been allowed to go out of print. It tells the story of a pampered boy, who, while visiting his uncle's ranch, is abducted and enslaved by a Native American raiding party (it's been a long time since I got my hands on a copy so I can't remember which tribe, I think it was Cherokee). He survives, adapts and grows to love their harsh life, becomes an accomplished horseback warrior and horse thief, and eventually earns his freedom and becomes a respected member of the tribe. There is a lot about horses in it, which gripped me at the time. It is pretty gruesome in parts (\\"Black Robe\\" rather than \\"Dances With Wolves\\"), so I wouldn't rush out and let my kids read it until they were about 10. I suppose if some of the gorier descriptions of Native American life weren't accurate there would be a case for letting it disappear into obscurity; however, I don't remember anything which wasn't also described in National Geographic and American Heritage-level books on Native American culture and history, and it was a right riveting read. Bring it back!"},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"One reviewer described it as a fine adventure story for boys, but I enjoyed it as a girl. I grew up in the Southwest, the history of which gets little attention from the rest of the country, even among the Northerners and Easterners who choose to relocate here in droves. Most are not even aware that the land they have overtaken was once part of Mexico, and the remainder simply do not wish to know. Komantcia was a nice change from the usual Noreuropean-oriented &quot;pilgrims and pioneers&quot; subject matter largely available to young people."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"This book has been on my \\"to find and buy\\" list since I read it from the library in 7th grade too many decades ago. I loved it so much that I started hand-copying my favorite parts into a notebook. Every few years I search for it on the web -- amazed that I finally found it! Even at 13, I could appreciate the realism of Pedro's adventure and the choices he made to become part of the tribe. I'll admit, I was a horse-crazy girl, so the descriptions of the horses and horse raiding really appealed to me, too. I'm looking forward to re-reading it in the 21st century. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't read it as a \\"grown-up\\" so the review is from memory."},{"Title":"Komantcia","review":"Solid 5 stars from me. My brother and I still discuss this book 40 years after first reading it. The adventure of the kidnapped boy is first rate, and Harold Keith was skillful and wise enough to portray the marauding Indians as proud, loving and honorable to their own, and made up of kind and cruel people, just as is every culture. The cruel warrior Comanches start as antagonists in this book, and end up the protagonists. The behavior of the Comanches doesn't change, but the understanding of the reader does.The main character is flawed, as are we all, and I wonder that I didn't learn more from this book when I read it at age 10. I have read it 3 times since, having purchased a first edition used copy, and am just finishing it today. Each time read it has seemed fresh to me, with new insights about a \\"foreign\\" culture understood better maybe because of my own broadening insight. I know the telling of the story to gain that insight was always there in the book. This is a work of a solid historical writer as he invested 7 years in the writing, and his attention to the cultures of Spain, Mexico, the American soldiers, and of the Comanches is his gift to the reader.Another review mentions that the story was a bit cross timed, as the fate of thenative American Indian was really sealed by the date described, but I forgive that error. The culture he recreates was true in its time, and I don't feel the book is lessened by this time shift.I am tempted to purchase a signed copy of the later edition book to give to my brother, knowing he would be moved by the gift. I enjoyed reading the other reviews, some of them describing the violence of the culture, but somehow it is told with an understanding that it was a unique culture of pride and many good points. I suspect our own culture now may not stand up to the scrutiny of history any better. I hope that there are those able to portray our strengths as well as Harold Keith did those of the Comanche.At the end of the first edition there is a promise to write the sequel. I have not read it, and it was published when the author was a very old man. James Michener produced art very late in his life, so age doesn't preclude the possibility of a second novel as good, but I am not sure that Harold Keith was really the author of the sequel.I wonder, as did another reviewer, why this story is out of print. As a female reviewer mentions I also feel that any young woman with a sense of adventure and natural curiosity for history would love this book as much as any boy. I bought the book just so my at-the-time 13 year old daughter would read it, and she discusses the book with me to this day. She used it for a book report, of her own accord, and then we lent the book to several other students eager to read it after her presentation.I have read this author's Rifles for Watie, as well, and it, too, is a book with the heft of artful storytelling, and characterization. These books are both gifts to American Literature, at least in the opinion of this humble reviewer."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"Clean and presentable. But this impression does not come with a glossary of Trollopian terminology, nor with an editor's Introduction. For the student of the Trollope oeuvre, therefore, it is not entirely satisfying."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"Anthony Trollope spends so much time doing the things that well-meaning creative writing profesors now tell one never to do--his editorial voice peppers each novel, he avoids subtle foreshadowing in favor of telling you essentially what will happen next, and he consistently drives plot towards a theme. Yet Trollope, a consummate Victorian, seems intrinsically modern whereas many more &quot;literarily correct&quot; modern humorists grow antique in a week or less. The secret, of course, is character, an eye and an ear for class distinctions, and a skewering wit combined with tremendous fellow-feeling for the foibles of his characters. Miss MacKenzie contains much of Trollope at his best--the title character is a beautifully observed genteel poor spinster-to-be suddenly visited with the misfortune of fortune. The author assiduously exposes flaw after flaw in Miss MacKenzie and her social milieu, and yet we like her better for the harsh light. In this world of tremendous unkindness, it is nice to remember that one can be honest without being brutal. Trollope, a writer of genial works of whimsy, brings the quiet honesty of literary fiction home safely here."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"This is an overlooked small gem of a novel. Margaret Mackenzie is a spinster in her mid-thirties who receives a large inheritance when her brother dies and must then deal with what comes with the inheritance, including several suitors, who may or may not simply be after her money. Trollope depicts Miss Mackenzie with his usual unsparing honesty, and although in his autobiography he called her &quot;a very unattractive old maid&quot;, her modesty, charity, and dignity endear her to the reader and make the rather everyday plot engrossing."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"This book, when compared to what is written today, is excellent. Trollope is a master with words - as all readers of his works will agree. He has a tremendous command of the written word - unlike authors of today!! However, for Trollope compared to Trollope, the book is just so-so. Many of his other novels are far superior. The book concerns the trials and tribulations of Miss MacKenzie after she inherits a fortune and then looses it. We see how her friends, neighbors, and male paramours react to her as her status in life changes. It's, as all Trollope books, enjoyable, but not one of his better books."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"Miss Margaret Mackenzie is a lonely young woman when she receives an inheritance after the death of her brother Walter which amounts to 800 a year, quite a substantial allowance in the 1860s. Subsequently Margaret moves from London to Littlebath where she takes care of her niece Susanna. Being fair and wealthy, she becomes the object of desire of three gentlemen in particular: her cousin John Ball, Mr Maguire the clergyman and Mr Rubb, junior partner in the company of her brother Tom. Margaret's destiny changes abruptly when her lawyer tells her that actually Walter's money is not hers since it was given to her before Jonathan Ball's death and that it belongs to John Ball.Mr Trollope casts a critical glance at all the intricacies of the Victorian era: money, social position, marriage and business. Nevertheless, the novel is a suspenseful family saga and the plot is so cleverly constructed that it surpasses many a story written in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"I have to admit this is my first novel written by Anthony Trollope. I have some of his other books but I haven't read any of them yet. I decided to pick this one up first because it was the shortest of the ones I have. I really enjoyed it! The book is such a excellent and subtle satire. Our heroine is Miss Margaret Mackenzie who sufferes the great misfortune of becoming an heiress to a rather large fortune. She is a spinster who has spent most of her life taking care of her father and invalid brother. She spends the rest of the novel trying to do the best she can by the money she has inherited and eventually loses. I think one of the reasons that I love this novel is because it is so honest. Trollope tells the readers all of Miss Mackenzie's faults but it makes us like her the better for it. All of the other characters are also very honestly portrayed and we like and dislike them based on these facts. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good satire full of plenty of moments of comedy and sentimentality."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"Anthony Trollope's MISS MACKENZIE falls in the early half of his career, toward the end of his BARSET cycle and just at the beginning of his PALLISER cycle. The story concerns the titular character, a thirty-something woman who is nearing spinster-hood is suddenly left a large inheritance. Newly-wealthy, she moves to a smaller and more fashionable town outside of London to try to recreate herself. The first half of the novel is rife with social satire as she tries to determine if she will ally herself with the local religious set, or take on the more independent lifestyle of her nearby neighbor. During this segment of the novel, we are introduced to three potential suitors, all of whom have more interest in her money than in herself, though they are shown to be mostly decent men.Near the midway point, Trollope throws a major curveball in the plot, and the second half of the novel crosses over more into strictly dramatic territory, and we will slowly learn the true nature of each suitor and the suspense will ultimately come down to whether or not Miss Mackenzie will even marry at all.It is this twist that gives me a mixed opinion of the work. On the one hand, I appreciate the sudden and unpredictable change in direction. On the other, I was very much enjoying the comic element of the first half, and it seemed a lot of interesting characters and conflicts were being set up. With the change in story, these characters fall by the wayside, and I found myself regretting that we didn't get to pursue those elements. As it stands, the second half is still interesting, but seems much more typical of the author's previous works.Furthermore, of the three suitors, one is revealed to be quite a scoundrel. Of the remaining two, one becomes our \\"hero\\" and the other mostly disappears. I'm not sure I liked Trollope's choices here. The \\"hero\\" is really not particularly likeable, nor is his family. I personally preferred our missing third man, and would like to have seen him more prominent as the latter events unfolded. I suppose Trollope's choice makes sense in light of the story setup, but that doesn't mean I have to like it!It's certainly worth the read, if it is maybe a couple of dozen pages too long. But this author has better works in his ouvre."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"One of his best books.

But then I did, and then I cared SO MUCH that there would be a happy ending for her, and I remembered Trollope saying in his autobiography that he wrote books to encourage people that goodness would win out, or words to that effect, so I was pretty sure dear Miss Mackenzie would find happiness, and she did. Knowing that she did will not in any way diminish the pleasure of reading this book if you are a Trollope fan. It leaves a nice, warm glow in the heart. Moreover, as usual, there are plenty of amusing patches throughout and a villain or two to hate."},{"Title":"Miss Mackenzie: A novel (Library of select novels)","review":"This is a classic Victorian novel, and the verbosity is typical of the period. The plot is predictable, though buried in an excess of words. Trollope is amusing in places, particularly with the puns on names, but this is not a truly prominent part of the book.

Finneran and less expensive, more portable paperbacks."},{"Title":"The POEMS OF WB YEATS NEW EDITION","review":"One may find from Finneran similar collections in theThe Yeats Reader: A Portable Compendium of Poetry, Drama, and Proseand his ample collection, similarly titled but briefer,The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats. Either may also be found more favorably priced as well, and, more humbly bound, submissive to rough and daily usage.Nevertheless this is the best you can get, and the price for a Like New or even a New copy is now quite accessible. I am very glad to have acquired mine today, through the great and mighty amazon.I have the Scribner Collected Poems linked here, which I shall use for my reading copy. This I will place in the shelf of Bibles, for special use, and special times, when settled in arm chair to read, in peace and safety, should that day ever come. This is a glorious book, of great scholarship and dignity, and commands respect.I refer here to the revised Second Edition published copyright 1997, so wonderful to hold, to find familiar verse, to bear in arms and to read.Essential reading for any appreciation of Mr. Yeats I have found in Professor Vendler'sOur Secret Discipline: Yeats and Lyric Form, which has opened so much to me, not only Mr. Yeats but beyond, into lyric form. I wished it had included a explicit and systematic revelation of his shifting meter as well, but what magnitude there is is ever-expanding.Please see also Mr. Ellman's study of WB,Yeats, the man and the masks (A Dutton paperback)andEminent Domain: Yeats Among Wilde, Joyce, Pound, Eliot and Auden.. I now await a recorded version of his work on Yeats, also through the amazon.In this present volume, so dignified, so glorious, so firm, so stern and serious to hold in hand, certain of its own great worth, we find therefore the most comprehensive collection of Mr. Yeats poetry possible, and the most authoritative. Part one of this 752 page book is titled Lyrical, containing every collection of poetry published in his lifetime, plus other collections, in chronological order, beginning with the 1889 Crossways through the 1899 Wind Among the Reeds through the Wild Swans at Coole of 1919 (containing some of his best known pieces) through the 1928 The Tower, through the Winding Stair and other poems of 1933, which includes Blood and Moon so well explained by Professor Vendler, and the Crazy Jane sequence, through New Poems and Last poems of 1938-9. Of course several collections are skipped in this present list for lack of space.This first Part also contains \\"Narrative and Dramatic\\" Poems beginning with the early Wanderings of Oisin (1889) through to the 1923 Gift of Harun Al-Rashid.Part Two contains Additional Poems, 129 in all. Then follows Appendix A of Yeat's own notes to his Collected Poems (1933). These from the Poet himself are followed by Finneran's Notes upon those Notes, as in the Scribner collection. Then follows five musical notations for five poems from 1938's New Poems, with notes for the tunes and their traditional origin.Then comes one hundred pages of explanatory notes original to this editor, who explains what to expect and what not to expect within them. \\"The purpose of these notes is to annotate all specific allusions in the poems. Annotation of other kinds, as well as interpretive commentary, has been avoided (p. 623).\\" Along with other avoidances, Finneran mentions ascribing certain personages to certain poems as a slippery slope not to be approached, although traditionally we have assumed certain poems to be \\"about\\" someone in Yeats' life, just as we like to assume we know the object of the Sonnets of Shakespeare, including his \\"Dark Lady.\\" Finneran explains: \\"This last omission perhaps requires comment, as many readers of Yeats are accustomed to approaching a particular poem 'knowing' that it is about a certain person - be it Maude Gonne, Olivia Shakespear, Margot Ruddock, or whomever. However, firm evidence for many of those identifications is lacking. Moreover it is arguable that Yeats did not wish to narrow the meanings of those poems by presenting them as statements about specific autobiographical situations. A key instance is 'Upon a Dying Lady.' ( . . .) he preferred to present it as a universal statement on death and dying, much as he told Hugh Lane that 'To a Wealthy Man . . .' was addressed to 'an imaginary person' (see note to 114.4)\\"I quote this at length to demonstrate the academic rigor of these notes, that they keep to what is provable and not fanciful. We may trust Finneran's judgment and scholarship here in these notes as elsewhere. The notes therefore are not only extensive but based on solid, demonstrable research.Then follows a few pages of Textual Notes which describe the sources used for the poems, in Part B the copy texts used and in Part B Emendations to the copy texts, with the authority for emendations made. Those requiring further information upon these, Finneran's editorial decisions are referred to hisEditing Yeats Poems: A Reconsideration.Following this helpful section lies the Index of Titles and of course the Index of First Lines.I hope this brisk walk through this tome has been of some assistance in your search to purchase. Certainly you might have discovered this through the Search Inside feature of the amazon product page, but perhaps this helps in something. Truly this is a book worthy of every home, each library, each university, every hearthside.Incidentally this is but the first of fourteen volumes collecting every thing known published by Mr. Yeats, with additional materials. The entire series is overseen by Mr. Finneran and George Mills Harper. The second volume contains theThe Plays: Vol.2 (The collected works of W.B. Yeats), edited by David R. Clark. Let these small steps begin your acquisition of the full set, well worth it in our darkening post-literate age, in which we lose the power to express the human heart with this power and precision, and glory.Read this book, and live it, and sing it, and write your own . . ."},{"Title":"The POEMS OF WB YEATS NEW EDITION","review":"If you love WB Yeats, this is a perfect volume to hold onto for life.

Arthur Qullier-Couch, or &quot;Q&quot; as he became known as an author of short stories, had recently been appointed Professor of English Literature at Cambridge University, England: and these lectures are a statement of his beliefs about knowledge. Knowledge, as distinct from information.I suspect that the recent discoveries about how the brain develops (Matt Ridley's Nature via Nurture is a good text) will lead to an increasing emphasis in the next fifty years upon knowledge rather than information. At the beginning of the 21st Century our focus is exclusively upon information and communication. Our education system is geared not to gives us facts, but to teach us how to discover facts when we need them. Many social consequences parallel this: not least the rise of feminism, it being very probably true that women are better at communication than men.Quiller-Couch's thesis is the reverse of our universal present-day mindset. He argues (and I paraphrase grossly) that information is not only irrelevant, but that too much information can be at best distracting, and at worst, dangerous. The esssential features of human character - the battle between good and evil, of self and others - has remained unchanged throughout recorded history. Each person since the human race began has to resolve, or fail to resolve, this battle for themselves. The most gifted have been able to write about it, or compose music, or paint pictures of it. The very greatest of these works of art have a universal application: that is, the human context applies to anyone living in any age - Hamlet is not just about a medieval Dane. What differs from age to age is the language in which the context is expressed.Until fairly recently a girl's school in the east of England had the school motto &quot;Video, Audio, Disco&quot;. No prizes for guessing why it was changed. But in Latin it is a reasonable aspiration for a school: I see, I hear, I learn. So language changes and has different resonances at different times. To understand Shakespeare or Milton we have to study what the words meant at the time they were written. This means understanding the human dilemmas and issues that the dramatist/poet/author was trying to address. Our way into these works of literature is therefore through understanding the universal problems of human morality. QuillerCouch suggests the remarkable claim that anyone who has read and really understood Book 9 of Milton's Paradise Lost doesn't need to learn anything else, except what may be necessary to earn a living. And he goes further: having mastered Book 9 (or whatever) then, apart from the few other works of art of similar stature, any further and lesser knowledge is distracting.This idea seems preposterous to a generation brought up to believe in information and a Freedom of Information Act. But I suspect that the pendulum may start to swing back in the next twenty years, and if this review is still posted here in fifty years, Quiller-Couch's ideas - updated with examples of universal great art from 1916 to 2050, and from a wider set of cultures than The West - may be nearer to cutting edge than obsolesence."},{"Title":"On the art of reading,","review":"This is one of two books by Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch used by Helene Hanff as the foundation of her education as a writer. Many people educate themselves who cannot afford education by reading all they can. My mother did not finish the eighth grade but knew more about American History and literature than most college kids today because she had a solid foundation of learning from an old fashioned teacher in a one room school house and a lifelong practice of reading.Many may find this book dated and no doubt boring if possessed by a mind incurious of the literature of their country's language.

This book is for every young woman, public library, high school library or anyone interested in an outstanding book of historic subjects. Special accolades to the author, Patricia Rife, for her professional treatment of this manuscript."},{"Title":"Lise Meitner and the Dawn of the Nuclear Age","review":"While there has been a recent renewed interest in the life of Lise Meitner, and a number of biographies have appeared, this I believe is the first one to focus on physics, as opposed to personalities. I may add that the authors do weave together an entangled web of scientists, their thoughts (through correspondence), their ambitions, and their (in many cases) flawed judgments. And the narrative is captivating!Lise Meitner was born in Vienna in 1878, and she started her career in the turbulent times of the First World War, at a time when Germany was a clear leader in physics research, in the Golden Era of physics. Yet, Lise Meitner was the first woman German scientist; first PhD in physics. When she started her studies, German universities were almost entirely closed to women; and especially so in the sciences.The authors bring to life the turbulent events in modern history which shaped Lise Meitner's career. A central theme in the book is the physics community's reaction to the first use by the USA of a fission bomb over Japan in 1945.In Berlin, building on a decade of research by Meintner and Otto Hahn, in 1938, the three Lise Meitner, Hahn, and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission. The Nobel Prize went to Hahn alone, and Lise Meitner has until recently been largely forgotten. In this interesting book, the authors examine why. Readers may find that the reasons are different from what we might have guessed.Many of the German scientists in the 1930ties were Jewish, or partly Jewish, and they were dismissed by Hitler in 1933, or in the years up to the war. The year before the outbreak of war in 1939 was the last chance to escape, and the entire physics community dispersed as German scientists had to flee, --- some chose to escape. A small number went to neutral Sweden, and others who had left earlier ended up in the USA, and became leaders in the Manhattan project, the secret Los Alamos team of scientists, led by Oppenheimer, the team which built the first atomic bomb. There were some German scientists, Otto Hahn among them who didn't have to flee. They included Lise Meitner's research collaborators, Hahn, and Strassmann, plus Max von Laue, Werner Heisenberg. At the end of the war, their relationships resumed, and an examination (in the book) of private letters reveals some fascinating new insight. Palle Jorgensen, October 2005."},{"Title":"Lise Meitner and the Dawn of the Nuclear Age","review":"Lise Meitner and the Dawn of the Nuclear Age, by J.A. Wheeler is a fascinating book documenting the extraordinary life of an aspiring woman scientist whose life was filled with adversity. Surviving both World Wars and gender discrimination, Meitner was a pioneer at the forefront of her discipline involving the study of radio-elements and nuclear fission. At the University of Vienna and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Meitner was inspired to study experimental physics with a focus on atomic structure by her two most memorable professors Boltzmann and Planck. Meitner's major discovery was her work with Hahn and the splitting of the atom (nuclear fission). This monumental discovery led to the invention of the atomic bomb, which drastically changed warfare. Besides her accomplishments Meitner was a truly inspiring woman for her strength and personal conviction. Meitner barely escaped from Nazis Germany only to be isolated in Sweden from the international scientific community. She helplessly watched her lifetime of dedication and achievement be overlooked by the Nobel Prize Committee countless times, only to have Hahn receive all the credit. In the face of the immanent destruction of her career and life by the Nazis she experienced the pain of being abandoned by close colleagues. Rising above her obstacles she dedicated her life to helping victims of the Holocaust and refusing to work on chemical warfare or nuclear bomb research, but instead working towards awareness of the moral responsibilities scientists needed to have in this new nuclear age."},{"Title":"Lise Meitner and the Dawn of the Nuclear Age","review":"What an amazing person.

While Meitner never received a Nobel Prize, she was nominated over twelve times and had an element named in her honor.

It was a conscious choice on my part to NOT read the whole thing, based on my experience of the first part of the book.I suppose I can understand why someone would write a book about writing and resort to movies for examples. The number of serious writers is probably pretty small. Everyone and their grandmother WANTS to be a writer, and might buy this book if it is accessible to them. I mean, if you assume that everyone who wants to write a book has actually read a few, then you are going to eliminate a large segment of the population right off the bat. My problem is: I am serious about writing, and I want advice from a book that takes writing as seriously as I do. This is definitely not that book.The lists and descriptions would probably be useful to someone who is reading a book (or maybe watching a movie) and wants to analyze it in a scholarly fashion. I saw nothing that would help someone who wanted to actually create one of those books in the first place.START SLIGHTLY UNRELATED RANT (BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY):Not to mention that I am really sick of all these Writer's Digest Books that alternate seemingly randomly between using masculine and feminine pronouns when describing characters, like this book does. I find the practice completely distracting. One paragraph will talk about your character and how he should have a strong motivation or something like that. Then, the next paragraph will talk about your character, and how she should should face . . . -- wait. She? She who? Who are we talking about now?This practice makes the writing far from invisible. It is jarring every time it happens, and makes it difficult to concentrate on what is being said. Luckily, with this book that wasn't a problem, becuase nothing important was being said, anyway. I believe writing that draws attention to itself is bad writing (possible exception: poetry).END RANTIf you are serious about writing, you should probably skip this book. If you already bought it, give it to your grandmother.

Interesting, although somewhat vague.2 points for the 55 dramatic situations which are fascinating and could potentially make for myriad combinations. I bought the book just for these.-1 for the shoddy research done on the gothic, horror, sci-fi and fantasy genres-1 for failing to accurately define melodrama and then touting it, along with romance, as a story \\"structure\\"I would have subtracted one more point for citing Polonius as if he were a Shakespearean authority, but I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt that she was being humorous (although, I have my doubts).The author warns that her book is only a guide and that the reader should feel free and is encouraged to explore beyond its confines. The dearth of intelligent script-writing on TV and Hollywood film bear this out. The fact that the author cites some of the most mediocre of Hollywood films as examples of \\"structure\\" is appalling to me. I mean, Independence Day may have an identifiable structure, but so does an I-beam. I wouldn't stare at an I-beam for 2 hours."},{"Title":"Story Structure Architect: A Writer's Guide to Building Dramatic Situations and Compelling Characters","review":"Part 1 - Drafting a PlanSix basic conflict types you need to decide upon as you structure your story.

No 4- or 5-Act structures covered here, but when you think about what is presented you can have some creativity in combining elements of different structures or taking away.Part 3 - Adding StoriesFifty-five dramatic situations that expand on the traditional 36 are explained well with examples from contemporary movies/books.Character types and their motivations are presents which drive the types of story options listed. This helped me consider some additional motivations for my characters in my stories.Overall this is a fantastic reference.The book is practically a book of lists to pick and choose and consider as you construct your story.

UNLIKE so many other books that claim to help a writer flesh out their novel and then only give vague refrences as to character and plot, this book just about details step-by-step how one can go about doing it.Another reviewer commented that the print in the book is 'too small' and that it is very hard to read -NO. It has the same print size of any paperback novel.Another reviewer said something about an error relating to the book saying that the book states that stories are either plot related or character related with the other taking second and then gives examples which are actually the same as each other. Well, i have the book in front of me and this is NOT true. What the book says is that (and you can skim the other reviews to find the one i'm talking about) plot driven stories have the characters REACTING to the events of the story and that character driven stories have the characters ACTING to cause the plot to further itself.What this means is that in a character driven story if the main character(s) stop deciding to act, which will further the plot of the story because of what they then do, then the story would simply be over. Think of it like your main character deciding that they need milk for their cereal and decide to go to the store to get some. That decision furthers the plot but at any time during their trip to the store they could just as easily decide that they change their mind and don't need milk after all. Then they could just turn around and the story of them taking a trip to the store to buy milk would be over with their decision.Plot driven stories are like if you are driving to the store to pick up some milk and then on the way there your tire blows out causing your car to veer off the road. When you wake from the crash you try to call on your cell phone for help but just as the operator picks up the line your battery dies. Then you are forced to walk and as you do a storm comes and drops tornados down all around you.Can you see the difference? That is what the book explains and i think that the reviewer whom i mentioned earlier missed that point.Anywho, this is a very well written book that explains the information within so well that it is hard not to understand it. Not only is there a great amount of detail to what is stated inside but there are numerous examples to follow and guide the reader.In my opinion: buy it. I'm glad i did."},{"Title":"Story Structure Architect: A Writer's Guide to Building Dramatic Situations and Compelling Characters","review":"Schmidt provides excellent coverage of the variegated structures of plot. The book is divided into four parts. The first explains how to plan a narrative. The second explains how to structure a plot. The third is a compendium of story structures. The fourth is a brief guide to research.In the Part 1, Schmidt emphasizes character motivation and conflict. Unlike many books of its kind, \\"Story\\" clearly explains the relation between the \\"throughline,\\" the conflict and the genre. If you aim to produce marketable works, this point is crucial. Schmidt covers this material at just the right depth, neither too theoretical nor too paraphrased.However, in Part 1 you will find the only error in the book. The author makes a distinction between plot-driven stories and character-driven stories, but it is a distinction without a difference. According to Ms. Schmidt, a plot-driven story moves forward by events that \\"cause the characters to react to those events. Characters are secondary to the plot.\\" On the other hand, a character-driven story moves ahead by \\"action and choices.\\" Character-driven stories advance by the actions and choices of characters, while plot driven stories advance by the reactions of characters to events. The distinction claimed evaporates when we see that reactions invariably involve choices and actions, and moving ahead by \\"action and choices\\" invariably involves reaction to events.For over 2,000 years, a good plot has been understood to be the logical and probable actions of characters. This is a plot-driven story. In some rare cases, the characters are not people, perhaps not even living. The long descriptive pieces in Hugo's \\"Toilers of the Sea\\" are a good example. A kind of story is told, but the characters are the Chanel Islands. So, to tell a story some kind of character must act. Good stories have logical and probable actions, but all stories have a plot.The character-driven story places the focus on the development and changes in a character's character. Thus, character-driven (in this context) doesn't mean \\"an actor in a story\\" but rather \\"a characteristic property that defines the apparent individual nature of something.\\" Character-driven stories tell of the events that change the nature, personality, or individuating property of a character in the story.In short, character-driven stories are a species of plot-driven stories that show how a character's character changes. (That's a mouthful!) A good example to study is \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"Part 2, is very interesting. Schmidt explains all the traditional plot structures, and even some modern twists on them.Part 3, is the reason I bought the book. The author compiles a very comprehensive list of story structures, along with questions and examples. I can now stop relying on Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" for my story ideas!Part 4 is very brief, but enough to get you going.It's a good book.

Using classic and modern examples, just as in her previous book 45 Master Characters, Schmidt lays out the possible and probably plotlines, subplots or ideas that can enrich almost any story. Just as her previous book may seem, at first look, to be a guide to creating stereotypes or generic stories, but is instead a fresh look at the stories and characters that exist in almost every culture. These are stories and characters that we resonate with and can see ourselves in.I hope she has another book in her because I have great confidence in Schmidt as a writer and a teacher."},{"Title":"Story Structure Architect: A Writer's Guide to Building Dramatic Situations and Compelling Characters","review":"When I first picked up this book I thought it was a simple little how-to book.

The designer might as well be a college kid turning in a freshman project.It was an altogether aggravating read and I only persisted because the information is extremely uusefulVictoria Lynn Schmidt, Ph.D., had created an amazing blueprint that covers many aspects of story structure in useful detail [about the only thing she didn't do was diagram sentences or provide linguistic diacritical marks for pronunciation].BUT the book is difficult to read and to handle. To begin with it is small - a bit larger then a paperback [5.5 inches by 8.5 inches]. This is not necessarily the kiss of death BUT the inside paper is a heavy weight variety making the book hefty, the cover is a plasticine paper which doesn't give-way in its perfect bound format. The simple act of holding the book open turns into a wrestling match.Also, the copy runs to 277 pages. Apparently, in order to squeeze the copy onto half-sized pages, it was necessary to use \`mouse' type - I'm guessing 8 point fonts. Also san-serif type alternated with a standard serif font, one supposes as a means of saving space to, again, squeeze everything into the half-sized pages. San-serif fonts tend to reduce readability.The book design is credited to Lisa Buchanan-Kuhn & Claudean Wheeler. They key off the title word \\"architect\\" as almost any designer would do but their creative choices work against readability.Architects work with \\"blueprints\\" which are well know for being difficult to read. So the designer can make the connection with margin art [which they do on every page] but let that be enough.Where the attempt to carry out the blueprint motif truly fails is the too cute use of the same pale blue ink IN THE TEXT.The shade of blue is virtually unreadable against a white page. The color is OK to use for bullets that set aside outlines as well as for line graphics surrounded by a lot of white space.Where the blue ink truly fails is when it is used for blocks of text set aside for emphasis, set in san-serif font of a tiny size.It fails in the table of contents where it is used for sub-heads, it fails as sub-heads in the text and in the copy that begins each chapter which is [inexplicably] placed over a light blue graphic background.The designer used numerous fonts for sub-heads and with the wide variety [a bit unusual but not terrible] of fonts, each heading could have done very well in simple black ink.This designer clearly did not have the reader in mind.The book deserves to be redesigned in a larger, workbook type format that does away with the effort to win design awards and considers the end point user."},{"Title":"Story Structure Architect: A Writer's Guide to Building Dramatic Situations and Compelling Characters","review":"This is a book I was very excited to get.

If I'm not familiar with the word \\"obtaining\\" I'm probably not really up to writing a book, or even reading one.As another reader pointed out, many of her examples are Hollywood bombs. That may simply be a limitation of this type of a guide, but it's even more discouraging, as I slog through the pages trying to get a few structural ideas, to think that the best I might end up with is something like \\"Striptease.\\" I think I'd forgive the author this if her prose wasn't so stiff.

Here is my take on it. The author breaks down the Plot construction into Throughlines, Conflicts, Structure and Situations (she also adds Genre and Research into the mix as well). If you do a search on the web, many others before her have taken a combination of the above to reflect what constitutes the main plot structures. In this book, she breaks it down into separate entities within itself and treats each as a \\"step\\" in constructing a plot. However, there are other elements that are important in driving a plot that are not really mentioned here (i.e. moral premise / theme, as well as Character). I don't care what label you put on her sections, they all equate to conflict, so without enlisting Theme/Premise & character/motivation into the mix, this book only serves as a book on Plot Design at a very superficial level and not construction. Hence the name of her book, and you basically end up with a book that has an overbloated list of sorts that will result in a contrived plotline if used alone. Those are the negatives.The positives: The section on the 11 structures based on the 3 act story structure is quite illuminating and probably the only section in the book that would validate the purchase of this book. In this section, each structure is offered with a visual to explain how story time / pacing / turning points can be changed around in order to produce a specific type of story structure (i.e. meladrama, jouney...).At best, this book would be better served with other books that focus on Theme/Moral Premise, Character and the such. Here, the author's intent was probably to offer you a sort of map in plot design, but you still need a compass to navigate through your story from beginning to end. With that said, here are some other books worth looking into for that purpose:Inside Story by Dara Marks and Moral Premise by Stanley D.

For instance, consider her Situation #2, \\"Benefaction,\\" wherein a person does a good deed for a person in trouble. Then consider her Situation #3, \\"Deliverance,\\" wherein a person rescues another person in trouble. She considers the primary distinction between these situations to be that the Unfortunate asks for help in \\"Benefaction\\" but not in \\"Deliverance\\". I don't consider this a meaningful distinction. Polti himself believed \\"Deliverance\\" to be the converse of \\"Supplication\\" (his and Schmidt's Situation #1).Schmidt describes the situations in pairs; she has taken a list of twenty-seven \\"primary\\" situations, most of which come from Polti, and doubles them to produce fifty-four. In some cases, this works. In other cases, it seems at best contrived, at worst foolish. In almost all cases, she makes a distinction without much of a difference.Consider her Situation #3, \\"Deliverance\\", wherein a person appears and saves another person from harm. Now consider its \\"double\\", \\"Sojourn\\", wherein a person appears and saves another person from harm. Schmidt says \\"Like Deliverance, there must also be an Unfortunate and a Threatener. But the Unfortunate is not in any real danger; the Threatener will be more focused on the Sojourner than the Unfortunate.\\" Again, I don't consider this a meaningful distinction.Or consider #16, \\"Support\\", which she describes as the converse of #15, \\"Revolt.\\" She actually says, \\"In this situation the Conspirator becomes the Supporter. He channels his energy into helping the one in power he agrees with rather than fighting or revolting against the one in power he doesn't agree with.\\" I don't see a meaningful distinction. She blurs it even further with \\"Of course by its very nature this implies a democratic situation where it is not necessary to overthrow a Tyrant to be rid of him. In a democratic situation, there is always another candidate to choose... In situations where democracy is not the case, such as with a parent or boss, the Supporter can walk away and head for \\"greener pasture\\" somewhere else. He can always find someone who agrees with his views to live or work in harmony with.\\" WTF, Vicky?She frequently cites examples that undercut the simple-minded structures she describes. An example is citing *Catch Me If You Can* as an example of her Situation #9 (her \\"Flight\\", Polti's \\"Pursuit\\"), but making the blanket statement that the Fugitive always gets away. I'm not sure which version of the film she watched, but in the one I watched, and in the book I read, Abagnale definitely did not get away with it. It is true that he only spent a few years in prison, but he was released through an act of intelligent mercy, not due to his own slipperiness. She also asks the question, \\"Will she get away with it by dying (think *Thelma and Louise*) or by giving up something like citizenship as she moves out of the country?\\" I find this mildly silly.She sometimes indicates that she doesn't really understand the situations she's discussing. In her Situation #1, \\"Supplication,\\" she repeatedly describes the situation as having a Petitioner entreat her Persecutor for help. This is indeed the case sometimes, but only because in those instances the Persecutor and the Power in Authority are the same entity.She frequently makes blanket descriptions that reduce the generality of \\"her\\" observation and restrict the universality of the situations. In her Situation #1, \\"Supplication,\\" she describes the Power in Authority as \\"usually someone who has power and the will to use it. Whether he helps or harms is purely up to him. Power is this character's identity and he lives to exercise it. He may be a judge, policeman, parent, teacher, boss, or anyone who is 'above' another person.\\" I'm sure this is indeed the case most of the time, but she dismisses without comment situations in which the Power in Authority is at best uncomfortable exercising power, where the Persecutor holds some sway or can threaten the Power in Authority, and so on. She seems more interested in particularizing the archetype (perhaps to be a more interesting read) than to consider the possibilities of the situation.All in all, it's a muddled mess of distinctions without difference, difference without distinction, apparent ignorance, and bad writing. It's worth reading, but only so you can rewrite it into a form that's more useful to you -- a form that agrees more with your own perceptions of the variability of dramatic situations."},{"Title":"Story Structure Architect: A Writer's Guide to Building Dramatic Situations and Compelling Characters","review":"Fascinating book!

Sadly letdown. The book gives a tired old treatment of using a black list to check against the header of a mail message. Now not all spammers forge the header. But many do, as known for years. And they don't just forge the From line. They can also forge the Received lines.When the author wrote the previous review, he mentioned the Received header lines. But, in general, for an ISP, the only valid header info is what the ISP itself writes. Received lines not written by the ISP can also be forged.So using a black list on a header can easily be defeated by a spammer. And is being done so by many of them.But Schwartz goes on to say that SA can now apply the black list against the body links. GREAT! Awesome. This is the key difference between 3.0 and the earlier stuff. Yet, when I went thru the book, I did not see any mention of this. Okay, perhaps I missed it. But if the book actually talks about it, it is in a very obscure fashion.The new ability in 3.0 is seminal. Because while a spammer can forge headers, if he wants users to click through to his site, he has to write a valid address for himself. When AOL implemented this idea [not using SA] earlier this year, they said it led to the first documented decrease in spam they'd seen.I repeat- if the book didn't mention the new 3.0 ability, it is grossly deficient. If it did mention it, but scantily, ditto. It certainly deserves at least as much space as was given to Mr Bayes."},{"Title":"SpamAssassin","review":"This is a book for anyone who wants to know what is under the hood. This books details what is behind the engine, its architecture and its learning system. While it is leaning more heavily in the mail transfer agent (MTA) side, it still offers a lot of tips to readers as to how one can use SpamAssassin to combat junk mail. The Autowhitelisting and Bayesian Filtering are a must for those who really want to know how to use the tool. This is what makes it different from other keyword based filtering. This would be a great book for those who run and maintain their own mailing server, because it has lots of details for sendmail, postfix, exim and qmail.Although the author has a section on pop mail configuration, I would like to see more client configuration examples such as outlook express or Novell's evolution/Ximian, or kmail. This is because not everybody runs email server at home. Nonetheless, this is a great book for those who want to set up their own spam mail filters and get rid of those annoying junk mail. Additionally, the author provides a very detailed list of resources."},{"Title":"SpamAssassin","review":"SpamAssassin is the immensely popular open-source spam solution for the Linux/Unix world. This book covers version 3.0, which, curiously enough, is not included with the book. This is pretty unusual in the open-source world since it costs very little to put a copy of the program onto CD and bind it into the book.The reasons for SpamAssassin's popularity include its high level of customizability, the ability to change the rules and the weights assigned to those rules, automatically report spam to clearinghouses, ability to interface with other resources on the internet including DNS blacklists, ability to create a whitelist, and the ability to work with a wide variety of mail systems including sendmail, Postfix, qmail, and Exim. One of the really nice features is the ability for the system to automatically add a person to the whitelist if you send an outgoing email to that person.Of course all of this requires an understanding of how SpamAssassin works and how to configure and tweak it to get it to do what you want. That is where this book comes in. The author has done an excellent job of explaining not only the concepts but also the details of how SpamAssassin works and how to tweak it to work best in your environment. This is easily one of the most clearly written and understandable books on configuring the software that I have read. SpamAssassin is highly recommended for anyone on a Unix-like system who is considering using the program as a spam control solution.It took some time to figure out how to configure it best for my needs but my spam is down over 90% with no false positives. Don't expect the author to spoon feed you what is best for your system, but he gives you the information to design one that works for you."},{"Title":"SpamAssassin","review":"A comprehensive description of the many features of SpamAssassin [SA] and how it can be integrated with the major mailing programs sendmail, postfix, qmail and Exim. Certainly, the free and open source nature of SA will appeal to some.But the problem with the book is that it never seriously analyses the many flaws of SA. The most glaring is how it used blacklists. It only applies these against various header fields. Yet it is well known that spammers forge arbitrary sender addresses. Which greatly reduces the efficacy of the blacklist.Also, the book devotes attention to how SA uses Bayesians. It says how you need a corpus of spam and one of non-spam, to train the Bayesian. Yet this has proved to be a severe constraint on actual usage. The book never says how these corpuses are to be found. In practice, this is done manually. Even worse, the book does not point out that spammers can and are poisoning Bayesians, with innocuous non-sequitur words in their messages. This means that a Bayesian must be continually retrained on new corpuses, that have been manually gathered. Very labour intensive. Few users are willing and able to do so."},{"Title":"SpamAssassin","review":"I'm sure that the Spamassassin developers are doing the best they can, but the sad fact is that the spammers are winning the war.I don't think there really is a good solution for spam right now. Blacklists don't work, Bayesian filters don't work - nothing works well enough to stop spam entirely.Still, Spamassassin is useful, and because it is configurable (and open source), you at least have complete control. That assumes, of course, that you understand how it works. That's the reason to buy a book like this, but I was a bit disappointed in that area. I'm not sure yet whether the fault is Spamassassin - maybe it's just not as configurable as it should be - or this book just not explaining things very well.For example, I note that an awful lot of the spam I get is from certain IP blocks. I don't want to block out large ranges arbitrarily, but I thought it might be interesting to increase the Spamassassin score if the sender was in one of those ranges.Well, if there is a way to do that, I still haven't figured it out. It could be me - maybe I just haven't read things carefully enough - but I didn't feel that I understood Spamassassin after reading this. Maybe this needs to be a bigger book - only about 100 pages are devoted to configuration and modifying rules, the rest is installation advice.On the other hand, there's nothing else out there, and this isn't totally without value. If you are using Spamassassin, you may want to pick this up - it could be a long wait for anything better."},{"Title":"SpamAssassin","review":"Unless you're a PERL weenie and just love all the technical jargon and obscure set up code in this book -- forget it.

You won't be able to do much better with this book, even if you COULD implement it.

I'm a fan of Clive Cussler and this sounded like it as in the same vein. After the first 30 pages I realized that this guy can't write anything that comes close to Clive Cussler. I like my novels long and heavy on detail in both the history and the action. This deliverd on neither. The Historical backgourd for the prologue and within the body of the story itself pales in comparison to Cussler. The action sequences were not all that well written either and the dialogue felt stiff and forced. I may borrow another one of Higgins' novels from my Grandfather-in-law who gave me this one and give him another chance but I'm not going to hold my breath.If you are a fan of Cussler I strongly recommend skipping this book.

Looking for other books for HigginsRegards,Roger"},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"It's been years since I read a Higgins novel. As a teenager, I devoured everything from \\"The Eagle has Landed\\" and \\"Storm Warning\\" to \\"Solo\\" and \\"Luciano's Luck.\\" Higgins had a way of playing with history, particularly WWII, and coming up with fun twists, but I lost interest in the late 80s.During those late 80s, I made a number of trips into China, so on a recent whim I decided to read \\"On Dangerous Ground,\\" intrigued by its Hong Kong/China premise. The story starts like many Higgins' books, with a prologue setting up the historical mystery, in this case a secret document signed near the end of WWII that would give England an additional hundred years of rule over Hong Kong. The document, not surprisingly, is lost after a plane crash.Higgins then jumps to the 1990s, where we discover Sean Dillon, former IRA member and likable mercenary, as he aims to stop an assassination attempt on the US president. This is only the first of his adventures, though, and soon he's headed to the Scottish Highlands to investigate rumors of this lost WWII document that could disrupt the balance of power for governments, as well as for commercial enterprises both legal and otherwise. His main foe is an American mafioso who knows that England's continued control of Hong Kong could secure his own \\"business\\" interests there for many years to come.Although Higgins was never a great prose stylist or narrative genius, he is a master of plotting and pacing. The story moves along quickly, giving us a vast and interesting cast of characters, a unique setting, and some sparse action scenes. The ending tries to rush all the final players into conflict and feels a bit ham-handed, yet are a whole lot of fun nonetheless.This isn't among the best books I've read by Higgins, but it is a fine example of his ability to entertain. If you haven't had a recent dose of Higgins, this is a good choice for rediscovering him and his hero Sean Dillon."},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"If you havent read any of the Sean Dillon series, read them, they are really good action books and keep you enthralled with each story."},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"The plot of the book will keep you reading, at first the three stories will make you ask many things about the real plot, but when the three stories merge and start the main story of the book you won't be able to leave the book, nevertheless, at the end of it is like a James Bond movie with a new star Sean Dillon instead of Sean Connery.The story is good but it has his details that any secret agent would never do, for example to trust blindly Asta and try her to be against her step father.Read it!"},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"Aaaargh, what's happening ???!!! Why is the sense of d&eacute;javu so strong in this one, especially following right after Thunderpoint??!!!I give the books 3 stars because it is fast moving action-packed with a simple plot peppered with some witty dialogues, enjoyable especially for those who had not read Higgins' previous works.Character-wise, is it my imagination or is the old BG Ferguson, veteran of Korean War, getting more and more into the action, seeing him accompanied by different aides (the female in this one is so similar to the one in Eye of the Storm, but of course *SPOILER* Higgins can't use her 'cos she had a thing against Dillon).The introduction of physical/mental therapy for Dillon through Chinese arts was refreshing, but frankly, the short duration it took stretches the credibility.Our heroes seem to make the same mistake again as in Thunderpoint, namely, going after vital objectives while being clearly outgunned when they could have been more careful. And of course, there is slight rehash of Luciano's Luck later in the book.The interesting character was Asta, an enigmatic woman who had no problem shooting to kill but couldn't take care of a drunken lout, namely, one Fergus Munro. Those familiar with Higgins novels would immediately notice this character has the worst of two of Higgins' famous creations : Dougal Munro and Dougal Munro 2nd generation Ferguson, without any of their redeeming qualities.Another bright spot of this book though, is that the villains (Mafia) got news of the Chunking Covenant before a mole leaked out the information to the establishment (heroes). Usually in Higgins story, it is the other way around."},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"This book throws all sorts of surprises your way. Everything you've come to expect or think about the characters will all of a sudden change as their true personality is revealed. It's just full of surprises that keep you wanting more, even when nothing exciting is happening.This book was particularly interesting because of the topic. With Hong Kong having been handed over just a little while back and me actually living there I thought it took on a different meaning. Now I wonder if something like this really happened, whether the Chungking Covenant actually existed and was found. Either way, it makes for a good read, especially on a lonely beach in Malaysia.I agree with everyone else that has written reviews here, Dillon is a great character. He seems like the perfect secret agent, but he's also got a little bit of an evil past which helps make him the person he is. The way he and Asta relate really confuses me because when they are around each other they seem like they truly have a thing for each other, but when they go back to their homes their attitude completely changes. Asta is a great character too, mainly because of that side of her, the way she changes so quickly makes you unsure of her motives so that when they are revealed at the end it really surprises you.All in all this a great book that I never expected to like. I had to pick out a book on China for english and this seemed like the one that would appeal the most to me."},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"In China, in 1944, in the waning days of WW2, a document was signed by Mao Tse Sung and witnessed by Lord Louis Nountbatten, on behalf of Winston Churchill. This document, the Chungking Covenant, guaranteed continued rights to the British to accupy Hong Kong for yet another 100 years. The plane on which Scottish Officer, Ian Campbell and the Covenant was flying, crashed but Campbell , barely alive, was rescued by his batman and returned to England, never to regain his wits.Fifty years later as the time approaches for the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese, the now aged batman reveals the presence of the Covenant to be hidden somewhere in the grounds of Campbell's castle in the Highlands of Scotland and both British Intelligence forces and the Mafia, who hold huge interests in Hong Kong, are anxious to acquire the document. The Brits hire Sean Dillon, former IRA operative and general mercenary to many countries (but definitely an almost good guy) to act on their behalf and to vie with a mysterious American millionaire, to get the document. If you like action thrillers with plenty going on, you'll love this as I did...it would make a marvellous movie!"},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"Near the conclusion of WWII the British and Chinese Communists have a meeting during which they signed a pact, called the Chungking Covenant, which would extend British rule over Hong Kong for 100 years, provided the Communists were in control of China at wars end. The document is seemingly lost when the plane carrying it to England crashes. Fifty years later, news of the documents survival surfaces, when the surviving pilot of the plane advises a Mafia connected doctor of its existance. The Mafia, of course, would make multi-millions if they could get their hands on the document.Here again, our two favorites, Sean Dillon and Brigadier Ferguson, match wits with a coterie of espionage agents, such as Carl Mason and his step-sister Asta, who portrays herself as a sweet and loving woman, but who, in reality is just the opposite...a true vixen. The characters and the plot are both well developed and hold your interest throughout the whole story.E.J. Walden, author of \\"Operation Snow Owl\\""},{"Title":"On Dangerous Ground (Sean Dillon)","review":"An excellent novel by Jack Higgins. This suspenseful novel is for young adults and older. In 1944, Mao Tse-Tung and Lord Mountbatten signed a secret document. If the British would supply the Chinese Communist Army with ammos to fight the Japanese, Mao Tse-Tung would extend the British Rule over Hong Kong by another hundred years if he ever rules China. However, the plane that held the secret documents was lost in a plane crash.In 1993, the Italian Mafia learned about the secret documents from one of the pilots that survived in the plane crash. Now, the Italian Mafia would find the documents so their billions of dollars of investment will not be gone in Hong Kong. The British Government finds out that the Mafia is up to the documents. Sean Dillon and Brigadier Ferguson are on a mission directly given by the Prime Minister to recover the documents before the Mafia lay its hands on them.I recommend this book for people who have spare time to read. It's an excellent novel after all. The storyline is interesting. With the beginning focusing on Mao and Lord Mountbatten and then it ends. It then jumps right into 1993. The Mao part is great. I thought that their meeting really happened. The author has a serious tone in that part of the novel. The best part of the novel that I thought was when Sean Dillon was introduced. He seems like a cool and cold-blooded guy. A guy who use to work for any other terrorist or government organization. He bombed places and killed people. However, he never killed children or women. He sounds like a brutal man but actually he's not. The author was smart in creating Sean Dillon because he makes Sean sounds like a bad guy at the start of the novel but when you read further in the story, what you think of him actually changes. Another interesting character is Asta. She appeals to be like a charming girl who only knows about having a peaceful life. But actually, she's a heartless woman who killed her own mother and tricked Sean Dillon. These two characters are interesting because they tend to change throughout the book.When reading the book, the story becomes more exciting. There are more actions and myths to solve. Once you piece all the myths and problems, it feels like if you are part of the story with them to solve the case.I think Jack Higgins could do better in stretching the storyline and having a longer climax and resolution because the climax was not that good and the resolution sucked. But, after all, this book is good.An exciting novel, which one should not miss. Check out this book and read it.

Former IRA terrorist Sean Dillon, who walks a fine line between good and bad, takes to the Scottish Highlands for this fast-paced adventure. In 1944 a secret pact was signed by Hong Kong and England extending British rule over Hong Kong by 100 years until 2097 rather then restoring the nation to China in 1997. However, the document vanishes during an airplane crash over Scotland. The two pilots survive but the vital paper is lost, and with it the matter is laid to rest.In 1993, the only living pilot confesses on his deathbed to an Italian doctor the details of the covenant. The doctor, who is from a Sicilian mafia family, informs them of the news. The mafia has a vested interest in the deal, as they run and own much of Hong Kong's most successful enterprises. Meanwhile, the reports of the old treaty leak to British officals and like the mafia, they want to get a hold of the paper if it still exists. But who would be the brightest and best person to overcome the odds in finding it? Bring in Sean Dillon!The pursuit heats to a boil as the charming Dillon takes on the most powerful men in the Italian underworld. The Scottish countryside is turned upside down while Dillon and his colleagues Brigadier Ferguson and the lovely Chief Inspector Hannah Bernstein face continous grave danger as attempts are made on their lives. Indubitably, Sean Dillon outwits the most skilled assassins and finds incredible solutions to get out of the non-stop trouble surrounding him. Sounds a bit far-fetched? You bet! But that's what fiction is all about. I believe Sean Dillon is one of the most exciting characters in modern day thrillers, even if I do find myself rolling my eyes at the amazing way he works his way out of his predicaments.

The characters were well developed from the start and seemed likeable... although they don't act morally all the time. The plot concerns the handing over of Hong Kong in 1997 and with HK just being handed back to China, it's a timely read. Our main character is Sean Dillion, a former notorious mercenary and gifted thespian, who now works for the British government. His boss is Charles Ferguson, an astute man with worldly experience in international matters. Making up our trios of heroes is Hannah Bernstein, appointed secretary to Ferguson and also chief of Scotland Yard. The foes they come up against are the Mafia in the form of Carl Morgan, his step-daughter Asta and other assorted baddies around to thwart the deeds of our gallant protagonists, who are trying to recover a signed form stating that HK will stay independent until another 100 years. This letter of priceless importance is located in the highlands of Scotland. There, the two forces battle it out with wits and a deadly game of cat-and-mouse until there is only one winner!

Chapter three goes back to the Chungking Covenant, and Dillon is brought into the case somewhat belatedly. It is an interesting case, but both the good guys and the bad guys bumble about a bit too much in circumstances where one slip could mean sudden death (dropping their guard, turning their back on a known enemy, etc.). Some scenarios are repeated in other Sean Dillon tales.Unlike James Bond, Dillon never seems to have much luck with women. The story has considerable violence but very little sex. Overall, the book is worth reading for light fiction, especially if you are a Sean Dillon fan. The action is fast paced, and never gets dull."},{"Title":"Prairie Fire","review":"I found this book to be a quick read. It kept me captivated on a plane trip to Tokyo and really helped the time go by. All the characters are believable, passionate, three dimensional and believable. I found most of the conclusions about legal cases and political situations to be plausible and convincing. The only criticism I have is that I feel the story wraps up to quickly, I would have loved another 50-75 pages of detail. So the simple truth is that I believe for his first full-length fiction novel Mr. Usle has shown himself to be a writer with talent. I hope that he will continue with his writing to give us more.Recently I sat down to reread this story as I wait for some of my other favorite writers to release a new book and still enjoyed the reading. The story is on par with West Wing and Commander and Chief. In today's interesting political climate this story will get you asking what you can personally do to change the course of politics in your town and beyond."},{"Title":"Prairie Fire","review":"This book deals with modern law in a rural setting. Mr. Usle has created a story of nature and politics. Farmers of the land vs. the law of the land. It is as if the reader is sitting on top of the proverbial water tank that towers above each small Midwestern town, a vantagepoint for this story of politics and common sense. Just as the photo of the author shows on the back, the water tank of Carthage in the background, I couldn't help but look up the historical details and see how ancient Carthage was a threat to the Roman Government and destroyed. However, not until Hannibal, a Carthagian general, had crossed the Alps with his troops and his war elephants. If I know the author, he was waxing philosophic with a twist of a good joke.It starts with an accident in the fields of wheat, in an area ecologically protected by State law. Under the risk of arrest, neighbors rally to the aid of this family's tragedy. As if a natural disaster, the story snowballs into a story of common people rebelling against the absurdity of politics and law - &quot;... The rulebook and bureaucracy are the first things to go when a tornado or flood hits a town.&quot;The comparison of a natural disaster to one that's manmade sums up the underlying theme of this book. The metaphor of the Mississippi River overflowing its banks, with the National Guard and townspeople struggling to keep it from destroying their town, is used to show the reaction of the same citizen to the manmade disaster of a broken parole system and the enforcement of absurd environmental law.I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories of common sense delivered with poignant irony."},{"Title":"Prairie Fire","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time.

Rather then reading some dry history book which would necessary have less feeling for the stories of individual people, Ashes and Diamonds tells history exactly by concentrating on the peculiar life stories of the main characters. It shows how the unsettled and chaotic situation of postwar Poland gave rise to some weird coalitions in politics, strange passions or totally unreasonable expectations of the people who had to live then. Since we can afford the luxury of informed hindsight and already know that by 1949 Poland became communist, it is interesting to watch Poland in the period when things were not at all clear yet."},{"Title":"Ashes and Diamonds (European Classics)","review":"Beautifully written historical novel reminds one \\"Look closely at what the future generations will see about passions and 'isms'of today."},{"Title":"Ashes and Diamonds (European Classics)","review":"Jerzy Andrzejewski's Ashes and Diamonds is a complete rip-off if you are in it for the diamonds. My copy only included the ashes part. After getting over the fact that I had been duped into buying all ashes and no diamonds, I began to enjoy the beauty of the ashes.Andrzejewski does a spectacular job in presenting ashes. The ashes in this book are the remains of Poland after the Second World War. The Poles seek to pick up the pieces of their war- torn country and move on towards a \\"new Poland\\", one that embodies freedom and happiness. However the road to this promised land is very elusive, and people often blindly pick sides in a new battle to define Poland. The result is only more ashes.The part of the book that really made it worth reading for me was its fresh look at the heart of mankind. In my opinion, Andrzejewski does not present a people who held on to morality and goodness through even the toughest of times. He presents a people who, when pressured, revealed the predominately black makeup of a human heart that allows a person to do evil in order to survive or merely to get ahead. Some characters deal with this blackness in themselves and in others, often feeling let down and confused. One example of this is in a conversation between Podgorski and Kossecki after the war is over. Kossecki is burdened after the war with the knowledge that, when in the camp, he did not behave as the honorable man he thought himself to be before the war. He took part in beating people to save his own hide. In their conversation, Kossecki looks for answers to make himself feel okay. Then Podgorski, speaking about the time before the war, says \\"People had confidence in themselves, in their courage and their morality. Certain things seemed impossible. Life then simply did not present such desperate alternatives. A man had a right to think of himself as decent and incapable of exceeding certain limits. Only criminals did so. But nowadays I've met so many people who broke down and failed this or that test that I don't attach much importance to what a man thinks of himself. Until a man faces the test he can deceive himself endlessly.\\" Kossecki is disappointed in the blackness of his own heart and Podgorski is disappointed in others who let him down. Through some character's painful realization that people are often not as good as they would like to believe, I was forced to ask myself how I would react in such horrible circumstances. Would a terrible situation reveal diamonds or ashes in my own heart? I believe Andrzejewski's greatest success in Ashes and Diamonds is his ability to make me question myself, even though the novel is set in a foreign land and in a time period I will never live in.However, in my opinion Andrzejewski does a poor job of developing the characters. There are just way too many of them to really know much at all about any of them (I counted 47). It is a pretty good sign that there are too many characters when you have to keep notes just to remember who the main characters are. It is possibly lacking in plot as well. Perhaps through predominately using dialogue and not action, Andrzejewski was attempting to offer a glimpse into the minds of the characters. If this is the case, he could have done a better job by limiting the number of characters and spending more time with each of them. It would seem that if a lot of dialogue was included at the expense of plot, we would at least know more about the characters. Unfortunately this is not the case.Overall, I enjoyed Andrzejewski's beautiful presentation of ashes. However, if he intended to complement the ashes with diamonds, I missed it. From the young gang of boys, about whom it would be hard to conjure up anything good to say, to the older party leaders who seemed lost and were often driven by personal success rather than by a desire for a free and happy people, they all seemed ashier than a lotionless Arab on a cold day.

But then again, Lladro related books are so rare, this itself is a jewel. Majority of the pictures shown here are the 'official' photographs of piece by Lladro themselves. It would have been great to see pictures taken by the author or owner as it would give a different angle and view of the pieces. I'm an avid collector and was thrilled to see many of the older pieces and read a short history about them in this book. Perhaps the author would consider to publish a newer edition?? And also source out Lladro examples from a more varied selection of collectors. A view of how they are stored in display cabinets at individual homes would be great too, to give a more personal and homely touch to the pieces. This is a great book and I'm sure it took a lot of effort to come out with it.... I would recommend it to anyone and hope that new editions will be published in the near future."},{"Title":"Collecting Lladro : Price & Identification Guide","review":"For anyone who is interested in learning more about Lladr&oacute;, the company, the history, the incredible artistry, &quot;relatives&quot; such as NAO and Zaphir, collecting and becoming better at collecting, and how to care for your collection, this book is fantastic and I highly recommend it!

I have since looked back on it a couple of dozen times. The pictures are wonderfully done and in color which is a very nice change from the black and white of the official price guide. The author has a love for Lladros that shows throughout the book. I learned a great deal from this book. The section on fakes was incredibly enlightening and will prove to be helpful if I ever run across one. The section about if a restoration is worth while was certainly a eye opener. There are pictures of all the marks Lladro has used over the years and when they used them. It was very interesting to find out that my collection consists of only two different artists' work. That was an aspect of collecting Lladro's I had never thought of before but certainly found my collection reflects it. I did not find it to be an advertisement for dealers in any way. There are several listed at the end of the book but I didn't see them throughout the book at all. In fact I found the sections on buying from retailers, brokers or auctions to be very unbiased and in no way leaning toward any certain dealer or broker. If anything I walked away from the book knowing that I would not buy from a broker unless I had a specific need that would make the added expense worthwhile for me. Well, to each their own I suppose but I cannot imagine someone who truly read this book coming away with the comments below.

Despite the new state's allegiance to the North, the population of West Virginia remained divided in its loyalties, as author John W. Shaffer has described in his other book, Barbour County, A Clash of Loyalties: A Border County in the Civil War. In his latest effort, Union and Confederate Soldiers and Sympathizers, Mr. Shaffer enumerates over 1,000 individuals who comprised the fractious community of Barbour County.Using official military records, the 1860 U.S. federal census, and a variety of other primary and secondary sources, the author lists 718 Union and 528 Confederate soldiers and sympathizers from Barbour County. These individuals are arranged by army and thereunder alphabetically. For each we learn the military unit (except for sympathizers), dates of service, duties, date of birth, names of parents, postwar occupation and other activities, and date of death. Mr. Shaffer's Introduction describes the background of the Civil War in Barbour County, while the Appendices specify the Union and Confederate units and military engagements in which Barbour citizens fought."},{"Title":"F.D.R.: My Exploited Father-In-Law","review":"If you ever want to learn how our Government REALLY works, read this book.

I have quite a few monographs on Sargent, and this one contains work which I have not seen before. It focuses on every aspect of his ouvre, from portraits, landscapes, genre, and figurative studies. Not only do the selected works represent the sensuality that eminates from Sargent's hand and mind, but the layout of the actual book reflects this also. The last section of the book is devoted to some of his male figure charcoal studies, which are incredibly inspiring. They are printed on laid paper (different from the rest of the book), and have a beautiful quality to them. Most of them are even different drawings than those reproduced in the &quot;Sargent: Male Nudes&quot; book. This is very refreshing to see, as the drawings bring us right into the studio with Sargent, almost looking over his shoulder while he renders the figure with unwavering power and finesse...."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"The reproductions of Mr. Singer's drawings are worth the price alone. A wonderful collection of work which needs to be in the library of all serious artists. The main thought of the text, however, makes an issue of Mr. Sargent's personal life regarding his sexual orientation which as depicted in this book may or may not be accurate. It saddens me when an author speaks in great authority on deeply personal areas of a celebrity when they never met the person and do not know if their theories are accurate.Other than that, there is a great deal of valuable information in the text which is very interesting in regards to giving insight into the history involving many of Mr. Sargent's paintings. The reproductions are very well done and the tonal studies in the back of the book are master courses on human form, anatomical structure, body movement and emotional impact.I highly recommend this collection of reproductions and must say the price is insignificant compared to the wealth of art inside. If you sketch his tonal drawings in your own hand, you will learn a great deal and open yourself to a new realm of artistic achievement. Mr. Sargent continues to earn respect for his artistic achievements which very few have attained."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"The current re-evaluation of the contributions of John Singer Sargent to the art of the USA, as indicated by the impressive exhibition \\"Sargent And Italy\\" currently in Los Angeles, the steady flow of new books about his work, and the academic resurgence of emphasis on his importance in American art at the turn of the last century - this re-evaluation has been truly underscored by this very fine book by Trevor Fairbrother. Written with great style and zest, the author explores the sensual nature of an artist once considered a 'society portraitist', a good painter but one more concerned with reaping the wealth from his gifts than in painting for art's sake. Well, bury that prejudice, as Fairbrother reveals Sargent's preoccupation with the human body, not only elegantly clothed but sensually nude. A fine example is \\"Nude Study of Thomas E. McKellar\\" in which Sargent paints his favorite African American model in a beautifully erotic pose.But the sensuality does not stop with the plethora of nude figure studies. Indeed, the author demonstrates how Sargent's compositions of landscapes and buildings as well as outdor and indoor groups of people are rendered with a sensual manipulation of light and pigment. And much time and discussion focuses on the famous painting 'El Jaleo' of a flamenco dancer barely visible in the artificial light of the stage, making her sensual movements of the hands and wrists ring like the music accompanying her.This well written book is lavishly illustrated with excellent color reproductions and gifts us with a significant body of work at book's end - a folio of male nudes called \\"Album of Figure Studies\\" which alone is worth the price of this superb volume.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"I was a disappointed by this book. Most of the reproductions lack luster and most of them are too small. To make matters worst, probably a third to half of the images are in black and white. What is the point of putting out a book on Sargent when we the readers can't enjoy his color palette? I can understand reproducing sketches in black and white, but to have finished paintings reproduced in black and white is totally absurd."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"After I graduated from art school, I realized I'd taken that massive library for granted, and that I was going to have to invest in my own art books if I wanted to retain them as a source of inspiration and instruction. Of the fine artists, Sargent was my first target, not just because of his exceptional art, but also because the apparent explosion of interest in his work that has occurred in the last decade or so means that books about him are easy to find. This is the second Sargent book I've purchased, and what I like best about it is the quality and variety of the reproductions: there are oil paintings both famous and obscure, lovely watercolors, and a nice collection of incredible nude figure drawings. While it is hardly a comprehensive view of Sargent's work, this is a great overview for anyone with a passing interest in the artist and a wonderful addition to any enthusiast's collection. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"Handsome and powerfully built, American painter John Singer Sargent (1856 - 1925) epitomized the versatility of the Realist approach. Noted for his luminous portraits of the wealthy and famous on both sides of the Atlantic, he astonished viewers and critics alike with his powers of observation and deft renderings. A visitor to his studio once noted that he had painted his model's scarf with one sweep of his brush.Trevor Fairbrother has prepared a rich and meticulous analysis of this expatriate painter in \\"John Singer Sargent,\\" a volume in Abrams' acclaimed Library of American Art Series. In his preface Fairbrother states, \\"I want this book to reflect the complexity of Sargent's affiliations and practices as an artist. I will try to provide a balanced representation of the man and his art, in the hope of understanding the unusual highs and lows of his reputation.\\" Fairbrother accomplishes these goals admirably.Born in Florence, educated in Florence and Dresden, influenced by Velasquez, Sargent's career as a portraitist began in Paris. He later settled in London where he maintained a rigorous schedule, adding watercolors and drawings to his expanding oeuvre. His portraits were commissioned by the Rockefeller family, statesmen, authors, and actors, enhancing Sargent's celebrity. It was argued snobbishly \\"that Sargent was most useful to people with new money or foreign blood who want to buy social recognition.\\"In a day that paid homage to power and physical beauty, very much as we do today, Sargent knew no peer. With some 100 illustrations and well crafted text, this beautiful volume represents him well.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"This is my 3rd book on Sargent purchased from Amazon so I might have been expecting something more. It's very well prepared, though I think that no painting should be printed in black and white! I found the few black and white images quite annoying actually. The rest of the book is well presented, but I found the occasional reference and clear bias about Sargent's private life is quite irrelevant for me."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"If you are a fan of Sargent, this is a must have book.

Fairbrother have done an unbiased work on Sargent. All his life, Sargent have always been attractive to the exotic, the bizarre, and the supernation and loved color and gaiety in his life. In his early paintings, he had painted many ethnic women including Rosina Ferrara, whom I've compared her to Chilli of TLC and I have two websites dedicated to both Chilli and Rosina Ferrara. He painted beautiful, lively gypsy women remininscent of Carmen, which was played around the same era as Sargent. His book is a wealth of pictures and sketches never seen before. Especially his book of nudes, which he had done when he wasn't busy painting wealthy patrons. He's interested in the masculinity of his models in his sketches. Those were very realistic and sensual.His book's a treat for those who are really interested in the brilliant artist in the person of JSS."},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"Singer es un pintor a quien debe verse en vivo en los museos; el &uacute;nico inconveniente que encuentro en el libro es su tama&ntilde;o, esas pinturas se disrutan mucho m&aacute;s en formatos m&aacute;s grandes"},{"Title":"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist","review":"I have not seen this particular book so ignore my rating. Sargent was a genius, plain and simple, and I love his work. As for his sexual orientation, perhaps he never got married because he didn't wish to-from all reports I've read, he traveled in the company of family and good friends. As for his male nudes, Victorian 'morality' may have dictated his choice, as female nudes were considered obscene and disgusting by that society and any woman who posed for a nude study would have been ostracized, whereas male nudes were considered 'classic' because they were based on Greek and Roman archetypes. Other Victorian painters got around the taboo by placing nude women in classical settings. By the way, the Cincinnati Art Museum has one of his women, fully clothed of course, and she is hot."},{"Title":"CURSE OF THE SQUIRREL (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))","review":"This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read.

I am just starting to learn about Francis Schaeffer's writings. Edith's works always strike me as a little too wonderful to be totally true. She was Martha Stewart before Martha! I've read her daughter Susan's works, too, with the same feeling. L'Abri is a place I wish I could have experienced in my early adult years. It seems to take itself a little too seriously though.

It was called L'Abri, the French word for 'shelter,' because they sought to provide a shelter from the pressures of a relentlessly secular 20th century. As time went by, so many people came that others were called to join the Schaeffers in their work, and more branches were established.\\"In the book, Edith Schaeffer recounts the day that the name \\"L'Abri\\" came to the mind of her husband Francis Schaeffer (philosopher, prolific author), he said, \\"Let's call it L'Abri, and let these people know that they are welcome to come back and bring friends with them.\\"I first readL'Abriabout twenty-five to thirty years ago, and have dreamed since then of a ministry similar to L'Abri, one that would be about faithfully teaching God's word and living God's truth, day by day, starting out of our home, or small- to medium-sized working farm or retreat, where our day-to-day living -- whatever that included -- would be part of the teaching, part of the ministry. Recently, the dream has been coming into clearer focus and continues to clarify, pending God's go-ahead, or \\"green light,\\" but I do see how He has been preparing us for this or something like this for many, many years. God's timing is perfect.At the time I first read this book, I was so inspired by Edith Schaeffer herself that I read every book she had written that I could get my hands on, which as I recall includedThe Hidden Art of HomemakingandWhat is a Family?, and I enjoyed both of them very much.

But it, too, is a fascinating read, and well worth the effort of tracking down -- especially for other K-L fans, but for any student of history, politics, religion, or culture.Anyone familiar with K-L's later works will find many of the themes of those works being developed here. Although (as I realized with a shock about half way through the book) K-L was just 34 when this was published, his distinctive style is already fully developed: assertive, contrarian, polyglot, unapologetically Catholic, and richly sourced and documented. He already has his favorite quotes, his favorite examples, his favorite turns of phrase.And yet, while this book is recognizably K-L, there are many valuable arguments in \\"The Menace of the Herd\\" that make it far more than just a first-draft of \\"Liberty or Equality\\" or \\"Leftism.\\" His central point is a dramatic challenge to \\"herdism\\" and mass democracy (or \\"ochlocracy,\\" as he calls it), in which all positive virtues are overwhelmed the lowest-common-denominator of simple majoritarianism. The positive virtues, for K-L, include piety, aristocracy, responsibility, personalism (which he distinguishes from \\"individualism\\"), and, of course, Catholicism.Within this argument, K-L makes many smaller points that any thoughtful reader will want to turn over in her mind carefully. These include a fascinating discussion of the classical Christian view of rewards in eternity versus happiness in the here-and-now (and how this affects life in predominantly Catholic nations); the harm caused by the modern educational focus on \\"how\\" (science, math) instead of \\"why\\" (philosophy, theology); the myth of militarism and nationalism as conservative or \\"rightist\\" movements (K-L calls this, in caps, the Great Error of the Century); and much more. Just as intriguing and thought-provoking are his asides and footnotes, including the relative sinfulness of despotism versus mob rule, the differences between \\"statism,\\" \\"nationalism,\\" \\"racialism,\\" \\"patriotism,\\" and \\"imperialism,\\" and this gem: \\"Neither are the progressivists, in present-day America, revolutionaries or enemies of the order.

It more than repays the time and money."},{"Title":"The menace of the herd: Or, Procrustes at large (Studies in conservative philosophy)","review":"Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (1909-1999)was one of the few thoughful men who carefully diagnosed what was wrong with mass decomracy and the political adoration of mass men. Mr. Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (K-L for the sake of convenience)clearly saw what nationalism, socialism, and anti-cliricalism had done and what these ideas would do if not checked. To say this reviewer appreciated the book is an understatement.K-L knew that the political approval word \\"democracy\\" was nothing more than what the Ancient Greeks called Ochlocracy or mob rule against dissenters and those seen as a threat to the \\"common man\\" whatever that term means. K-L compares and contrasts Catholic Europe and the Catholic Hapsburg Empire with Europe especially in the second half of the 19th. century and 20th. century. K-L remarked that Germans, Masgyars (Hungarians), Polish, etc. lived in relative harmony in spite of language and cultural differences. Yet the concepts of nationalism and racialism plus socialism altered this stable state of affairs. K-L asserts that the unity of the Catholic Church helped curb any animosity because almost all Europeans were bound by the Catholic Faith. K-L was very clear that he is a staunch Catholic and asserts Catholic religious and intellectual concepts to make his case. For example, Catholic religious authorities and theologians repeatedly argued in favor of free will which some Protestant leaders denied. For example, John Calvin (1509-1564)and his European supporters preached the idea of predestination which meant that men and women were predestined to paradice or hell before they were born. Luther (1483-1546)argued that men and women were so depraved that they could not help being vile and evil. Yet, the Catholic Church which certainly believed in Original Sin still argued than men and women could improve themselves by acts of kindness, love, decisions re good and evil, etc.One may justly ask how all this affected modern ideologies. K-L stated that men and women should be resentful toward anyone who by intelligence, character, etc. and use mob rule to subdue their neighbors in the name of democracy, nationalism, etc. In other words, demogogues used their influence to inflame race, ethnic, and social class hatred to destroy those considered better. People were a lost cause when standing on their own, but demogogues urged men to identify with their race, ethnic group, or economic class to gain \\"self worth\\" as a member of a group regardless of what outrages mass men committed.Such idiocy emerged at the Versailles Peace Conference (1919)when the deomcratically elected leaders yeilded to passions of hatred and revenge rather than a reasoned peace to prevent future wars. K-L wrote devestating criticism of Pres. Wilson, Lloyd George of Great Britian, Clemencau of France, and their equally ignorant advisers. These men, especially Pres. Wilon, knew next to nothing about Euroepan History, culture, or Georgraphy. As a result, they coerced a settlement on the Germans that was simply stupid. As K-L stated, they did nothing about the dismemberment of the Hapsburg Empire which made Eastern Europe wide open for domination by either the newly created Soviet Union or a revived Germany. To prevent the Russians or Germans from dominating Eastern Europe, a cornerstone of British foreign policy was to prevent either German or Russian penetration into this area. As K-L stated in this book, the Versailles Peace Conference made such an event almost inevitable. One easily state so much for the intelligence of the \\"victors'\\" intelligence.K-L also had a good assessment of Fascism and Communism and Fascism. He convincely argued that the aims of the leaders of these movements were quite similar. For example, many of the Fascist leaders wanted to make everyone the same by expanding and eliminating races and ethnic groups. The Communists wanted to expand by reducing everyone to the same social and political level. Both isms wanted basically same thing even if everyone had to be poor and common or eliminated. Any dissenters were quickly eliminated for opposing the democratically leadership and their insane, evil concepts.K-L also had interesting comments re the Industrial Revolution and mass democracy. He argued that the common man could not possibly understand the complexity of industrial technology, and K-L reluctantly stated that men were compelled to the rule of experts rather than democratically leaders who would follow the wishes of voters completely ignorant of industrial and technical complexities. K-L wrote that the only solution was to hope for honest and farsighted experts and hoped that the best men would staff bureaucracies. Otherwise, bureaucrats would be the willing tools of totalitarian leaders.Readers should realize that this book was published in 1943 in the middle of WW II. K-L made appeals for a just peace and one that would not involve mass murders, mass deportations, and unheard of revenge. He obviously did not get his wish. Howoever, those who may claim K-L was naive are wrong. The book was written BEFORE the end of WW II and not after.K-L was also very aware that the US was not a classless society. He cites examples of what to \\"get ahead\\" and are willing to kill themselves to \\"get to the top.\\" He cited examples of superficial social registers whereby men and women would surrender all their self respect to he registered. In other words, social and economic differences were part of human nature in spite of racial or class warfare to the contrary. One only has to look at how well Soviet bureaucrats lived in the \\"Workers\\" Paradise.\\"K-L should have referred to Keynes' books titled THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF PEACE and REVISION of the Treaty (The Versailles Treaty of 1919) to enhance his case. Keynes vindicated K-L's thesis which this reviewer is sure that K-L knew of these books.Yet, this book is well worth reading. K-L was knowledgeable and impressed this reviewer with his knowledge of European History, US History, philosophy, etc. K-L was 34 when this book was published which belies his youth at the time. An interesting thought that K-L made that a lynch mob is a perfect example of pure democracy."},{"Title":"The menace of the herd: Or, Procrustes at large (Studies in conservative philosophy)","review":"_The Menace of the Herd_ is an early work by Erik von Kuhnelt-Liddehn (writing under the name Francis Stuart Campbell), the famous German Roman Catholic Rightist and anti-democrat, written near the end of the Second World War. The subtitle of this book is &#65533;Procrustes at Large&#65533;, and Kuhnelt-Liddehn bases his argument around the Greek myth of Procrustes who made individuals fit his bed by either stretching them or cutting off their legs &#65533; standing for inflexibility and the herdist desire for levelling. In this book, Kuhnelt-Liddehn shows the dangers of herdism &#65533; seen in democratic levelling, identitarianism, and collectivism &#65533; and opposes this to the traditional Christian principles emhasizing morality, personalism, liberty, aristocratism, and monarchy. The author writes much against the developments of modern man in both technology and government, with a pastoralist hankering for tradition, an agriculturally based life (including the tradition of private property), and religion as revealed in medieval society and in the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church. The author sees much in city life which lends itself to herdism and much in modern democracy which is really ochlocracy (&#65533;mob rule&#65533;). To the author, technological developments and modern &#65533;progress&#65533; have negative aspects which are so conveniently overlooked and hidden from view by their modern trumpeters. Opposed to these developments and to modern industrialized, democratized, levelled, and urbanized culture stands the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church, Christian morality, and the tradition of monarchy. The author&#65533;s advocation of monarchy may appear extreme; however, the author notes that a just monarch rules his subjects out of love (monarchy consists in loving obedience to a just monarch just as one may give oneself freely to a lover in love) and often in monarchies of the past individuals have enjoyed more liberties than in modern day democracies (which amount to ochlocracies). Many other thinkers of the past including Plato, Aristotle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and de Toquenville have found democracy (&#65533;tyranny of the masses&#65533; or &#65533;tyranny of the majority&#65533;) to be problematic. It is this worship of identity and conformism as opposed to difference and diversity as well as a levelling effect based on &#65533;equality&#65533; which crushes all difference and genuine diversity (as opposed to the false form of diversity which is merely egoistic individualism). This effect may be seen in both the movements of Communism and Fascism (and National Socialism) in which collectivistic, nationalistic, and identitarian (often racist) elements emerge to enforce sameness. In the second half of the book, the author turns his attention to both Germany and America with reference to recent history (the First and Second World Wars). The author finds much to criticize in the Second and Third Reichs of recent German history following the First World War. Against these regimes the author yearns for the Roman Catholic German empire free from herdist instincts gone mad. The author next turns his attention to England and what grew from its colonies, America &#65533; the United States and its republic. The author notes that America lacks a titled aristocracy and that this leads to a constant craving for success and achievement among its citizens. The author is critical of the democratic and herdist elements within American society and contrasts these elements with European society. Finally, the author turns his attention to the Second World War. The author notes that this war involves an epic conflict, but that it must be fought over &#65533;liberty&#65533; and not &#65533;democracy&#65533; (which in fact is more represented by the Axis forces, both Hitler and Mussolini being &#65533;democratically&#65533; elected and enjoying mass appeal). The author argues for a just peace and for a peace agreement with Germany that is both humane and truly Christian &#65533; as opposed to one which is based entirely on the lust for vengeance. Finally, the author contrasts a mere leader (such as Hitler or Mussolini or even the American President) who is a &#65533;man of the people&#65533; with a ruler, who often resides completely outside the people as in the old monarchical tradition. It is the herdist tendency in man which poses such a threat to his liberty and to his great traditions, prime among them the religious tradition embodied in Christianity, which the author argues so vehemently against. In an era which has seen the rise of totalitarian regimes, it is important that we heed the words of individuals like Kuhnelt-Liddehn (a.k.a. Samuel Francis Capbell) in our assessment of the dangers of democracy and the readiness with which man can surrender his liberties and give into the rule of the mad mob, i.e. ochlocracy. Since the French Revolution, egalitarian and democratic tendencies have proliferated within government and their dangers must be noted as we witness the rise of totalitarian regimes with full support of the people. Like all his books, _The Menace of the Herd_ abounds in obscure references and useful quotes and pieces of information and reveals the author's learning and profound mind. Complete with footnotes and appendix this book offers a challenging assessment of the modern world and man's need to overcome his base (herdist) instinct."},{"Title":"The menace of the herd: Or, Procrustes at large (Studies in conservative philosophy)","review":"I'm a big, big fan -- I should say, a devoted student -- of Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (1909-1999), author of a great many articles and books, including \\"Liberty or Equality?\\" and \\"Leftism Revisited,\\" books I've been putting off reviewing for many years for fear I couldn't do them justice. \\"The Menace of the Herd,\\" published under a pseudonym in 1943 (when Americans were not too interested in reading books by authors with Germanic names, and people from occupied countries had families to protect), is less well known than the two books just mentioned. But it, too, is a fascinating read -- especially for other K-L fans, but for any student of history, politics, religion, or culture. The invaluable folks at the Mises Institute are to be commended and thanked for making it available once again.Anyone familiar with K-L's later works will find many of the themes of those works being developed here. Although (as I realized with a shock about half way through the book) K-L was just 34 when this was published, his distinctive style is already fully developed: assertive, contrarian, polyglot, unapologetically Catholic, and richly sourced and documented. He already has his favorite quotes, his favorite examples, his favorite turns of phrase.And yet, while this book is recognizably K-L, there are many valuable arguments in \\"The Menace of the Herd\\" that make it far more than just a first-draft of \\"Liberty or Equality\\" or \\"Leftism.\\" His central point is a dramatic challenge to \\"herdism\\" and mass democracy (or \\"ochlocracy,\\" as he calls it), in which all positive virtues are overwhelmed the lowest-common-denominator of simple majoritarianism. The positive virtues, for K-L, include piety, aristocracy, responsibility, personalism (which he distinguishes from \\"individualism\\"), and, of course, Catholicism.Within this argument, K-L makes many smaller points that any thoughtful reader will want to turn over in her mind carefully. These include a fascinating discussion of the classical Christian view of rewards in eternity versus happiness in the here-and-now (and how this affects life in predominantly Catholic nations); the harm caused by the modern educational focus on \\"how\\" (science, math) instead of \\"why\\" (philosophy, theology); the myth of militarism and nationalism as conservative or \\"rightist\\" movements (K-L calls this, in caps, the Great Error of the Century); and much more. Just as intriguing and thought-provoking are his asides and footnotes, including the relative sinfulness of despotism versus mob rule, the differences between \\"statism,\\" \\"nationalism,\\" \\"racialism,\\" \\"patriotism,\\" and \\"imperialism,\\" and this gem: \\"Neither are the progressivists, in present-day America, revolutionaries or enemies of the order. Being 'radical' or 'progressive' they merely want to continue with greater speed and determination along the established, wrong trail\\" [p. 218].At the same time, K-L posits some arguments that may well make his conservative and libertarian fans uncomfortable. These include a strong argument against \\"capitalism\\" as a \\"herdist\\" instinct, and the above-mentioned opposition to \\"individualism,\\" as distinguished from \\"personalism.\\" At one point, K-L argues that advertising increases the cost of consumer goods -- a point Mises effectively took apart in chapter 15 of \\"Human Action.\\" Interestingly, in some of his later writings K-L backed away from some of these earlier arguments, concluding that the elusive \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism was not in fact possible.Finally, since this book was published in the middle of World War Two, I should note that it contains a fascinating discussion of German and Austrian history, and a study of the cultures and characteristics of \\"the Germanies,\\" that put both world wars in a new and highly intriguing light for me.\\"Liberty and Equality\\" and \\"Leftism Revisited\\" are both, as I've noted elsewhere, books that I return to again and again, trying to absorb the learning and the perspective and get my mind around arguments and insights that are highly counter-intuitive for many Americans -- even contrarians like me -- steeped as we are in a culture that worships \\"democracy\\" and the \\"common man\\" above all else. \\"Menace of the Herd\\" now takes its place beside those other books. I strongly encourage any of my fellow K-L students to add this to your library.

This historical fiction triology portrays Josephine with alot of heart and compassion. This is a must read, even if you haven't read the previous two books. I commend Sandra Gulland on her creation.

The Last Great Dance on Earth was captivating, most other historical fiction novels are very dry and slow. This story captured the reader in the beginnng and Josephine's experiences kept the interest level high. From the introduction of historical character to events that shaped this time period, Gulland shows the human side of history. She allows the reader to experience early nineteenth century France though the vivid description of the beautiful castles. &quot;The light streaming in the brightly coloured windows, the enormous tapestries, the painted backdrops, pigeons swooping high above the glittering crowd.&quot; The language Gulland used captivated the reader's heart as she concluded the marriage between Napoleon and Josephine. The words she used in their divorce ceremony brought tears to my eyes. Napoleon's declaration began, &quot;She has adorned fifteen years of my life.

The dissolution of my marriage will make no change in the feelings of my heart.&quot; This book will remain one of my favorites. A beautiful end to a beautiful trilogy, Gulland made this period of history a page turning suspense. Although not completely historically accurate, Josephine was known to have slight infidelities of her own, Last Dance captures the heart.

Great series! I read this one in a night.This third and final installment marked the final chapters in the life of Josephine, beginning with Napoleon's reign of power and ending with Josephine's death.Each page is filled with stories of Napoleon's love, their mutual passion, and Josephine's strength in the face of adversity. It was inspiring to discover how much she endured. Despite the difference in time periods, I think many of Josephine's trials (infidelity, anger, sacrifice) are relevant today. This is an inspiring book to read if you're going through a difficult time.I still can't believe how fast a read this is -- how compelling -- how interesting.

It paints a portrait of a fascinating woman. The reader finishes the book with an understanding of how little control even the most powerful people have over their own lives.

I actually found this volume before reading the others, but have now bought the trilogy, since the style and quality is so fluid and easy to read.Josephine's point of view is certainly compassionate in regard to Bonaparte, as well as forgiving. The book consists of her journal entries describing the success and coronation of the couple as Emperor and Empress of France. What has begun as a &quot;people's revolution&quot;, gradually takes the form of a benign monarchy as Napolean models his court after other royal courts, albeit Kings and Queens. The attendant corruption is not surprising, as the struggle for power changes hands with flattery and deceit.In Napolean's mind &quot;blood is all&quot;, and the extensive and greedy Napolean clan take full advantage, while Josephine is unable to bear a royal successor. There is unremitting intrigue in the court until Josephine agrees to step aside in order that Napolean may divorce her and re-marry, in hopes of fathering a son. While there is no question that this diary is written with a bias towards Josephine's defense, the scenes are well-written, dramatic and intense. I seldom read novels in a diary format, but found this engaging and informative."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I love these historical novels. Sandra Gulland has history and imagination and great writing skills going for her. I just finished this book and can say only a few things since I am still more with Josephine than with myself: She's really entered the mind and heart of another woman, another era.

Love ordering from this site."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"The Last Great Dance on Earth, by Sandra Gulland (Third book of the Jospehine B. Trilogy)...Josephine and Bonaparte have just gotten married...I'm often asked if it's possible to read this book without having read the previous two. First of all, the three volumes in the trilogy are a continuation of eachother. So, in order to appreciate the story in full, you need to read all three. Josephine's life takes such dramatic turns that it almost seems as though she lived three lives in one. Almost like three powerful novels culminating in The Last Great Dance on Earth. This one, I felt, was truly a touching and emotional read.As the first two, the third volume is also written in diary form. In this book however, Sandra Gulland, develops the memoirs even further, without ever altering them. For me, this brought Josephine to life, closer than imaginable. From the beginning of this book, Gulland lures the reader further and further in, until you become totally captivated by Josephine's life.It was impossible not to befriend Josephine. Her letters called out to me and I often thought myself to be her priveleged confidante. Gulland skilfully captures our emotions throughout these letters. This can be seen in: Josephine's unsuccessful and painful ordeals to have Napoleon's baby; Bonaparte's family's disdain for her as well as their scheming plans to rid themselves of her; Josephine's loneliness; Her pain and humiliation while enduring Bonaparte's affairs; Her resilience, sacrifice and surrender for the name of love and a greater purpose...and more.I was able to feel Josephine's emotions throughout the book. At certain points, I even became angry at her for accepting Napoleon's affairs; but this didn't last for long. Despite my views, somehow, I made exceptions for Josephine. I understood her reasons and also came to accept them. She understood Napoleon's greater purpose and all that it entailed. She understood that he was a man like no other, \\"Je le veux\\"- and he conquered. Her voice, feelings and motives came through clearly throughout this historical novel. Very often, I become teary-eyed when reading about the lives of historical figures- but with Josephine, I caught myself sobbing...several times (as though I'd learned about this for the first time). Josephine's love, tenderness, understanding and total devotion to Napoleon, her man, came first, above all else.Besides her great love for Napoleon, Josephine's tremendous love for her children is constant throughout the book. The detail in portraying Josephine as a caring and encouraging mother who stood by her children in their every decision, made her all the more endearing to me. The way Josephine cared for Hortense through her painful family tragedy and marital problems - Her willingness to take care of her grandchildren when Hortense needed her most- her children could always depend on her to be there.Eugene and Hortense's letters to her are filled with caring words that reveal love and concern. There is a clear sense of their close and loving relationship in the way they all interact with eachother. They are together and united in every decision, regardless of their own personal feelings; the Divorce being a perfect example of this, as well as, their unity in accepting and welcoming Bonaparte's decision to marry Marie Louise.These unbelievably difficult situations which must have required an enormous sense of loyalty, love and acceptance, continuously surface the story to emphasize the passionate life that Josephine lived. And in the end, Eugene's touching letter announcing the death of his beloved mother to Bonaparte, addressed: Sire, Emperor (Papa), completely moved me to tears. I know it's history, and I've read this all before; Even so, The Last Great Dance on Earth is now forever sealed within my heart.Up until her death, Josephine only wanted what was best for her Bonaparte, the man who \\"had inspired her to believe once again in heroes, in destiny, but above all in the miracle of love\\". p.4Passionate times, beautiful details, sorrowful moments, love beyond boundaries- Bringing history to life, The Last Great Dance on Earth is an exceptional book."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I'm almost 40 and I'm new to the reading world, although I know how to read well and I've always been a keener with good grades in english somehow I managed to go through school without reading a single novel, I just didn't read it and that really brought my grade down. I've never - until recently read novels or much of anything else... When I began to read earlier this year- the feeling was euphoric. It was the discovery of this treasure I was surrounded with and never knew... Now I love, love, love to read. I've collected so many books I'm sure it'll take a few years to get through. I started shallow splashing around with light reads such as Sophie Kinsella, Emily Griffin and soon dove in deep and gravitated toward historical fiction. I enjoyed this trilogy a lot. Although I know Josephine was going to die in the end, it didn't stop me from crying (something I try to avoid if I can)... Any suggestions for other interesting reads, please let me know. I suggest this set, it was wonderfully written... As well I enjoyed Ken Follet's \\"pillars of the earth\\" I have't yet started the follow up \\"a world without end\\" I also enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's books... Until I read Sandra's books of Josephine I knew little of Napoleon. It has sparked my curiosity and I research online to learn more about Napoleon, Josephine and the others. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"While this book stands out on it's own merits, you would be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't read the first two books in the trilogy first ('The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B.' and 'Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe'). This is probably my favorite group of books and everyone I have let borrow them feels the same. All are well-written and easy reading (as well as interesting history). I am only sorry that Sandra Gulland hasn't written any other books...yet. I keep hoping."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"This book wrapped up the story of Napoleon &amp; Josephine very well. I found myself truly caring what happened to this couple. The only drawback was the fact that the author didn't go into Josephine's life toward the end--the book just ended and then there was a postscript. I would highly recommend the entire series."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I loved this book! All three of the &quot;Josephine trilogy&quot; are excellent. I learned more about Napoleon and Josephine, and indeed, the French Revolution, than I ever dreamed possible and it was all done in an exciting and very readable way. Bring on more my Sandra Gulland."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"If you've read the first two of Sandra Gulland's novels, this one will provide a very satisfying end to the saga of Josephine. After reading a factual account of Napoleon and Josephine, I realized that these novels put a somewhat exxagerated romantic spin on the last years of their relationship, but it makes for great reading. Hope she writes more books like these."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"The Last Great Dance on Earth is a novel that allows you to gain a better understanding of the reign of Empress Josephine while being extreamly enjoyable. The last book, in the trilogy, follows through to the beginning of Bonaparte as First Counsel to his exhile to Elba through the eyes of Josephine.During this novel you join Josephine for the last 14 years of her life from the highs of royalty and the lows of not being able to produce a heir to the throne.This is a novel that has opened the world of history to me and now i no longer see it as a bore, but more as an interest. I recommend this novel to anyone who loves a classic love story as it will be sure to bring a tear."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"How does Sandra Gulland do it? This well-researched, well-written trilogy will score her legions of fans everywhere. The history was presented in an interesting interpretation through the eyes of a historical character often ignored....Thank you, Sandra Gulland, for writing these books!"},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"This book was an excellent conclusion to the trilogy, I literally could not put it down. I found Josephine's love for her children and for Bonaparte to be amazing. The work put into this book really pays off. It is by far the best written series I've ever read. The letter from Eugene at the end of the book is the best possible way to conclude it, without having read the first two you would still sob at reading this."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"A perfect ending to a wonderful trilogy. Gulland has clearly done her research and France comes alive through the eyes of Josephine Bonaparte. Compassionate, kind and well-loved in France, Josephine also gives us a very intimate and sympathetic insight to Napoleon Bonaparte. I enjoyed this whole series and would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in the French Revolution, the French Republic and the rise of Napoleon. It is engrossing, humorous and heart-rending. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"I can't express how much I loved this wonderful novel. The most accurate adjective I can think of would be 'interesting'. This book was soooo interesting. Gulland's attention to detail is absolutely meticulous. She used over 400 sources in the writing of this trilogy. I learned so much--not only about Napoleon and Josephine, but also of other historical figures of that time. I also found the daily life of the aristocracy not only fascinating but also exhausting.Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine Beauharnais are some of the most intriguing characters in history. Their story is so compelling and Gulland does a wonderful job of presenting it. Her 'Josephine' trilogy tells the story of Marie-Josephe-Rose Tascher (Beauharnais Bonaparte) who was born on the French Caribbean island of Martinique in 1763. She died, as she was still known, as the Empress Josephine at her beloved Malmaison in Paris in 1814. THE LAST GREAT DANCE ON EARTH begins in March 1800 at the Tuileries Palace in Paris and ends at her death. But, Gulland has a special treat for her readers. She ties up all the loose ends by telling us what happens to all the characters in her novel. I loved that! In fact, I was taking a tour a couple of weeks ago in St. Augustine, Florida and the guide told us that this is where Napoleon Bonaparte's brother came to....I now know that it was Jerome. The author also has a chronology with detailed accounts and dates of events in the last fourteen years of Josephine's life. Gulland also used actual letters of the pair in this book. And again, the pages are peppered with footnotes that add credence to this story.In book three we're treated to more of the deep and abiding friendship of Josephine and Napoleon. The love they had for each other is legendary. Napoleon was a wonderful father to Hortense and Eugene and they also adored him. But Josephine had to put up with her horrid in-laws, their jealousy and constant designs of destroying her marriage, their lies and the constant undermining--geesh, she was more patient than I could have been. They eventually succeeded. Despite going through horrible and archaic treatments for infertility, Josephine could not conceive. As we all know, Napoleon divorced her in order to gain an heir. Even then, they continued their friendship and love.I have been mesmerized with Napoleon and Josephine since visiting the Lourve for the first time as a college freshman and falling in love with David's \\"The Coronation of Napoleon.\\" Then, after visiting the famous, albeit headless statue of the former Empress at her birthplace in Martinique, my curiosity became insatiable. We learned that Josephine's head was cut off because she influenced her husband to reinstate slavery. I was hoping to read an explanation in these novels but it was never mentioned (although Martinico is mentioned quite often). Which comes to another point: Gulland mentions that researching the lives of Napoleon and Josephine is addictive; I've already bought two more books, maybe I'll find the answer to my question!"},{"Title":"The Last Great Dance on Earth","review":"In this third book in the series, the whole tragedy of Josephine's life unfolds. First she goes through her husband's meteorite rise to power and is moved from a big Palace to an even bigger one. She is forced to hire more than thirty people to work for her and becomes, step by step, a queen. Until she is crowned empress of France. Her prediction is fulfilled but she also remember the old voodoo woman said it would be for a short time...She also acquires what will be her most loved house: Malmaison where she will spend her last days.As we know, in the end Bonaparte divorces Josephine because as emperor he must have an heir and she is incapable on having any more children. So she has to leave him when she loves him the most and suffers his losses in war. At the end, she dies not being able to see him but knowing he has been vanished to Elba.Once again, a great book."},{"Title":"GRAND CANARY.","review":"The change of scene novel seemed to be a staple among the mainstream novelists of the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those who hovered, as Cronin did, in the nether regions between the merely popular novelist and the &quot;literary&quot; novelist. In Grand Canary, we see some of the stock devices of Cronin novels--a driven young doctor, the caustic impact of passion, the struggle for redemption. Yet, instead of the outward struggle through medical school and inward struggles amid doubt, Catholicism and Protestantism which usually informs a Cronin novel, we are here exposed to a trip to the Canary Islands. This is rather a stark contrast from the Irish and English scenes more familiar to Cronin readers, and the book's atmospherics seek to invoke a certain &quot;other-island-worldiness&quot;. One cannot help but note that Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh in this era were both using exotic locale as a canvass for resolution of a spiritual inward conflict, and it is quite safe to say that this is nowhere near as satisfying in evoking an exotic place as, say, Greene's Power and the Glory. But for those of us who enjoy a Cronin novel, such academic discussion is of secondary importance--the real question is whether the novel is a good read. The answer is simple: Cronin's use of locale and certain &quot;mystical&quot; elements detracts from the reader's interest in his characters. We have precognitive dreams, yellow fever, destined encounters of newly enchanted lovers, a missionary gone astray in a first exposure to the pleasures of the flesh, and the victim of unrequited love martyring herself in the name of familial duty. It's all rather like a parody of a Somerset Maugham tropical clime short story, except that we have Cronin's idiosyncratic faith-based vision rather than Maugham's skepticism putting the puppets through their paces. The novel is by no means a bad read--some of the characters are quite intriguing, if a bit &quot;set piece&quot; in design. But the plot devices and cardboard side players are less than we expect from Cronin, and perhaps less than we expect from ourselves when we seek out light fiction to read."},{"Title":"GRAND CANARY.","review":"Although this book was not as interesting as many of Cronin's other books(The Citadel, The Green Years, etc.), it was pretty good. It tells the story of a doctor accused of malpractice who went on a cruise in the canary islands to calm down and escape publicity. On the boat, he meets the young, beautiful, Mary Fielding, and they obviously fall in love. He is later given a chance to save her life and be the wonderful doctor he always was. The plot is rather boring and predicatable, but the characterization is excellent. All the people he meets on the boat are very interesting and that is the strong point of the book. I recomend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Cronin's other book, but don't expect anything too wonderful."},{"Title":"GRAND CANARY.","review":"Now I know why I always liked AJ Cronin.This book was up to his usual standards,and anyone who has experienced defeat in the healthcare fields can feel the protagonist's pain.We see someone who started out trying to drink himself to death finding his focus,even love,and proving himself worthy to continue in his chosen profession,and even learning the truth after facing great despair and ostracism."},{"Title":"Chi Kung: Increase Your Energy, Improve Your Health","review":"This book provides a very easy to follow guide to Chi Kung.

Rory Fallon and his partner Bruno have been living at the Venetian Vistas for about two years, when one morning, they meet Austin Harden, his wife Meg and their two young boys Noah and Josh.Lately Meg has become the \\"boss\\" of the family, an aggressive corporate lawyer, and a self-admitted perfectionist; Meg is working hard to provide an elegant and stylish \\"trophy\\" home for her devoted husband and her children. Austin has just been retrenched, a victim of downsizing, he now spends most of his days loafing around, working part time pushing medical equipment whilst ferrying Noah and Josh between school and soccer practice.Rory and Bruno have been off and on since college. Together for nearly seventeen years, they built a life together, spending their years living in family type neighborhoods as Bruno steadily works his way up the corporate ladder. They're both the first to admit they've never met more than a handful of neighbors, certainly none that needed anything other than a nod or smile in the way of interaction.At first, the arrival of Meg and Austin is seen as a refreshing change. Austin even remembers Rory and Bruno from his college days, and sees them as curiously insular and comfortably coupled now as they had been then. He makes an instant connection with Rory, drawn to the younger man's youthful vulnerability and artistic temperament.Meg, on the other hand, presents a veneer of pleasant respectably that thinly disguises her scathing homophobia. \\"Who'd ever thought we'd have gays for neighbors\\" she comments to Austin. And when she sees the two men out by their pool, she worries her sons might have full view of their lifestyle.To Meg, homosexuality is an anathema - what kind of life is that no matter how devoted to each other - \\"no kids to love and raise; it just goes against the grain somehow.\\" As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to pursue separate agendas, uniting in an addiction, determined pursue a type of emotional and sexual reinforcement.One night, keeping a vigil at his office window, Austin spies Rory and Bruno making love. The incident ignites deep-seated and acutely closeted passions within him. The sight of Rory and Bruno's romantic coupling turning him on in a deeply \\"male kind of way;\\" their activities don't disgust him because they are personal, just as his interest is personal.Austin's desire to be physical with Rory increases, growing from a mild distraction into an ever-increasing itch and he becomes ever more open to the possibilities of an abstract kind of sexual availability that Rory presents. He sees them both as outsiders, accoutrements to their respective partners whims. The friendship becomes intimate and in the growing sexual tension, Rory and Austin become embroiled in an affair, which will leave the weaker to suffer in stillness, an emotionally wrecked and confused man.In rich, languid and perfectly nuanced prose, author Jay Quinn traces the arc of each character as they are steadily transformed by their experiences living next door to each other. Neither Rory, Bruno, Austin or Meg are particularly sympathetic or likable characters, all are rather fickle, status conscious and materialistic, and all are almost always wounded by their own faults.Meg is perhaps the least likable. Hardened to the world of men, and often threatened by her husband and two boys - and the world masculinity she sees taking shape around her, she views the world through rose coloured glasses and is threatened by those she sees as different. Yet she's still a woman, and in one instance, she lets herself become flustered by Bruno's physical closeness, all too aware of Bruno's sweaty physicality and well-built mass.Bruno is the butch he-man, a truculent pig-headed egotist - he disparages Rory's efforts to forge a career in rap music and carries on as though he owns him. Rory, however, constantly plays second fiddle, relentlessly feeding Bruno's ego, telling him he loves him because that's what Bruno wants and needs to hear. His real love for Bruno is a fierce loyalty formed over their many years together.Materialism, masculinity and sexual fluidity are the central themes of The Good Neighbor, with Quinn ingeniously casting a unique spell over many of the assumptions and stereotypes that we tend make about suburban family life. These are shallow adults - both gay and straight - who've inadvertently mixed up sex, love and friendship, hoping that it all works out in a mature kind of way.Quinn's characters eventually discover, however, that what really hurts and what really kills is the sense of betrayal that ultimately comes along with messing in this kind territory. This is an elegant novel that mines the murky underbelly of sex and suburbia, where bigotry and acceptance do a delicate dance, often lying uneasily side-by-side.For Austin, there's a define price to be paid for touching and loving another male, and as these neighbors come full circle, his confusion appears to be far from resolved. Mike Leonard June 06."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"In an age of ongoing national debate regarding same-sex marriage, Jay Quinn's \\"The Good Neighbor\\" is a thoughtful look at modern-day marriage and brings home the idea that non-traditional marriage isn't really so different from traditional marriage after all.The story focuses on two upwardly mobile couples living in an upper-middle class Florida suburb. Austin and Meg Harden move into Venetian Vistas with their two sons in tow and are somewhat surprised to learn that their new neighbors are the Fallon-Griffin's, two middle-aged gay men. But, despite Meg's initial discomfort, the neighbors cross their respective property lines and relationships develop. Austin, reeling from the loss of his job and plagued with insecurities about not being able to fulfill the role of breadwinner for his family, strikes up a friendship with Rory (Fallon). These two unlikely friends quickly realize that they have much in common - from controlling, career-driven spouses to shared insecurities and unfulfilled dreams outside of the suburban box they find themselves painted into by life.Quinn takes the idea of neighbors crossing property lines and creates a cautionary tale of breached boundaries, as entanglements ensnare the four characters in an oft-uncomfortable yet believable way. Life and those we choose to share it with can be sticky, and Quinn doesn't shy away from exploring the effects of gender roles, bisexuality, infidelity, trust, and growing older on the modern marriage. This is a contemplative novel, and Quinn's prose is gentle and lulling. He has drawn believable characters and isn't afraid to make them flawed and imperfect, even ugly at times. But, in the end, the titular good neighbors are just like you and me - human. And it is in the humanity of Quinn's story that readers will leave Venetian Vistas feeling satiated from a simple, well-told story of everyday neighbors who could be yours or mine."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"My first review of The Good Neighbor for amazon.com was rejected. The absolute only reason I can think of is because I described major character Rory as \\"pussy whipped.\\" Let's see if this one goes through. The interesting thing about Jay Quinn's story is that a gay author makes the seemingly-straight married couple the sympathetic characters in this treatise about life in suburban, affluent South Florida. Austin (inexplicably called David in the editorial reviews on amazon.com) is fully developed and explained. His wife, Meg, a bit of a stereotype, is believable. Their kids are adorable. The hottest scene in the book is on page 183 between Austin and his son, Noah. On the other hand, the gay characters, Bruno and Rory are pathetic. Bruno is completely obnoxious. Rory, as described above, is weak, helpless and a real loser. What redeems the story is the totally authentic description of life in a gated community outside Ft. Lauderdale, right down to the description of the bakery delicacies at the local Publix. Ah, the color! Jay Quinn is a serious contemporary writer. I look forward to more of his work."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"On a quiet street in the luxury Southern Florida subdivision of Venetian Vistas, living next to each other are two couples who seem very different at first, but actually have much in common.There is Austin Harden, his wife Meg and their two sons Noah and Josh. While Meg is a partner in a prestigious lawfirm, Austin plays \\"Mr. Mom\\" for the two boys, working out of his home on a sales job, following having been downsized from a corporate \\"dot-com\\" executive position. They moved into their house almost two years after their neighbors, Will \\"Bruno\\" Griffin, a fast-tracking investment analyst for a national company, and his lover, Rory Fallon, a home-based electrical design consultant. After introducing themselves the day the Hardens moved in, Rory and Austin run into each other often, since they are both home most of the time, and they become friends. Rory and Bruno are thankful that their new neighbors nor their kids seem to have any hangups about the fact that they are gay, although they are a little concerned that Austin seems to be overly curious about what they do, watching from his upstairs office window. Meanwhile, Austin is facing the reawakening of bisexual yearnings he thought he left behind many years ago. When Rory becomes upset with Bruno over the revelation that he had an affair with a female co-worker while on a business trip, and this coincides with a time when Austin is feeling especially emasculated by his wife being the family's breadwinner, it throws the two of them together in such a way that threatenns to destroy the lives they have built with their respective mates.As in his previous novels, Quinn shows a keen skill in portraying realistic, emotionally-complete characters, and expertly explores the dynamics of the two couples, and how one can feel alone even when in a relationship. He further nails the nuances of masculine pride, sexual curiousity, jealousy and betrayal that can be at work in a couple's relationship, without preaching or bemoaning the need for fidelity as necessary for everyone. A bit simplistic, perhaps, but an effective parable for our times. I give it four stars out of five."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"After seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon, I thought, \\"why not, I'll read it and see.\\" But as someone who reads profusely and minored in English Lit. in college, this is one of the worst-written books I have ever read. There was so much potential, but not much came of it. No one in the book is likeable: Rory is whipped and dumb, Bruno is a total jerk, Meg is a pain, and Austin is confused and stays that way. The only characters I liked are Meg and Austin's two young boys, who we don't see enough. This book couldn't have ended fast enough for me. If you want to read something great, try some Paul Russel, Alan Hollinghurst, or Edmund White."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Quinn, always perceptive and able to offer us characters of depth and complexity, has presented in \\"The Good Neighbor\\" a fascinating story of considerable maturity and acceptance. The principle characters are multi-dimensional and the plot goes places I had not expected. A book Quinn should be very proud of; a book I'd like to read for the first time, again."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"This book was a curious mix of bland lifestyles in a Suburban setting and modern relationships. I found it difficult to get involved since the characters seemed to have no interests. In its favour Quinn did explore contemporary issues and attitudes about gay couples from the differing perspectives of the Harden family. Bruno and Rory, now 40, have been in a settled relationship for 17 years. They have been living in a new affluent suburban development for two years when the Harden family: Austin and Meg and their two sons Noah (13) and Josh (6) move into the new house next door. Bruno and Meg are the successful professionals whereas Rory and Austin have limited work schedules, no friends or activities and personalities constrained by their more dominant partners. This book improved in the last third as Quinn finally gave his rather two dimensional characters some substance. An adequate light holiday read but it is likely to put you off living in a South Florida suburb no matter how affluent!!"},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"While looking for some non-erotica gay literature, I came upon this book and gave it a chance. I found it hard to put this book down. Very engrossing and not overly detailed, nor is it too skimpy on details. The characters, though few and sometimes predictable, are very well-drawn, and the story is told in a very light-hearted way. There are a couple downsides to the book overall: numerous punctuation errors and spelling mistakes. We are taught in English classes that \\"alright\\" is all wrong. It is spelled \\"all right\\" and I wish to goodness that more people would be aware of this. But do these things interfere with the story or make it difficult to follow? Thankfully, no. It is a fine gay drama without the glitter and poppers and raunchy sex one so often finds in other less restrained novels. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"so far the book is dragging along for me , but hoping it will perk up and get better, cant review the entire book as I have struggled to get to page 67 and am hoping it gets better."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"I truly enjoy Jay Quinn as a writer and \\"The Good Neighbor\\" is the fourth novel (\\"The Beloved Son\\", \\"Back Where He Started\\", and \\"The Boomerang Kid\\") I've read but enjoyed a little less so than the others. The main characters in this particular novel were not entirely sympathetic or likeable although I felt I understood what drove each character's behavior. Also, what's with the cigarettes/smoking and Oxycontin fixation? I didn't notice it as much in \\"The Beloved Son\\"; however, it seems to be a recurring device threaded throughout Mr. Quinn's novels (I've read so far). At this point, it is more a curiosity for me rather than a complaint or objection - I imagine myself asking him if he happened to be at a book signing or reading.Regardless, the author has a real talent for unfolding a good story and capturing the rich nuances of Southern speak for his characters - I'm reminded of time spent in Morehead City, NC and Columbia, SC when reading the dialogue. I also appreciate what seems to be a caring study of relationships in his novels: parents, children, siblings, and longtime partners - both het and gay. \\"The Good Neighbor\\" certainly explores partner relationships and boundaries. Is it okay for one person in the relationship to have indiscretions while the loving, nurturing partner keeps their bond together by being so forgiving - justifying or excusing the action while ignoring their own hurt? Is this realistic or just an ideal? If one person (whether male or female) has the stronger personality in the relationship - will they or do they tend to emasculate their partner? In this story both the wife and alpha male partner seem to do so in their respective relationships, which could be construed as clich&eacute;, yet the author somehow manages to find some way to redeem them and/or the story just enough...maybe it is Southern charm. The protagonists in this particular novel may not be the most likeable, and it isn't my favorite Jay Quinn work, but I do think it is worth reading.

I thought all 4 characters were very interesting and the relationships that develop between them are beautiful and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"While I did think the book was very well written- if you're looking for heroes- or even just someone to like, you're not about to find it in this story. A couple of the characters are down-right terrible, and the funny part is, I think we're expected to identify with and like the remainder of them- but this reader did not. None of them live lives I'd wish to. And none of them lead lives or have experiences that I feel mirror my own in any way. In short, I felt like I was simply a brain-dead-bored voyeur sneaking looks thru the window of a pair of homes that I certainly would have walked away from, had I anything better to do at the time. Reading this book made me question why I wish to find love. If the love these folks have settled for is what my future holds- I'd rather remain single. Like the Reba song says: \\"I'd Rather Be Lonely, Alone\\"."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn is one of the best gay novelists out there today. There are many around but usually the quality of work provided is light, frothy somewhat superficial beach read material. Jay Quinn takes his work seriously and has a purpose with each novel he writes. He takes his role as author seriously and respectfully provides the reader with a quality, well written piece of literature while proving quality character profiles.Here he explores marriage, partnership, identity, self worth, masculinity and how we deal with all these things. We are taken to suburban South Florida and our main characters are two couples - Austin and Meg who are married with two sons and Rory and Will who are life partners. The two couples form a very close friendship and all four are very well developed characters. Austin and Rory in particular form a special, unique friendship as they seem to feel their indivividual identities wilting away as their respective partners careers and lives seem more on a forward track.Jay Quinn provides a very mature, adult perspective and holds nothing back as he allows Austin and Rory to become raw with their fragility and loss of self. He uses sexuality not for gratuituous reasons in this novel but it is utilized in very realist, believable watys. Sex is almost another character in this novel. It has a great power - sometimes it is just sex but often it is an expression of so much more. This novel will raise many questions for the reader. You may judge some of the characters. Some won't. It is this type of novel, the type that makes you think, that shows a quality piece of work.Jay Quinn holds nothing back and this novel is for all readers - all adults and all couples - gay and straight. This novel is an intricate psychological profile of four very interesting characters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn is a master of character study. This relatively new author is someone that all readers should examine. Although his novels have somewhat been pigeon-holed into the genre of gay literature, these are books for all readers to examine and enjoy. Quinn has an expertise in the study of relationships and the ways in which characters interact with one another in today's society.Check out this book. You'll be glad you did. Also recommended is his more recent novel, The Beloved Son."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Jay Quinn wrote a novel that applies to straight or gay people. In attempting to keep Bruno and Meg from knowing about Rory and Austin's adventures, it made me think of the stupidity of people who have to confess affairs of the heart to their other halves as a way of making themselves feel better, but causing unnessary pain to the other person. I think that is selfish on their part. Some secrets are best kept secrets.I love the way that Bruno talked to Meg about Bruno's sensing that little Josh might be gay. It offerred a little ahead of her time to make positive adjustments. The change in the generation's attitude with the statement by Josh, that if they wanted children they could always adopt. Something you would not have heard even 15 years ago.Quinn using the lack of communication between both couples as form of opening up the possiblities of a more than just a friend/neighbor relationship, reflects that when two people stop communicating and realizing that their needs and wants requiring equal attention and respect, can create a loneliness that may end up up in a deeper relationship that could threaten the one they primarily treasure. It says regardless of the gender sexuality We are have the same basic wants and desires. He reflected this well.Finally, Quinn gave us characters that were all likeable and with whom we could identify. We are all vunerable, human, and capable of greater sacrifices to keep what we love. To go the extra mile despite pettiness, self-centerness, and our own stupidity at times.Alfonse."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed the first book of mr. quinn that I read, METES AND BOUNDS. it was a little uneven in structure, but overall I felt is had some depth and held promise. however, with each successive novel by mr. quinn, I find myself increasingly disappointed.

The last paragraph/sentence is fantastic! I highly recommend it to all gay readers, and I think straight readers would enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Outstanding character studies, dialog, situations, and downright believability. It was easy to insinuate oneself into the story and become a partaker/present observer."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"I very much enjoyed this novel about two households in a upscale Florida community. Rory and Bruno are a longtime gay/bisexual couple who have had their share of ups and downs but are firmly committed to each other. Rory is basically a house-husband and contentedly plays the role of \\"wife\\" for Bruno, a financial analyst. Bruno is a big, muscular, aggressive guy and their relationship is very slightly tinged with dominance and submission. Meg and Austin are their new neighbors, a husband and wife who move next door with their two young sons. The novel explores perception of gay men, in particular with the character of Meg whose homophobia is gradually eased as she gets to know Rory and Bruno. Conflict occurs when Rory discovers that Bruno has cheated on him with a woman during a business trip to NYC. At the same time, Austin discovers that his friendship with Rory re-ignites his long-buried bisexual tendencies. Almost reluctantly, Rory has a few sexual encounters with his neighbor, mostly because Bruno's cheating has hurt him, or because Austin seems to need him so desperately. Rory's motivations for cheating are never clearly stated, and that's probably what makes him such a fascinating character. But Austin is too engaged with Rory, and the situation becomes dangerous. Unbeknownst to the cheating pair, both Bruno and Meg are aware of the infidelity. Bruno has been guilty of so many trespasses, he does not let on that he knows his boyfriend has cheated. Meg is considerably more unhappy about it, insisting that Austin get an STD test before he touches her again. However she eventually accepts that, despite his craving for sex with men, Austin truly does love her and their relationship weathers the storm. Bruno arranges to be transferred so that he and Rory must move, which they do every few years, seeming to enjoy this lifestyle. This allows the situation between Austin and Rory to cool down and presumably things are back to normal for everyone.The only weak character in this whole book is Meg, who comes across as a bit shrewish. Because Austin was laid off for being a whistle-blower, and only marginally contributing to the family expenses with his freelance work selling medical equipment, she has had to act as head of the household. Money issues inevitably lead to conflict within couples, and it's very difficult for the one person who is supporting the entire house not to resent the other who is unable to contribute to expenses. When Austin orders a new suite of furniture for the boys' den, Meg and he squabble about it, and the author's sympathies lean towards Austin, although to me it does not seem unjust to criticize an unemployed husband for spending his wife's money on furniture from Pottery Barn. Meg is portrayed as rendering her husband impotent, but in my view, she is merely refusing to let him pretend that he is the main breadwinner. Happily, Austin is vindicated by getting his old job back.Altogether this was a great read, revealing much about the inner lives of bisexual men and the gay and straight people who love them. I would love to see Jay Quinn write more novels featuring Rory and Bruno."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: A Novel","review":"Oh, it is so true ... men do think with their groins.

High on the success of finding six of Garrett Kincaid's seven illegitimate grandsons, she fell into the arms of the fifth, Trent Remmington. Now, on the threshhold of this unexpected, yet long anticipated, family gathering, Gina must confront Trent with her deception and with the possibility of her pregnancy.Ironically enough, the private investigator Trent hired to find Gina was entirely unnecessary. As he tries to orient himself with the truth about his biological father, he also finds himself facing imminent fatherhood if he could only convince Gina to marry him. After discovering the terrible truth about his true father, Trent is even more determined than ever to be there for his child.What there is of Trent and Gina's story is good but woefully inadequate. Jackson's writing is good but the story's structure is fragmented. When I wanted to know more about Trent and Gina as well as their relationship, I receieved a slew of information on the history of Whitehorn, some of its extraneous characters, and Gina's frustrating struggle to locate the seventh grandchild. By the story's end, I felt that Jackson could have done well if she'd had a full-length novel to work with. As it was, she had so much background to lay down, so many characters to introduce, and too little space to accomplish it in. Still, it was a pretty interesting start to a new mini-series."},{"Title":"Lone Stallion'S Lady (Montana Mavericks)","review":"Garrett Kincaid's son was a n'er do well who fathered several children out of wedlock.

Despite her strong attraction to Trent, Gina resisted his strong arm tactics, knowing he didn't understand love. Lisa Jackson offers a wonderful beginning to the new 12 part series in Silhouette Special Edition's Montana Mavericks - Lone Stallion's Lady. The only downside to this story is that it introduces a lot of people. Since the series will be written by different authors, their introductions were very brief.

While signs point to the town's silversmith, John must fine the guilty person without the two families killing each other or the Sheriff hanging the wrong person.It is always a good start when an author includes Author's Notes, a map and a glossary at the start of an historical mystery. It lets what license the author has taken, defines the locale and saves me running to the internet. More than that, from the very beginning, it brings the book to life.What wonderful characters have been created by Knight. Sir John, his bodyguard Gywn of Polruan and his clerk Thomas de Peyne are a wonderful, not completely harmonious, combination. Then you have John and his relationship with his wife. I am normally opposed to a protagonist having a mistress, but I'm willing to make an exception here. You empathize with John's frustrations and cheer his constant struggle to enforce the new law.Knight takes us into the 12th century, making it come to life without ever glorifying it. These were hard times and people with hard lives, poor sanitation, the demands of taxation and eternal political wrangling. The legal process was in formation yet laws would change with the kings. I always appreciate an author who can educate and entertain me simultaneously.The story is well plotted with plenty of intrigue, conflict and drama. The mystery is definitely there and the killer well concealed. The ending felt abrupt and slightly unsatisfying, which is why my rating is lower than it might have been.Even so, the author's voice and the principal characters make this a captivating series.

There are chapters devoted to Bluegrass, old time country, the folk music world, modern country, early commercial Hillbilly music, a chapter on Jimmie Rodgers, The Carter Family, Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and more, all thoroughly researched. It is also has a very thorough history of the music industry over the years, past and present and the writing style is perfect for the kind of book it is. As a whole, this book is highly recommended for anybody interested in the history of country music and popular music in general."},{"Title":"Country music U.S.A.; a fifty-year history","review":"This is the place to start any indepth consideration of country and western music. In fact Dr. Malone's survey and Nick Tosche's COUNTRY THE BIGGEST MUSIC IN AMERICA are my two favorite introductory volumes. Each book is radically different from one another with Dr. Malone's history by far the more authoritative and serious consideration while the Tosche's book operates more as stream of consciousness fan's notes."},{"Title":"Country music U.S.A.; a fifty-year history","review":"An excellent reference tool for country music scholars and enthusiasts alike -- a 'who done it' of country music.If you aren't looking for every detail of every aspect of everything country music, you may want to look elsewhere... but if you are, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.The prose has a narrative quality to it that makes reading enjoyable, while at the same time filling you with every detail imaginable.I recommend picking up this one up! Just make sure you get the most recent edition; it has been updated several times."},{"Title":"Country music U.S.A.; a fifty-year history","review":"This is a book contains loads of great information. It is a great intro to the origins of country music. However, the amount of information is overwhelming and the writing is very boring. Still, its unlikely that any book will give be as comprehensive as this one."},{"Title":"Country music U.S.A.; a fifty-year history","review":"Bill Malone's major work is everything one thinks it could be - an historical treatise on the history of country music from pre-country to fairly modern-day country. Really recent singers in the past eight years or so won't be found here - but that's not why this book is a staple for the country music lover. It's not the kind of reading that invites a start-at-page-one-and-read-to-the-end attempt; rather it's an invitation to be choosy about a time period in country. Malone's views are broad and encompassing and even critical of others' writings about country music. One's favorite is probably in his work although Malone does not write in equal proportion to each performer or time period."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I liked this book. No, I loved this book! It was a &quot;can't put it down&quot; read throughout. The story, which is true, is about less than perfect people who build a relationship that is perfect for them. It tells of a tragedy but it is not about the tragedy. It is about what real people can do with their lives through tragic events. It is not a sad book. Although I cried. Reading &quot;Raising Cole&quot; was an uplifting experience. I hope we hear more from Mr. Pittman in the near future."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I just finished this incredible book. It is wonderful story of a family and love shared between a father and two sons. A few comments: (1) this book is a fascinating, loving and gut-wrenching story of a father's love for his sons and the subsequent loss of one his eldest son. You will laugh, you will cry and your heart will ache for this family. Even though at times, it is a tough read in that I closed the book with tears streaming down my cheek, it is a MUST read for every parent. As a new father of a little girl, it made me think of how I want my relationship with her to develop. I told her every day, before I read this book, that I love her. Now I tell her I love her sooooooo much and that I want her to always feel that love and know she can talk to me. Yes, I say this to my 16 month old because I want to get in the practice of saying that to her for the rest of my life. This book helped visualize what I want my relationship with her to look like. (2) For every tough macho man in this world, this is a must read book. This is a book about two stud football players at the University of Texas and about a father who wrestled a bear and won. Yet, they showed their love for each other every day through words, hugs, hand holding, and yes even kissing. Man, was that refreshing. For so long we have had this stigma of men not being able to show their feelings. Then you see this family, each male over 6 ft, 200+ pounds of masculinity and yet they constantly showed the world their bond and their love. Wives and mothers should buy this book to give their husbands to show them how open and loving a relationship with their children can be. Men should buy this book too see how one can be strong, macho and yet openly affectionate. Lastly, this book makes you appreciate the moment, right now. One never knows when someone they love gets in a car or on a plane or walks down the street if they will see that person again. Life is wonderful and precious yet fragile. This book reminds you to NEVER left things unsaid. Well, I hope I haven't rambled. I was just so moved by this book. Thank you Marc Pittman for sharing your story!Screven WatsonTallahassee, Florida"},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I met the author of this book before I even bought it. My husband and I had been to two book stores in Shreveport and both were sold out. Upon purchasing it, my husband read it in one day- unable to put it down. I read it next, more slowly, so that I could embrace each sentence, each thought, even rereading whole paragraphs just to let it sink in. Some parts brought a smile to my face as I could just imagine these events in Marc's life taking place. Several times I stopped to praise God for the miracles He performed in the lives of the Pittmans. As I was reading, I would suddenly become aware of tears streaming down my cheeks. This story gives me hope for our children. If only we had more parents like Mr. and Mrs. Pittman, maybe today's children would be happier. I have told basically everyone I have spoken to, since I read the book, of its powerful message, and I have urged them to read it themselves. In my mind, this book is for everyone- those with children of a young age and even those whose kids are grown. I think it's appropriate for grandparents, aunts, uncles, stepparents, and those of us who aspire to have children someday. It's about relationships- everyboody has those. Thank you for sharing your story with us."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"My husband read this book a little over a year ago, when we found out we were pregnant with our first child. Our lives have not been the same since. This book has made a positive impact on our lives and the relationship we want to have with our children and family.After being blessed with the birth of our first son and reading your book, we now understand the importance of church, family and God. We are now members of a church and attend every Sunday.We are expecting our second son in July. We are going to name him Cole, in honor of your son and as a reminder of how important God and family are.

Marc Pittman's insightful look at his relationships with his sons goes beyond football and beyond the typical scope of day-to-day parenting. I am thankful to Marc for candidly sharing his experiences and emotions. I will use 'dead man's talk' with my children and will never lose sight of what's important in life."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is an easy read. I read it in one day. It is such a moving story. I think the story will inspire/motivate others to triumph over tragedy. Nothing can replace the loss of a loved one!!! I believe Marc Pittman's story shows a productive way to deal with great loss as well as a beautiful way to live LIFE everyday with those you love...your children."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"This is an extremely compelling book of profound significance that you absolutely must read for the sake of everyone you have in your life that you genuinely love and care about. In this book, Mr. Pittman describes the powerful bond he created with his sons and shares practical methods he calls Dead Man's Talk and Love Wars that anyone can use to strengthen the relationships they have with the most important people in their lives. It is a poignant story of love, of living life to the fullest, of cultivating a relationship of ultimate honesty and openness, of never leaving thoughts and feelings unsaid to the people you love most. It tells of the kind of relationship that you've always wanted and shows you how you can achieve it. It reminds you how precious life is and that tomorrow is never promised. It shatters every obstacle that stands in the way of building deeper relationships with the people you love. It tells of a drastic change that happens in one generation and how Mr. Pittman is able to turn the void of what he felt was lacking in his relationship with his own father into such a strong relationship with his sons. When you read about the difference between how Mr. Pittman was raised and how he raised his sons, you simply cannot hide behind the excuse that your upbringing effects your ability to have better relationships with the people you love. This book shatters the idea that the tough guy image is an obstacle to building relationships. It is filled with stories you will never forget that show Mr. Pittman and his sons to be as tough as they come, yet to also be incredibly compassionate people. This book shatters the idea that the social pressures of the teenage years are an insurmountable obstacle that stands in the way of a closer relationship. When most kids are asking their parents to drop them off two blocks away from their high school so they don't have to be seen together, Mr. Pittman and his sons are holding hands and kissing in public before stadiums filled with thousands of spectators. This book also demonstrates the importance of faith and our dependence on God to have any hope of creating close relationships with the people we love. Life is about the relationships you have with other people and, even though we are all flawed and broken people, this book clearly shows that with God's help, we can have relationships that mirror the perfectness of God's relationship with us more closely than we ever thought possible. Raising Cole is a fitting tribute to the extraordinary life of Cole Pittman. Thank you, Mr. Pittman, for sharing your story with us and may Cole's legacy live forever in thousands upon thousands of lives affected by this book."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I am a mother of 5 boys. They are now grown, and I have few regrets about their upbringing, but there are always some things that tug at all parents' hearts on given moments when we say, \\"I wish I had been more open; I wish I had not been afraid to say what I felt and to encourage our children to speak without fear.\\" Marc Pittman's book would have plugged up that weakness in my parenting. It would have left me with fewer regrets and fewer 'holes' in my past, especially late at night when all moms and dads replay their encounters with their teens. This is book for all parents! It is a short read with a long result. It can make a permanent difference in one's inner circle.

This book is one of those books that you find yourself grabing your children and never letting them go. I read it in one sitting and the next day I bought 10 more copies to give to every father I knew. I cried, laughed, and most of all was reminded how tomorrow is never promised. This book has wisdom for fathers that will change the way children are raised. Love is the main theme, and a true love between two men, which is hard to find today was clear. The men that I have given the book to, have read it, cried, hugged their children and passed the book on to others. A must read!!"},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"Do you love your kids? Do you love your spouse or significant other? Do you love your friends? If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, this book isn't a good choice, it's one that can instantly change all of your relationships in positive ways you can't imagine that reading such a story will do.Marc Pittman isn't a sappy psychologist or counselor, he is a tough country boy hailing from humble beginnings, and has not written a how-to book on the right and wrong ways to raise your kids. His story, one that is every parents' dream as well as every parents' nightmare, is so compelling that it is the first book I have ever picked up that I could not stop reading until I had turned the final page.This book (a true story) involves hunting camps, championship football teams, street fights and grit. It talks about successes, and involves a great tragedy. The author reveals his own failings in the process and the story lights understanding so well in the reader that you will instantly feel its' effect on you. I cannot imagine anyone, no matter how tough or jaded, that will not feel chill bumps on the neck and tears roll down their cheeks before getting to the end of this incredible book.I have never thought so much of a novel that I felt the need to buy more than one copy, and had no intention of buying more than one of this one, either. I have also never felt compelled to share my feelings on a book here at this site before now. To date, I have bought 7 copies for my immediate family and a couple of friends, and I'll be buying more. I hope that everyone I give it to experiences the same things I did. The few hours it took me to read this book are the best time I have invested this year, and every page was as compelling as the one before.Don't just consider buying this book: RUSH to get your hands on it as fast as possible, and you will thank me later. Give it to your father, your mother, your kids, your family and any other friends that mean something to you. Then, don't be surprised by the ways it changes your life or where your life ends up. It is sincerely that kind of an experience."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"I read Marc Pittman's book last night. I could not put it down until I finished it. I laughed out loud and also had tears come to my eyes several times. Before I ever met Mr. Pitman several years ago, I had heard about him as my wife is from the same North Louisiana parish. Marc Pittman is a living legend there. I got to know the Pittman family as I followed a friend's son football career at Evangel who was a teammate of No. 44, Cole Pittman.. Marc Pittman is like no one else I've ever met--he really is bigger than life with a heart as big as his 6&quot;6&quot;&quot; 280 pound frame. (The story of him wrestling a 700 pound bear is true as a client of mine was in the tavern the night of the event.) And Judy Pittman--what a wonderful, loving person who is simply everyone's friend. Cole's death shocked the college football world, Shreveport, Austin and every place in between. Cole was the &quot;All-American boy&quot; in every way. I went to Cole's funeral and graveyard services in hopes of simply paying my respects to this grieving family -- but after witnessing the thousands of persons present and hearing Marc Pittman give the incredible eulogy as he stood next to his son's coffin, I left the services with a new desire to tell my own beautiful children how much I love them as often as I saw them. The tragedy of Cole's death changed my own relationships with my children, particularly with my own college-age son of whom I am sometimes very demanding. As I drove away from the funeral services, I called my own son who was away at college and (in tears) told him what I had just witnessed and how much I love him and how fortunate I am to have my great relationship with him. I will always remember the minister asking during Cole's funeral, &quot;How many Saturdays do you have left?&quot; Last Saturday could have been the last of my life or the last of one of my beautiful children's life. We just don't know, do we? Marc Pittman's book is a &quot;must-read&quot;, particularly if you're a father. Because of his Christian faith, Marc is able to rise above his toughness as well as his grief and tell an heart-filled story that inspires all of us to honor and better appreciate the gifts of life and love that God has bestowed upon each of us. It's the story of a father's incredible love and a family's tragic loss-- but it is also a great inspiration as to how we can nurture and develop our own personal relationships with those we love. May God bless the entire Pittman family."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"As a Father I couldn't have asked for a better book to encourage and inspire me as a Dad.

It was relatively short, and I thought it would be a good book to start my Kindle experience with. And it was! I got my Kindle at about 2pm today, unboxed it before dinner and finished this book earlier tonight. I personally couldn't put it down.I was attending the University of Texas when Cole was killed. And I was at he 44 point game. Honestly, at that time, I had little idea of the significance of the game I witnessed. After finishing the book, I felt like such a fool for not thinking about it back then. So this story touched me on a slightly personal level, though I never met or in anyway really knew Cole. It just feels like it happened in my home town.Before I started reading, my thoughts were \\"how good can this be, what are the odds Cole's dad has any ability to write a book that is easy to read?\\" I was impressed.

The problem with these books are that they are written by these egg head psychologist types that seem to be detached from reality and talk of situations that I could not relate to. A friend of mine who played football at U of Texas with Cole Pittman, recommended this book to me. It changed my life and made me believe that I could be a good father. Mr. Pittman shows that men are capable of overcoming their past to become great fathers who can create strong relationships with their sons that builds strong confident men.

Pittman is the owner of a construction firm, and from his own account is a huge man. Likewise his sons grew to big, strong men, but they never allowed their masculinity to stop them from openly showing affection for one another.Pittman's story, however, doesn't start with his role as a father but as a son. His father was anything but affectionate, and early in his son's life he followed that same path. Raising Cole recounts his walk toward an open and extremely deep loving relationship with his sons.His son whose name rests in the title, Cole, was a lineman at the University of Texas with a bright and promising future when he fell asleep on his way back to campus from home and died in a automobile accident.The book's more poignant moments are Pittman's response to his son's birth and death.My favorite chapter was \\"God Shows Up.\\" Pittman admits it is the presence of God that has allowed him to continue these years following Cole's death, not his own strength.Pittman also states that though it has been years, he still grieves for his son. His grief finds solace in ways I admit I don't fully understand, but then I've never lost a son.While this book may be of help to those who have lost a child, I think it may hold more value for those who children are still with them, especially men who may be reluctant to be open with their affection."},{"Title":"Raising Cole: Developing Life's Greatest Relationship, Embracing Life's Greatest Tragedy: A Father's Story","review":"This book is a must read for everyone because it is so moving.

She frets everyday over raising her two sons without a daddy. I wanted to finish the book before we left each other at the end of the week so she would be able to take it home with her and read it. I had told her there were so many good things in the book about raising kids and relationships... I ended up reading the last six chapters aloud to her on our drive home. My 12 year old son, crawled up in the back seat and listened to the story again. He has read the book twice already. We cried thru most of your story relating to ours and the grief that you experience when losing a loved one. It was healing for us in relation to our own loss. I pray that time has eased your grief some although I realize it never ends.I also googled Chase and found what a successful young man he is turning out to be at LSU. Congratulations on what wonderful children you have raised... What a proud moment in a parent's life. Now you get a chance to spoil your granddaughter and send her back to mom to do the tough part... That is what my parents tell me. I am sure Payton has you wrapped around her little finger.What a difference your book will begin to make in my relationshipswith my husband and sons.

Finally, the author wastes three of these pages on an introduction and another three on the works cited - leaving only 36 pages of actual discussion! Given the complexity of devising, researching, organizing, writing, publishing, and marketing annotated bibliographies, you can't even begin to delve into the process in so few pages. Personally, I'd expect a decent book on the subject to run at least 100-150 pages - and even that would cut the conversation short! And at $10, the book is outrageously overpriced. Period. I've written longer, more complicated papers in a weekend.Nonetheless, the information included in \\"On Compiling an Annotated Bibliography\\" is quite useful, for both amateurs and experiences scholars alike.Author James L.

It is because of this book in particular that I recognized the good luck of having Mugwort in my own garden.

However this book made me open to the wonders and magic of Mugwort. Not only can i use it in herbal smoking blends (\\"Sailor's Tobacco\\"), but it actually competes in the garden with worse weeds like crab-grass, poison ivy, etc. and is far easier to weed when the time comes."},{"Title":"Joy Riders Pb (Mammoth Suspense)","review":"The Joy Riders doesn't reach any literary heights and a predictable ending does nothing to make it any more rememberable. The Joy riders is the story of a few days in the life of poor fourteen year old girl Jo, whose father walked out on her and whose mother has to work a number of jobs to keep her brother and herself alive. One of the two biggest losers on the housing estate who everyone including the school teachers is afraid of fancies her and when she doesn't turn up to an arranged car park meeting with him he takes her younger brother along with him and his friend as they steal cars and takes polaroids of her brother enjoying himself. Jo now has a choice, either come along and join in the car thefts the next night or the photographs get sent to the police.Weak characters make this book a definite miss. If Jo is so caring about her brother and supposedly smart she would definitely come up with better decisions."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"It was but a few short months ago that David Hewson was reintroduced to American readers with A SEASON FOR THE DEAD, the first of a projected series of novels featuring Italian State Police detective Nic Costa. The second novel in the series, THE VILLA OF MYSTERIES, has already seen European publication and is scheduled for American release next year. Hewson has a bit of a backlist that has not seen publication here. The issuance of LUCIFER'S SHADOW only a few months after A SEASON FOR THE DEAD is a welcome and important step toward remedying that literary shortfall, while constituting a blessing for readers who, with one novel, had become enthralled with Hewson's intricate plotting, and intelligent and literary narration.LUCIFER'S SHADOW consists of two stories, both of which are set in Venice but separated in time by almost three centuries. The events of the past dovetail into those of the present, with parallels that surprise, astound, shock and delight. A printer's apprentice in 18th-century Venice is drawn into a web of duplicity, jealousy and murder that centers on a brilliant orchestral work created by an anonymous composer, who is in fact a Jewess. Her nationality and gender compel her to keep her background and identity a secret, but also leave her vulnerable to blackmail.In present-day Venice, meanwhile, an English student named Daniel Forster has accepted a summer job that ostensibly involves cataloguing a private collector's library. Forster soon discovers, however, that his job and his employer are not what they initially seemed to be. Forster is in fact to be the go-between for his employer with a petty thief who has acquired an antique violin, a prize that is also sought by the shadowy Hugo Massiter, a wealthy and ruthless figure whose life is shrouded in fear and rumor. Forster's retrieval of the violin serves as the catalyst for a star-crossed romance with Laura, the household's servant, whose haunting beauty slowly and inexorably brings Forster under her hesitant sway. The acquisition of the violin, and the discovery of an abandoned musical manuscript, also provides the catalyst for a succession of violent acts that lead all concerned toward certain destruction.The two tales alternate chapters, for the most part, with Hewson keeping things moving at a deceptively sedate pace. He is no particular hurry to reach either denouement, yet everything is set forth with purpose. Hewson's research for this book is magnificent, as it was for A SEASON FOR THE DEAD. The reader is transported across space and time in this work, which demonstrates that the elements, good and bad, that make up the human condition remain constant, even with the tolling of the centuries. The parallels between both of the stories in LUCIFER'S SHADOW is presented subtlely, and when they converge for a brief moment, it is all the more startling for the presentation.Delacorte Press has somewhat defied conventional wisdom by publishing two works by a new (to these shores) author within a few months of each other. This was no doubt done with the knowledge that anyone who had read A SEASON FOR THE DEAD would welcome more Hewson, and welcome it immediately. For myself, it would be fine if every month brought the arrival of a new Hewson novel. There is no one who is doing this type of work --- work that by turns has echoes of Christie, Dickens, O. Henry and even Poe on each page, and yet is unshakably contemporary and unmistakably Hewson. LUCIFER'S SHADOW, set in different time periods, is itself a timeless work, a classic. Highest possible recommendation.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"Lucifer's Shadow is a very well-written thriller. Hewson evokes Venice masterfully, and shows great skill in interweaving his parallel plots and parallel characters.I have a couple of reservations about the book, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five. The explanation of what was behind everything that happened in the present-day story was a bit implausible: the more I think about it, the less it seems to hang together. Also, some of the violent acts that take place in the book are described in too much gruesome detail. A good writer (and Hewson is one) should have been able to establish that his villain is a despicable sadist without having to resort to such lurid descriptions of his sadistic acts.However, those reservations marred my enjoyment of the book only slightly. If you're looking for a cross between Donna Leon's Inspector Brunetti mysteries and Daphne Du Maurier's Don't Look Now (there's a nice, fleeting reference to the movie version of Don't Look Now, as if Hewson were tipping his hat to a source of inspiration), then Lucifer's Shadow is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"Moving swiftly between tow subplots that are set three centuries apart (one subplot is set in 1700s Venice, while the other is in modern day Venice), and both focusing on the music world of both eras, David Hewson weaves another brilliantly gripping and mesmerizing tale of intrigue, deception and murder.A young Oxford academic, Daniel Foster is thrilled to be in Venice, esp since he's being paid a small stipend by Signor Scacchi to catalogue his library. Scacchi desperately hopes that Daniel will find some lost treasure that will replenish the ailing old man's much depleted coffers. What Daniel finds is a lost masterpiece for violin and orchestra. Excited, Scacchi comes up with a plan to fully exploit this find, a plan that will put Daniel firmly in the center of a maelstrom of deception, intrigue and murder, and that will bring him to the notice of the sinister and powerful antiques dealer, Hugh Massiter...Cut to 1733, where another young man, Lorenzo Scacchi, has come to Venice (upon the death of his parents) in order to work for his uncle, a well respected printer. It is the era of Canaletto and Vivaldi, and through his uncle, young Lorenzo finds himself rubbing elbows with the artists, the eccentric rich, and the beautiful and talented Rebecca. A musical prodigy, Rebecca (who is a Jew) is willing to break Venetian law that forbids her to play with Vivaldi (in a church) and after curfew, and the wholly smitten Lorenzo finds himself completely willing to help her escape all the social constraints placed on her in spite of the cost to the both of them (and their families) if they are found out! As both subplots of \\"Lucifer's Shadow\\" progress, it soon becomes evident both Daniel and Lorenzo are navigating the same path between treachery and honour; and as the intrigue and deception deepens ,it also becomes readily evident that the stakes are not so much survival as the price of one's soul...\\"Lucifer's Shadow\\" made for a truly absorbing read. The mysteries are many (from an old murder case of a young violinist, to the Scacchis and their connection to the violin piece that Daniel finds, to the sinister Hugh Massiter and his connection with everything), so that any lover of mystery and intrigue novels will be happily absorbed throughout. The pacing was swift and the descriptions of Venice (both in the 1700s & modern day) were lyrical and vivid. As for the manner in which the authour brought both subplots together, that was brilliantly done and rather clever. All in all, \\"Lucifer's Shadow\\" was a haunting and mesmerising novel, suspenseful and completely compelling."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"Venice, 1733 - A young Jewish violinist violates Venitian law and custom to perform with Vivaldi at La Piet&agrave;. But her ambition is larger, and she risks everything to have her own music, revealed anonymously, performed. The concerto is a resounding success, but greedy men prevent her from claiming the accolades she's due. In the ensuing struggle, the score for her composition is lost...Venice, today - Daniel Forster arrives in Venice to catalog an old man's library. In the process, he unearths a long-lost anonymous concerto, setting in motion another chain of tragedy. Caught up in a scheme to profit from the find, he finds himself cast in the unlikely role of composer. As he is pulled ever further into the intrigue, he struggles to protect his friends and save his own life.Well written, with complex and believable characters, these twin stories alternate as they progress down parallel paths. The past and present overlap, with surprising consequences. This is a wonderful tale, with beautiful and loving descriptions of both the city and the music. The use of Tintoretto's \\"Temptation of Christ\\" as a metaphor for the choices we make is especially powerful, and helps fuel the underlying themes of the book. With a wonderful setting, interesting characters, and a plot so full of twists it keeps you guessing right to the very end, what more could you ask for in a book?"},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"I'll admit I was drawn to the book simply by the title and an interesting concept. And as it began I thought, briefly, that I may not enjoy the book at all. But that quickly turned, and as a result, I found this to be one of the best books I have ever read. A wonderful job is done of mixing the historic and modern stories, and it only appears to be predictable, when in fact, Hewson throws in a mix of twists and turns that leave you eager to read on. Well written, well thought out, and a definite page turner."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"In 1733 Lorenzo Scacchi comes to Venice to work for his uncle at Ca' Scacchi printing press.

Things are going well until his uncle assigns Lorenzo to chaperone a gifted violinist who must hide her identity or face condemnation. Lorenzo obeys, but quickly finds the deception is turning from dangerous to fascinating to deadly.Two and half centuries later, Englishman Daniel Forster obtains summer employment cataloguing a library in the Ca' Scacchi. Excited by the prospect of Austria, he immediately falls under the spell of the beautiful capital. As he performs his duties, Daniel finds an anonymously written eighteenth-century concerto. That \\"treasure\\" leads to his involvement in a con that could turn from dangerous to fascinating to deadly.David Hewson provides a fascinating look at Venice two-hundred fifty years apart in this exciting thriller spread centuries apart. The story line contains two plots that ultimately merge, but are also a two-edged sword as at times it is difficult to keep track of what is happening. Still the beauty of the city past and present comes to life inside the twin tales of intrigue and corruption bringing down the innocent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"Other reviewers have done a nice job summarizing plot and characterization in Lucifer's Shadow, and I'll just add that I found the parallel mysteries intriguing. This book is a departure from Hewson's Nic Costa series, and shows that he is a very literate author. Lucifer is more novel than genre mystery, and Hewson has skillfully incorporated much local color and accurate historical detail, successfully bringing beautiful, mysterious Venice and its inhabitants to vivid life."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"On the second floor of the Scuola di San Rocco, Tintoretto's painting of the Temptation of Christ affords English academic Daniel Forster a glimpse of reality Venetian style. The painting's focal point is not Christ, but the devil. The devil wears no horns nor sports a pointed tail; he is attractive and extremely alluring. This seemingly benign appeal, Daniel discovers augurs the spell the city has yet to cast upon him, adequately mirrors the human avarice of all the novel's players and offers a bit of a biblical metaphor for the events of this partial police procedural/battle between good and evil.From the moment he arrives to catalogue the library of the ancient Scacchi family he is surrounded by its eclectic members entrenched in their own whacky sophistication-a sophistication that camouflages needs and desires that are as corrupt and beautiful as any old palazzo crumbling into the Grand canal, When he finds the manuscript of a brilliant violin concerto written during the time of the maestro Vivaldi, he suddenly knows what it is like to be Tintoretto's Christ and to mistakenly turn the devil's stones into bread.. When his employer asks him to buy a priceless black market violin, and pretend that he is the author of the found manuscript, Daniel feels he is about to fling himself off that temple wall and prays that the foretold angels will break his fall. Ultimately, Daniel sees the devil for what he is, and instead of accepting the wealth of all the kingdoms of the world, he saves his own soul and the souls of a two beautiful women seduced by the magic of the violin concerto and the world of power and music that brings such beauty to the life in an otherwise corrupt world..Juxtaposed with Daniel's story are the letters of 19th century Lorenzo Scacchi, another tempted Christ who knows first-hand the secret of the violin concerto, the mysterious violin and the lovely Jewess caught in a web of intolerance where her genius must go unrecognized and her spirit remain trapped forever in both a real and metaphysical ghetto.As Daniel becomes more aware of his role in this ancient drama and emerges triumphant to conquer his devil, Lorenzo reveals his own very human desires, and succumbs to that which he fears the most.Hewson does a wonderful job of recreating that mystery of corrupt sophistication that so intrigue all visitors to La Serenissima. His descriptions of the Jewish ghetto and the worldy resignation of its inhabitants horrify almost as much as his denouement of both characters and the woman in their lives thrills."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"I really enjoyed \\"A Season for the Dead\\" and thought I would really like this book as well. Unfortuantely I was kind of dissapointed. It's a good story, but the charachters really seemed to lack something, and I had a little trouble keeping some of them straight. It's not a bad book, the ending was actually very good. I think a little more charachter development would have really made this a great book."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"The thought this book was wonderful! I am always delighted when I find a good novel that is unpredictable, unusual, and holds my interest. This one certainly did! Do not do what I did and begin reading it in small increments of time: 20 minutes here, 15 minutes there. That is a disservice to both the author and to yourself. Give the book the time it deserves for you to concentrate on the subtleties, nuances, and the complex cast of characters. Also, clear the decks of whatever is on your \\"to do\\" list. After about halfway through the book, I knew I wouldn't put it down until I finished it. And that was at 5:00 AM this morning! My eyes are like fuzzy golf balls after so long a stint at reading, but it was worth it. I intend to read his other novels, but I think he will be hard-pressed to write another as interesting as this one."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"A recent visit to Venice and a stopover in Rome prompted me to pick up this beautiful and surreal story of love, hate, obsession and passion.David Hewson has blended the old and the present day with seamless ease and one feels able to move between the interweaving stories with an almost surreal yet tangible sense of being there....There was a balance between descriptive elements of Venice itself (sufficient to satisfy someone who has been a visitor) and the characters such that you felt yourself there, drinking the wine, hearing the music, seeing the colour of the Canal at dusk. A dark, complex, and intriguing story which almost challenges the reader to choose between good and evil for the sake of love and passion. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"This book was very helpful as background to the plot and characters of The Lizard's Bite, another David Hewson Venetian mystery/thriller but which is part of the Nic Costa, Roman detective, series. Unfortunately Nic was not around for this one.I found the parallel plots interesting in and of themselves but was having a heck of a time keeping them straight as the book progressed. My attention span gave out several times and delayed the end which I had my doubts of ever reaching.One of the modern day characters is supposed to be a 19 year old Oxford student working in Venice at a summer job but seems unreasonably wise beyond his years given his somewhat sheltered life to date. He was not credible in many of the situations. By the time he (briefly and mostly off stage) appears in The Lizard's Bite his life experience is what it should have been in Lucifer's Shadow to make him an interesting foil to the villain Massiter.Looking forward to continuing with the Nic Costa series. I really miss Peroni!"},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could, but since I can't it only gets 2 stars. The historic storyline was vivid & beautifully written, however the parallel present-day plot did nada for me. In addition, the characters in the present-day setting didn't seem as developed either. This bk. had such possibilities... By mixing the 2 tales it completely ruined this bk. for me & the 2 stories never seemed to fit together. The bk. isn't awful, just disappointing."},{"Title":"Lucifer's Shadow","review":"This book could have been a much better read.

I remember reading it as a seminarian in college in 1957 and it was passed around with eager anticipation. What makes this book truly a classic is that, like classics, it never loses it touch. Guardini (remember this is before Vatican II) has a way of delving into the heart and mind of Jesus with deep reverence. It's not a psychology of Jesus which he says no can write anyways. But he reverently explores the life and words of Jesus in the gospels and with a clarity that is startling lays out the deep meaning of Jesus words. Sometimes, what he says is so rich in meaning, I have to catch my breath and sit back and try to let his words sink in. As I said it was written before Vat II but it fits in right now in the pastVatII era. The reason I'm sure is that Jesus is neither pre or post....He's Jesus for all time. Marvelous. This is the 3rd time reading for me and it won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Lord","review":"The Lord, by Romano Guardini, is a study of the life and person of Christ. Romano Guardini was at once brilliant, profound, deeply holy, insightful and &quot;humanistic&quot;, and this look at the person of Christ reflects his essence as a &quot;humanistic&quot; man of God in our century. Christ is studied intimately from a spiritual/&quot;psychological&quot; standpoint. Guardini examines his profound holiness, his loneliness, his innocence, the misunderstanding and blindness he encountered, his origins, his impact on the men of his day, and of our times. It is perhaps unparalleled in its intimacy and beauty of an examination of Christ, although, in my opinion, it is NOT amongst the best of Guardini's writings because it can be long, and at times obvious. His best books are, in my opinion, The Living God, The Virtues, Prayer in Practice, The Life of Faith, Power and Responsibility, The End of the Modern World, and The World and the Person (the original titles of these works when translated), but, nonetheless, it is, like everything he wrote, masterful and well worth reading END"},{"Title":"The Lord","review":"I stumbled upon Romano Guardini's &quot;The End of the Modern World&quot; in my readings concerning technology (Jacques Ellul) and culture (Walker Percy). &quot;The Lord&quot; provides a humble insight that deeply challenges the reader to reconsider their understanding of Christ (S. Kierkegaard's &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot; may have been an inspiration for Guardini). A powerful section of the book deals with Christ arriving in Jerusalem and the events leading to his death. Guardini draws on the humility of Christ and challenges the reader with the gravity of imitating Christ. Perhaps what I enjoy about Guardini is that he is readable by all Christians -- his theology does not adopt a dictated theological system. No, the reader experiences a man struggling to understand Christ as if Christ were contemporary with him."},{"Title":"The Lord","review":"I have never been so challenged by a book as Guardini's &quot;The Lord&quot;. He takes you through every aspect of Jesus' life. The section on the book of Revelations was the best analysis I have ever read.

This book generally deals with the ministry of Jesus till death and resurrection. You will find any and many of your questions about Jesus answered. The way this book has been written is simple without any \\"heaviness\\" of theological language so that a layman can also understand it properly. The author Romano Guardini has warned in the preface that this book is not a theological work and that this book is one of the perspective of Jesus's life.Some words about Romano Guardini:- The way he has written this book should make possible for numerous Christians to benefit from his book. What's more Romano Guardini was one of the authors which influenced the thinking of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, later Our Pope Benedict XVI.Go ahead and buy this book.

Beyond Second City","review":"There is so much valuable in this book that its shortcomings are all the more frustrating. Nobody else has described in as much depth the history of the improv movement in Chicago since the rise of Second City. Certainly there are hard facts in here that I didn't know, and this is a field in which I wrote one of the early books.Unfortunately, much of the text has been written through such narrow ideological blinders that the author sometimes offers arguments so contorted that she unwittingly contradicts herself.As she quotes from my book, SOMETHING WONDERFUL RIGHT AWAY, I have to confess to being upset by the use she makes of one passage with an early Second City player, the late Roger Bowen. She misinterprets what he said about black players in improv profoundly, and her misinterpretation has the lamentable effect of implying he was a racist. Since Bowen isn't around to defend himself, and since he was one of the most progressive, thoughftul and generous souls ever to grace an improvisational stage, this is deeply disturbing. His memory deserves better.If one can distinguish between the often genuinely insightful analyses she presents and gaffes such as the one I mention above, there is a great deal here to chew on. She correctly identifies the contradictions in a form of theatre that grew out of a desire to offer a progressive/radical view of society and those aspects of improvisation which encourage the reinforcement of stereotypes. I'm not aware of anybody else who has made this point as well, so this would deserve its place in the literature if only for raising this issue.On balance, a book that I think serious improvisers should read, but with some skepticism."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway? Beyond Second City","review":"As a former Chicago improviser in all the new waves she writes about, and a teacher now trying to influence my own students (especially women and minorities) to continue their improv education in the undisputed improv capital, Chicago, I would do my best to keep this book out of their hands. It is a clouded pseudo-history littered with deluded conclusions resulting from her own fears as a female improviser. The talented people I had the pleasure of working with of all colors and genders did not play out of this place of fear that is evident throughout the book, but a place of love for each other and what they do. But I must say kudos to her for even putting a pen to paper about a most neglected subject and I wish that some of the brilliant teachers mentioned in the book would write their own truth about their theatre histories and theories to share with budding improv students throughout the country."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway? Beyond Second City","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and was quite excited. I performed at Chicago's Improv Olympic for over three years as well as places like the Playground and the Chicago Improv Festival, and right there on the cover is one of my teachers! As I flipped through it I saw tons of pictures of people I called friend and was excited to see interviews with some of my former team coaches.The trouble seems to be that while the book was written in good faith (in the spirit of giving theaters who perform chiefly improv as much credit as the not-so-improv-anymore Second City) it misinterprets many facts. Shortly after mentioning the book on an online message board I discovered that someone who I was excited to see mentioned in the book had been given a false history in it.Upon further inspection I noticed the book, although covering much ground where it had never been covered before in improv, seemed to have a bit of a bullying attitude towards what true improv was. All these things combined was very frustrating, as people who don't live here have nothing to go by when it comes to this &quot;age&quot; of improv besides this misleading and inaccurate book. Hopefully someone will come along who is less ambitious and more interested in chronicling events, and I hope this happens for those not in Chicago. If you are in Chicago, you're better off scanning the reviews in the free papers for a more clear vision of the scene, even though there aren't as many nice group photos."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway?

Beyond Second City","review":"Dr. Seham has the makings of a potentially valuable book here -- she comprehensively details the histories and inner workings of almost all the major improvisation/sketch comedy companies (as of publication date), including The Second City, ImprovOlympic and others. Sadly, she sees fit to contaminate her narrative with intrusive and fallacious critiques bearing all the fingerprints of Marxism, postmodernism and radical feminism..."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway? Beyond Second City","review":"Oh dear.The jacket cover of this book suggests we may learn more about the roots of Improv and more depth of the art than is &quot;seen on TV&quot;. &quot;There is far more to Improv than....Whose Line...&quot;.Instead of a history, guide or introduction to Improv, however, Ms. Seham uses this book as a personal forum to vent spleen on various political angles, mainly feminist. This is a humour free book full of political rhetoric and outrageous slanted views on the gender, race and sexuality in Improv theatre.Seham states many times throughout the book that she believes the vast majority of Improv groups are nothing short of &quot;boys clubs&quot;. As a woman working in Improv for 8 years I find her opinions and views narrower than those of the males she claims abuse their role in theatre.In one notable moment she even makes specific negative reference to an improv colleague - &quot;I felt that Patrick's offstage attitude toward me as the artistic director of the theatre had entered into his improvised choice. Not only was a sultan ordering his concubine to her knees, but Patrick was demonstrating his power over a female authority figure.&quot;Naming names like this is not only extremely distasteful, but possibly damaging to the individual and an explicit display of Seham's personal angst and hatred. Surely she would have been better advised discussing her issues with her father if she wanted to be so personal.Another quote might give you a feel for the piece. &quot;In a manner that again parallels Bakhtin's notions of the grotesque, &quot;Annoyance people reject product, reject the very concept of &quot;finished&quot; as a matter for faith and experience&quot;.A laugh a minute. Prejudiced, biased and yawnsome. A subjective personal essay on gender race and politics in theatre rather than an interesting history of Improv.As a female comic I find the constant reliance on Tampon/Lesbian humour, or attacks on male performers an insult to my gender and intelligence. If Seham can't use her wit and skill onstage to demonstrate her Improv prowess she doesn't belong there and certainly doesn't deserve to be published.I simply can't imagine anyone buying this book being pleased with the purchase.Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway? Beyond Second City","review":"I love that improv is developed enough now to have scholarly texts about it - not just histories. Although &lt;i&gt;Whose Improv&lt;/i&gt; gives a lot of history not available elsewhere, its real value is its assessment of gender issues in improv.

Which is, if you ask most WOMEN in the Chicago scene, clearly a bass-ackward accounting. In fact, most groups around town are actively LOOKING for women to join; it's not a \\"all-white boys club\\" because of any exclusionary policies.Also, somehow lost in her diatribe is the mere fact that half the teachers and coaches, as well as the owner/operator of IO, are women.Sad, sad, sad."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway? Beyond Second City","review":"I am a ComedySportz performer, so I was eager to read the detailed history of ComedySportz's origins provided in this book. It does accomplish that. However the history is surrounded by ridiculous blowhard pseudo-intellectual writing that tries to tie improvisation to politics. Just take this excerpt as an example, \\"Chudnow [the founder of ComedySportz] acknowledges that improvisational performance is historically associated with liberal or even transgressive politics. But ComedySportz, through its sports overlay, not only disallows transgressive performances, it actively produces normative ones.\\" What the heck does that mean? There are also many references to Marxism and other philosophical ideologies that are completely out of place. It seems based on the personal experiences of the author and interviews with two former ComedySportz players, the author is trying to paint the whole of ComedySportz as a racist and anti-women organization. This would be a surprise to the many women and non-Caucasians that I perform with and count among my close friends. Clearly that author has an axe to grind."},{"Title":"Whose Improv Is It Anyway?

These exploits have been faithfully recorded by his friend and ally, Dr. Watson, who also resides at 221-B Baker Street. Doyle's literary style includes the following elements: ample dialogue, a detailed denouement which fills in all the loose ends, and occasional personal touches. Watson appears attimes as bewildered, disappointed, deductive in his own right,and truly concerned for Holmes' physical and mental health. Sherlock is presented as a man of personal honor and unflappable integrity, compassionate toward victims while ruthless toward criminals, and in one tale very human-delighting in the praise and recognition from Justice professionals. In addition he rarely extracts a serious fee for his services.The settings for these 8 mysteries range from six in the country to two in town. Holmes is sought out by clients in four tales, while he actively helps the police in the other four; onemystery he stumbles into while holiday. Most of these crimes involve cruel murder or bizarre death; two concern precious gems and one delves into English history. Readers will find a cypher in one tale and a multi-generational puzzler in another. The knowledge of Geometry will prove valuable on a treasure hunt. Realizing when he needs a little help from his \\"irregulars,\\" Holmes even relies on the keen nose of man's best friend.

Building a smart home is actually a pretty easy process, especially with a lot of the equipment which is currently available.

This not only includes installing motion detectors, but also configuring your heating and cooling system to be remotely programmed, as well as your lights. Additional chapters cover projects for your garage and outside, kitchen and bathroom (how about a stove that shuts itself automatically when you forget or a toilet that is smart enough not to overflow), and even audio/visual systems and distribution mechanisms.While smart homes may not be for everyone, there are a lot of cool ideas in this book.

The exact time and place of his birth are unknown. Some think he might have been born in Penkarne near Monmouth, others say Llanrhymny near Glamorgan. It is certain that was related to the Morgans of Tredegar, as they are mentioned in his will. Although the names of his parents are unknown, The Morgans were by then a distinguished army family. Henry was related to Sir Thomas Morgan, who forty years before Henry's birth had helped Queen Elizabeth help the Dutch fight the Spanish. In 1594 The Queen's Own Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs) were commanded by Colonel Thomas Morgan. They fought off a Spanish attempt to capture a fortress at Bergen-op-Zoom in the Netherlands, and Thomas Morgan received a knighthood for this service.In 1642, when Henry was seven years old, the British Civil War broke out. We know that various uncles and other assorted relatives fought on both sides, Royalist and Roundhead. Henry is surrounded by wars and soldiers until and during the decade-long Civil War. Cromwell eventually rules Britain, and decides to try and do something about Spanish hegemony in the New World.By this time, the English had finally managed to establish colonies on two small islands in the Caribbean, Barbados and St. Kitts. Spain considered the British colonies on these tiny islands to be illegal. The Catholic Pope had helped Spain and Portugal divide between themselves the entire New World: Portugal got Brazil and Spain got the rest. The two British colonies were annoying pinpricks to the gigantic Spanish Empire in the New World. Spain was determined to harass the British colonists in the Caribbean, lest they gain more ground. Spain claimed and/or ruled the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the Spanish Main- most of the New World where Europeans had settled. Spain was in the New World to extract gold and silver from mines in Peru and Mexico, and wasn't there for planting tobacco and sugar like the British.The Spanish ships carrying all that gold and silver back to Spain proved very tempting to pirates and privateers. What's the difference between a pirate and a \\"privateer\\"? The distinction was important. Spain was always at war with one or another of the other European powers. Sometimes they were at war with the French, sometimes the English, sometimes the Dutch. It was quite expensive for countries at war with Spain to outfit navies. So any ship that asked would be granted a commission to fight the Spanish Dons, and became legal pirates- \\"privateers\\". If captured by the enemy, instead of being hanged as pirates, they were instead prisoners of war. Sometimes these POW's were put in dungeons, sometimes they became slaves.Oliver Cromwell sent out ships and soldiers to wrest Central America and the Caribbean from the Spanish, the young Henry Morgan among them. They arrive in Barbados at in 1655. After a series of mishaps on the island of Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic) the British manage to win Jamaica. Jamaica is the perfect island from which to raid the rich Spanish cities that ring that Caribbean, and that's just what Henry Morgan and his buccaneers (the book explains what a \\"buccaneer\\" is) do. The best part of this book are the descriptions of the daring raids which Morgan makes on the Spanish Main, culminating in the looting and burning of Panama in 1671. Morgan and the buccaneers pillage their way around the Caribbean legally and with the sanction of the British, as they comprise the Jamaican navy.Dudley Pope was an accomplished novelist, author of the \\"Ramage\\" series. The Ramage novels are historical fiction, the action taking place on sailing ships in the warm Caribbean seas. Pope has an impeccable command of Jamaican history, combined with the writing skills of a novelist. The reader will find himself wondering about the larger historical picture back in Europe, and some of this is gone into. I very much enjoyed reading this book- it's as much a history of the early British settlement of Jamaica as it is a biography of Harry Morgan. One couldn't find a more stirring history than Pope's biography of Morgan, and I'm glad to see it back in print."},{"Title":"Harry Morgan's Way: Biography Of Sir Henry Morgan 1635-1688","review":"Sir Henry Morgan left behind a huge legend, but not much else - no artifacts of his life remain, no heir carried on his name - even his grave was lost when Port Royal was obliterated by earthquake and swallowed by the sea shortly after his death. Today, most know him better as myth than history, or worse, as nothing more than a cartoon caricature used to sell rum. In \`Harry Morgan's Way', navel historian and novelist Dudley Pope cuts through the myths and reconstructs for us the history of this bold and fascinating man.It would be impossible to understand Morgan without some basic knowledge of the history of European conquest and conflict in the West Indies, the pivotal part that Jamaica played in that conflict, or the history and significance of the buccaneers to that conflict. Pope realized this; \`Harry Morgan's Way' is as much an early history of Jamaica and the West Indies buccaneers as it is a biography of Morgan. Henry Morgan doesn't even enter the action of the book until chapter seven. Pope used his initial chapters to explain how Spain came to be in conflict with the English, Dutch, and French in the West Indies, and to tell the fascinating story of how the unique buccaneer culture developed. We learn that buccaneer has a very specific meaning, and is not an interchangeable synonym for pirate, and discover the fine legal and ethical points that separated privateers from pirates as well. All of this is absolutely necessary background to understanding a man who was not only the undisputed leader of the buccaneers of the West Indies, but was knighted by his king and made lieutenant governor of Jamaica.Morgan was a bold man of action, equal to the great Sir Francis Drake in stature, and a history of his exploits makes for fascinating reading. Pope is at his best when describing Morgan's major raids (for he was more soldier than sailor, ships being little more than the transport that moved his troops for land battles) against Granada, Portobelo, Maracaibo, and Panama. Much of his life was spent in the intrigue and battles of Jamaican politics as well, and though these can be interesting, Pope does not show the same deft touch when writing of them, and sometimes my interest waned under the brunt of their detail. Still, all told \`Harry Morgan's Way' is a riveting read - exciting, informative, well written, and recommended.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Harry Morgan's Way: Biography Of Sir Henry Morgan 1635-1688","review":"Well researched and lively writing make this a great read about the privateers and pirates of the 1600's in the early settlement of the Caribbean islands. It focuses mainly on Sir Henry Morgan (Harry to his friends) and the efforts to keep Jamaica an English posession thru the use of privateers. References are from West Indian Spanish islands records and from Spain as well as Dutch, French and English records and books published at the time or about a decade later. Pope as a naval historian and international sailor filled in details of the life during the times and wooden sailing ships so the jargon conditions in different parts of the Caribbean Sea are comprehended."},{"Title":"Celtic Christianity: Making Myths and Chasing Dreams","review":"Writing on the subject of Celtic Christianity is beset with sentimentalism plus a generous dose of wishful thinking. Bradley's book is a sobering reflection on some of this writing - including his own! The author of &quot;The Celtic Way&quot; has had cause to stop and consider the scholarly accuracy of his previous work, something which takes great courage.The result is this overview of a succession of Celtic revivals spanning from the 7th - 20th Centuries, including Victorian Celtic Romanticism. It is interesting that the first revival Bradley refers to is from the period which other popular commentators tend to include within the Age of the Celtic Church itself: 7th-9th Centuries. Yet Bede's nostalgia for a past era of holy and simple saints has a very familar ring to it!The book concludes with the current revival and a whistlestop tour through the popular and scholarly writings that have sprung up recently, plus the wider cultural mainfestations of this such as Celtic music. [I too have played my part in this collusion of popular Celtica as singer and songwriter for the band eve &amp; the garden(eatg).]One discovery he makes is that despite much research by himself and his colleagues, there appears to be no reference to the term &quot;Wild Goose&quot; (representing the Holy Spirit)which pre-dates George Macleod, founder of the Iona Community in the 20th Century!All is not lost in terms of the application of certain distinctive themes to the Church today, as Bradley's follow-up &quot;Colonies of Heaven: Celtic Models for Today's Church&quot; (Darton Longman &amp; Todd, 2000) attests. The sobering appraisal of &quot;Making Myths&quot;, however, stands as an initial guard on what can and cannot be said about the British Church in the early centuries of Christianity.The one problem I would mention is that I would have preferred a more indepth analysis as to the possible reasons for the current revival - or maybe that's just because that's the essay question I'm currently working on!!So if you have a tendency to go misty eyed and sentimental over the possibility of re-establishing the true church of the ancient British Isles, then you must, absolutely must read this book."},{"Title":"Textbook of Psychiatry (Hodder Arnold Publication)","review":"I had to take a course in psychiatry for my Naturopathic degree and one of the possible books to choose from was this one.

I noted that the editor (Gloria Norris) comments in her preface that whilst American writers are credited with developing the short story to its highest and most varied expression, &quot;many readers today complain that the form has been terribly narrowed in subject.&quot; Clearly, she has set out to prove the lie. A good variety of stories reflecting all aspects of life and many many themes, these are sexy, sassy, surprising, stimulating etc. Each is followed by a short explanation from the writer telling us why he or she preferred this particular tale for inclusion.

There were some nice elements to this story; the characters were beautifully developed and the setting and situation made for a great read. But in the second half, the warm, feel good Christmas story I was expecting turned into Bible quotes and preaching. With all respect and no offense intended to Christian readers, I was disappointed that the beautiful, lyrical story I was reading became proselytizing. That's okay but not what I want when reading fiction."},{"Title":"White as Snow: A Christmas Story (Mysterious Ways #1)","review":"Donna Westover Gallup is a master storyteller. Her book \\"White as Snow: A Christmas Story\\" will keep you wanting to turn to the next page and keep reading. The chapters of the book are fairly short. It is an excellent book for both adults and children as young as 10 to read for themselves. You could read one chapter a night to your children or grandchildren. The book appeals to all ages. It is simply wonderful!The story is set in the Colorado territory in 1864. The author provides excellent characters. There is Charlie. For about the first half of the book I was curious as to his age. I knew he was a young boy and through the story I learned he was barely taller than the two-headed axe he was trying to use. Only later did I learn he was ten years old. We learned his age when he answered the question, \\"How old are you boy?\\"The next person in the story is Gramps. For most of the story Gramps is in bed, fighting for his life. Charlie, his grandson, cares for him by mimicking the care he received from his late grandma when he was sick. Only later in the story do we learn Gramps is battling pneumonia.With Gramps sick and winter coming on Charlie has to care for himself, the farm and Gramps. Through a series of well written remembrances or flashbacks we meet the 9th Kansas Cavalry of the US Army that has come down from Fort Collins to buy cattle from Gramps. We see Charlie drawing from his memory lessons that Gramps and his grandma had taught him that sustain him though this tough time. We have reflections on attending a camp meeting revival with the evangelist, not the circuit preacher. We have reflections of visiting the neighbors and their four children who live in a one room cabin.We see how the training up of a child in the ways of the Lord helps him in these tough times. The book has a scary scene in it. Charlie has taken \\"Old Blue\\" which is his grandfather gun. He has been told not to use it, though Gramps has been teaching him with the gun. He barely escapes death during an attack by a grizzly bear who he believes is defending her cubs from him. The scene was so well written it had my heart racing and the palms of my hands sweaty. Throughout the book we see Charlie dealing with the guilt he felt for disobeying Gramps and taking the big, heavy gun. And he loses the gun in his encounter with the mama Grizzly bear.Charlie is losing hope and faith. He cries out to God. At just that perfect time as his supplies are running low and he is ready to give up, a giant mountain man, named Jess, shows up riding a giant horse, named Goliath. Jess able to help him. He teaches Charlie that God has not abandoned him. He shows that things could actually have been worse if he wasn't praying. Jess helps restore Charlie's faith and helps him to get the ranch back in order.Jess and Charlie share the same birthday. Jess makes this a Christmas to remember as he gets them a Christmas tree, the first one they have had since Grandma died. He cooks a Christmas feast for them, and they even find and us Grandma's good china for the meal. Gramps recovers and Jess simply vanishes.The novel is inspirational fiction at its best. The book has a happy ending. I was left wondering if the big mountain man Jess was real or an angel sent from God to help Charlie and Gramps at their time of need.Donna Westover Gallup has a way with words. There is beauty in her descriptions. Her writing is has a poetic flow to it. While the book might interest people with spiritual beliefs, it can be a heartening account for everybody else. Five Stars and a big hug for the author is my rating for the book.

I read a lot of fiction, and especially love period or historical fiction with Christian themes woven in.Ms. Gallup has such a warm way of describing everything and everyone, and in such detail, that you can actually picture all of the locations and characters vividly. Her knowledge of the era comes out in her details, too. But what I love most of all is how her main characters warm your heart and make you want to both know them and to emulate them. The recurring theme that God is always with us is brought into the book in a very creative, sometimes humorous, and always heartwarming way.This book is not \\"preachy\\" as some Christian fiction is. Discussions about God and references to the Bible flow naturally through realistic conversations that the characters have. Lessons based on Christian beliefs are taught lovingly and gently, often reminding me of some of my own conversations with God over the years.I found myself not wanting to put the book (Kindle) down until I finished it at 2 a.m., and was so happy to realize it was part of a series. I immediately downloaded and read the next 2 books, and am now looking forward the release of the 4th and final installment in the Mysterious Ways series.It's been a long time since I purposely went in search of all of the books in a writer's series. And, in fact, this is only the 3nd author I've done this with. I highly recommend this series. It's suitable for any age group, and especially recommended when you are looking forward to one of those long, long reading days. I hope you enjoy this book -- and the others -- as much as I have."},{"Title":"White as Snow: A Christmas Story (Mysterious Ways #1)","review":"Set in Colorado territory in late 1864, this story actually pertains to Christmas...unlike so many others which use the word loosly in a cheap attempt to hawk more books. I don't generally read books with religious themes but this one spoke of the ways in which the protagonist learned lessons about life and, as such, was not offensive in the least. Another reviewer felt the book became proselytizing, which is too bad because the tale contained nothing but truths which would enrich all of our lives if only we would live them. I gave the book four stars because of some errors and omissions, but overall it was an entertaining and thought provoking read. If you're not too fragile to accept that there is actually religion (God forbid!) in the true celebration of Christmas...you'll most likely enjoy this little Christmas story."},{"Title":"White as Snow: A Christmas Story (Mysterious Ways #1)","review":"Very good book with a good story line.

His grandpa falls sick with pneumonia and rests unconscious in bed for weeks. Having no one in the world to care for him and help him out, Charlie has to take care of the farm and his sick grandpa. Charlie struggles for existence are over when Jess comes to their door. The stranger turns out to be their benefactor who helps them out through the hard times.The novel is an inspirational account full of strong beliefs in God and his power of helping the ones in need. Charlie does his best to be in charge of the situation, but all his efforts fail, leaving him hopeless and praying to God for help, which soon arrives. The ending leaves us wondering if Jess was actually real or an angel sent by God to assist them in the fight for survival.Donna Westover Gallup is a wonderful author, who uses superb metaphors to illustrate her talent to write. Allow me to quote from the book:\\"A fellow could imagine the sonata of a lone wolf rolling up through the hills. Or he'd hear a mysterious siren song call across the grassy waves and intertwine itself in the limbs of the dark evergreens and golden aspens, then build to an eerie crescendo, only to fall to a sigh of rustling leaves and then recede, pulled back by an invisible tide.\\"Reading the book, I found myself often thinking how could somebody be able to play with words in such a poetic manner: the descriptions are absolutely terrific and her writing flows gracefully. She makes writing look so simple.Although I am not a religious person, it was a real delight to read Donna's work. I found it simple and emotional. This book might interest people with spiritual beliefs, but it can be a heartening account for everybody else.

Both are still well worth reading, though to my mind Tooley's essay has aged better. There is still something to get out out Thompson's paper, but the fact that it was written (as all of these were) in the early 70's shows more in hers. John Finnis does what he always does- give an argument that you must be a Catholic to accept and then claim that it's self-evidently true. Very annoying. While it's worth while to read the essays by Tooley and Thompson, it might be better over-all to get a more up-to-date volume."},{"Title":"The Love of Learning and the Desire for God: A Study of Monastic Culture","review":"Dom Leclercq's study of Benedictine monastic spirituality remains a classic. In fact Pope Benedict XVI has quoted from it extensively in his various addresses on monasticism and European culture.Originally written as a series of conferences for young monks, the book starts by exploring the two foundational documents of Benedictine spirituality - the Rule of St Benedict and the Life of the saint by St Gregory the Great. From there it traces the development of the monastic commitment to learning and prayer through the middle ages, with particular emphasis on St Bernard.It is beautifully written, and full of spiritual gems.A must read for any serious student of monasticism."},{"Title":"The Love of Learning and the Desire for God: A Study of Monastic Culture","review":"\\"Read the acts of Sts. Anthony, Macarius, Pachomius..., the Egyptian Monks, of those who lived in the Holy Land or in the Thebaid. ...implant in the darkness of the West and in the cold of Gaul the light of the East and the ancient fervor of Egyptian religious life.\\" Jean Leclerq, Ancient traditional SpiritualityLatin Monastic Tradition:Two of the most influential in Spirituality as Evagrius Ponticus, and John Cassian who established the first European monasteries according to the Pachomian ideal, and wrote the first Monastic manuals, the institutes and the Conferences. \\"If Benedict created the institutional frame of Latin monasticism, then Cassian helped define its inner life, its mystical aspirations,\\" wrote Wm. Harmless, Desert Christians.The Benedictine rule of Saint Benedict of Nursia (6th century), formed the basis of life in most monastic communities until the twelve century. The schema faded out until St. Bernard of Cleurvaux restored it to its original zenith. Among the principal monastic orders that evolved in the Middle Ages were the Carthusians in the eleventh century and the Cistercians in the twelfth; the Mendicant orders, or Friars, Dominicans, Franciscans, and Carmelites arose in the 13th century.Theognosis, Learning Spirituality:Theognosis, the knowing of God, has always been a means for a unity in love which transcends all knowledge. This ultimate end is union with God or, partaking in the nature of God, the theosis of church Fathers Ireneus and Athanasius. The eastern tradition whose masters were Origen, Evagrius, and Dionysius, the pseudo Areopagite, has never made a definite distinction between mysticism and theology; between personal experience of the divine mysteries. In a certain sense all theology is mystical, inasmuch as it shows forth the divine mystery of revelation. On the other hand, mysticism is frequently opposed to theology as an unutterable mystery which surpasses our understanding faculties to any perception of sense or of intelligence, to be lived rather than known. We should, look for a profound change, an inner transformation of spirit, enabling us to experience it mystically, far from being mutually opposed, theology and mysticism support and completement each other.Leclercq presents his Study:Having declaring himself, a supporter of twelfth-century monastic theology, Dom Leclercq presents his book in ten chapters, grouped in three sections, addressing its formation, sources and its fruits. Right from the beginning, in a concise introduction, Dom Leclercq presents a distinction between monasticism and scholasticism, such distinction is radically clear in the three parts of his study of the monastic Culture. Roman Catholic Monasticism reached its apex in the twelfth century when, an often quoted, scathing condemnation of Byzantine monasticism was launched by Eustathius, bishop of Thessalonica. In Leclercq's eye twelfth-century Latin monasticism reached its apex in Bernard of Clairvaux. Most theological interest, is devoted to the 13th century, whose writers were scholastics, academics of ecclesiastic background. Leclercq keeps isolating monastic from scholastic theology, whose target was to acquire knowledge, pursuing a venue of objective analysis of his inquiry. The monastic, were just eager to know God, in subjective means of his own existence and within Scripture, earning Leclercq support within the two groups. Scholastic theology that stemmed from the University of Paris was debated orally before it was written. Monastic theology, based on patristic writings was literate from the start.Sources of Monastic Culture:Leclercq definition of the sources of monastic culture, in four headings: devotion to heaven, sacred learning, ancient traditional spirituality, and liberal studies. Defining that experience which \\"induces the desire to reach the culmination of this experience,\\" Medieval monastic culture depended on two sources, textual literary sources absorbed in meditative reading, and experience. Summarizing the content of monastic culture her pronounced in two words: grammar and spirituality. The most important of the themes which kept the monks faithful to the vision of Gregory, was their devotion to heaven, clearly traced in their writings under the topics of the heavenly Jerusalem of which the monastery is a mundane icon, to which is attached the Old Testament concepts of Temple and Tabernacle, mediaeval monks were fond of dwelling on Christ's ascension and of his Transfiguration, similar to Eastern Orthodoxy.Dom Jean Leclercq:\\"Dom Jean Leclercq, OSB, a monk of Clairvaux Abbey in Luxemburg, died on October 27, 1993 in his monastery. For more than sixty years he resolutely used his great erudition for the service of the future of monasticism. He united together a confidence in monastic tradition which he knew so well and a great hope in contemporary humanity, its bold research and its spiritual possibilities which frequently remained unexplored. He was remarkable in the fact that, without holding any particular official place in the monastic order, yet his influence was definitive in many areas.\\" Fr. de Bethune, In MemoriamA Concise Review:The book is what the subtitle proclaims it to be: a study of monastic culture, in medieval Europe.

Over the years I have seen a number of references to Leclercq's book and then I read it. In the Middle Ages (Eleventh century and beyond) learning happened in two social contexts: monastery and school. Leclercq focuses on the monastery, where the monks learned in order to praise God and live devout lives. To pray they had be be able to read the scriptures and other texts - both Christian and classical. What they read and prayed about prompted them to write their own expositions. The more famous of these are ones by Bernard of Clairvaux, Anselm and a few others. In general, the monks had little interest in abstract or conceptual learning; they left this to those teaching at the schools. Overall, Leclercq clearly and thoughtfully describes the learning at the monasteries, which influence later Western thought. The Middle Ages were not as \\"dark\\" as we sometimes think they were."},{"Title":"The Love of Learning and the Desire for God: A Study of Monastic Culture","review":"Back in university in the late 1970's, I took a course at the University of Washington titled \\"The Bible in Early and Medieval Literature and Culture\\". This book was one of the main textbooks. Thirty years later, I still open Leclercq's work to gain greater insight into the development of monastic culture. Leclercq died in October 1993, but not before leaving us with a treasure trove of writings on monastic life, lectio divina, and other subjects. \\"Love of Learning\\" is not casual reading, but intended for the serious student of history, especially anyone fascinated by monastic life, and the development of various forms of monasticism. As a Benedictine monk, Leclercq's hero of course is St. Benedict to whom he devotes many pages of insight, especially the development of Benedictine spirituality over the centuries after Benedict. That is where he has been of great help for my studies in the spread of Benedictine spirituality, and the influence of Benedictine culture upon western Europe and contemporary life. It is not by accident that Benedict is consider the Patron Saint of Europe. Through the spread of Benedictine abbeys across the landscape of Europe, from Portugul to Poland, from Sweden to Sicily, Benedictine life touched the lives of millions of Europeans in those centuries often known as \\"the dark ages\\", with Benedictine monks bringing literacy, health, agriculture, orchards, vineyards, industry, artistry, preservation of ancient manuscripts including the Bible, calligraphy, liturgy, modesty, humility, and stability to villages, towns and cities across a continent. No small feat!

No, instead she shares an example from her own life about dragging home a kidney-shaped table and discovering that a coat of paint couldn't transform it into a Victorian desk.

It is not linear, it does not spoonfeed plot point after plot point just to end up with some timely conclusion that puts you at ease, and in the end, the narrator is absolutely as confused as you are.See the thing is, in truth, The Literary Detective is about a search and rescue mission of sorts: a man named Henri is searching for the truth about who his father was (also named Henri...or was he?), and he hopes there might be a chance to perhaps rescue his father from the image he has created in his mind about who this man really is through a series of interviews with a man named Titus, who claims to have known his father.The novel is full of questions, philosophizing, myths and legends, baseball, poetry and God. It is scattered and jumps seemingly incoherently at times from one thing to the next, but this is the brilliant part about it: all of this reads like a detective who has a desk absolutely littered with sheets of paper that he is using to try and piece everything together in his search to solve this \\"case.\\" This makes the story resonate a bit more if you can catch the image through reading all of the entries.The narrative flow and jumpiness can have their merits despite their off-kilter sensibilities, but the biggest distraction in this novel that really keeps it from shining is the series of errors and misspellings that appear. A certain Hall of Fame pitcher's name is spelled incorrectly, words are capitalized that shouldn't be and vice versa, and in some cases it is simply a matter of changing a vowel or letter to make it one word instead of another. One could argue that no novel is without mistakes, and I agree, it was just that this was hard to deal with because there were more than a few of them in the story.The Literary Detective is anything but a disposable read. You will likely find yourself challenged by what you read, so be prepared to be very patient. I found the ending to be rewarding, if a little odd, but worth it. If it were possible, I would rate this at 3.5 stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Literary Detective","review":"One of the best books I've ever read-- deep, meaty, poetic, and contemplative.

With the care and precision of his Scotland Yard background, Anderson reviews the 69 weeks of the Great Prophecy, dots the yods and crosses the tittles (are there such things in Chaldee?) and brings us to a precision rendezvous with the planned (2nd) triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Mark as the fulfilment of the 69 weeks.The great care he takes demonstrates that he was no clergyman, but a real Bible student.Ignore the man behind the curtain, D. Pentecost could never have done this work. This fellow may be second only to EW Bullinger as a recent and real Bible student."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"Anderson was an investigator and he tackles the prophecy of Daniel and the accumulation of evidence like a pro. When he wanted to know exactly when the moon would rise in a given year he wrote to the Astronomer Royal (who responded).He writes in a somewhat flowery and formal style and there is very little devotional content. Although I'm sure he was a devout believer he is not setting out (in this case) to 'lift Christ up'. He was living in a time when higher and lower criticism were attacking the book of Daniel and he sets out to put forward a 'case' for the simple truth of scripture.In his beliefs he appears similar to Arno C Gaebelien (who has done an excellent book on Daniel too).Anderson settles for a 'traditional' pre-millenialist view of Daniel.I don't think I would recommend this as a first commentary on Daniel or possibly even as a second. But for someone who has already gotten embroyled in all the controversy surrounding the book then this is an extremely scholarly work that HAS to be read, if only because you want to dis-agree with it!"},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"I was amazed with the deep biblical knowledge I found in this book. As a commom man who likes to study I was enriched with the prophetic study and many other information about people, kings and dates mentioned in the Bible. I do recommend its reading to everyone who believes the Bible is the true word of God and wants to know more about prophecy."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"This was the research tool I needed. It was suggested by Chuck Missler as necessary reading for anyone looking to do serious Prophetic Bible study."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"I read this book many years ago and found it nothing less than thrilling. It is the work of a top investigator who searched for the facts before coming to a solid conclusion based on the evidence. Having often read the nonsense that is sometimes spouted out by atheists regarding the Bible, it is good to know that there is abundant evidence to support the divine inspiration of scripture. Surely this is a book which any serious Bible student should read. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"Imagine having a law-trained scholar from the 1890s who headed Scotland Yard during the era of Jack the Ripper and who was knighted by Queen Victoria unlock for you key-turn by key-turn, the secrets of the mysteries of the end-times prophecies in the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Imagine having his analysis calculate for you to the date, year and day of the month the historic events of when Jesus entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, was arrested and crucified. Then know that these calculations are supported by historically documented events based upon the Jewish calendar, as supported by ancient astrological observations and calculations. Imagine all of this taking place and being written down in a book published years before the first shot was fired in World War I. Imagine then again that all of these events were written in the days shortly after Bismarck and not long after Napoleon ravaged Europe. Finally, imagine that this entire effort is intended as a backdrop for the coming \\"end of days\\" as told in Daniel and the New Testament Book of Revelation with a startling basis in historical fact. Stop imagining. You can purchase this long-forgotten book fifty years after its Tenth Printing edition."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"The Coming Prince is not a book for the casual Bible reader, it is a must have for serious students of Old Testament prophecy. Sir Robert Anderson gives the most satisfying explanation of Daniel's seventy weeks. He weaves facts, Jewish history, and geography with scriptures to pour light on the meaning of the 9th chapter of Daniel. This book is stunning in it's portrayal of end time events. There is something for both Christian and Jew in this book and I would highly recommend it to both groups."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"The book was excellent. To me, after the Bible, the most compelling book ever written. The precision goes so far beyond what is customary for theologically-oriented writers. The strongest logical argument for Biblical prophecy, with pre-Septuagint writings giving a stronger prophetic testimony of Christ than most people will ever hear."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"This book initially published in 1894 by Sir Robert Anderson was the first of its kind for its day, and is still as fresh and relevant today for understanding the '70 week' backbone of prophecy in the book of Daniel, which sets out the past and future history of both the gentile nations and the nation of Israel.Apart from the gospel itself, this '70 week' prophecy is probably the most important part of the scriptures in many ways. Anderson sets out the '70 weeks' into the relevant weeks of years and events dealing with such things as the coming of the Messiah (Christ) on the VERY DAY Daniel was told He would come. The most amazing prophecy in the Bible. Anderson also sets out the historical events of the gentile nations which will pattern and lead to the coming Antichrist, who is 'The Coming Prince' of the book title.Much has been written on the subject in the last forty years or so. Current world events are exposing and confirming much, but Anderson was the first to understand and put it together without contemporary help. A must for serious Bible students."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"To those seemingly endless distractors of the Book of Daniel, they would be advised to read this book. The precision of Sir Robert's research is akin to the precision of Gabriel's message to Daniel during the 'Interrupted Prayer', the margin for error is zero. Believer's of the Divine Message will certainly gain astonishing insight and encouragement to see fulfilled prophecy as it unfolds in the world today. As then the head of Scotland Yard, he presents his material in such a logical and methodical manner, an obvious judgement is easily ascertained. Despite his use of some rather arcane language, and accasionally some Latin, your effort will not be unrewarded. This work is a must for the serious interpreter of prophecy, as we are so commanded to do by the Lord himself, He expects us to know and 'understand' its impact on the world and thereby be blessed to spread that encouragement to all."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"Robert over thought the 70 weeks of Daniel it was right in his face, he didn't need to do all his math.Daniel 9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. Messiah was crucified/cut off for the world at 62 weeks, right there in scripture."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"Sir Robert Anderson was one of Britain's best 19th Century slouths. He puts his mind to work on the question of Daniel's prophesies.Even though the book was written over 125 years ago, it reads like it was written in the 21st Century.Sir Anderson also includes the calculation as to the date of Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem in April 32AD."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The older english is a little hard to read, so if you are like me you will need a dictionary as well as a Bible to get through it. I'm sure there are other views on these particular prophecies but I thought Sir Robert Anderson laid out his arguments well."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"This is an excellent book. It is thoroughly researched and explains the seventy weeks of Daniel in detail.Don Stanker"},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"This book analyses the Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah using math. It deduces that Jesus is the Messiah.One interesting thing is that it uses the then current end times theory that the Rapture would be in the second half of the seven years of end times. The pre- and mid- and post- rapture theories are recent inventions."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"The best way to read this book is slowly and thoughtfully with an open Bible at hand...really can't say enough good about this volume. My only regret is that there doesn't seem to be anybody around these days with the force of intellect that permeates this writing."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"good book. robert anderson does a good job explaining the coming Jesus and makes it very easy to read. j"},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"I would recommend this book to any bible student,theologian or anyone that has a an interest in in depth study of the Book of Daniel. The professional skills that Sir Anderson acquired as an investigator has been well utilized in his authorship and research of this book."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"First published only a few years ago...(like in 1894), I suppose I can understand how I was only just introduced to this GREAT work.WHAT?!How has this book been kept so dormant for over 100 years? and why am I only just now learning about it!The information locked within this book for so long will literally blow you mind regarding the accuracy of Biblical Prophecy."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"If you want to have some solid understanding of end times prophechy, read this. You might disagree with what he says, but you'll have to agree that it's good stuff."},{"Title":"THE COMING PRINCE","review":"A little \\"wordy\\". The writer is the type who will impresswith his vocabulary and sentence structure ability...if youdon't choke it up before finishing the book.Still, great in depth prophecy analysis."},{"Title":"Modern Hebrew Stories / Sipurim Ivriyim Moderniyim (A Bantam Dual-Language Book)","review":"In October 1971 Bantam published a dual English/Hebrew edition of a series of short stories by contemporary Hebrew writers. This was part of a series of other dual language books published by Bantam. The justification of such an odd book, original text on one side, translation on the other, is that we can have a sort of running dialog with the original language (if we know it) and the translation. We don't have to accept the translation as writ. We can argue and tangle with the two texts.I do this with the JPS translation of the Tanakh. I constantly scratch my head at the translator's choices. Instead of rendering the Plains of Moab the Plains of Moab, they are called the Steppes of Moab. How justified is this translation? Maybe steppes is closer to the Hebrew original, but in English it conjures up images of snowy, vast Russian open spaces. Something is lost here in this choice.You will find this and more in the translations of several short stories by Agnon, Hazaz, Yizhar, Megged, Amichai, Aloni, Appelfeld and Yehoshua. If you can find this old book scarf it up. Read it and tangle with it. Make meaning out of this fraught enterprise called translation."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"This book is a great tool for the student of the bible, particularly the one who wills to sharpen his/her understanding of the Hebrew text in context.Once you start reading it, it keeps you interested and, in spite of your own notion and interpretation, it will give you another perspective or a better one.Of course I disagreed with some of its content because of my own training and background. Nevertheless, it allowed me to see that the highway used by many is not always the only or best way; the narrow way or local road allows me to see and know more about the place I am going to.I already fell in love with Hebrew, this book simply added fuel to the fire."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"As an owner of Brenner's many books, I must say he has completely educated me about paleo-Hebrew. It is sad that only a few people know about his work. I recommend all of his books to anyone who is seeking for a deeper connection with religion but cannot find it. Brenner's books made me understand how truly wonderful the old testament is through the mysterious letters of Hebrew."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"The book was strong in areas that were not that much of interest to me. It provides a lot of background on the derivation of many hebrew words using the ancient script.I thought that the author overstates the value of the etimology of some of the Hebrew words because as one goes back through how words get their current meaning, the connection becomes weaker and weaker. I believe that this was probably overemphasized in this book.I was also disappointed at the many missed opportunities for presenting the plurality and nature of God in the Hebrew. Clearly the author was writing from a Christian perspective and so I believe that he could have presented some stronger arguments in this area than he did.If you already read Hebrew this book might not be that interesting to you."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"His name is One~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The name does mislead the Jewish reader. I thought he would write aboutOne God. But in the end it was a \\"messianic Jew\\" a Christian. For him Jesus (Yeshua) was God too.That comes to two.It is allright for him. I threw the book away and kept only one page,the ancient letters. Thats what I do not like at amazon. I can never know, if it is really a Jewish book. As I am interested o n l y in Jewish books.

The author does a great job of keeping it simple enough for those of us who do not yet know Hebrew, but have an interest. If you are seeking to grow closer to God and want to know and understand more of His character, this is an excellent tool."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"This book is a great source of the good information that could develop into knowledge that could be an awesome step towards the windows of Wisdom."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"This is well done in explaining the oneness of god.

Shalom"},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"In the world of Biblical language studies there are numerous learning materials that teach one how to simply translate words from their form in one language to another. However, very few will explain to a person the difference between the cultures of two people, and how this affectts interpretation and translation.This book will do just that; it will give the reader a firm introduction to ancient Hebrew culture, and how it affects the way we read, and translate the Old testament from the Hebrew scriptures. More specifically, how we translate the names of God, and view God. We, the English speaking world of today view God from a very abstract point. Most of us view God as an old man, resembling pictures of \\"father time\\", or as some glowing force in outer space somewhere, or as some \\"unseen force\\". To the ancient Hebrews, God was a father, a shepherd, a friend, and a savior. This will all become apparent upon reading this book.As a student of Biblical Languages (Biblical Hebrew, Ancient Pictographic Hebrew, Ancient Greek, and Aramaic), I highly recommend this book. it is a must for all those who wish to obtain a deeper level of understanding concerning God, and how we view him through the Bible."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"This book, as well as all of Jeff Benner's materials, are an absolute must for anyone interested in truly understanding the Bible. The insights are fabulous. By understanding the pictures expressed by the original Hebrew characters, Jeff takes us right back to the root of the word and shows the common sense meaning. With every Hebrew word studied, you leave with a sense of its simplicity and yet its profound implications. In His Name is One, Jeff takes you through many of the Hebrew words used to describe God. It gives tremendous insights into the character of God. I have many dictionaries, concordances, and word study books, but I consider Jeff Brenner's materials more valueable than anything available. They are scholarly and inspirational. I have purchased everything he has written and constantly reference them. I will not be without them. Biblical word study is powerful, and Jeff Benner's materials open the doors of understanding unlike anything else. I can't say enough praises about his books, and the blessings I have received thru them."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"Jeff Benner's books &quot;His Name Is One&quot; and &quot;The Ancient Hebrew Language and Alphabet&quot; are must reads for all Christians. Christianity over the millenia has stripped away it's Jewish roots thereby depriving today's Christian of it's rich heritage.Jeff's books help retrieve some of that lost heritage and introduces you to a God that is more awesome and more personal than you thought possible. I am anxious to read &quot;Learn Biblical Hebrew&quot;!"},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"The material contained within the pages of this book exemplifies the fact that the Hebrew language as well as the Scriptures are alive, not static as many would have it. Those of us whose native tongue is English are at a great disadvantage when trying to grasp a fuller meaning of the Scriptures. Mr. Benner does an excellent job of bridging the gap of Western thought and Eastern concepts in language, which is intrinsic in understanding Hebrew and the nature of the various names of God within the Scriptures.This work clearly demonstrates that each letter of the Hebrew language (specially the ancient Paleo-Hebrew) has a meaning and life all its own. When combined into words, the words of Scripture truly jump to life before your eyes. As I was reading this book, I came to see Hebrew as more of a multi-dimensional language in which the character of Yahweh, Yahshua and the Ruach are intertwined.I highly recommend &quot;His Name Is One&quot; to anyone seeking a richer meaning to Scripture and a deeper spiritual connection to the Almighty whom we serve."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"Jeff A. Benner's book, His Name is One, proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that learning Hebrew reveals gems within the Scriptures that will never be unearthed if one continues to cling to the sanitised NIV or King James English Versions.Potentially volatile issues such as the oneness of the Father and the Son and the trinity dissipate into obscurity when one becomes unshackled by Greco-Roman thought and dons a Hebrew mindset.A must have book for anyone who wishes to immerse themselves in a whole new world that is at best only hinted at in mainstream Christianity.Jason C.N. Jordan - Author of \\"All Lights on in the Master's House\\""},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"I learned a good deal from this book. I particularly liked how he addressed the mistranslations in modern day biblical text and exposed some of the more popular but ignorant modern day views. I think his intentions are genuine and that is more than I can say for some preachers and so called teachers. Jeff's book seems to bring light to the hebrew perspective and I respect the fact that he encourages study and cross referencing of material to dismantle bias. I am awaiting his lexicon. I sincerely hope that the Lord blesses him in his endeavors and he is able to truthfully share. And yes, I am a Christian!!!Leo Williams"},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"An outstanding presentation of why we of the western civilization do not understand the Scriptures. While this is directed at the meaning of one's name in the Hebrew culture, it opens the door to understanding Sematic thought and how that culture saw the world about them."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"In spite of its rather coarse presentation, this book is an eye opening experience when learning biblical Hebrew. Benner explains in a simple way what theologists and other adepts do not tell us about the sacred names of God, making us want to delve deeper and deeper, be it the culture, the Hebrew language or Kabbalah. His explanations and examples are cristal clear, even if one doesn't have any previous knowledge about Semitic languages. Now, The Bible, when reading a compared version (Hebrew-English) makes much more sense than before. Excellent work."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"I would like to thank the author for this wonderful work which helped me better understand the covenant relationship and the name Shepherd along with other names. In particular I would highlight the meaning of the commendment \\"thou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain\\",it is not just saying the name in vain, it is actually not representing His character in vain, since we are made in His image and His likeness and thus His character must be represented. This truth changes everything because we must show Him to the people, and when we don't we thus violate this very commandment.God bless you all."},{"Title":"His Name is One","review":"His Name is One by Jeff A. Benner is a very insightful and thought provoking book. I started out about a month ago researching material for a bible study and came across Lew White's Fossilized Customs online which led me to his book by the same name and Jeff A. Benner's His Name is One. Yahuah certainly works in mysterious ways. Here I thought I'd come up with names of our Creator, Saviour and Holy Spirit and have enough material to last a few bible studies. Little did I know that Yahuah had other plans - as he always does. All that I've been taught in church and accepted while growing up are now being challenged. I'm aware of what our bible went through with the rise of Emporer Constantine so I've been very receptive to all of what's been shared in Benner's and White's books. I know that Yahuah would not lead me where his hand can not guide me. The material that's been uncovered for bible study has turned into deep, meaningful life changing lessons that will affect many. Now, when I pray, I call upon the name of Yahuah and Yashua and have taught a few to do likewise. May the fruits of these writtings be bountiful and may all who partake be blessed!

I absolutely love the way she explained how the couples met and then explained what happened throughout the relationship with eventually ending it from a professional perspective of the things these individuals missed right at the very beginning of the relationship. It's certainly given me the opportunity to reflect back as well as look ahead in order to know some of the \\"hidden\\" signs of manipulation and control individuals have over you while you are still overwhelmed with the excitement of the relationship and the love you are feeling. I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a way to see some of the not-so-good signs of a relationship early on in order to prevent a lot of misery later on.I would also like to add that this book isn't exclusively about \\"romantic\\" relationships. Some are simply friendships, another subject in the book is a homosexual, while others are in a romantic love relationship.It's amazing how there are people in all types of relationships that are manipulating, controlling, and abusive.The book recommends, however, that you cannot use the tools in it to get out of a current \\"bad\\" relationship. It was written for future awareness for when you meet people down the road to see the various signs of behavior that can end up being dangerous.Knowing the seven warning signs of a troubled relationship has definitely helped me to analyze and pick out behaviors that are indeed warning signs.
