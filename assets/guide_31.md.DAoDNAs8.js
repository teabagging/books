A sensitively written history of visual stereotyping and its effects. The book interweaves and points out the importance of Yoruba and other African philosophical heritages and their positive affects on artists, images in the U.S. Really excellent!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Colored Pictures: Race and Visual Representation","review":"Dr. Harris is an engaging, easy to read, writer with strong arguments. This book is great for anyone who wants to learn about this history of race via artistic/cultural representation. It begins by looking at white artists' depictions of African Americans and moves steadily into African American artists' work as the 20th c. progresses. He is a bit one-sided at times, for example in his criticisms of Kara Walker and Michael Ray Charles, but given his AfriCobra affiliation, that is not surprising. Even his criticisms of Charles and Walker are valid-- although I find their work to be just as important. Fascinating read which will introduce you to some lesser-known AfAm artists of the 20th c. Note that this is not a survey text with snippets on a vast number of artists. It is a critical book that works through themes in each chapter and delves into certain artists' careers in a more in-depth manner."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"\\"Coyote\\" is less a novel than a collection of loosely-connected short to medium-long stories about a group of approximately 100 people who leave Earth to colonize a planet in a star system 46 light years away. Actually, there are two mutually hostile groups, and the planet is really a large moon of a much larger planet, but that's not what makes the book work - or fail, depending on your perspective.Steele's straightforward style makes \\"Coyote\\" easy to read, but much of the material is plodding and derivative. There are a lot of unlikely (even unbelievable) elements, ranging from the anachronistic right-wing government he describes in the first section to the rather contrived \\"surprise ending.\\" (I see from other listings on Amazon.com that there are several more books in the \\"Coyote\\" series, but this first one did not make me want to buy or read them.)"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The first question that Amazon asked when typing this review was whether I am over 13.I find it an extremely apt question.I can give this book two scores, based on the age of readers. Either a 4 for a 'rousing', tolerably well-written (for a children's book) and slightly thought-provoking children's book. Or I can give it one stars for a book that has a mature sci-fi reader shaking his head at every single turn of page. Perhaps not shaking, perhaps banging his head against a shelf of well-written sci-fi books.I'm sure children and teenagers will be engaged by this book and will enjoy it immensely.That said, they'd prefer Heinlein.I find it astonishing that this book was written only a couple of years ago.This is not a book that was written, in spirit, in the 21st century. Heinlein was writing better books, in the exact wagons-to-the-stars vein half a century ago. The 'inspiration' is obvious.Adults will be driven to frustration by one-dimensional characters, awful science, barely concealed political frustration, unoriginal plots, pandering to children and the absolute stupidity of plot events and character behaviour.A couple of examples of stupidity includes a laughable plot to steal a spaceship, a spaceship arriving to colonize a planet with no idea what to expect (so if the planet was hostile, the colonists would presumably have been doomed to eating each other in orbit), that spaceship being full of 'scientists' (a very 50s expectation) because agricultural experts were not foreseen, a planet with edible organisms that did not evolve from shared DNA (unexplainable), Marxist superhumans arriving to take over a planet (they have super-fast propulsion systems and cyborgs but forgot to take their food with them) and perhaps the most insulting part of all, a plot development in which a treacherous colonist reveals the colony location to the super-communists by sending them its location by radio. I can see my car parked on my street via Google Earth and I expect those that use zero-point energy could probably read the contents of this computer from orbit and they do not need traitors to find a primitive settlement on a planet.Help, my brain is imploding from this childish sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Steele is a lazy writer. Apparently little thought goes into his words, he just writes without thinking through anything. For example, the colonists arrive at Coyote with a huge supply of guns (Steele throws out the remark that automatic machine guns are setup around the perimeter to keep away the boids) - but the bullets are all 300 years old! And yet they still work. There is a sea that completely circles the equator. This would lead to enormous tides (plus, there is a Jupiter size planet right next door), but Steele misses that. The second sentence in the book read: \\"The Milky Way galaxy is nearly one hundred thousand light-years in diameter, within its spiral structure are approximately fifty thousand stars....\\" Huh? 50,000? All Steele has to do is go to askJeeves.com and ask how many stars are in the galaxy: answer 200 billion (more recent estimates are 400 billion.) At the end of the book, when the social collectists arrive, why would they want anything to do with completely primitive original landing party? They crossed interstellar space to subjegate 150 wayward colonists??? (The original colonists shudder at the idea of this social collectivism, but a few pages earlier Steele tells us that there aren't any locks in the Liberty town because everyone shares - merely ask for something and they will loan it to you it sounds as if the original colonists are already practicing social collectivism.) At one point Steele mentions a wooden currency - but that disappears after one paragraph. Apparently there are only two types of trees on the whole planet - blackwood and faux birch (Steele's paucity of ideas extends to lame names for the trees, the local fauna, everything.) We are expected to believe Gillis happened to spot a spaceship glancing out a port window, even though they are in deep space and thus no nearby sun will illuminate the craft - so do these ships light up like Christmas trees? And how likely are you to spot a ship when travelling a partial speed of light in vast empty interstellar distances? Besides, Gillis wakes up only 3 months after the voyage starts, so how can he spot a WHSS Glorious Destiny when it won't be built for another 50 years? At the end the colonists lock Chris and his mom (why the mom? What crime did she commit) into the jail and abandon them. What would happen if the WHSS people did the expected thing and ignored the Liberty colony, and went off somewhere else on the vast planet to found their own nation? Then poor Chris and his mom starve to death in the jail!!!Obviously, I can go on and on about this very carelessly written and unimaginative book. If you want an exciting SF, try Legacy of Herot by Niven, or Fallen Dragon by Hamilton, or Permanence by Schroeder. There are many more books out there that are vastly better than this lame offering. Skip this! Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Many people have already dismissed the technobabble in this book, so I won't really dwell on it. When he described the hibernation process I couldn't help but wonder why he didn't just call it a magic freezing box. From that point on, I pretty much just skipped over all of the technical descriptions.Many people have problems with the characters, and that's where I find chief fault as well. While it is pointed out that preparation for the expedition is lacking, there doesn't seem to be a single character that tried to be a colonist on another planet. For a group of conspiratorial scientists, you think someone would have done some research into basic survival and pioneering skills.The most egregious example of this is a section where a crewman acciidentally wakes up in mid-voyage from hibernation. He seems trapped, since he did not know know how to put himself back in hibernation, he did not know how to get the computer to let him back in hibernation, and every moment he spent awake he was using resources the colonists would need when they arrived. I kept waiting for this highly-trained scientific officer to do something logical or ethical, and neither occurred.Steele is a good writer in that I never found myself bored by his style, but the entire book was disappointing."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Allen Steele's \\"Coyote\\" is actually a collection of stories and novelettes that have appeared in Science Fiction magazines over a 2-3 year period. They are strung together in a cohesive story about a group of rebels who escape the earth, which is now governed by an ultra-Conservative coalition. Ultimately they wind up on a new world called Coyote on which they build a small community they name Liberty. Steele enters new writing territory with this book. He has traditionally written books set on the Moon or on near-Earth venues in the not-so-far off future. This one travels far ahead.One thing I liked about this is Steele's attention to detail. There are plenty of \\"new world/new colony\\" Science Fiction novels out there. Many of the ones that I have read just brush over things like building toilets. Steele often discusses the lack of these day-to-day necessities and the impact on the characters.I could not really find one clear lead character although there are plenty of antagonists. Among those are a Colonel loyal to the old government. Deadly flying creatures called boids. The elements of the new world. The inner demons of those haunted by a past way of life. The two characters who have the biggest \\"parts\\" are Wendy and Carlos. I find the obscure reference to the trans-gendered synthesizer artist Wendy Carlos almost ironic as this is a person who explored new genres of music.The one flaw is the change in presentation. The first several chapters are written in present tense, which I found distracting at first but easier to follow later. Then half-way through the book it switches to past tense. Generally I found this to be a pretty good read and I am glad that I was able to read it over a few days rather than over three years in various magazines."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"\\"Coyote\\" by Allen Steele was a great disappointment. It has some very interesting ideas, and a great potential for a good novel, but it is not a good novel. In fact, I could not finish the book due primarily to the fact that it is written inconsistently and in PRESENCE TENSE (although there are times the author slips into past tense.) I hated the way this book was written in present tense. Let me clarify what that means. \\"One hand still on his weapon, Carruthers takes the bag from Jorge, lets it dangle from midair while he unzips its flap.\\" (page 80) To me it would have been much better in past tense \\"One hand still on his weapon, Carruthers took the bag from Jorge, letting it dangle from midair while he unzipped its flap.\\"In reading \\"Coyote\\" the way it was written in present tense it kept reminding me of listening to sports commentators. They speak in present tense (I am not a sports fan). So when was the last time a friend related an oral story to you using present tense? It just does not happen.I then pondered and I can recall none of the older classics which were written in the present tense. Of course, I have not read everything, but I have read widely. Is it true that most books in the present tense are relatively recently published ones? Is this just some passing fad? I sure hope so for I have only read one book in present tense that was not ruined by that format (the one exception is \\"The Novelist\\" by Angela Hunt, but she barely pulled it off)Present tense writing just reads as a string of events. It tries to create a sense of urgency which to me, hides the fact that the writer isn't really describing the scene well. Present tense also ruins dialog. It is harder to flow smoothly in and out of flashback and background. After all, writers are telling stories, not reporting the news, or doing commentary on a local high school football game.Coyote was ruined by present tense. To all you potential Sci fi writers and editors out there, please reconsider your use of present tense. It RUINS the stories. But that is just my opinion and I have been wrong many times."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Allen Steele is one of the best \\"new\\" writers I have read recently. He writes very readably and packs a lot of action and personal interaction into this work, creating lifelike and enthralling characters and scifi situations. Steele weaves several plots and subplots masterfully together. This turned out to be the first of at least three Coyote novels, and it sets the stage well for those that follow.The book contains a list of the main characters and several maps of the 47 Ursae Majoris system and the moon on which the colonists land, which are very helpful.Steele presents a good variety of people, so the reader can find himself or herself identifying with one or more of them.The author also introduces the reader to, and explains, a number of fascinating scientific theories and describes how they might actually be applied. (Personally, I am a propulsion-technology fan.) Steele makes it all seem so \\"lifelike.\\"In this book, Steele describes several adventures and a number of helpful survival skills. Although I was a Boy Scout, served in the military, and have read a number of survival-skill books, this author mentions a few tips that I hadn't thought about, previously. I was surprised, but pleased, because it is always good to learn something new from the books you read.Having read the second book, it is somewhat difficult to focus on the events that only happened in this book. Therefore, I am being careful not to reveal too much.This book, Coyote, is a visionary story that takes the reader on the first steps toward colonizing our section of the galaxy. It sets the stage for the following book, introducing another governmental group who wants to \\"share\\" this new site with the original colonists.Steele introduces us to some new technology and includes a few surprises, to delight and fascinate the reader. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I will just encourage you to purchase this book and blast off into a bold new adventure, on an unspoiled world!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The Coyote novels (this is book # 1 in a series) are nominally included in the Science Fiction genre, because they concern the exploration and settlement of an alien planet. But once they land the spacefarers are strangely quick to opt for 19th-century technologies, all the way down to spontaneously domesticating local fauna for use as beasts-of-burden. As a result, these books are basically just Westerns set on another planet. Later the series becomes more concerned with the colonists' fight to preserve their freedoms as various outside authorities - governmental, religious, and corporate - attempt to impose themselves upon the fledgling frontier society.The writing is of a level normally reserved for the Young Adult category, with simple word choice and sentence structures throughout. Narrative details are repeated over and over again to the point of tedium, and the characters are all well-worn stereotypes who behave exactly according to the playbook. The incorporation of Steele's sociopolitical sentiments is heavy-handed to the point of being pedantic as well. (Socialism Bad! Religious Zealotry Bad! Effete Corporate Bureaucrats... BAD! Rugged-Yet-Sensitive Frontiersman? Goooooooood.)Still, the Coyote books are fast-paced and entertaining, and Steele does a good job with his descriptions of frontier life. Many of the conflicts are man-vs.-nature stories of people just trying to survive, which is a nice change in a genre overfull with epic battles between fleets of alien starships. He also successfully juggles an enormous, intergenerational cast of characters, and while none of them is especially original or well-developed, they're all likeable people and I found myself genuinely rooting for them by the end of each book.So, if the idea of a cowboy adventure set on another planet appeals to you, and if you don't expect your leisure-reading to qualify as literature, the Coyote books are worth a try. They probably won't give you much to think about, but they're decent entertainment for long flight or a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The good things: This book is well written and easy to read. Allen Steele has painted a plausible picture of future space exploration. Interesting social interactions, lively (although sometimes a bit \\"flat\\") characters.The bad things: Lots and lots of very basic science errors pop up here and there. It's like the book has been written without regard to basic principles of physics. Some of the most striking examples: the \\"maps\\" in the book show \\"rivers\\" that practically flow in closed loops - all downwards; for some reason the author decided that crossing the line of the equator changes the direction in which the wind is blowing in each hemisphere; etc, etc. This sometimes gets annoying, especially as the plot relies heavily on some of these errors.Generally, I think the book is worth reading, once the reader learns to ignore the bad science."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Coyote is the first of a trilogy of science fiction novels. The plot is that rebels hijack Earth's first star ship and flee a repressive right wing government that has taken over much of the United States. They journey to an earth-like planet 46 light years away. The homesteading life on the planet proves to be difficult and dangerous but the colony is slowly making progress when an unexpected event occurs -- and that's the end of \\"Coyote.\\" The ending is sufficiently enticing that I'll be reading volume two in the triology, \\"Coyote Rising.\\"Author Steele gets an \\"A\\" for story-telling, but he flunks science. I'm not Stephen Hacking and I'd probably fumble at telling you about nuclear fission or fusion -- but I know that the Milky Way Galaxy has a lot more than \\"fifty thousand stars.\\" That's what Steele says in the second paragraph of his book. He's 399,999,950,000 off -- which I believe qualifies as a significant error and compromises the author's credibility. He also makes a number of other errors in the book such as apparently not knowing the difference between east and west. Moreover, the book was originally eight short stories, so it's a bit disjointed where the stories are melded.Despite the errors, \\"Coyote\\" is an exciting and well-written novel which kept my interest throughout. It's partly sci-fi and partly a story that could have been written about the early colonists in the United States. A good tale with good characters overcomes the many deficiencies of the author. For those who dismiss the book as a left-wing jeremiad against American conservatives I would advise them to keep reading. There are hints that the author may not be as doctinaire anti-conservative as he appears --or maybe he is and is just throwing out red herrings to confuse us.

In spite of the tiresome comparison between Mr. Steele and Heinlein, the former I find more satisfying. The first half of the book is almost perfect. Aside from the weak idea that a future conservative republic would name airports and other public buildings after lightweights like Pat Buchanan and Jesse Helms, the setting is believable and the trip out to Coyote is brilliantly done. Surprisingly, the author's imagination seems to fail after the Alabama reaches its destination. Easily the weakest installment in the chronicle is the flight of Wendy Gunther and her companions from camp. She's the least interesting character in the novel and frankly the idea that a teenage girl -already subject to several rape attempts in a camp-would not be on some form of dependable contraceptive stretches the reader's credulity to the breaking point. I wish the author had spent more time chronicling the lives of the Captain and other adults.

I know they started out as a string of short stories but he destroys all the mystery by telling what is going to happen in the first paragraph of each chapter or at the end of the preceeding chapter.(I know TWAIN did that, but that was the general style in the 1800's). I'm a great STEELE fan and loved his last two CHRONOs. If you are Steele fan read this otherwise just read Larry Niven's \\"LEGACY OF HEROT\\" from 1970.ALSO his diagram of the ship is incomplete(He has a key with missing labels on the ship), Also the map sort of gives away alot of the story, It's helpful but reveals too much of the plot.It's probably his second worst book after Jerico It."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"by Lynn Nicole Louis&quot;Coyote&quot; is a compilation of eight previously published stories, including the Hugo-nominated &quot;Stealing Alabama&quot; and &quot;The Days Between.&quot; As such, it doesn't read like a traditional novel, since the focus of the segments is on different characters. Too, each story is self-contained; overall they fail to form the traditional arc a reader usually finds in a novel.

So i would definitely recommend buying this book!!!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"It's been quite a while since I've read any science fiction, and being normally quite picky with what I like in the science fiction world, the title of this novel was a let down, while the subtitle piqued my interest. After reading Coyote, I can say it truly is a great science fiction novel of interstellar exploration.The time is about sixty or so years in the future. The American system of government has gone to hell, and there is only one party and it's basically one big ugly dictatorship, much like 1984. The American government has bankrupted the country to build a great spaceship which will travel across the galaxy to a distant star where there is a distant planet (much like Saturn) with a distant moon called Coyote that is just like Earth.But Captain Robert E. Lee has plans to hijack the ship and get a bunch of illegal people aboard to start a new world and life in the stars away from this terrible excuse for a nation. Everything goes according to plan and they are off on the two hundred year journey in safe biostasis. Except something goes wrong with one man whose tube opens for some unknown reason, and he is left to the horrors of living on a ghost ship for the rest of his life while the crew remain in comfortable biostasis. He does not survive.Upon arrival on the planet, the hundred or so pioneers begin to start their new lives, as they deal with this new world, new plant life, and new predators. Lives are lost and times are hard for them in the first few years. And just when a system of order is created, the greatest shock of all happens: people from Earth show up on Coyote's doorstep.It is not surprising that Steele has won the Hugo Award two times, and after reading Coyote, I only hope there is a sequel and I will keep a lookout for one of his earlier novels, Chronospace. Coyote is what I always dreamed ideal science fiction to be like, and it happens to be one of the best science fiction books I've read.Originally published on February 3rd, 2003.[...]"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This books is put together from several short stories and novellas that were written and published separately. Some of them read better than others. All have very heavy handed foreshadowing - if telling you right up front how many people will die in the next section can be called foreshadowing. The similarity of Coyote to Earth seems way too easy - more like something out of 1950's SF. The biggest complaint I have, though, is the comparisons to Heinlein when R.A.H. would never have published such sloppy science.Examples:1. At one point a starship is somewhere around the Kuiper belt, but constellations aren't recognizable because stars have moved so far. Given that the nearest star to Earth is some 3 light years away, travelling to the Kuiper belt is not going to move anything far enough to make much difference compared to what's seen from Earth.2. Coyote (a moon) has a flat, circular orbit around its planet and no axial tilt. It's planet's orbit has no inclination to the plane of the system, but it is elliptical, which accounts for seasons on Coyote. Fine. However, Steele then goes on to talk about days getting shorter as the seasons move towards winter. With no axial tilt, days will be the same length in any season.The characters are better than those of Spindrift, but overall this is one of the less imaginitive books I've read. Readable, though."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Caution: spoilers.I believe if you are going to write \\"hard\\" SF, you should know a bit about science.

Wouldn't it be a fairly safe bet that a starship that could travel at .95 the speed of light would be able to pinpoint the source of transmission on a planet half the size of earth? Maybe the evil Progressive Marxist regime that replaced the evil Right Wing Conservative regime on future earth banned the use of telescopes or signal triangulation from outer space.

It wasn't terrible but it really wasn't very good. The setting is interesting but the rest of the story didn't live up to it.There were a number of errors in basic physics that kept scuttling my suspension of disbelief. Some of them seemed to be the author's attempt to add hard-science-y detail without actually getting the details right, which could have been either omitted or fixed up with the help of someone who understood the science. (There's no shortage of people willing to do the fact-checking!) Some would have required moderate to major rewriting of the story. Since the novel is a fix-up of shorter works previously published in SF magazines, it's startling that these problems weren't corrected somewhere along the way.There are subtler errors in biology and biochemistry. Again, these could have been fixed... but weren't.There was a *lot* of \\"idiot plot\\": vast organizations creating massive projects which are fundamentally flawed; people keeping crucial facts to themselves for no good reason.Given that the novel is a fix-up, it's unfortunate that more care wasn't taken to clean up the \\"what has gone before\\" tid-bits that were intended to clue in someone who was reading only one of the short works at a time. There were several other more fundamental proof-reading failures.On the whole, the book was a disappointment. The author has received a lot of positive recognition, but I'm not going to rush out to try his other works."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I went into this book expecting something like a Heinlein juvenile, e.g. 'Red Planet', 'Starman Jones', 'Farmer in the Sky', etc. which I always enjoyed. I was willing to look past a political message (God knows Heinlein always had one) and to let slide a couple of foolish technology assessments (again Heinlein was guilty of a more than a few astrogators working their slide rules...) and enjoy a medium-hard SF/adventure story.Wow. This book is awful. The author strikes a nearly impossible chord of providing just enough information to make his constructed universe irrational and inconsistent. Fewer details and some hand waving, and this could be a decent SF adventure story. But if you're going to give details they have to make sense. Many times I fought the urge to put the book down, in the hope that it would redeem itself, and each time it got worse.The science, the technology and the future history are either silly and childish, inconsistent or utterly irrational. There is not a single deep idea in the book, and the characters are just as shallow.Steele has no respect for his readers. Assuming he is not a stupid man, he (and his editors) must believe that we are."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Allen Steele is no hard sci-fi writer. The book is filled with glaring basic mistakes in his scientific understanding and world creation. I can't help but notice that the positive reviews on this site seem to ignore the science (and perhaps were written by those rather new to the genre).I didn't catch the tides thing that others have written about until I read about it here. But there are many, many other errors.For instance, the ship has a 230 year voyage at .2c (20% of the speed of light). This covers 46 light years. OK, so far so good. Assuming lower speed during acceleration and deceleration, and leveling off for most of the voyage, the math can work out. The problem is Steele, in the same chapter, tells us that the ship is under constant acceleration from a ramscoop drive and also tells us that the speed levels off at .2c. Huh? Well, possibly just an editing error right? The author may have meant that the ship constantly accelerated with an overall average speed of .2c, right? um, no...A major character dies because of a fall from several stories within a shaft in the ship, which could only happen if the ship was under significant acceleration (this is 32 years into the voyage at this point). Let's say the ship has to be accelerating at a rate of at least .3 of earth's surface gravity in order for this fall to be fatal. Well, that takes the travel time for 46 light years down to something like 52 years on earth and 17 years ship time. Doesn't quite work out. Even at .1g, which surely would not cause a fatal fall from an accidental slip on a ladder in a narrow shaft (hint: reach out and grab the ladder), the travel time would be something like 62 years on earth and 36 years on board. To match Steele's numbers, continuous acceleration would be somewhere in the neighborhood of .0035 g's.Also, he apparently forgot to think about where computers and robots will be in 50 years. His colonists pilot surface-to-orbit shuttles by joystick, and land them by manual control. The colony ship has maintenance robots that clean it while the colonists sleep (apparently constant cleaning would somehow be necessary on an ship where nothing alive is exposed to the environment), but once they land, they have no machines to help them farm, explore, or work. They burn down the weeds then rake the soil, 20 people to an acre. Hmm. The colony starship has an AI that holds a natural-language conversation with a colonist, but lacks any programming oriented to protect the interests of the colony or preserve a colonist's life. They don't have a way to construct decent shelters except by manually sawing through blackwood (takes them hours to saw through a limb...they apparently don't have a chainsaw or a laser to speed things up).Others have mentioned the glaring inconsistencies between the map included in the book and the narrative.Also, I found the characters lacking. I'm not sure where other reviewers are coming from when they call the characters believable or well-developed. For example: the teenage girl character writes in her journal with the exact same voice as the author sports when using the 3rd person point of view, or the ship's captain uses when he's the point of view character. The military a-hole who accidentally joined the rebels is...a military a-hole. We learn nothing more about him. The list goes on.Even the social structure of the colony is hard to believe. The colony was founded by a government that strictly forbade abortion by penalty of death. OK, so they are rebels from that government. I still find it hard to believe that they would basically mandate abortions under a 'moratorium' on births during the first year or two of the colony.This book was just impossible for me to enjoy. I do enjoy non-hard SF, like, for instance, Orson Scott Card. He doesn't write the science like Larry Niven or Kim Stanley Robinson, but he also doesn't dwell on it. His stories aren't ABOUT the science. Not so with Steele. I think Steele could have done a good job if he didn't attempt to be a hard sci fi writer without putting in the research or effort to do it right. He could have told all the human stories he wanted to tell within the same basic framework if he had simply kept the technical details very general or very vague. (For instance: don't tell us what the ship's speed is. Just tell us how long it took. We'll assume the math works out.) Or...god forbid...read one of the several books that were specifically written to help sci fi writers in their world creation.The obvious lack of caring and effort on the part of the author to really develop his scifi concepts really distracted me from the story."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I'm a sucker for a good space/planetary exploration story, and I've enjoyed Allen Steele's writing in the past, so I began COYOTE anticipating a good read. Alas, it didn't really live up to my expectations. The book starts off with a right-wing regime in control of the southeastern US and a group of dissidents hijacking Earth's first interstellar colony ship in order to escape. The book goes on to detail the events of the voyage to the new planet, dubbed \\"Coyote\\", and the first few years of the new colony.All this might have worked well enough, but the story is actually cobbled together from several short stories. As a result, the focus of the book shifts from one central character to another as it moves from one storyline to the next. As a whole, COYOTE has an episodic feel to it, and the benefit of seeing events from more than one viewpoint is wasted as key early players are left to become secondary characters later on.Rather than arousing sympathy, conflicts among the characters came across as petty and annoying. In the end, I found myself not caring overly much what happened to any of them.COYOTE is apparently the first book of a trilogy. On that basis there's hope that the other installments will turn out to be more coherent and compelling than this one. It's not that it was a bad read, just that it wasn't especially good, either. As a standalone, I wouldn't recommend it. If the entire trilogy turns out to be entertaining, then this one's worth the effort. As things stand, the jury's still out."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"You don't have to guess much where Allen Steele comes down in current politics. In his Coyote future, the Dixiecrats of the 2000's have won complete control at last, and set up a totalitarian regime that names its ships after Jessie Helms and George Wallace. Although the Northeast and the West have broken away from what was the United States what remains is totally contemptible. If you are a straight Republican voter you won't like any of this.The male hero, Robert E. Lee, rejects for reasons never fully explained his position of status and privilege to lead a rebellion that steals a starship.This story is told as a series of somewhat unconnected vignettes, each well written and from varying points of view. The female central character, Wendy, starts out interesting but never somehow develops. Her ultimate mate, Carlos, never seems that likable but again his development seems obscure.There's another character that seems to have utterly nothing to do with the story. He wakes up on the interstellar voyage and incredibly has no way to go back into hibernation. So he spends the first part of the 230 year voyage wandering the ship and writing a novel until he dies. Nobody else in the story has any interaction with him other than to read his legacy. I would have preferred the 5,000 or so words to be devoted to after the exodus and it would have been a better story.There are other loose ends, other unexplained motivations, but those aren't important. You will have to read this for yourself to see if you end up caring about the characters or not."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Coyote is the fourth moon for a Jovain gas giant orbiting a star 46 lightyears from earth.

Don't miss his latest novel!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The author created a distinctive and potentially interesting setting for a new world to settle - a huge moon orbiting a gas giant - but failed to consider its physics in his story. Most glaringly, he has characters blithely pull up small boats and camp overnight right on the shores of a sea-sized \\"river\\" - which would actually be subject to daily tides on the order of 1000 feet, ensuring their certain demise in their sleep. The writer had a certain romantic notion of a story in mind, and lacked the integrity to write a different (and probably more interesting) story when physics didn't support it.Neither the author nor characters seems to have ever heard of \\"planning\\". They land at the first convenient spot that a shuttle pilot picks *in flight* to the landing. The post-landing activities are directed off-the-cuff with no established priorities. They land with *no idea* of how they are going to govern themselves.The characters are foolish and deserve the grim fate their planet will mete out to them. Most annoyingly, some teens deliberately sabotage essential equipment incidental to an unauthorized escapade. Because the equipment is essential and irreplaceable, and there is a great risk the teens will never return with the information needed to correct the damage they left behind, this \\"prank\\" is truly a potential death sentence for the entire colony. But when they return and fess up, they are not even punished. At all. On a *real* frontier, they would face some serious punishment, maybe exile or worse - how can the community possibly trust these fools in the future?The overall work is a choppy collection of three novellas, but each has a good narrative flow and is easy enough to read - especially the middle part, which also lacks the major flaws I've noted. This is definitely a writer to watch - if he gets past the cliche story to actually explore the worlds he imagines, he will give us some good work in the future.But this one, you can skip.PS. Note how many of the favorable reviews start with something like \\"I don't read a lot of SF but I like this...\\". Exactly. In contrast, I have been an avid SF reader for 40 years, and rest assured, this is NOT good science fiction."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"It appears that Steele doesn't know much about biology, ecology, or physics for that matter. Although the book is somewhat entertaining, it's a bit frustrating while reading when Steele failed (pretty bad, I might add) at illustrating the ecology of Coyote. There are a lot of things that do not make sense on Coyote. Granted Coyote is a fictional moon, which has a different ecology than Earth and organisms that we do not see on Earth, but it lacks a diversity of life to support an ecosystem. For example, there aren't enough animals on Coyote to have a food chain. What do the boids feed on? How do they get so big? There aren't intermediate predatory animals? There are other flaws throughout the book and too many to mentioned. Whoever the editor that edited his book didn't do a very good job at catching these flaws."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I'm not what you would call a huge fan of science fiction, but I found Coyote to be a compelling, interesting read. Coyote is a moon of a planet in a solar system many light-years from Earth. The action in the novel takes place well in the future, when the world has drastically changed. The U.S. is no longer, and what is in its place is particularly unappealing. The starship Alabama is about to launch when it is hijacked by its own crew filled with, instead of the intended party loyalists, social dissidents. The successfully make it to Coyote (and Steele gets them there with some imaginative sci-fi creations) and form the rudiments of a society. They ultimately have contact with earth again, but it is not the earth they left. Coyote is a very readable, very enjoyable sci-fi novel.

You can tell that it is the first book of a series in the last chapters. Just who are coming to Coyote? And how will they interact with the people there? This is the start of a very rich and enjoyable series. And one that I would recommed to everyone."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Allen Steele's Coyote details Humanity's first interstellar colonists in the late 21st century as they attempt to flee a repressive, totalitarian government and then survive on an alien world that has some similarities to Earth, but is also markedly different.Coyote is primarily a chronicle of these intrepid pioneers. Not only does it depict how they escaped the clutches of a despotic government, but it also goes into some detail about their new world. What is the world like? What does it feel like if you are walking along its streams or tromping through its swamps? Steele goes into a fair amount of detail describing what this world looks like...what kind of plants and animals share the environment with the colonists? How do the colonists survive their first seasons on the new world...especially prepping for the long winters (Coyote's year is three times the length of Earth's).Ultimately, the author does a good job of pulling you into the world that his colonists are confronted with and makes you want to keep turning pages. The only significant gripe I had with the story is that the author admits to piecing this novel together from a series of short stories, and while he does this reasonably well, there were spots where the seams could have been sewn together a bit better. Nonetheless, I am most definitely looking forward to picking up the sequel in the near future and would recommend Coyote to others who enjoy similar stories."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said, basically, &quot;good story, lousy science.&quot; The low biodiversity and other problems are all there. Another one that Mr. Steele missed was the small problem of tides. The tidal forces near a super-Jovian gas giant are thousands of times stronger than anything we experience on Earth. On a tidally-locked moon, this isn't so bad. On a rotating planet (such as Coyote), the ocean basins basically would empty and refill twice per day (with appropriate tides)... I assume that Mr. Steele wanted to avoid trying to figure out a tidally-locked world, but his solution (ignore the details) is inadvertantly humorous. Basically, enjoy the book for its well-drawn characters. I don't regret buying it, but it's not a great book."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This book is so full of technical errors that it should be listed as Fantasy instead of SciFi.I read in his bio that he testified before the House of Representatives in hearings regarding space exploration in the 21st century. That was a waste of time. A janitor at NASA would have contributed more.Steele needs to team up with somebody with some technical knowledge. Or perhaps spend some time at the Patrick J. Buchanan Education Center.Don't waste your money or your time."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"As far as science fiction is concerned, I tend to drift more towards the stories of Gene Roddenberry and the like. However, for reasons I can't explain, this book caught my eye as I was walking through the bookstore. I'm very glad that it did; this is quite possibly the best sci-fi title I've ever had the privilege to read (and believe me when I say that I've read quite a few). Allen Steele has truly created a Heinlein-level masterpiece in the beautiful planet to which I find myself returning over and over. It seems to blend the classic Clarkian space opera with the frontier adventure stories of Gary Paulsen. Part of the reason for that is because I think Allen Steele has done more than create a rich sci-fi world; he has reminded his audience of the fundamentals of the American dream in a fresh, new style. His novel warns of the dangers of partisan bureaucracy (ingeniously managing to do so without pointing fingers, in fact) while simultaneously reaffirming the basic American need for freedom.In addition to the soundness of his ideology (which I can't fully embrace, but that's because of personal opinion), he has a very engaging writing style. I think Mr. Steele's journalistic background has definitely worked to his advantage in this story; this book is a true page-turner and a wonderful adventure. Part of the great chemistry for that adventure is in his characters. His dramatis personae is very diverse, and each character in the story is a unique individual. In many stories of this scope, the characters occasionally get muddled together. Not so with Steele's story. As another testament to the soundness of a good sci-fi saga, Steele is extremely well researched. He correctly uses many terms associated with quantum mechanics and astrophysics to create a believable scenario. Some of the history/science minutiae in the book's prologue are a little dated, but that happens with almost every sci-fi novel eventually and has no bearing on the actual story.I also like the organization of the story. The book was originally published as a series of short stories in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, and these stories have been slightly altered and republished in novel form. This is a good thing because it minimizes the time commitment to reading the book. Clear stopping points are easy to find for readers on limited time. You should be warned, however, that there is magic within the pages of this book - stopping points are easy to find, but you won't want to stop reading once you start. This is the first book in a trilogy (which has been followed by a sequel duology and several other spin-off books); it can be read by itself, but I have the feeling that you might reach the end of the first volume and be left hungering for more. I certainly was."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"If you are a student of the American Revolution and enjoy a thoughtful and scientifically accurate SF yarn, then the Coyote books are for you. The pacing is marvelous as the revolutionaries plan daring plots of subversion and--racing against the clock--carry them out at great personal sacrifice. No carboard villains here; the bad guys fully believe in their causes and are just as fallible as our heros. Steele's fascinating alternative ecosystem on Coyote is well thought out and credible, too.Some may find the structure of woven short stories and POVs distracting. I found it innovative and refreshing."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This book is \\"science\\" fiction in the sense that it its setting is an interstellar voyage to start a colony on the moon Coyote, in a planetary system 230 light-years from the Sun.However, I found it to be mostly a study of the social workings of the new colony. The problems inherent to starting a colony in a new ecosystem were not dwelt upon. The moon was different from Earth, but not very much different.From the social point of view, I thought the book was OK. There's a large cast of characters, and a few of them are singled out for development. I found Carlos Montero's story to be interesting in its ups and downs.I also enjoyed the episode with one of the colonists being woken up during the voyage, and being forced to live out his life alone on the starship with everyone else asleep. A neat storyline.I also must point out that I've just come from an author signing, and Mr. Steele said that when he was writing, he wrote not as Ch. 1, Ch. 2, etc., but rather as a series of short stories. This may be why some other reviews thought the book was a little disconnected."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This is a great book, an exciting adventure, and very political. However, it is not finished. It is easy to get caught up in the story of a small group of space pioneers trying to build a new life on Coyote, but because it is told in vignettes there is little cohesion. Characters appear, tell a bit of their story in journal format, and disappear. It is like a game, who will survive? Not that they all die, their storyline is simply dropped. At some point I no longer tried to remember their names or roles in the society. Time crawls by, and then it jumps in years. But I kept reading and enjoying the adventure. The book is a circle. When I got to the end I realized I was back at the beginning. These people want to be free from any political structure but their own. So I need to read the second book, the continuation of the story. So far there is none. I am left without answers to my questions. Was there another civilization on Coyote? Are those other creatures primitive man or Ewoks? Do they have a governement? What happens when the medicine runs out? What happened to the other spaceships? What is the legacy of the next generation? If Coyote gets crowded will they flee to yet another planet? Or will they want to become part of the larger group their parents chose to shun? I need more!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Have you ever read a book that was, well, pretty good- not great, but pretty good- only to have your willing suspension of disbelief ripped apart by one or mor ereally dumb things the author couldn't resist putting in?Yeah, it's a lot like that.This is a pretty good, and pretty imaginative store. It's not a particularly original one; the same story has been told any number of times by other writers, but Steele does a workmanlike job of stiching the various tales togetehr. Unfortunately where he gets original is where he sticks his foot in it.The story opens in a United States that's come under the control of a repressive dictatorship. Sort of like \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", or perhaps bits of the Ender saga, or number of other stories. And who has taken over the country? Libertarians. Yes, those opressive, dangerous Free-Marketeers. Hmm.So we ignore that and move on to the rocket shuttles, which are names the \\"George Wallace\\" and the \\"Jesse Helms\\", which are Steels's idea of heroes of the future repressive state. Except both of these former politicians ended up renouncing their former racist views in the later years, and Wallace in particular ended up embarking on a campaign to atone for his earlier sins. It gets worse- and dumber- but I won't mention how as to do so would be to telegraph a major plot development. Not that it really matters as Steele himself telegraphs it less than halfway through the book.Now it's not an awful book; far from it. There are a great many books far worse out there. It's a reasonably interesting story, and probably ideal for passing time in an airport lounge"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this wonderful novel. It sort of invoked some of my Alan Dean Foster images of some of ADF's early novels. The excitement of the first part and the description of the totalitarian state that the United States could become seems out of tomorrow's headlines. Indeed, when I was starting to read this book I saw a headline that NASA was given the green light to start developing a new Nuclear Propulsion system. Contrast this to the headlines detailing the breakdown in civil liberties that is inherent in our trying times and you can see the handwriting on the wall. Given the fact that this novel was started well before Sept 11 give me the wilies.Anyway, to compare this to Niven's Legacy of Herort is to do injustice to both. While it shares some elements of both they are truely two different works. While Niven's story details a fight to the death with the unruly beasts of Avalon, Steele's world is a reatively benign world awaiting fronteersman to tame. The plot and situations are believable and the dystopian future they escape from are chilling. A good story of a new frontier to conqueor."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This novel was a lot better than I thought it would be. It seems any sci-fi novel talking about the exploration of another planet by colonists comes down to a tale similar to the old west of the United States or the fledging colony on James Island in Virginia in the 1600's. Which could make for a boring tale with overused themes such as the lone saloon at the edge of town, the town drunk, bitter rivalries between former friends due to the shortage of women, building canoes to explore the new untamed wilderness, etc, etc ends up being an enjoyable read. Allen Steele has a connective style of writing that keeps you mesmerized to the story. And there are interjections of hard science fiction here and there to keep things very interesting.The book starts off as heavily political and you think you know what the politics will be from reviewing the first few pages and seeing names like Robert E. Lee and the Gingrich Space Center. As it turns out though, any name (except Lee) given to a facility or spacecraft is meant in the worst way. The US has broken up into three different sections with the largest as a fascist totalitarian state that sends \`dissident intellectuals' to such places as \`reeducation'-camp/concentration-camp/labor-camp/gulag/death-camp Patrick Buchanan. Is anyone in the United States *really* worried about being rounded-up in the middle of the night and armed troops forcing them out of their homes... even after having read this book. Does anyone in the US personally know anyone rounded-up in the middle of the night and \`disappeared'. Sure, science fiction is supposed to be on occasion cautionary tales; but what else, cautionary tales of the same cautionary tales. Sure enough, there are a lot of scary, influential, people that have to be held in check, but I've seen many well-meaning, intelligent people lose their perspective. Well, the above is something that, if not already, one will have to be accustomed to. Steele does try to offset things by writing about the negatives of a social collectivism, although it's also as ludicrous with such high level personnel given names after Castro. The whole politics of the book may have supposed to be a big joke. What it does seem to support, even though a one point it appears to mock it, is libertarianism (and which may bring the comparisons to Heinlein) as individual spirit is one of the things valuable in colonizing a new world.Imbedded in the novel is the most realistic male-female relationship dialogue I've ever read anywhere by anyone. There's a male talking to his girlfriend after being distressed all day that eventually opens up to his girlfriend on some dubious action or lack of action, and after so the girlfriend responds by telling him the relationship is over.This is a novel that may have won a science fiction award if written many years ago when this theme was the style of the time. The ideas here have been explored before, but what's refreshing about it is that it's a modern writing."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"As a fan of Allen Steele's Near Space series who hasn't read much from the author since the publication of A King of Infinite Space in the late 90's, I was pleasantly surprised to find that his latest book is a return to his most potent subject, that of the human exploration of space. From interviews and personal correspondence with Mr. Steele (yes, he's generous enough to respond if you send him e-mail), I gather that Coyote was originally envisioned as a sequel to A King of Infinite Space, which concludes with the main characters blasting off in a colony ship to a nearby solar system. Instead of continuing the series, though, Steele eventually decided to take the basic idea and create a new universe. The result is Coyote, which is as readable and entertaining as anything Steele has written. As a portrait of humans exploring a new world, it can easily stack up against anything in the Near Space series. Many of the stories, in particular \\"The Days Between\\" and \\"Across the Eastern Divide,\\" show how much Steele has matured as a writer since some of the early stories in Sex and Violence in Zero-G. The novel has two major flaws, though. The first lies in the structure of the novel, which is very episodic. Although this is understandable considering that it originated as a series of short stories, a little more editing could have produced a tighter work. However, it does allow for the inclusion of multiple perspectives and a greater overview of the different people that compose the Liberty community than could be afforded by a traditional focus on one or two main characters. The second flaw is the fact that Steele's personal politics (which seem to be those of an old-school Truman Democrat) occasionally interject themselves a little too nakedly into the text, particularly in the beginning. As a native of South Carolina, I find the idea of a near-future U.S. dominated by right-wing southern fascists a little irritating. However, these are just minor reservations. I recommend Coyote to anyone interested in Allen Steele and look forward to the sequel coming out soon."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"This book is so hilariously awful I was sure it was some kind of joke. Jeez Louise, where to begin when every single place you look is a disaster area? What about the statement that the Milky Way has 50,000 stars (try 300 billion). Or that the future is symbolized by maglev trains, \\"smart\\" desks, crude robots and primitive AI - all existing presently. The tenor of the entire book is 18th century - not 21st. Despite the author's progressive attitude and predicted trends, people of color are strangely absent. The crew and settlers are lily-white crew save for the the token Asian or Hispanic. The political writing comes in for the harshest criticism. It is pathetically amateurish. The author resorts to using current (or past) conservatives as villians (in 2070 will anyone know or care about George Wallace or Jesse Helms)? It's simultaneously transparent and embarrassingly childish. There is not a hint of subtlety or nuance, reminding one mroe of a badly-written middle school paper.The \\"plot\\" to capture a starship (costing a mere 100 billion - LOL) is pure Indiana Jones. For some reaoson, the regime with all its invasive spying techniques fails to detect a single hint of the plot. I could almost forgive these howlers but for the godawful story and the pathetic characters. In true sci-fi fashion, we are given caricatures without an atom of authenticity - the noble captain, evil politician, valiant liberal thinker, perky stowaway child, stern military man, blah blah. Everyone is one-dimensional, instantly forgettable.A short vignette of a traveler mistakenly awoken early in the voyage is strangely compelling - a good piece of writing hidden between junk. At last they awaken after 230 years and folks act like they arrived at Grandma's - unhook, stretch and tell the kids not to run around. Once we reach the surface it's a classic case of SURVIVOR COYOTE as they plow for food, forage through the forests, fight alien creatures and each other. They build log cabins using technology circa 1950 proving once again that the author uses science fiction as a foil for a political story. The ending is utterly predictable - a spaceship arrives from Earth commanded by the \\"Matriarch\\". She explains that the regime was overthrown 200 years previously (who would care at this point?) and she is bringing the gift of Social Collectivism, a sort of fuzzy Marxism. She explains that advances in science were possible only thru the use of collectivist political theory and with that last bit of nonsense the book gratefully concludes."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I think this is an excellent book, well worth your reading time.

The characters all seemed too shallow, they are either good or bad without any further development - at least none that was making me care for any of them. The science is doubtful and sometimes aggravatingly misunderstood, and the world building is uninspired for the most part.Maybe the blend of dystopian, hard science fiction space opera was too ambitious, or maybe the original short stories should have stood by themselves. The best thing to say about this book is that it is a pretty quick read and it probably is still the best in the series, it is going downhill from here --- although the titles suggest otherwiseCoyote Rising,Coyote Frontier). These books could have been of more value in a historical context had they been written twenty or thirty years earlier, but as a fairly recent publication they cannot compare to any of the current outstanding authors. The additional spin-offSpindriftthen is not much more than a Rama transcript into the Coyote universe."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Very entertaining and well done issues and characters. \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" has finally happened, and the the new pilgrims flee persecution, led by Captain Robert E Lee who hijacks the world's first long range space craft to do it. Then, instead of setting up a liberty oriented, new, free society on the new frontier of Coyote, they elect a counsel that controls everything, even when women can give birth (including the possibility of forced abortion), all guns are kept safely locked away, and they even end up issuing wooded dollars (fiat currency). Then, the World Socialist Union or some such eventually makes to Coyote, and threatens the group's independence, and they all say such things as \\"as everyone knows, socialism is bad, so we must fight them.\\" I had a hard time following: Socialist Pilgrims leave earth to get away from Nationalist Theocracy, and then they end up denouncing the incoming socialists as a threat to their \\"freedom.\\" BUT, it also occurred to me that this disconnected view is really much closer to our historical reality, so I am forcing myself to read Coyote Rising.

If some of the science was more believable I'd give this story a 4 and half or a 5.As someone else has already mentioned, there's not near enough bio-diversity. There should be many more types of animals, birds, plants. The pull of gravity from a gas giant planet that close would have enoromous effects on the tides of Coyote.And the author is seriously directionally dyslexic. A teenager leaves to explore on his own. A couple of time we're told he's headed west, but if you look at the map in the book, he's obviously headed east. Later on in the story the direction changes and suddenly he's headed east, which fits with the map, but these kinds of mistake should be noticed before the book is published. On one page it says, 'back on the river....head west'.A few lines later it says since 'the prevailing winds are from the east, he was seldom able to raise his sails, so progress was slow'. These kinds of stupid errors are irritating.OK, now that I've got those complaints out of the way, I found the story itself and the people to be interesting and beleivable.The author may even be a little prophetic. Looking at the USA from the outside, it's completely believable that the country could turn into the kind of undemocratic place that Steele writes about. Americans seem to be more willing to give up their liberties because of religious intolerance and fear of terrorists. That's what helps make good science fiction. You can see the possibilities of the fiction becoming fact. A lot of non-Americans wouldn't be surprised to see the rise to power of the &quot;Liberty Party&quot; and eventually the United Republic of America.I liked the people. I liked the story, and I liked the ending. As long as there's a sequel to finish the story. We certainly need to learn more about those 'sandthieves'."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"In the twenty-third century, the United States is no longer the home of the free. In fact it is no longer the United States since Pacifica and the New England states are separate nations. What is left of the once proud country is the United Republic of America, a fascist right wing country ruled by the Liberty Party. It is a nation where dissidents are placed in reeducation camps and the party's young are encouraged to enroll in youth hostels where they are indoctrinated to believe the propaganda as gospel truth.As a testament to it's glory, the party has funded the starship Alabama, a one hundred billion dollar space ship that is to send one hundred supporters to colonize a habitable planet. Thanks to the bravery of key personnel the ship is successfully skyjacked by dissidents who plan to form a colony based on the radical concept of democracy. So begins the story of the Founding fathers and mothers.COYOTE is a rousing tale of revolutionaries starting over on a new planet much the way the pilgrims started over in the New World. The characters are well drawn, complex and totally believable as they escape a police state to pioneer an uncharted planet.

He clearly wasn't satisfied with going on about fascist(aka Republican) goverment and just had to name concentration camp, Bucanan. Dude, are you serious? And I don't even like Patrick Buchanan but it certainly irritated the crap out of me. Why is it always right wing goverment who is oppressive and totalitarian? Since I grew up in Russia, I can perhaps give him few lessons which type of goverment is oppressive and acts like the one he described.However, if you are willing to ignore that little piece of information, you can actually enjoy first half of the book. After that it gets pretty boring. You would think that reading about people trying to colonize another planet would be more exciting. Alas, no. About as fun as watching grass grow.

Of course, since this is a science fiction book, the author can write anything he wants. But the type of totalitarian government he describes in the book has always come from the left of the political spectrum, not the right.I am no fan of people like Buchanan, who is a thinly veiled Anti-Semite, but I don't read books to have politics shoved down my throat.

Is there anyone writing science fiction today that does not have a preachy left-wing message?"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Coyote (2002) is the first novel in this series. Except for a minor quibble or two, I found this story a pleasure to read.Allen Steele has previously used themes similar to the near space frontier works of Arthur C. Clarke. Coyote, however, echoes several themes in Robert A. Heinlein's works, including the Second American Revolution and the theft of a starship by political refugees.The title says Coyote is a novel of interstellar exploration, but it is really a story of a great trek across 46 light years to settle a planet -- OK, a satellite -- in another solar system. Much of the novel concerns the trials and tribulations of two adolescents: Wendy and Carlos. In this sense, Coyote is a coming of age story much like Heinlein's juveniles.The story starts with the theft of the United Republic Service Ship Alabama by some of its crew and a group of \\"dissident intellectuals\\" fired from the Federation Space Agency. Since the ship can cruise at only .2c -- 2/10ths of light speed -- the trip will take 230 years earth time.After the escape, one crew member -- Comtech Leslie Gillis -- is awakened from biostasis and is not allowed by the ship's AI to return to this preserving state. Gillis spends the next 32 years as the only awakened person on the Alabama. Sometimes sane and other times mad, Gillis leaves behind some mural paintings, an epic novel and a mysterious note.Upon reaching Coyote, the crew and passengers are awakened from biostasis, encounter the mural and novel (and note), and are much puzzled.Coyote is habitable, of course, yet greatly different from Earth. The colonist find much strangeness and danger, but are able to adapt.While the science and technology is very much 21st century, the strongest aspect of this novel is character development. Even his villains are believable. Steele deals realistically with teenage sex and pregnancy among his characters, something that Heinlein was not allowed to do until very late in his career.The novel ends with a number of loose strings, so I hope that a sequel is forthcoming.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I'm a sucker for stories about the colonization of new worlds, so Coyote was right up my alley. Making the arduous journey, exploring the planet, surviving against the odds - it's familiar territory, but it's still good stuff. Steele is a competent writer, with smooth prose and an ear for dialogue. He has some interesting ideas, as well. All in all, it made for an enjoyable read.But not an altogether satisfying one. Steele sets the stage nicely, but he doesn't take his ideas far enough. Both the world and the story seem... undercooked. We are constantly reminded that \\"Coyote is not Earth,\\" but the differences are basically superficial: the trees and birds look different, the seasons are longer, and so on. There is only one dangerous native species, and after one encounter, they learn how to keep it at bay. With a blank canvas to play with, Steele paints Coyote as too safe and familiar; it's as if the settlers landed in Australia rather than an alien planet. I expected more.The same incompleteness applies to the colonists and their story. The group has their inevitable conflicts and setbacks, but those too are relatively tame. The social dividing lines are clear, but the expected power struggle fizzles out harmlessly. You never genuinely fear for the well-being of the colony.Bottom line, I enjoyed Coyote enough to order the sequel. However, I can't help feeling that if Steele had just taken it a bit farther, made the world more exotic, developed the characters, heightened the tension, that this could have been a great story rather than a decent one."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"#1 Harriet, of course, has beaten everyone to summarize the book, but I think some other criticisms here aren't fair.I really don't understand the reaction of the previous reviewer to Allen Steele's politics. Yes, a lot of Allen Steele makes me believe he's a pro-union, 1950s, Harry Truman-style Democrat. I doubt Steele and I would agree on much, but his politics are open and clear. He makes a dig at Newt Gingrich and Jesse Helms. So what -- are we Republicans that thin-skinned? I'm not.Secondly, the idea that this is just \\"Legacy of Heorot\\" is silly. Legacy... a brilliant book... was a story about a bad alien with stranging mating habits (something Niven himself mentions in the acknowledgments to Legacy. Coyote is a story about -people- colonizing a new world. If there are similiarities from that, it's only because Steele, like the authors of \\"Legacy\\" did his homework.I would have loved a tad more of Steele's excellent visual descriptions --- the gas giant around which Coyote orbits is mentioned a handful of times, but I never grew tired of the descriptions.Are his politics distracting to the story? Not at all. Is the story worth reading? Darn tooting! Does this story ring true, does it hang together, is it entertaining? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Why would a science-fiction writer make a point of describing his habitable moon as lacking an axial tilt--though still having seasons because its planet's orbit is extremely elliptical--yet repeatedly mention things like the Winter's Solstice and Autumn's noticeably shortening days? Or why would a science-fiction writer go to the trouble of describing an interstellar propulsion mechanism and relativistic effects of high acceleration yet describe a constant velocity of .2C for much of the journey and a fall that either wouldn't have happened or that a near comatose octogenarian could have recovered from before it was too late?The other innumerable science errors that have been mentioned--such as the lack of enormous tides, vastly underestimating the number of stars in the Galaxy, an absurd ecosystem, and the like--are merely errors of ignorance, some more inexcusable than others.But these two errors, and not a few others, go beyond ignorance into the sort of egregious stupidity that results from ignorance expanded by ambition. Steele's world-building is riddled with this sort of thing. His grasp of history and political science is insufficient for his implicit social commentary; his astronomy, physics, geology, and ecology utterly inadequate for his imagined setting; his understanding of human nature insufficient for describing a single conversation, much less entire lives and loves and betrayals.The content of this book, having appeared previously as short stories in science-fiction magazines, somehow has managed to survive scrutiny by not one editor and publisher, but several of each. More's the pity."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"While the book has many interesting and redeeming factors; there were also enough annoying mistakes to render the good factors neutral.On the good side, the intersteller travel technology was well done, as well as the political intrigue. Character development was also top notch.However, the book flops on at least three points - 1) The map of the world... while this could have been a great point, it falls flat on its face - how could there be so many rivers bisecting/trisecting entire continents? - ludicrous, really, as almost all of the many continents have this idiotic impossible feature, including the main river that the explorers venture out on. 2) The author evidently never heard of tacking a boat into the wind - unbelievable and annoying misunderstanding of a simple basic technological premise of exploration by sea... he has the explorers needing to cross the equator multiple times just to catch winds in a given direction. 3) Odd typographical and grammatical errors appear out of nowhere - did the author and editor's grammer checker go on the blink on random paragraphs?Yet, despite these huge flaws, the book has so many good points, it makes the book worth reading... indeed it is a fairly fun and quick read, if you just ignore the mistakes. In fact, I'm moving on to the second book, and hope there aren't more annoying huge mistakes that I'll be forced to overlook."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"With the advent of one-party rule comes certain destruction. But with the fall of that party comes something even worse. And sometimes, what you intend to change for the better sometimes changes into something much, much worse.In 2070, America is three nations -- The United Republic, New England, and Pacifica. The Liberty Party runs the Republic, but some citizens are unhappy. And there just happens to be a huge starship awaiting hijacking.The best parts of this book are the glimpses into the government (in the first part), the building of the world (in the next part), and what happened on Earth afterward (the third part). The only thing I'm not happy about is that Steele never printed the charter from the new planet.You've got intrigue. You've got sci-fi action. You've got conspiracies. You've got one-hundred-odd humans on a planet 230 years away from earth. You've got a whole new calendar system. You've got teenagers rebelling. You've got really interesting aliens.What more do you need?

The basic idea is sending a small band of settlers to another world and starting a colony on a new planet far, far away. A pretty basic plot sci-fi plot to be sure and I looked forward to the action scenes and new creatures.What this book did was stop all of that sci-fi stuff the second the settlers touched down onto the planet. They started planting crops by hand with rakes and hoes, skinning local animals for new clothing and building canoes to explore their new world. To put it another way, their level of technology all of sudden went back to the 18th century.This is essentially a historical fiction that takes place on another world. The author makes no effort to address any of this and instead focuses on a bunch of characters that are very illogical and pretty whiny.If you are looking for a sci-fi book with cool toys and action scenes, stay away. Personally, I'd reclassify this as a western."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"Unlike other reviewers who rated this book one star I am not much of a scientist. In fact, most of the science in science fiction goes right over my head. Don't avoid this book because it's bad science...avoid it because it's bad.The plot lumbers all over the place, dropping hints of plot developments that never transpire: like the fungus they were worried about when they woke up from biostasis. I thought that was going to be a problem...nope...never mentioned again. The 30 % drop in food supplies? Apparently not an issue after all.Also, I just gotta ask...subsistence farming...and the ability to do DNA testing? I think I'd have the left the equipment for DNA testing behind and brought a rototiller (maybe that's just me though).They never lock the doors because there is no theft. Huh? Didn't I just slog through a couple a hundred pages dealing with a bunch of stupid teenagers stealing everything in sight? And when Carlos finally comes back the writer states that most of the stolen items were quietly returned - didn't half that stuff end up on the bottom of the river?I could go on and on about instances where the author didn't even bother to check his own writing to make sure what he said made sense but you get the picture.I'll end with a silly thing that probably shouldn't have bugged me but did. The overuse of the word \\"yet\\". After a while I couldn't even concentrate on what I was reading anymore, I was so busy bracing for the next \\"yet\\". It drove me crazy. I read Coyote on my kindle so I had my kindle count how many times \\"yet\\" was used in the book: 338 times. The Pillars of the Earth, a book twice as long as Coyote, used the word \\"yet\\" 147 times. Other books, comparable in size to Coyote, used it between 40 and 50 times. And yet, Steele felt the need to use \\"yet\\" 338 times, yet one more instance of sloppy lazy writing, yet one that bothered me perhaps more than it should have.Bad writing. Bad Book."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I love books about space exploration and colonization, but this book didnt do it for me. First of all, it's a collection of short stories stitched together - which could have worked, but didn't. The author switches tenses in the narration which I find very disturbing.The first part of the book takes place on Earth, adds nothing to the story, and is terribly boring.The rest of the book focus on teenagers rebelling and taking off into the bush - not what I wanted to read about.Another reader says (and i agree) \\"If you are looking for a sci-fi book with cool toys and action scenes, stay away. Personally, I'd reclassify this as a western.\\"Allan Steele can write well, but this story was a real yawner."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"It appears the author wrote several short stories and just threw them together as a novel. The main story is based on a group stealing a star ship from a totalitarian regime - interesting premise with loads of potential. Instead, the first third of the book was so boring that I wouldn't have gotten through it if I hadn't bought the whole series when I bought this first book. The main character switches back and forth, initially it is the captain, then a passenger who awakens during cyro and spends 30 years awake by himself, then a group of teenagers, with a few rabbit trails led by others along the way.It just isn't a coherent book. For instance, the passenger who awakes during the cyro sleep spends his 30 years writing a novel. I thought, ok, he's going to be a prophetic type figure who gives them some warning about what their life will be like on Coyote. Other than naming one of the native species, that whole section of the book had no bearing on the rest of the book.Likewise, when one of the teens takes off on his own (considering adults weren't safe travelling in groups, the odds of a teen surviving on his own seems remote) he runs across a sentient life form. I thought that the author was going to get into some kind of interspecies relations, but outside of stealing a few pieces of equipment the natives had no further involvement in the story.The book ends with a major, unresolved conflict, obviously setting you up to buy the next book. I've gotten through about a quarter of the next book and it doesn't deal with the conflict, it is based on new colonists to Coyote and a cult leader.There is some potential to the book, but very little is followed up on. The first section deals with stealing the star ship and really doesn't come back into play until the end of the book. The second section deals with the passenger awakened early from cyro, but has almost no bearing on the rest of the book. The third section deals with establishing the colony on Coyote. I liked this section the best, but it seemed sketchy with only 4 species of plants and a half dozen critters. The last section dealt with teenage angst.The book just didn't seem to know where it wanted to go. Did it want to be a struggle against an evil government. Did it want to be a story about a precognitive individual. Did it want to be about the hardships of establishing a colony on a foreign world. Did it want to be a story about the trials of being a teenager. The only reason I could see for the various incomplete directions this book took were if the author planned to use them in future books."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The plot of the story is well covered by other reviewers, so i wont go into that.The novel is made up of previously published short stories by Steele, which accounts for it's lack of flow from one part of the story to another. While the majority of the stories are loosely tied around a few people, the captain of the ship Robert E. Lee, and two young colonists, Wendy and Carlos, the best of the shorts deals with a crewman who was mistakently awakened from stasis hundreds of years to early, and how he deals with being the only human awake.The ending was rather disappointing to me. I wont give anything away, but I expected more from the setup of the book.Despite the ending, and despite how the book didnt flow well, i'd still be inclined to reccommend the novel. The individual stories were for the most part very interesting and well written, and it was hard to put the book down. The story dealing with the awakened crewman was worth the book all by itself.

I hope there is a sequel."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"While the author has a engaging writting style, I was disappointed with the story. The book is not really a novel, but more of a collection of shorts around a central theme.The science in this \\"sci-fi\\" is uninspired and is secondary to the plot.The lack of common sense that would be included in the planning and execution of a space colonization voyage is appalling. The idea that an alien world, only observed by infrared spectrography would be no more hostile than the New England coast is laughable.The best alien creature the author could come up with are terror birds (he calls them Boids).The book is more an attempt to push the authors Progressive/Socialist politics than literature. And even that is amiteurish with him trying to equate libertarianism with one party fascism (its not, look it up)."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I agree with what most are saying here. The writing is not especially good and the story is a little jumbled in that it really is 4-5 different stories combined into a book with a lack of binding themes. I was particularly bored and frustrated when the book started telling the story of someone who woke up in biostasis and spent his life in interstellar space. It was an interesting idea (that I have thought of before), but it really dragged considering it didn't have a particular part in the overall story. Writing-wise, it seems the author had a bad habit of interrupting people's narrative mid sentence. He is the creating author of the book, why not let people finish their sentences every now and then? It seemed like he interrupted his characters speech at least once every couple of pages. It got old when you were trying to...\\" suddenly, out of nowhere a bear slashed at his chest... Annoying isn't it?All that being said though, it was still a mostly enjoyable read for me. I read it in two days, which is rare for me. I liked the premise and the setting. It is especially good for people who like interstellar sci-fi, but try to stay clear of stories that are too futuristic or \\"unrealistic\\". This story seemed very feasible and thus its strength.

After a long journey in suspended animation, they reach their new home only to discover that the real challenges have just begun. Written as a series of discrete stories, there's limited continuity among the characters, and some serious slow spots, but the whole does tell a pretty compelling story, including a nice coming-of-age piece involving three teenagers. There are times when Steele seems rather heavy-handed politically, very reminiscent of Robert Heinlein in his heyday, but if he's trying to make a point, he never pushes it. Actually, none of the conflicts in this novel ever really amount to very much, which might lead one to expect that the power of this book lies in the fantastic wonders of the new planet, but in fact there's not a ton of imagination on display here, either. Nonetheless, this reviewer found this an entertaining read, mainly due to the grand sweep of the storyline, and the everyday believability of its execution. The ending is actually rather a let-down, in keeping with the whole \\"less is more\\" philosophy of the plot, but clearly Steele already had his eye on the sequel. Not a masterpiece, and not overly scientific, but still an enjoyable piece of storytelling, with a sci-fi context."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"OK, sending a multi-billion dollar mission (that can be hijacked with the push of a button) to a planet that nobody really knows anything about may or may not be entirely plausible, but it made for a great story. In fact, so strong a story that it carries two additional sequels. Mr. Steele succeeds not only on the strength of fine writing but also because the themes of his story are so familiar. It is simply a retelling of the discovery of a new world--condensed, to be sure, but the parallels to the American Revolution are plain enough.Coyote succeeds because it taps into the power of the frontier to fire the imagination. The West has been won in our world but it is interesting to think of what will happen when a new frontier is identified and the inevitable battle for control takes place. As for Mr. Steele's politics: The ultra-conservative takeover of the US was balanced by the portrayal of the triumph of liberalism, i.e. Social Collectivism. Give an author a break--there had to be something to upset the apple cart.Some things are worth fighting for. Far too many of us take our freedoms for granted and I think that this story was made stronger by its evocation of what could happen. Such a scenario is precisely why fiction is important and why in a world where a new discovery is a rare event, science fiction becomes much more relevant."},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"I have to confess, this one takes me back to my younger days, when as an adolescent, I would search for a good sci-fi adventure story. Coyote is such a book. I would have loved it as a young teen, I enjoy it immensely now. Sure some of the science is suspect; hence the 4-star rather than 5-star rating. But, hey, it's a great adventure story!In the not too distant future, a tyrannical government in what used to be part of the U.S. builds a ship designed to travel 40-odd light years to a solar system with a habitable moon orbiting a Saturn-like planet.At the last minute, a plot by freedom-loving rebels comes to fruition, and the ship is taken and heads for it's destination. The system's planets and satellites are named according to native-American mythology. The moon Coyote is the site of the colony. There are forests, extensive waterways(no real oceans, altho a world girdling equatorial river reaches the size of a small sea), and native wildlife. The major characters in the book, of all ages, have to come to grips with making a home in their new world.All told, this tale, in a distant setting rather like an alien version of Canada, will entertain readers from jr. high onward. A rollicking good time, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Coyote: A Novel of Interstellar Exploration","review":"The previous reviewers have covered well the scientific shortcomings of the novel, some obvious and other less so. (I did not think of the tidal problems till I read their reviews!) But, interesting science fiction does not always have to be scientifically accurate on every detail. We all lived with Captain Kirk not floating around the decks of the Enterprise despite no mention of artificial gravity. I don't think the novel sets out to be \\"Red Mars,\\" i.e. a highly detailed technical dissertation. It uses just enough snappy scientific ideas to move the story along.The main drawback for me was first the repetition, which comes from cobbling together the book from previously published materials. One expected a narrator to pop up every chapter and say, \\"When we last left our intrepid explorers...\\" The re-referencing of already established facts distracted from the pace of the story. I blame the editors on this one, as a few sentences cut here, and a few altered there, would have removed these annoying phrases.The second thing that seemed odd was that the characters often reacted like someone stepping off of the pages of a 1950's teen novel. Women swoon and men gnash their teeth when fate reveals that an unwed pregnant girl is in their midst. Horrors! Mary Jo will never find a prom date! Not to belittle the problems of teen pregnancy, but as being the key crisis point for a scifi novel (that includes inter-steller kidnapping, murder,etc ) it'a bit anachronistic even now, let alone for characters supposedly living decades hence.Final beef. Space exploration in this novel is still to be a largely Anglo-American enterprise, with most participants leaning towards the more pallid complected races. As China forges ahead with their plans to get to Mars, can any writer seriously think that Europeans and Americans will be the only space travelers 100 years from now?All that being said, the novel kept me turning the pages, the story did not drag, I learned a few new things about planets and space travel, and that means it can't be all that bad.

But ever since Paris there's been a mysterious woman following Mandie and her friends, and she's determined to find out who she is. But things take a turn for the dangerous when a valuable ruby is stolen, and Mandie and her friends get lost in the catacombs.Can things get worse? Apparently they can, but Mandie will not give up, no matter what the circumstance.This is one of the better books of the Mandie series. The part when Mandie, Celia, and Jonathan get lost in the catacombs is really neat, and also the part when Mandie and Celia scream their head's off because someone is in their room.Altogether it makes for a very interesting read, and it is an excellent edition to your Mandie collection."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Silent Catacombs (Mandie, Book 16)","review":"This is one of my favorite ones, but its very creepy because while Mandie and Celia and Jonathan step aside to read some words written into the wall, someone blows out the candle in front of their faces! They find that all the candles in the catacombs have been blown out. They get lost. Then when someone comes in their room at night and whispers, \\"Where is it?\\" it is sooooo scary! I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Mandie and the Silent Catacombs (Mandie, Book 16)","review":"This book was a request from my 10 year old daughter. She enjoys reading the Mandie series and this book was missing from the library. Great book for girls aged 8-12. It is best that book one, Mandie and the Secret Tunnel, in the series is read first. Also read these books before hand to understand the characters: Mandie and the Forbiden Attic, Mandie and the Midnight Journey, and Mandie and the Shipboard Mystery."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Silent Catacombs (Mandie, Book 16)","review":"This book was probally one of my favorite Mandie books ever!!!!!!!!! I have all of the Mandie books and I have read all of them at least 20 times!!!! I started to read them when I was 5 and I am 12 now and I still love them! I like this book because it has a lot of adventure and is very suspenseful. I think that Grandmother Taft should pay more attention to Mandie, Celia, and Jonathon because they are always getting into dangerous things, and Mandie never listens to anything anybody says. I loved learning about all the things in Rome!!!!! This book is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I especialy liked the part when they got lost in the catacombs."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Silent Catacombs (Mandie, Book 16)","review":"This was a very good book, but not as good as some. This is one you have to have time to read. It's hard to just set it down and pick it up two days later and understand everything. I can't say anything bad about a Mandie Book. It's impossible! This book takes place in Mandie's travels through Europe in 1901. Mandie takes a trip to the Catacombs with Celia and Jonathan. That one trip is the basis for most of the adventure. I just couldn't get into the story until the very end, when the mystery was solved. This is a good book to read when you have a lot of time, like on a rainy day or a long car trip. It was still a very good book. I still think you should read it, and read the books in order to understand them best."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Silent Catacombs (Mandie, Book 16)","review":"This is an extranganza of a book!

The reader and the listener are both captured into the realm of the tales that they design to fascinate and ultimately teach about the human spirit. They give children a foundation on which to base their attitudes. They give the adults a platform, on which, to reevaluate and reconsider the examples they may be setting to their young.

Not only do I think that such a book is important but Hague also happens to be one of my favorite illustrators. So on breaks at work I would read it. It is not all that I had hoped it would be, but it is good.However, Bennett's bias politically drives me nuts which has mademe biased against purchasing this book. Added to that, hisdecision to not only preach against sin but to name the names ofthe sinners (in another venue) makes him something less than aneffective moralist and something more like just another loud-mouthed commentator on tv. And then to put the nail in the coffin, there is the recent revelation of his own particular downfall (gambling). Talk about people who live in glass houses!!None of my own biases against this man has to do with the intrinsic value or lack thereof of the book. But, I have decided that I would find someone more personally worthy of informing me and my grandchild about virtues."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"We're on our second read through of this book of children's morality tales.With poems, short homilies and stories, Bill Bennett entertains young children as life's good lessons are imparted. The accompanying illustrations are visually delightful.Some of the stories, because of word usage, appeal to a slightly older audience than my four and five year olds, but they can appreciate most of the vignettes. A good book that helps parents in childhood instruction."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"My name is David. I am eight years old. I am reading The Children's Book of Virtues, edited by William J. Bennett. My favorite story so far is &quot;The Honest Woodman.&quot; It is about a poor woodcutter who looses his old axe in a river. A water fairy brought up a silver axe and a gold axe. The woodcutter said that they were not his. When she brought up his steel axe, he said it was his. The water fairy gave him all the axes for telling the truth. Telling the truth is very important."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"This is an excellent book to read to your young ones (4+) The stories are old yet the principles are ageless. The children will curl up and live these tales. I find myself truely enjoying this special time. When they get to six or seven I would strongly recommend moving to the Book of Virtues by William J. Bennett. The stories will sweep you and the children away. MY childrens favorite time is reading these stories. They actually ask for the book and seldom does anything else draw such smiles and &quot;Thank You Daddys&quot;. Enjoy the experience."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"I had this book when I was a little kid. I honestly think that by reading it, it changed how I viewed things as a child. Partially because of this book, when I was little I had strong feelings about responsiblity, kindness, courage, perserverance, and many of the other subjects illustrated in The Children's Book of Virtues. I loved reading it and the stories affected me greatly."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"As a homeschool mother I am always looking for great stories for my almost 7 yo and my 2.5 yo. This book is part of the curriculum for Sonlight and it is fabulous. My daughter's favorite is about two brothers, one who doesn't let his \\"please\\" out of his mouth so the \\"please\\" jumps into the other brothers' mouth (which makes him say all his \\"pleases\\" twice). Eventually though, the \\"please-less\\" mouth wants his please back and his \\"please\\" is thrilled to be at home and allowed to get some fresh air. The stories are grouped by moral or attribute (compassion, courage, etc.). Both male and female main characters throughout the stories and the poems makes this book appropriate for both boys and girls. I highly, highly recommend this book, no qualms about it."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"My daughter (6 yo) loves this book, and I do too. The stories are entertaining and engaging, and the illustrations are wonderful.The book hearkens back to good old-fashioned values and morals, and is completely unashamed in doing so. Mr. Bennett writes in the foreword that the process of intentionally instructing the young in virtues was done without embarrassment in our recent past. I enjoyed the frankness of the approach in this book. Each selection is headed by a summary of the lesson contained in it.This collection includes poems, fables from Aesop, adaptations of fairy tales, and other stories from cultures around the world in order to illustrate certain virtues, such as responsibility, kindness, honesty, and good manners. The selections are of a good length to sustain the interest of a young(4 - 8 yo) child. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to inculcate good values."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"These tales were collected from virtually every corner of the globe and some go far back into the reaches of antiquity. Bennett and his collaborators did a fine job of finding stories of universal, fairly non-controversial appeal that we can all cite without worrying about the inherent differences in religion or politics that might otherwise divide us. Segregated according to the principles being celebrated (Honesty, Courage, etc.) these fables and true life stories demonstrate virtues of conduct far too often left unstressed in our morally-undermined society."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"I have been looking for a great collection of stories that convey important values for quite some time. I had not been able to find anything good enough (or easy enough) for my 5 year old son to find interesting...until now.The Children's Book of Virtues is a compilation of short stories and poems, many of which I remember from my youth. The book is well organized, with stories/poems grouped by the virtue they represent (courage, perserverence, etc.). So if I want my son to think about a particular virtue, maybe due to what happened that day, I can easily find an appropriate story in this book.The illustrations are also so well done. They are colorful and expressive, catching my son's attention as I read to him.Thank you for this book. I hope additional volumes may be developed."},{"Title":"The Children'S Book Of Virtues Audio Treasury Cd","review":"If you are looking for a book that will instill &quot;values&quot; in your child while s/he reads, this is just the ticket--my only hesitation is that some of the values being instilled are somewhat out-of-date, so read the book carefully. Edited by William J. Bennett (yes, that William J. Bennett--I know, I was surprised too!), the book is divided into sections, e.g., &quot;Courage/Perseverance,&quot; &quot;Responsibility/Work/Self-Discipline,&quot; and so on. Each section contains several tales that illustrate its titular virtues. Now the problem is this: under the section &quot;Responsibility...,&quot; he uses the poem &quot;There Was a Little Girl&quot;-you know, the one with the curl. The little girl raises a huge ruckus in her bedroom which her mother assumes is being made by her brothers &quot;A-playing at combat in the attic&quot;; but discovering that the miscreant was her daughter, &quot;she did scold her most emphatic.&quot; Bennett writes a brief note at the beginning of each entry, and the entry he wrote for this one is: &quot;In this poem, we see what happens to us sometimes when we do not behave!&quot; Come on, for Pete's sake! The real lesson in this poem is that little girls must remain quiet, acquiescent and obedient while little boys can tear up the attic all they want, because that's what little boys do! Sorry Bill, but I don't buy it, and I don't think many parents will either. But there is much in this book to recommend it, particularly the 19th century retro illustrations which Michael Hague has contributed. And it really is an excellent compendium of favorite anecdotes, poems and tales, sort of a Norton's Anthology for the nursery set.

My only hesitation about it for parents who wanted to use it to teach their children virtues was that -- because it collected stories written in an earlier era when attentions spans were longer and vocabularies better developed -- was that some of the language required being explained.

Each story teaches a moral lesson. Children will turn a deaf ear to lectures from parents about poor choices. However, this book does a beautiful job of teaching time honored values and morals in a story format that children find very appealing. Instead of preaching and lecturing, this book tells many wonderful stories of how other children have chosen to do the right thing, even if it was not an easy thing to do. The stories in this book give parents and caregivers wonderful opportunities to talk about right and wrong, good and bad, and having empathy for others.

There is a nice selection in each category of 1 paged poems, to several paged stories. There is a solid virtue to be taken from every single work.I recommend this book highly.

Both he and our 3 year old son love to \\"read\\" books; they insist on going to bed with them every night and they often stay up later than they're allowed to, flipping through the pages. Unfortunately there aren't many stories in this book that hold their attention, and the ones that do seem to be over too quickly. My personal opinion is that this book is probably more suited for girls of 4+, and boys of 5+.The book is a very nice quality and the illustrations (every page) are marvelous. The stories are grouped by virtue, but each one is independent of the next, so there are many different ways to navigate this book.

Problem is, we have a 2-year old, and the longer stories she is not quite ready for yet. This book is a collection of many stories and poems, short and long, and as there are illustrations, she is content to wait until we finish reading a page before turning. Add to that, the stories have good examples, ethics, and morals within them that are explained clearly, and we see very little negative in this book. The rhymes within she has memorized the majority, and often quotes this or that part of a story. \\"The Little Hero of Holland\\" is currently favorite.)

This book covers alot more than health care. For instance, under caring for an older dog, the tips are practical, simple, and have nothing to do with medicine or illness. Simple things like buying the dog a softer bed. Life style changes that may not cure, as somethings cannot be, but can make your dogalot happier.Dog care books are usually either written by a vet, who takes the linear Western medicine approach, or a holistic practianer who never sees the need to darken a doctor's office. This book is written in a partnership between a vet and a holistic person and the book shows the wisdom of both and suggests when and how to use either one or both of the approaches. Good common sense abounds. And always practical information. In a section on diabetes the authors list the dog breeds most likely to be susceptible. If you have one of these breeds it may make recognizing the signs easier. They do this for most of the diseases they discuss.And they discuss alot more. Prevention, diet, homeopathy, herbs, TCM. bodywork, alternative therapies and conventional medicine, and more. It's a fat book packed with info.If you have a dog, you need this book....though in truth I think alot of what they say can be applied to any animal, including the human."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"I have a variety of books on health for dogs, which I reference often. I noticed lately, however, that I've gone to this book first over and over and often I don't need to look at any of my other books. I usually cross reference material, but I've found valididated information from several other sources in this book so often that I save myself the trouble and just reference this book now.Rarely do I find a \\"the only book you'll need\\" in any book, but this one definitely has it all, and the information is not extreme. The authors recognize balance, recognize that there are a variety of methods to attack a problem, and they present each method thoroughly and non-judgmentally.For example, if a dog is vomiting and has nausea, they first differentiate between acute and chronic. If acute, they first give information on nutritional support, then homeopathy, then herbs, then accupressure and finally other methods including flower essences and considering addressing the dog's emotional state. If chronic, they are just as thorough but give other paths to follow in trying to treat the dog's vomiting.In addition to concrete suggestions for treating many health problems, very clear and professionally drawn illustrations abound throughout the book. In the section for vomiting, one drawing shows the dog's digestive tract and another the accupressure points for the digestive tract. When referring to the illustration in the text, the authors also reference corresponding charts and additional illustrations in another part of the book (and give page numbers!) that will further explain information regarding that particular illustration, such as finding the exact meridian point on the dog.The treatments the authors focus on in the book include diet, homeopathy, herbs, accupressure, acupuncture, TCM, bodywork, and energy medicine. The authors touch on a few other areas of therapy but they focus primarily on the topics just mentioned.I found the illustrations to be extremely valuable. They are peppered throughout the book showing parts of the dog that are relevant to the corresponding text. The illustrations aren't too detailed; they have just enough to explain. They're clear, concise, and easy to understand.Overall, this is the best comprehensive book on holistic dog care on my shelf. I'm gradually getting rid of the others because they don't compare at all to the accurately named, \\"The Complete Holistic Dog Book.\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"I sat down with this book intending to go through it in a \\"first time kind of glance through\\" way and ended up reading it for four hours - non stop.I started with the homeopathy section which had an excellent discussion on how the remedies are made and used. I am a novice in this area of medicine but found the explanations clear, concise, and informative.I then turned to the puppy section - and found a wealth of valuable information on the importance of puppy socialization - how exposing my puppy to lots of different people, dogs and places, (after their vaccination series is complete, of course!), helps him learn manners, gives him confidence, and allows me the luxury and joy of taking him with me to many places without having to worry about his behavior. The book also discusses how to select a good and compassionate trainer.There is a section on \\"Letting Go\\" - always a difficult and painful part of sharing one's life with an animal. I found the author's advice personal and heartfelt.The chapters on new vaccination protocols and nutrition are informative and complete. Although the two authors recommend a homemade diet, they also tell the reader how to select a high quality commercial diet, as well.I appreciate the author's balanced view and the fact that they explain the \\"why\\" of things - something which is often lacking in many books. Excellent.The book is loaded with helpful tables and graphs and personal stories. In addition, there are great photos of \\"Found Dogs\\" sprinkled throughout the book.It is obvious these two authors love their topic and want to improve the lives of puppies, dogs, and their people. I will recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"Dr Katy Sommers is my vet, yet when my Irish Wolfhound pup, Jessica, had problems with her diet, I took Katy's home-cooked-diet advice with a smile and continued to buy the top kibble. I was intimidated by the responsibility of balancing a diet for a giant breed!As she grew, Jessie failed to thrive on kibble. By the time she was 10 months old, she was a walking skeleton and I added more &quot;home cooked&quot; to her diet with some success.Then she had a medical crisis brought on by my feeding her fat trying to get her to gain weight. Dr Katy and I sat on the floor of her clinic late into the night, giving her morphine to help with the pain, and I had to make the decision to put her down or see her through her problems. When she recovered, I was convinced that I needed to switch over completely to a home-cooked diet.Luckily, Katy's book came out the same week! Great timing, Katy!I have several highly recommended books on Natural Health Care for dogs, but Jan &amp; Katy's is the easiest for me to apply. It provides easy-to-follow instructions on food selection, preparation and balance. Using her guidelines I'm able to easily fix Jessie's meals as I fix my own - my diet's improving too!I was also pleased to find thorough sections describing major illnesses, health problems and injuries, and appreciate Jan &amp; Katy's common sense approach to herbs and alternative medicine.Results? You Bet! I bought the book at the end of September; Jessie was 11 months old, 30&quot; tall at the shoulder and weighed 74 pounds. A month later, Jessie has gained +25 pounds and is a strong vigorous dog. The change is phenomenal, and has convinced me that THIS is the way dog should eat!Jessie agrees! Thanks Dr Katy, for being there for the Jessie's of the world!Linda Cowles"},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"After getting another book, I found I wanted to ensure diversity in my book collection of reference materials. Saw this book, flipped through it in the book store and decided to get it. That simple. It has great information in it and bullets out just what I want to know. I also have the Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats : Your A-Z Guide to Over 200 Conditions, Herbs, Vitamins, and Supplements by Shawn Messonnier. Both of these books complement each other and provide what I need to know for taking care of my animals. Often, the herbs recommended correlate to the ones I'm taking (or that people take). I certainly don't mind sharing with my best friend and loyal companion.My quest initially started because my 7 YO schnoodle suddenly experienced a slipped disk and couldn't walk (essentially hind leg paralysis, both hind legs). I was completely distraught at the prospect of surgery on the little guy. After learning a local chiropractor (ours as it turns out) would take a look at him, I took him in. I consider it CAM - complementary alternative medicine. I kept him on steroids, and pain management, and the chiro adjusted him. By the next morning he was able to walk out of his cage (where the meds had clearly made him sick all night). I decided then and there that there is no question in my mind that there is something to be said for alternative therapies. No one can convince me otherwise. This dog dragged himself around for two days, and the vets told me they saw no improvement when they had him. I continue with touch therapy and supplements to his diet. But I will never forget this extraordinary and valuable lesson. Our families are valuable treasures and we are entrusted with good stewardship of our K9 companions. This book helps make that job a bit easier."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"Fabulous book!! It is packed with information, but easy to understand and apply. I found the book to be very balanced and subjective in it's approach and advice. For example, it fairly presents the pros/cons of different diet approaches, without specifically recommending a \\"one size fits all\\" solution. All chapters of the book are valuable, but the section on diet and nutrition is particularly outstanding! Since reading the book, I have adopted a diet of home-cooked meals for my german-shepherd-mutt that is virtually 100% vegetarian! Seeing the way she responded to the new diet has converted many of my friends into believers who were total skeptics of a vegetarian diet. Although my dog was always healthy and happy, the changes are unbelievable in terms of her temperament, appearance and personality.Regardless of whether you're looking to change your dog's diet (as I did), this is a valuable book and must-have for every serious dog owner!"},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"Recently I have been interested in learning more about the holistic approach to veterinary medicine. I purchased this book but I am very disappointed with it. I find its descriptions very vague and not informative at all. It lists many different herbs and homeopathic medicines to give for different ailments, but it doesn't say why they work or if there are any side effects to them. I am sure it would be great for someone who already has an understanding of holistic medicine, but I don't. Also some of the viewpoints in the book I feel are wrong. Such as recommending making your dog a vegetarian and that dogs are not really carnivores. In fact I would say the whole chapter on diet is not very good information. Even some of the essential fatty acid sources they recommended (most of the vegetable oils) are not good for dogs. They are too high in omega 9 and actually cancel out the good omega 3 and 6's. It kind of makes me not trust any of the information in the book. And I feel diet is the most important part of a dog's health. I bought this book because it had such wonderful reviews. I wish this book had a look inside option. I don't think I will buy a book solely based on reviews again. Unless you already have a very good knowledge of homeopathy or just want to be told what to do with no explanation then I would not recommend this book. It was a waste of money for me."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"I found this book extremely balanced in terms of providing feeding information if you are interested in providing fresh food for your dog's diet. Its good to realize that it can be done without a tremendous amount of extra time and effort. In fact, my husband and I realized that WE don't eat well enough to just cook a little extra for our dog, as suggested. We were inspired to improve our own diet to include the variety proposed for our dog!After losing our 9 1/2 year old Boxer to cancer, we wanted to take the cancer prevention nutrition suggested by the veterinary oncologist we worked with and combine that with a good whole foods diet for our new Boxer puppy. This book, since it is co-authored by a veterinarian, seemed to give the best all around advice for those wanting to move their pet's care in a holistic direction, but who also feel more comfortable knowing there is good research and science supporting the advice given. We looked at a lot of books on the subject and truly liked this one."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"Since buying this book it has become my best friend, it has helped me and especially my animal friends time and time again.

Its not ievitable and this book shows you alterantives that can improve your dog's energy and extend their life. An excellent, practical book filled with everything from how to avoid over vaccination to adopting a vegetarian (or vegan) diet for your dog. Using this book, we successfully transitioned our adopted dog (4 years old) to a plant based diet (for a lot of reasons) and found after about 1 month she had a shinier coat, more energy, and gained up to her normal weight.

It has changed the way I feed my own dogs and they absolutely LOVE their new way of eating. Who knew that the healthy foods that humans eat is exactly what is the healthiest foods for our own dogs.

The style is much like that of a very easy to follow text book...one that even an average 5th grade student should have no struggles with understanding. Everything is well organized and beautifully presented. Even the illustrated sketches are very well drawn out and educational. --absolutely spectacular!If you desire to know more about holistic care for your dog, then this book will be a wonderful start. The Complete Holistic Dog Book is one of those books that will be an easy and entertaining read for both adults and even children (with a good reading level); yet without pulling away the educational and informative resource this book is. It can easily be read from front to back, by going through each chapter as a \\"lesson\\" (or daily/weekly reading goal) or it can be easily used as a guide, for looking up areas of interest.Nothing about this book is intimidating or boring. At the very worst, you'll most likely enjoy this book as a very good reference guide, that you can refer to for different aspects of your dog's care. As with any broad range book, I would not recommend this as the only book you'll ever need on holistic concerns. This is a perfect first book, and it's very easy to read and understand. This outstanding resource will give you enough information, to help decide if you'd like to learn more on a narrowed interest."},{"Title":"The Complete Holistic Dog Book: Home Health Care for Our Canine Companions","review":"I purchased this book based on another review and can say that the book is exceeding my already high expectations.

What they show is Neville Chamberlain and his ministers in close detail, what they thought and why they thought it. This book achieves what it sets out to accomplish: it explains in careful detail the origins and practice of British appeasement in the run-up to World War II.The authors make two primary points, one obvious and one more subtle. The obvious point is that Chamberlain's government (and the Conservative Party more generally) was so eager to avoid another war that it simply ignored the abundant evidence that Nazi Germany was pursuing policies that were abhorrent to any constitutional democracy and that were bound to lead to another major European war. And in their ultimately unsuccessful effort to stave off war in Europe, there was virtually no step that Chamberlain's government would not take to attempt to mollify and curry favor with Nazi Germany.The more subtle point is that, as the decade of the 1930s progressed, and particularly after Munich, the Chamberlain government either removed from government or ignored dissenting voices, and it also began to conduct its diplomacy almost in secret, bypassing the House of Commons and public opinion to the fullest extent feasible. And the more the Chamberlain government and its ministers pursued a go-it-alone, hothouse mentality, the more it became isolated from public opinion. No wonder that Chamberlain was unseated in 1940; the surprise is that it didn't happen sooner.This sad story is all laid out it in great depth, literally on an hour-by-hour basis in the case of some of the major crises, such as Munich, and the Danzig negotiations of 1939. Beyond merely providing a chronology of these events, however, the authors provide the social and political context for the various events as they occurred, plus biographical sketches for some of the major actors within the Chamberlain Government.For any student interested in the origins of World War II, this is, quite simply, an invaluable book."},{"Title":"The Appeasers","review":"This book, out of print, but is important to the study of the period of time between WWI and WWII. The seller sent it wrapped from the UK and it's lovely smoky old smell reveals its history to me. Its an interesting read. But not a casual read."},{"Title":"The Appeasers","review":"Gilbert -- in one of his earliest books -- gives a detailed analysis of how the world appeased the great dictators, the missed opportunities and the willingness to abandon allies in the face of adversity. What is particularly relevant is the extent to which history seems to be repeating itself today with the way in which Europe (and others) handle Iran. The tactics are the same -- on both sides."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who said she couldn't put this book down! I, too, was up until the wee hours of the morning to see how this one ended. As a writer myself, I was completely drawn in to Emma's world and enjoyed the description of her writing routines. When they are disturbed, it makes the situation very personal, for how can anyone know that much about how one person goes about creating a world? I loved this book. Barbara Michaels is one of my favorites, and I've been looking for another supernatural/haunted house/gothic author I can read. Kudos to Ms. Rogan."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I have never heard of Barbara Rogan before, but as I often do, I judged a book by its cover and snagged this one off the shelf.

Jealousy, anger, mistrust; So real and alive in all of us, we can not help but to bond with Rogan's creations.Rogan has mixed together a little horror, a lot of suspense, and quiet a bit of love to make this novel come alive.

Roger locates the perfect home; an old Victorian located on an isolated cliff. Emma, author of ghost stories, realizes the house is the ideal place for a ghost to reside, but is grounded in scientific fact so scoffs at the supernatural.As soon as the family moves into the home, Emma sees and hears strange things that no one else senses. She hears loud crashing noises, smells lavender, feels cold spots, and notices a computer game that fails to follow its programming. At one time clinically depressed and even hospitalized for her condition, Emma wonders if she is losing her mind. However, she rejects that theory and begins to wonder if someone is toying with her emotions even though she cannot understand how that individual could have access to her home. Whether it is from the mortal or supernatural planes, Emma searches for answers even as she places herself in danger.Is this novel a well-designed ghost story or a clever psychological suspense drama? Barbara Rogan keeps the audience guessing until the very end and even then she leaves room for continual doubt. SUSPICION is a wonderful novel that captures and holds the reader's attention throughout the tale. Emma is a great character, whose doubts add to the feel of the story line.

Her husband Roger is one of those people. He secretly finds a house out on Long Island in a small town and drags the reluctant Emma out to see it. She is not too thrilled with the place and does not want to leave her life in the city. One room wins her over though, a room at the top of some hidden stairs which is the perfect writer's room, 360 degree views for inspiration. Her son Zack also loves the place. Much to the disgust of her sister and part of herself she reluctantly agrees to purchase the place and relocate.This house has a secret though. An old schoolteacher lady did some weird stuff here in her final years and the locals avoid the place claiming she haunts it. Caroline a domestic violence support worker also moves in to the small cottage down the driveway that came with the house. Roger does not like her but she quickly becomes Emma's friend.Zack is easily the best of the players in his new soccer team and the coach a womaniser not afraid to be labelled so is very interested in Emma. Meanwhile back at the house strange stuff is occurring when Emma is all alone. Is she going insane? Is the house haunted? Or is someone from her past back for vengeance?This is a pretty good book. I recently read Hindsight, also by Rogan just before this one which is in a whole other league above this, but this is still a good book and a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I really loved this book and was sad to see it end. I am defininely going to buy other books from this writer. The book kept you guessing until the last minute who the culprit was.

Very likable characters helped to shape this story.You won't regret buying this one!!Debi"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"As a lover of old houses, ghost stories, and women protagonists, this book was perfect for me. The possibilites seemed endless and it was interesting to follow Emma's train of thought, the events that led her to believe things that may or may not have been happening. Her suspicions were not all valid, and even tho some things seemed illogical, that's the point. Was it all in her head, was some of it real? Paranoia makes for interesting, sometimes frustrating, occassionaly frightening reading. Wonderful build-up at some points. Rogan's prose is easy, fresh, and hard to put down. I agree with some of the other reviewers--this one will keep you up late into the night!"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This book is both suspenseful and great fun. The plot involves a writer of ghost stories who moves into a house that looks like it came out of one of her books -- and strange things start to happen. Is it a ghost that's trying to drive her out of the home, or does she have an enemy that's alive and among her friends and family -- who else would have access to the house?This is a book to read in one sitting, so start it early enough to finish at a reasonable hour (otherwise you'll be up half the night finishing it). What I liked best was its &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; quality, the fun that can be had by a writer writing a story about a writer who jokes that if this were one of her novels and not real life, her dog's refusal to go up a certain staircase would be a sign of a ghost. The author's joke, of course, is that it is all really a novel -- there is no &quot;real life.&quot;The book was well-plotted, the characters likeable and engaging, and the author had great fun with the conventions of ghost stories."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I read some of the negative reviews here and found myself wondering if they read the same book I did. I could not put the book down. When I finished, I looked up and was surprised to find that it was 2 in the morning. I loved the characters, especially Ida Green and Mrs. Hysop with her purple pencil. I did figure out who the villain was pretty early in the book, but Ms. Rogan kept throwing me off track. I kept thinking, &quot;well, maybe not.&quot; I don't think the ending was predictable at all. The very end leaves you still thinking something might happen. It wasn't wrapped up in a neat little package, which I appreciate. The book I read before this was written by someone who could not write her way out of a paper bag. How nice and refreshing it was to open up Ms. Rogan's book. She is a fabulous storyteller and a tremendous writer."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I started this book as a book for small breaks inbetween - and that surely didn't work. It's grasping and full of suspense. Up to the end I couldn't quite make up my mind as to who might be involved in the whole scenario and who not, and Rogan does a great job at leading the reader not only 'down the wrong path', but down multiple paths where everything is possible and the heroine herself does not know anymore whom to trust and whom not. The main-character's development was nicely done, I thought, as was the build-up of tension.Liked the other characters, too. They're sharply drawn, no two of them alike.And all this with a sparse to-the-point writing style. No fluff. No paragaraph worth skipping (ok, maybe one about physics - but it's really just one). The descriptions are accurate and to the point like snake-bites - reminding you of things you've seen and felt but wouldn't ever have the observance, skill, and guts to name.I wouldn't necessarily pick this book if I was primarily fond of ghost-stories, but if one is interested in a grasping story singing with truth - the type of truth that whispers in tiny little daily details of the human mind - then this book is a real keeper."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"What a great mystery. Although I had an idea who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was early on, the writer had me second guessing as she brought out new characters. The ghost gave a nice twist to the story too.

This was not even a good one--the ghost being thrown in just to add more fluff to the plot line.

There is no real need for some of them and the sub plots they are involved in are not really necessary to the main story. The personalities of the main characters don't really &quot;grab&quot; the reader. There is no feeling of really liking or really disliking them. They just exist. The plot seems weak because the basic reason for the story is flawed. The buildup to the climax is pretty good, but the actual end is a real letdown. Actually, there is no real definitive end to this story. If you like a story that doesn't leave you hanging at the end, don't read this one. I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who liked it, but I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"Anyone judging this book by its cover is going to immediately think it a bit of Norah Roberts' fluff or a ghost story a la the unsurpassable 'The Uninvited'. Unfortunately, this book cannot be categorized as either romantic suspence adventure or campy haunted house horror. At the very most its story revolves around grim happenstance spotlighting a woman obsessed with dire possibilities which she worries to death. Woe to the reader who empathizes with the negative, and swallowed by it, finds herself/himself unable to reach the same intended life-affirming lesson/message at the end of the book along with our too savvy main character.The story should engage, but somehow it does not. After all the moody grief, there is no intellectualized savoring of the taste of strawberries as the author infers in her last paragraph. There is nothing but sour repellent mood, which most readers, expecting at least a powerful ghost story will abandon after the first 100 pages.Emma and her family move out to Long Island and inhabit a large secluded house perched atop a Northshore village flanked by the Long Island Sound. Her husband, Roger, is a smart WASP physicist. Emma is a Jewish writer with socialist tendencies she feels she is betraying by leaving her urban nest of ethnicity. But this is not her only problem---someone is targeting Emma in a dangerous game of malice that tampers her livelihood, her sanity and eventually her life. Because of events that occurred in the past, Roger does not always believe in the validity of Emma's spin on reality. Hence, Emma finds herself isolated at a time in her life where she needs the security of strong friends and family.Sounds potentially interesting, doesn't it? Well, it loses something in the writing. Narrated in the third person present, the format retains a choppy feel where the author uses too many literary analogies which seem forced, a little too light in atmosphere for the otherwise gloomy ambiance conjured up by the prose. Yes, Emma is a writer, but even so, I felt the author's choice of Emma's career a betrayal of sorts, Rogan utilizes her own personal experience rather than research a more appropriate and far less solitary and depressing form of employment for a woman already stretched to the limit and far too alone.In a nutshell, this book isn't any fun. The idea is well crafted without any holes, but Ms. Rogan and her editor need to understand that no one wants to read a book where a heightened sense of disillusion and helplessnes are packaged as a ghost story/romance."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This is the first book I have read by Barbara Rogan. I thought that when I bought this book there would be more excitement and more &quot;ghostliness.&quot; But the book started putting me to sleep, and that's when I knew I had to get rid of it. The book had good characters but lacked the plot it needed to support that fact. If you like slower moving mysteries, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"Basically it passes time. You can definately put the book down because you won't care what happens to characters.. The one thing I don't think any of the other reviewers have complained about is the horrible paragraphs about technical mathematics. If it is not Soccor it's linear equations.. is this fiction or a text?"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"As a bookseller who reads mostly spy thrillers and murder mysteries, this novel was surprisingly interesting. The writing is intelligent without being stuffy, the characters are well-developed. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"There are a lot of things I didn't like about this novels, especially the cliched characters. (Why does the heroine always have to be smashingly beautiful and superintelligent? Why is everyone always rich in this sort of book? Why does the black lady have to represent the entire diaspora? Why the false dichotomy of hard-edged urban superwomen and catty suburban housewives? Why can't their kid just be a kid, not a star athlete and overly bright? Why does the husband have to be Cary Grant *and* Humphrey Bogart?) I also think that B. Rogan overplayed the writer-living-out-the-scenario-of-one-of-her-lousy-books convention; it was interesting, but I kept feeling like it slowed the momentum and that the author overindulged her desire to talk about what it's like to be a writer (although of course it's not fair to assume that Emma is anything like Barbara Rogan.) Didn't like the pointless extended soccer sequences. Didn't like the red herrings - seemed more dishonest than exciting. And it wasn't really scary - I was always interested but I never got goosebumps. Also - I knew the answer to the mystery well before the main character, a huge fault in any suspence novel. And I'm not particularly good at guessing endings, either, so there should be no huge thrill for the experienced reader of suspence novels (I'm much more Anne Tyler or John Irving than Stephen King or Mary Higgins Clark).So -- why did I give it four stars? Because I couldn't stop reading! Spent just about an entire day curling up with the one; for all of my complaints against it, I have to admit that I was utterly engrossed. I don't know whether or not I'll ever think about this novel again - or whether or not I'll read another Barbara Rogan book - but I do now that I don't feel like my day was wasted. Good reading, if not a great book. Don't pick it up unless you have hours to spare."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best mysteries I have read in quite a while. It seems to start out a little slow, but all the background is necessary. Just keep reading, because when it takes off around page 30 it doesn't slow down again. You will think you understand what's going on many times - but you won't know for sure until the end - and I mean the very end. Emma Roth is a character you want to smack, cheer for, and help; all at the same time. A great read, and a truly fascinating mystery!"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I love books that are just the right amount of eerie (can't do real scary stuff). This one was great. I said I would read a chapter while waiting for the pizza guy-- a few hours later I'd finished it.The novel is tightly plotted-- with some deliberate loose ends left, but all essential questions satisfied."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"Dear Amazon.com, please make it possible to award a book NO stars. I purchased this book after reading all the rave reviews for it here. What a disappointment. The story's full of hack stereotypes, like the feisty, wise-cracking Jewish sister, the distracted, intellectual (he's a physicist) WASP husband, the studly kid's soccer coach who gets to be (big surprise) the potential extramartial interest. And then there's the embarrassing cliches: the young black woman who's forever saying &quot;You go, girlfriend!&quot; and the elderly English teacher WHO WEARS LAVENDER SCENT.Another reviewer felt that the main character wasn't very likeable. For me, the less-than-lovable heroine was the ONLY interesting thing in this sad mess.If you feel compelled to read this book, borrow someone else's copy or wait until it comes out in paperback, but please don't waste your money on the hardcover. Then save it for a brainless beach read."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"It's not easy to find good thrillers, but Rogan's &quot;Suspicion&quot; has it all -- edge-of-your-seat tension, memorable characters, fascinating setting. Warning: Don't start reading late at night, because you're not going to be able to put this book down!"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This book was a fun, easy read that I found entertaining. I cared about the heroine, Emma, because she seemed so real in her response to the tragedies she suffered. Two of my other favorite characters were Ida Green a no-nonsense psychic and Arthur, a libidinous book editor. I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This so-called ghost story sounded really enticing on the surface, but it remained a superficial read from start to finish. The characters are all cliches, and the plot is as obvious as Mrs. Hysop's purple marking pen. In fact, I think I liked the ghost better than anyone else in this novel, with the exception of the dog.Sure, there is a ghost, but I would not call this a ghost story. The ghost is peripheral to the real story, which is how a woman's past comes back to haunt her. As someone in a previous review pointed out, the main character is a shallow yuppie who evokes little or no sympathy in the reader.And what makes it worse is that Rogan is a skillful writer with some degree of talent, but she'd put it to better use by developing some meaty characters."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"SUSPICION is one of my all time favourite books! This is a sophisticated ghost story with a haunting that is woven so seamlessly and skillfully into normal life that it seems all too plausible and frightening.Emma, is a writer of ghost stories who doesn't believe in ghosts. Her dilemma: if her house is not haunted then she is either losing her mind or someone is trying to destroy her.You'll be guessing to the end!This is a wonderful novel! Read it! Barbara Rogan's other books are fabulous too!These are my other favourites:Hindsight: A Novel of the Class of 1972Rowing in Eden: Rereading Emily DickinsonA Heartbeat Away"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"Not one of those books that you can't put down. The story once you get reading moves along pretty well, but it just lacks excitment. I would compare it to a gothic mystery maybe. I for one liked the soccer scenes, since I used to be a soccer parent. Anyway, this would probably be a good book to take on vacation or read on a stormy day."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This book is definately not high on the list if you want a book that makes you think and keeps you guessing till the end but on the other hand it is an easy &quot;while away the evening&quot; read.If you want suspense and terror and a book to make you squirm while you read don't pick this one up. You will be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"A solid read; kept my interest. A bit cliched in bits, but overall the end result is good."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This was just an ok book if you are desperate for something to read. It was not at all thought-provoking and was full of stereotypes: the liberal, urban Jew - the uptight WASP - the soul talking, sassy black woman - the womanizing jock, etc., etc. The villain of the story could be picked out of the line-up after a few pages. To all this, add a cop-out ending and you have a very unimaginative story that has been told much better elsewhere."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"Although I didn't like the main character, Emma, I was sucked into the story and kept turning pages to see if it was a ghost or a stalker. The mathematics I found very interesting (of course I would), the soccer scenes I did not. I thought the red herrings were good, but I'm afraid I must agree with previous reviewers that the characters are clich&eacute;d. But none of this dissuaded me from finishing and going back to read certain parts again."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I had high expectations when I began this book because of all the favourable reviews. Although the plot was reasonably good and original, you don't care about Emma Roth or what happens to her, because she is such a superficial yuppie! Of course, her husband is the one who is the scientist(in a faddy field, chaos theory) because little ol' magnolia blossom wifey couldn't possibly be up to it, right? I mean, we are only in the 90's and that's not the 1890's either! The other beef I have is the author going into so much technical detail about soccer playing - give it a rest! The average reader is not that stupid! A book in the same genre which I read many, many years ago which was far superior was &quot;Castle Ugly.&quot;"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I found this book to be so enthralling! I stayed in my reading chair and let everything else go until I read the last page. I was so absorbed that every time the phone rang, I jumped. For those of you out there who are a little tired of the most popular psychological suspense authors, i.e. Mary Higgins Clarke, Patricia Cornwell, etc., I am sure you will find this book refreshing. I love the aforementioned authors, however, lately, I have found them somewhat predictable. I would suggest to anyone planning to read this book to block some time off. You will not want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"If you like books that keep you up all night, SUSPICION should be your next read. It grabs you right from the start and before you know it, reality spirals down into the book in your hands.Rogan's got a way with storytelling that doesn't allow you to sit back and witness. She's got you right in that house, breathing the unbelievable, feeling eerie, heart-stopping terror right along with her characters.And it's these characters who are so disturbing. No purple-turbaned exotics or flaky New Agers, just plain folks doing everyday things. It's all so believable. When things shift and stuff starts happening, the impact explodes all around you.Buy the book. Wow, is it ever one heck of a good time!"},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"I love mysteries and ghost stories. But genre fiction doesn't have to mean poor quality. This book is one of the silliest compendiums of cliched characters, predictable plot, and derivations from B movies that I've ever read. I had the flu and needed light reading, and I'll grant that this is a mindless page turner, so the book has its uses, I guess. If your mind's fully functioning, though, read Minette Walters or Thomas Cook for spooky psychological thrillers, Edith Wharton or M.R. James for ghosts--not this nonsense."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"This book is very suspenseful, I'll admit that much. Mary Higgins Clark, too, can write suspense. It's not easy! But beyond the suspense, which I admit kept me reading well into the wee hours, everything else in this book is flawed. The main character is eminently dislikeable. The first 50 pages should be chopped off. The one black woman in the book (a teacher and artist) speaks in a dialect I think is supposed to be &quot;black English.&quot; Other characters are flat or cloying. And in the end, a lot of loose ends are left dangling. Frankly, this book suffers in comparison to another newly-released (and BRILLIANT) novel involving the supernatural, Ann Arensberg's &quot;Incubus.&quot; But, ultimately, none of this matters because we keep reading and chewing our fingernails. This book will make excellent beach fare this summer."},{"Title":"Suspicion: A Novel","review":"A very well written, exciting read. It really keeps you guessing as to who (or what) is stalking the Emma Roth."},{"Title":"Child of Venus","review":"Finally!! Years ago, a friend found &quot;Venus of Dreams,&quot; at a bookstore and bought it for me. I enjoyed the story that unfolded about a girl named Iris. Her dream was to become a part of the terraforming of Venus and she see's this dream come true as an adult. Iris ultimately pays the price for her dream of transforming Venus, when the planet itself claims her life. The second book, &quot;Venus of Shadows,&quot; is by far the best of the series. Sargent weaves an excellent story (as always) by using Iris's decendants (in particular, Risa, Iris's daughter) to tell of both their personal desires as well as the desire to breath life into Venus itself. Again, there are hard prices to pay for these desires. The last and final book, &quot;Child of Venus&quot; wraps up the entire tale. Again, Iris's decendants are still terraforming Venus, amid all the troubles and turmoil that existed from the previous books. Normally I would have given this book Four Stars. But, I gave the book &quot;FIVE STARS&quot; partly because - it was actually a very good and interesting book. But mainly because I read the first book when I was about 21 or so, and I'm now 36. I guess I'm just grateful that the last book was published during my lifetime. Pamela Sargent has been one of my favorite authors since I read &quot;Venus of Dreams.&quot; I've read many of her other books and find them all extremly interesting and well written. I hope to read more of her work in the future."},{"Title":"Child of Venus","review":"Great quality and really low price.a b c d e f g h i j k l m n"},{"Title":"Child of Venus","review":"As an original reader of the first two books, it'd been a long time since I'd walked the aisles of Venus. It's fairly amazing to me that I'd still, from time to time, search on 'Sargent' to see if she'd ever written the third book. The pleasant surprise at seeing she had can not be overstated.What was also exhilarating to me was how-- prodded reflectively by the author-- I was able to recall the first two novels read nearly a decade and a half ago. That alone was worth the trip. However, to be frank, the book is a *good* read.How to describe it? It is a character novel. Specifically, a novel on the entirety of the protagonist's Mahala's life-- her choices, the people with whom she interacts, etc. It's interweavon nicely with a science fiction thread dealing with the fate of Venus, the Habbers, Earth and, ultimately, all of humanity.As such, it's a good thing that Sargent's strength in this novel is the fine, yet gentle literary tapestry of characters, future 'plausible' science, and, quite frankly, leveraged strength wrought from the legacy of the first two novels.If anything, the weakness in the books-- borne out in the closing 50 or so pages-- seems to be the cause of the delay in writing the third book (12 years? 13 years?): namely, how to end it. After all, the trilogy, at least from a Sci Fi standpoint, is about terraforming venus. of course, I'm not going to divulge that here.bottom line? It's a good read. If you haven't read the first two books, SHAME ON YOU. Get them. Read them all. Enjoy them."},{"Title":"Child of Venus","review":"I so enjoyed 'The Shore of Women' and had high hopes of a good read with 'Child of Venus'. No such luck. I did manage to finish it, although I found myself skipping and skimming much of it. Just plain boring. Never got into any real action at all, much of it was simple rambling and thoughts on paper. Maybe if I had read the first two in the trilogy, but even then I just don't think this book works well. I just can not recommend it. Try something by Sheri S. Tepper instead--or read 'The Shore of Women'."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was FANTASTIC! Maybe the best book that I have ever read! It is about a little group of rabbits that think danger is near, and decide to leave their home warren in hopes of evading it. It is a book of sheer suspense in the end, their clash with Woundwort. I really enjoyed the book and think that everyone who likes rabbits, or just likes good books, should read it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The characterizations and story are charming all the way and it's even believable that such things could happen at the time you are reading it. A basic, good story and applied to the rabbit cast in expert fashion. Although the rabbits more or less act like humans, they are still recognizable as rabbits and are very interesting because of it. A basic good and evil story, with good triumphing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book year's ago when I was a sophomore in High School. It was so good, I made my younger sister read it so I had someone to discuss it with over the summer. We even memorized the &quot;rabbit's language&quot; to use as code against our older sister.I was delighted when my daughter told me it was on her 8th grade required summer reading. The book is a bit difficult for the reader to get into at first, but once you start reading you are totally captivated by the characters. You will laugh, cry and cheer the main characters.A must read for anyone from 12 to 200! Read it and share it with all your &quot;book buddies&quot;. You might actually be disappointed to say goodbye to the characters at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. It was so entertaining, I read it in two days!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"although i did not find the book as embracing as many of the other reviewers, i did find it an excellent read. in my younger days i remember coming across the book and all of the fanfare that followed it. recently for what ever reason, i decided finally to read the book. i'll admit at my age, i was skeptical that i would enjoy a story about a bunch of bunnies gallivanting around! however about 30 pages into the book and i was completely engrossed.i enjoyed several things about this book. 1. the author tried to maintain a legitimacy to the life and behavior of rabbits. 2. there are constant departures from the original story where rabbits tell fables of El-ahrairah, a rabbit folk hero. 3. a tightly wound story with an eloquent ending.if you enjoyed The Hobbit you might enjoy this as well. Watership Downs, much in the same manner of The Hobbit, creates an alternate world to take readers to. one with it's own rules, diction and direction."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a masterpiece. I don't say that lightly, Adams put so much into this story (even the chapter titles are thought-provoking &quot;Like Trees in November&quot;).It is easy to dismiss this as a children's book about rabbits. It is about rabbits, but its not just for children. A great deal of thought and research went into this novel. The rabbits are seen as distinct individuals--whom we can relate to and share in their sorrows and triumphs. I cried. I got angry. I cheered for them. It is rare for a book to fully capture my emotions in that way.The reader is immersed in their culture, motivations, and language. The folk tales which form the basis for their mythology and spirituality could stand on their own, as is the case with, &quot;The Story of Rowsby Woof and the Fairy Wogdog&quot;.The rabbits are presented with many obstacles, not the least of which, is one of the great unrecognized villans of literature, General Woundwort, leader of Efrafa.This book works on so many levels. It would be a shame if you missed out because you thought it was just a children's book. This is a book suitable to be read and re-read throughout your life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down Richard Adams Book Review Watership Down is the greatest book because of the plot and the adventures throughout the story. Watership down is about the adeventures of rabbits. The 2 main characters are Hazel and Fiver. Fiver is the fifth rabbit in his litter and is the smallest, kind of like a runt in a litter of pigs. Hazel is Fivers best friend and a normal smart rabbit. The story starts as Fiver, who is known to be able to see the dangers in the future. Fiver sees a bad vision about his town and trys to warn the head master, thereah, but thinks Fiver is just a pyscho. Anyways Fiver and Hazel dont take any chances and get as many rabbits togethor and leave their warren. (warren is the term they use for there cummunity). After that their adventures really start to take off. They run into many of the rabbits preys such as the, eagle, owl and fox. But with the help of the smartest and the strongest rabbits from their town they seem to make it. The rest of the story i will leave a mystery for you but ill tell you one thing its great!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Could this have been one of my first literary departures from reality? I don't know, but since then I have been an avid reader of Fantasy and other books of the like. But this is a great retelling of the Exodus story with a small furry mammal twist. Hazel was a strong leader even if Bigwig seemed to be the stronger. the real power and respect lay with Hazel. So it is in the human worl. Children can greatly benefit from reading thhis as it easily correlates with some of the baser sides of human society. I try to watch the film version of it at least once a year and I now want my children to enjoy this fantasy classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My name is Amanda and I am i the 8th grade. We were required to read this book for the last part of the year. Oh my gosh! I fell in love with this book! I am an animal lover so i probaly liked this book more than other people, but this book opened me up to some of the challenging hard-ships animals face. Bigwig was my favorite rabbit throught out the story because he is determined, a little wacky at times, and very funny. I also like the little fur-top on his head. This book is a great book if you have the time to read it and the patience to stick through it. The reason i say this is because it is 481 pgs. long....... but it pulls you in as you start to read it. So all I can say is....get it, read it, love it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Writers should make more stories like these. Rarely does one find a book that can just make you turn page after page, and a book about talking rabbits nonetheless.This book is a prototype story: plot, character, conflict, etc. Rich in detail (which makes me wonder if Richard Adams is a rabbit himself) and full of imagination, it plunges the reader into the small bodies of these intelligent, resourceful, and lovable rabbits, and takes him through the journeys and adventures they have upon their escape from Sandleford. There are also mini-stories within the story, which deal with the random mythologies and folklore of rabbit legend El-Ahraihrah (which, by the way, are very well-done).Who would have thought rabbits led much more interesting lives? I didn't."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is truly one the greatest books of our time. The characters are deep and you care for them, and anyone who has heard of this book has to mention the hero: Hazel. He is one of the greatest characters I have ever read and a wonderful leader for this group of rabbits. This book is not necessarily an \\"easy\\" read but one you will have great satisfaction from. The ending you will leave you with tears in your eyes. Out of all the books you have ever read, you will remember this one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recently was assigned to read this book for school. I had two weeks to read a four hundred page book about rabbits. It didn't exactly thrill me, when I first started reading it was hard to follow and I thought oh Great! but as the book went on the details and all the rabbits their personalitys how they thought the stories they told were amazing. I was always reading on and on wanting to see more of hazels leadership, bigwigs headstrongs ways and keehars funny mixed english like mizter vigwig! I recommend this book to anyone who can read. I'll probably read it again about 10 more times. The best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"watership down is possibly the best book of our time. the way richard adams captured the hearts minds (and possibly their pets) of millions of people throughout the world is very touching.the book is about a small group of rabbits living in the wild in search of a better safer, warren. but none of them realize the horrible danger they shall cross paths with, that even the wisest nor bravest could imagine.while on the way meeting other creatures including gulls, mice and many more !"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read Watership Down for the first time when I was 13. Now 10 years later it still holds the same magic. This is a truly wonderful book. Many other reviewers mention the heavy symbolism used by Adams to represent various forms of government. I never read it that way. To me it was just a grand adventure. But then in my opinion, books like these are truly the best. Each and every time one reads them, something new can be discovered."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was not supposed to like this book. I don't read fiction. I certainly would not read a book about the life of a bunch of rabbits. Fortunately, I was forced to read it. It was required reading. My approach to required reading is this; I read a couple book reviews and the notes inside the cover. I then read the first couple chapters and then the last chapter. I wrap it up by listening to my other classmates talk about the book. I am very good at it and everybody thinks I have read these silly books. My plan didn't work with this book because after I read the first couple chapters I could not put it down. I just had to know what happened to these rabbits next. I told myself I would just read a little more to see what happens next. I kept saying that until I finished the book. It was absolutely outstanding!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"...long enough to get through the first chapter.Only an adult reader can grasp the entirety of this book. It touches on politics, mysticism, ecology, and the Darwinian struggle to survive. This would be an amazing enough book if its characters were humans. That Adams can make it work from rabbits' point of view is nothing short of incredible. If you give it a chance, it will entertain the most serious reader."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Rarely does a book so unique, so astoundingly original, and so gripping come out that will enlighten the world to the furthest sense. Richard Adam's Watership Down broke all pre-conceived barriers in the European world and did the same in America months later.The richness of the story compares to that of Catch 22 by Joseph Heller. The writing compares to something out of Tolstoy or Steinbeck. Put together, writing and the story that writing tells, if good, will grip a reader and enchant them beyond any reason. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Some ten- year old brat wrote a front- page review saiying he couldn't understand it and obviously didn't finish the book. Being it that he can't even spell, it's not surprising a twit like him would lose interest so fast. I think the book grips you very quickly, and once it has you it won't let go. Adams does a wonderful job of writing the story from a rabbit's point of view. The raids on Efrafa to get does to start their new life are absolutley riveting. The legends of the great rabbit El- ahrairah are hilarious ( and very similar to those of Brer Rabbit.) Men are also displayed as enemies of rabbits and we humans have a mirror held up in front of us so that we see the bullies we sometimes are to living creatures. The book is surprisingly complex, but you don't have to read it from a point of allegory or anything deeper than a great story.I sure didn't. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can read ( except for that snot nosed illiterate on the front page.)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What an imaginitive mind Richard Adams posesses! I first saw the film of this as a child and while viewing it I remember being surprised that my mother let me watch it, considering I was a HUGE animal lover and for an animated film about wild rabbits there was a good amount of gore and she wouldnt let me see Bambi or Dumbo because she knew how upset I would be over it. But years later when I was in my teens and I read the book \\"watership down\\" I realize she let me see it because it was true to nature, with a fictional aspect. The animated film was so memorable to me. The book is even more memorible. This is one of those books that you have on a book shelf and you read it again and again over the years because it is so well written. In the years to follow after seeing the film I have had numerous rabbits and they have all been named after the characters from Watership down. Basically this story is what Mr. Adams would percieve the life of a wild rabbit, threated by other animals, commercial building, traffic etc. bringing life and realism to the hares.

It is about Fiver, and his brother Hazel. Fiver has a sixth sense that told him to leave the farm immediately. Hazel and he gathered as many rabbits as would come and left. They made it over many obstacles and finally got to another warren. They were made welcome, but then they found a deep dark secret about the warren and had to leave. Another rabbit from that warren came with. They got to a new place, and were settled in when they realized they had no does. They went in search for some and Hazel got shot, but he lived. They had one doe. Three other rabbits went to a new warren to get does but came back sick and tired and scratched up.

Most people judge this book by looking at it, I admit I also thought it was not worth reading at first. This book's main plot was how a handful of rabbits escaped from their warren because one of the rabbits in the warren predicted that disaster would destroy the warren. Even though its a little dull at times, if you keep on reading you'll be glad you kept on going."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I first heard of Watership Down, it was from a friend who read it in school. When I read it in 6th grade. I LOVED THIS BOOK. I love it now. Watership Down is the best book that I have ever read. I reccomend it to everyone who likes adventure, comfort, animals, mystery, and everything else that makes up a good book. the only bad thing I have to accociate with Watership Down is the movie. I DO NOT reccomend the movie. All in all, though, my experience with Watership Down is a great one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adams strikes a wonderful balance between having a fully detailed and realized &quot;alternate&quot; world and creating characters whose playfulness and seriousness (when the plot requires) allow the reader to feel a closeness to them. Highly recommended for anyone from about 10 and up."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderful book, not only for the adults for whom it was written, but for children as well. I read the book to a first-grader, who listened, engrossed, from beginning to end, wanting to read it again as soon as we'd finished. Ostensibly a story about rabbits, it is truly a depiction of the attachments and strengths which enable people to work togehter through anything life brings.The use of rabbit legend to develop the story and characters gives Watership Down a mythical quality. It's a beauty!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It is a great book to read to your kids, or to yourself! The characters, despite being rabbits, are well constructed and believable. The characters make the book, and they certainly do their job here.

For me it was coincidence. As a child I once saw a cartoon called Watership Down. I remember there was music of Simon and Garfunkel in it. It probably ended with \\"Based on a story by Adams\\". Maybe that I made a mental note that day to read the book one day. I don't know. About 15 years later or so I finally bought the book and read it. Not bad, not bad at all. I thought it would be something like Duncton Wood, a book I read several years ago. And there are definitely similarities. Both books tell a story from the perspective of the animals. In Duncton Wood it were moles, here it was rabbits. I liked Watership Down better. It got me more involved and Duncton Wood was too long I think. At a certain point I got bored by it. Not Watership Down it entertained me till the end. I think the writer wrote one more book about the rabbits of Watership Down, but I'll pass on that one. Don't think a sequel was necessary. For me the story is finished."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I like this book very much because it was filled with action, drama & comedy. For example, it has 12 rabbits that have to travel on a dangerous journey to escape danger and start a new warren (home). The characters are a mix: strong, smart, weak...One knew how to lead and by working together they all got to a place on top of the hill where they were safe and no one got hurt...."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is amazing for most age, but as the negative reviews show, it's not for everyone.It's a long book. You need to have some sort of attention span to read it. Which is why so many high school students dislike it when forced to read it.It's &quot;about&quot; rabbits. They talk. If you can't get over that, skip this book. There are made up words too. Oh the horror. It is in part a fantasy. If that genre repulses you, skip this book.That's part of the reason so many people loved this book as young kids. If you know a child who's not too easily scared (because some of the book is dark) they'll love it for the pure fantasy elements of it, though they might need it read to them if they're really young.It's great on so many other levels too. I first read it the summer before freshmen year (yes, it was required for school). And each time I've read it since I have gotten more out of it. It's a moving story, a fanciful adventure, an allegorical tale, and more, all in one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm 14, almost 15, and i loved Watership Down, i wasn't forced to read it either.

It was an exalent book, i would read it again, yeah it was like, about 500 pages, but i like long books.If u liked Watership down u should try &quot;The Fire Bringer&quot; or &quot;The Sight&quot; by David Clement-Davies. BOth also 500 pages"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Overall I did find this story to be very unique with its substitution of rabbits, instead of people, for characters. I can easily see why people would call it the \\"Odyssey\\" of rabbits. However, I found it to be a bit drawn out and while I very much appreciate a descriptive author, I felt Adams at times was closer to writing something akin to \\"Walden\\" than anything else.It's a bit too adult for children, though it is certainly not above them. I just felt the story could have been a little more succinct. Overall, I give the story 3 1/2 stars as it did have some wonderfully suspenseful moments. Though I found flaws in this novel (which, judging by previous reviews, is not a popular opinion) I do give it an A for originality."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new book! I am a huge Watership Down fan, and I thought it would be nice to see another illustrator's perspective. I own the versions illustrated by John Lawrence, so I have a good basis for comparison.This new edition is hardcover, although it lacks a dust jacket. In contrast to John Lawrence's subtle black, white and grey drawings, Aldo Galli's illustrations are vivid, futuristic looking color renderings.If you are a traditionalist looking for a new printing in the old style, you will be disappointed. I am a huge fan of John Lawrence's originals, but I like most of Galli's images. It is a very different approach, but I think that is what makes it fun! They do a nice job of conveying the upbeat or dark mood of each scene.Aside from the lack of a dust cover, the quality of the book is very good, with good quality printing and paper. The print is fairly large, which is great for aging and young eyes alike!For the price, you cannot go wrong, and if you have never seen an illustrated version of this book, it is a treat. If you can find an old John Lawrence illustrated version, buy it for a contrast. There are two versions, a limited edition of 250 that is nearly impossible to locate, and a regular edition that is hard but not impossible to find."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams' classic novel, set in Hampshire, England, is worth reading for memorable characters and a decent adventure story. The protagonists of the novel prevail through their fidelity to their true natures, while the villains fail because they have sacrificed their freedom to their desire for security.The novel offers the reader some insight into real rabbit behavior, which, according to the front matter, the author gained from R.M. Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit. To me, the best scenes were quiet ones, with the rabbits snug underground or outside feeding on grass under moonlight.The only parts of the novel that didn't work for were the stories and legends that the rabbits tell one another about the mythical figures of Frith and El-ahrairah. After the second one, I stopped reading them and stuck to the main plot."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The volume was received in a surprisingly short time after the order was placed. The quality and format of the volume were exactly as described in the sale notice and will more than adequately fulfill the grandparental intent.A good outcome for one so geographically far away."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is an amazing book and one of my all time favorites. The rabbits may as well be humans, as Adams give them distinct personalities. It's about the stuggle for survival in the world, as well as in a community. The story parallels our own human struggle in society, community and against forces we can't control."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a really good book. if you have read any of the Redwall books, this is a 10X better book. Adams creates characters who could be in your own backyard, and makes you care and sometimes hate them. This is no child's story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership down the story of a group of rabbits who leave their warren because of a prophecy by Fiver in which he realizes that anyone who doesn't leave will be in great danger. After being convinced Hazel (who ends up being a natural leader) leads a group of a rabbits also convinced by Fiver's prophecy away from home in search of a new Warren.This book was very good. You have to be able to go with talking rabbits etc. to enjoy this book and they are considerably more intelligent than is realistic. So if you can suspend your disbelief on these types of things then you would probably enjoy this book. A long journey/adventure about a group of rabbits is search of a new home and the problems and challenges they encounter along the way and also once they arrive. A good balance of action and violence keep the book interesting all the way through.The good:The story was well written. The dialogue between the rabbits is actually enjoyable for the most part. You can feel as you read how the group of rabbits who didn't really know each other very well in the beginning come together as a group as the story progresses which makes you care for the characters and pull for them as you read on. The characters were well written and have distinct personalities.The Bad:Not much. There were a few too many El-ahrairah and Rabscuttle stories. They are mythological rabbit characters and Hazels group would tell stories about them at points. A few were okay because it gave depth to the rabbit culture but there were a couple too many of them.Overall Watership down is a good book worth reading. It isn't considered a classic for no reason."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a classic story about a group of rabbits searching for the good life. It has a surprising amount to say about courage, loyalty, and leadership."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think that the first thought of many people when they see Watership Down is \\"A book about rabbits? How. . .cheesy.\\" But truth is, once you get into the story, you begin to not even think about the characters as rabbits, more as complex beings.I've read this book at least five times, and enjoyed it increasingly each time through. The storyline, put into three sentences is: A group of rabbit adventurers leave their warren, just before it is destroyed by men. They encounter many dangers, finally settling in a place that is too good to be true. Then they face the problem of not having any females, so they journey to another (rather terrifying) warren to \\"steal\\" some does. Trust me, it's much better when you actually read it. You could not ask for a more exciting, as well as touching plot. The characters are so believable that you begin to really feel their emotions. You will reach the end of this book, lightheaded from holding your breath, and with your jaw somewhere around your knees.I could go on and on (and on and on and on) about how wonderful this book is.

Is someone trying to sound like they're above this book's level? I've personally read Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Divine Comedy by Dante, The Ring and the Book by Robert Browning, and other such brutally lofty and intellectual works, and I thought Watership Down to be a wonderfully constructed story.

I would reccomend it to anyone.I am a little insulted by the people who say no teenager would enjoy this book because of it's length and characters.

The story is about rabbits and it wouldn't have worked with any other animals but rabbit's so get over it.If you get past that you will realize how great a book it is. The book is very detailed and for good reason, it sets the setting up perfect, to the point were you can smells the forset. It also gives the characters depth. I didn't fell like I was just reading about nobody but people I know. I'am a 13-year-old male and if you don't get the plot of this book you most likly work at burger king. A must read"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Don't be discouraged by any reviews you saw degrading this book. It's fantastically discriptive, well-written, and exciting.

But if it weren't for them we wouldn't read it because it is very long and has microscopic print. Thanks to our teachers for making us read it!

After overcoming many dangers they get to a hill that fiver deems safe enough to live at, but Hazel, the leader of the new warren realizes that since there are no female rabbits which means there can be no baby rabbits, which means that once the rabbits that left the first warren die, the new warren will too die with them. To prevent this, an envoy is sent to another warren a ways off to ask for some of their female rabbits. Little do they know what awaits them on their task. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, because it had the perfect balance of suspense, humor, and action. The authors writing style is a little slow at times, but nonetheless I loved this classic. I think everyone should read this joyous book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am typically more of a fan of fantasy style stories, so when a good friend recommended that I pick up a 500 page book about rabbits, naturally I was more than a little skeptical. I figured it was some children's story, and the foreward seems to allude to that as well, but at 500 pages and no \\"Harry Potter\\" in the title, I don't think many kids pick it up. After finishing the book, I couldn't agree more that this is indeed a must-read. As the book reached its climax, I couldn't put it down. For any fiction fan in the mood for a change of scenery, this book is a very safe bet."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was wonderful. It is a story of working together to achieve a common goal. It shows that you can learn from your adversaries. Also, it shows how human beings can disrespect nature. This book made me care about the rabbits and what happened to them."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I really hate to review books that have been so thoroughly reviewed, such as 'Watership Down.' Nonetheless, I will proceed to put in my two cents worth in the name of foolish consistency...I like to recognize authors who have successfully created their own unique worlds in which their characters live and breathe. Tolkein achieved it with Middle Earth, Lucas creates new galaxies for the Star Wars saga and Adams has done the same in a few pieces of open fields surrounded by trees and a small river in the English countryside.It is more than a story about rabbits, it is also a story about the nature of government and the advantages of freedom of association. Far from perfect (one could easily edit out 50 pages wihout harming the story), it nonetheless draws the reader in to the rabbit warren. At the end, you just care about these rabbits!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've recently started re-reading this book as a Sophomore in college and I find that the immeasurable shear enjoyment of it has not deteriorated the slightest bit since probably six years ago when I first experienced Watership Down.

At times dry, it has enough action and pace in it to keep even the humblest readers satisfied. An ideal book for teenagers, it has remarkable messages about beig the underdog and rising to the top. Not perfectly expressed emotions, but Adams is very good at keeping what would otherwise be a boring book intriguing, twisted, and humorous. A good read, and not too deep. Good story line. Timeless."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read the book when I was 11 years old. I am now 34 and have read it for the sixth time. it left such an impression that I look foward to passing it on to my children."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is by far my favorite book. I am reading it again for about the 10th time, and over the years, my love of it has grown and grown. The first time I read it, back in 5th grade, it was an easy to read and easy to follow book that was a great story for a young girl on a rabbit farm. Over the years, each time I pick it up, it becomes more to me. I discover something I hadn't the last time I read it, or a passage &quot;speaks&quot; to me in a new way. This books speaks to so many levels of society, of power, of life for so many species. I tell everyone I know that this is a book they should read, I don't know how you couldn't love it.I love all of Richard Adams' books, I think he is a fantastic writer, but this is by far his best."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I may be 11, but I have a 12th Grade reading level. This was an excellent book - I read it in about 3 days. The book is about 500 entriguing pages long. It's about a group of rabbits, one of whom (Fiver) is a rabbit oracle, basically. They are all so cute! Fiver leads a group of rabbits, including Hazel, out of the Warren and into the wild. As they work together, Hazel becomes leader. They have many adventures and eventually end up on Watership Down, where they start anew. I loved the way Adams makes up words, such as Rah (eg Hazel-rah!), and uses them so efficiently. I would not reccomend this book for animal haters [aka devil worshippers :-)] or people under the age of 10, unless they can read very well and have patience to read books. If you like(love is more like it)d this wonderful book, I'd reccomend reading any of the Redwall books by Brian Jacques. Those are wonderful, and about mice. They are also intriguing, and I read all 14 in 1 day each."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams's incredible novel 'Watership Down' is not just about rabbits, as one first suspects. With its artful and satirical plot, painstakingly etched characters, and superb portrayal of a society, Adams has created a milestone of modern literature.Our story begins in a warren of rabbits where two brothers- Hazel and Fiver- are living a comfortable life when they're not being bullied and bossed around by the Owsla, or rabbit military regime. When Fiver begins to have visions and apprehensive feelings, he convinces Hazel that something evil is about to descend on the warren. The Chief Rabbit, Threarah, listens patiently to Fiver's claims and then shrugs the two off, convinced that if something devastating were coming to the warren, he would already know about it. Left to their own devices, Fiver and Hazel decide to leave the warren in search of something better. They bring with them a brave band of rabbits who together struggle, learn, and above all survive. This is a truly great story about comradary, the pursuit of the truth, and the unbreakable hope and spirit that is in all living things- be they human beings fighting for their rights in a terrorized society, or rabbits fighting to survive.Adams uses better techniques than just satire, however. He has a raw skill and talent to make the rabbit's problem hit a human chord that even the most primitive of people can understand. Adams also gives the rabbits an extensive history, religion, folktales, and fears. Several times throughout the novel, Adams has delightful digressions where he relates these folk stories through Dandelion, one of the rabbits to leave with Fiver and Hazel who tells stories to the new warren at Watership Down. The reader will have no trouble getting through the rich imagery, atmosphere, and hopeful appeal this novel wears so very well.'Watership Down' deserves every word of praise it gets now and will continue to get for generations to come. This timeless treasure of American literature stands as a towering landmark to good story-telling, flawless talent, and a return to a style the reader will not have felt since childhood. But make no mistake; 'Watership Down' is NO children's book. Its intelligence, craft, and moveable feel with take its readers to an unforgettable place they will be sorry to leave as they turn the last page."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When my family and I travel, we listen to books on CD.

I happened to stumble across it in the library one day and flipped through it just to see what it was about, and before I knew it I was several pages in and already loved it.

Those resourceful rabbits had aerial attacks, surveillance patrols, raids, search & destroy missions, psychological operations, seige tactics, diversions, etc. Perhaps the Pentagon could use this as a tactical field manual.

My older sister and I both owned pet rabbits, so I was first drawn to this book because it revolved around rabbits. I loved the book then, and I love the book now. At that time, the book was an amazing adventure tale, one not to be easily forgotten. Now that I am an adult, I see so many other things in this book besides an amazing adventure tale. I see a changing world of politics; I see the lesson in learning to adapt and change in order to survive; I see the bravery of facing the unknown but forging ahead anyway; I see the force of hope that propels us towards an uncertain, but hopefully better, future, working as a team to get there.I will be interested to see what I pick up from this book a couple of decades from now."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This was one of the books that I had to read for English class as a high school freshman, but actually liked.

The characters talk, but they otherwise act and think as rabbits might be expected to.Returning to Watership Down as an adult, I found the story just as engaging, with likable protagonists, scenes of danger and battle (which had helped hold my 14 year old self's attention), and several different rabbit cultures. It's an accessible read for younger people, but it contains plenty of adult concerns. My only minor criticism is the absence of significant female characters (though, to be fair, this is a plot point), but, other than that, this 1972 novel remains as timeless as it was when I first read it.The audiobook narrator isn't a standout, but he does a decent enough job."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams' Watership Down is a literary cornerstone that will last for ages for its whimsical and undying depth. What a phenomenal read. It contains epic storytelling, substance, and gratifying character development. The reader will be astounded with the way the characters and scenery are interwoven to create such a vivid and masterful scene of intrigue and substance. Numerous themes such as nature, heroism, strength, honor, failure, unity, harmony, etc can be extracted from the novel. In essence, the number of themes one can draw out from reading from this book are endless, thus showing what a remarkable piece of literature Adams has constructed.Rabbits represent much more than the conventional, cute and cuddly critter that we are all use to. They are mere humans in this complex story of survival and upward mobility in this fulfilling and charismatic journey to utopia. Despite being a fairly long read, it actually is suspenseful and offers a phenomenal glimpse into the rabbits' culture in terms of mythology, which is quite moving. If you own a pet rabbit like myself (mini-lop that is 5 years old) then you will most likely enjoy this book. However, if you do not own a rabbit, I am sure you will enjoy it for its lively narrative and storytelling that is sure to leave a lasting impression in you heart."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was sad to put the book down I felt connected with the characters. It is a must read for anyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Like many classic tales, Watership Down can be enjoyed as a straightforward adventure novel. Others might point out its (political) allegorical aspects, in the same way that the Narnia Chronicles incorporate (Christian) allegory into their adventure stories. Of course, this does not make a novel good or bad, or enjoyable to read. The key point is this: Watership Down is a fun, action-packed, and thoughtful novel that has maintained its status over its 30 years in continual printing.The story follows the lives of several rabbits, as they first flee the destruction of their home warren (at the hands of human developers), and then establish a new home in the more remote location of Watership Down. Obviously, as rabbits, they are subject to predation by foxes, stoats, and men, and those crossing the open fields have nowhere to run when danger strikes. Adventure inevitably follows, and the personalities of the group are combined and used to best advantage by Hazel, the \\"decider\\" and eventual leader of the group. Besides Hazel we have Bigwig the policeman/action hero; Pipkin the loyal sidekick, Blueberry the thinker, Fiver the sensitive one, Holly the tracker, Dandelion the storyteller, etc. If these appear to be crudely drawn carricatures, well, rabbits are simple animals with simple tastes. They want shelter, community, and to create little rabbits. The last drives most of the action in the book, as the original Watership warren was founded entirely by males. Interspersed throughout are stories from rabbit lore, telling the story of the creation of rabbits and the deeds of derring-do performed by El-ahrairah, the cunning first king of the rabbits.The freedom and equality (indeed, even democracy) that the Watership rabbits enjoy is contrasted with the three other warrens in the book. The original warren run in a classic strongman meritocracy style (the bigger the rabbit, the higher up the chain of command). On their way to Watership they encounter a libertarian warren where the rabbits apparently come and go as they please, free of laws or authoritarian figures, but their freedom is paid for with a terrible price. Thirdly is Efafra, a military dictatorship set up to preserve secrecy (from discovery by men) at the cost of all personal freedom. Thus, the main theme (at least, to a post-9/11 North American reader) would appear to be the balance of security and freedom, with our heroes finding a good balance (but leaning far to the freedom side), while the Efafrans clamp down on all freedom in the interest of mutual security. Perhaps this was Adams's point - the IRA was certainly active (and committing terrorist acts on British soil) at the time he was writing this book, and other European terrorist organizations were also starting up around this time (Red Brigades in Italy, Baader-Meinhof Gang in Germany, etc.). Therefore, the book is likely to continue to resonate with any society struggling with the classic balance between security and freedom.These musings are not meant to suggest that Adams spends most of his time on philosophy or in-depth arguments. No, this book is successful because it taps into basic human instincts and folklore, and presents it in a fun, fresh and exciting way. Just because the main characters are rabbits, it doesn't mean that they aren't \\"people\\"."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I just really enjoy this book - once I started it I didn't want to put it down. A very exciting story, the author warns not to delve too deeply as far as symbolism goes. I really think it was meant to be an exciting, great yarn of a tale! Enjoy the great storytelling - not sure what age children it would appeal to - I'm 40 and I like it and find it made me jumpy like a rabbit when reading at night! It was dark and scary at times..I don't know whhat children it would appeal to. I think I read it for the first time in my early teens.It's told from a male rabbit perspective and yes the does are portrayed as raising litters of rabbits, digging the dens, and baby-making but to slam the book as anti-feminism is kind of futile cause that's how rabbits are i.e breeding like rabbits!! I think as well less is known about female rabbits as they spend more time underground caring for the kittens..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've heard that one of my favorite stories, The Hobbitt, was originally written by J. R. R. Tolkien for his children - it wasn't even meant for publication. If not for the prodding of his friend, C. S. Lewis, it might never have been published. And in the introduction to Watership Down, Richard Adams explains that it was borne out of a request by his daughters for a story on a long car ride - not just any story, but a story made up just for them. And luckily for us, they encouraged their father to finish the story and have it published.Watership Down (which is a very dramatic-sounding title) starts when Fiver has a foreboding of danger for the warren. His prophecies, however, are rejected by the chief rabbit, and he and his friend Hazel convince a few others to leave the warren in search of a place to start a new one. But there are a great many dangers out in the world: foxes and wolves, weasels and stoats, and not least of all man and his machines. That's right, this is a story about rabbits. No, they're not rabbits who wear little mittens and coats with buttons - they're real rabbits who forage in the grass and occasionally raid gardens. But they also have their own language and legends and mythology, and we're treated to plenty of that in this captivating story as we follow Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Silver, Dandelion, Pipkin and the others on their odyssey.This book is often called an allegory, although Mr. Adams has insisted it was never meant as such and was simply \\"a story I told to my little girls.\\" But there certainly seem to be elements of symbolism. The legends of El-ahrairah, a type of Brer Rabbit, are told by the rabbits with almost religious reverence. The Black Rabbit of Inl&eacute;, another figure from their legends, might be compared to the Devil, and General Woundwort made me think of Joseph Stalin, ruling with an iron fist - errr, paw, I mean. And Fiver certainly seems to have a gift of prophecy, but the comparisons are only conjecture on my part and the legends add color and texture to a wonderful story.I'll admit I was hesitant to read this - a \\"classic\\" about bunnies? And it's not even very old, having been published originally in 1972. But I think it's certainly deserving of the attention it's received ever since and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's some violence and it can be occasionally frightening or sad, but I loved it and found myself genuinely concerned for Hazel and Fiver and Bigwig and their group. I listened to the audio book read by Ralph Cosham (and my kids would cast questioning looks my way: \\"A story about rabbits, Dad? Really?!?\\") who does an excellent job. In fact, I plan to follow Mr. Adams example and listen to the audio book with the kids the next time we have a long drive. They're going to love it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One of the classics I missed as a child. Great story, but it sometimes gets bogged down in the descriptions of the landscape. Still, it is definitely worth reading. I never imagined I would care so much about the fate of a few rabbits when I started the book. The action picks up mid-book and by the end I couldn't put it down until I new what had happened to Hazel and his rabbit friends."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I was, like, five years old, I used to watch the Watership Down movie all the time. It was my favorite, though it's a little graphic at parts for a child I suppose... Anyway, I first read the book in middle school when I figured out who wrote the book, and found it in the library. I loved it, and I still love to watch the movie. This book is just so fantastic. I love Kehaar! \\"Dumb bunnies got no mates!\\" \\"You got no mates, you got no plan.

I couldn't put it down. I read it at night, and during odd free moments at work. I picked it up again as soon as I got home. For the week I read WD, I was a rabbit. I , too, admired the unexpected leadership of Hazel. I, too, worried about our nervous prophet Fiver. I, too, loved my world of Frith (the sun) and El-ahrairah (our mighty rabbit folk hero) and I, too, was terrified of Lendri (badger) and Pfeffa (cat) and I, too, was mystified about the white burning sticks.Happily, I decided to read this book again with my online 1001 Children's Books You Must Read group.And, happily, the book held up. Delightful."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is amazing because people of every age can undertand it and yet it has many layers and levels.

In writing about rabbits you soon see the author bringing out the parallel to humans. Writers are always comparing people to wolves or lions or other predatory mammals. As Adams points out in this adventure tale, we are much more like rabbits. Brave rabbits, but still rabbits. Which, when you consider how ill equipped we are by Nature to defend ourselves (except with our minds), the rabbit comparison is much more apt.Adams does a good job and I can see why this book is becoming a classic.GvG"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Reading it as an adult is definitely a totally different experience then reading it as a young child.

I HATE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was REALLY looking forward to this one. When I was a kid a friend of my mom's gave her a copy of this book. I remember wanting to read it because I respected the friend giving the book. Then Sawyer was Boone's reading copy on LOST. That gave it more weight. \\"Obviously, this is a fantastic piece of literature,\\" I thought. Sadly, I did not find that to be the case. There must be something wrong with me for not liking it. Maybe I expected too much. I was hoping for something a kin to Animal Farm, which this book is not. I'm very disappointed."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down looks really good from the outside but was really boring and intolerable! I an only in sixth grade but I have read The Jungle, Animal Farm, The Accidental Tourist (I know I didn't spell that right , but I did read it!) and many more books like Moo, How Stella got her groove back and many more, but I could not stand this book! If you are looking for adventure, it is not in this book! If you are looking for cute and happy bunny books, this is not one. My teacher who used to be a principal said he would never in his right mind even think of reading this book. Warning: This book Is 494 pages of &quot;Blackberry came from the meadow with cowslips and two female rabbits to mate with.&quot; Oh man, this book should be banned from the planet! It's not an aligory like it looks either!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Full of your average bag of teenage book antics (i.e. The Outsiders, The Chocolate War). Yes, they were pretty good, emphasis on the pretty, but they lacked in depth. I had a hoot reading all the reviews of this book-yes, I read all 100+. Seems to me that Amazon should start reading the reviews more carefully, this site is turning into a message board where everything personal comes in. What sensible book buyer wants to hear for the 100th time &quot;The best book I have ever read&quot;?Another point: sadly I'll have to admit the bunny theme was rather lame. This is a book that only reaches out to younger children, and are still loved by those same children in about 50 more years. This isn't the type of book written with enough action and plot to make the average adult want to read a book about rabbits.I wouldn't call this &quot;the best book in the world&quot; or &quot;my favorite book of all time&quot;, the writing level was too simple...same on the level of Beauty by Robin Mckinley...even Green Eggs &amp; Ham had more meaning and thoughts to it.Overall, I am saying that elementry kids may enjoy this childish and lowly book, but readers who are up to more challenges should find another book more difficult, if not more engaging. Some George Eliot and Thomas Hardy should do the trick!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am a teenager and I read the whole book, I found it a total let down. So many people had said that it was a wonderful book. However I found it increadible boring and confusing. The author made up words so that you couldn't follow what the rabbits were saying, the only nice thing that I can say about it is the irony of the book and the little action that is in it. Also the rabbits are incredibly stupid, it isn't until they get to there destination before they figure out that they are a bucks and that they need to mate to keep their warren going. I would advise anyone to not buy this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"bunnies talk, walk, sleep, eat, and die. Wow...uh huh....that sounds fun. COME ON!!!!! IT WAS BORING!!!!!

I know it will pick me up and brighten this somewhat dismal world that sometimes comes down the road.Watership Down is the allegorical story of a warren of rabbits who have to flee because their country domain is being destroyed by modern man and technology. It is the story of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest of their friends and family as they try to find a new living space in this sometimes cruel world. They have their own bunny language, their own epic heroes, and their own lives which every reader can equate to his or her own self.I thought this is one of Adam's best works, and I found in it much suspense as the rabbits make their way across the English countryside with just enough pauses for me to catch my breath and continue on. After all, these are rabbits.In this sometimes cold and callous world, we need more bunnies."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I first heard of this book, I thought the name was odd and the fact that it was about rabbits really turned me off to the book. It took me a few years to really want to read it, cause like most people I didn't want to read about cute little bunnies, that's just boring. One day while wandering through the children's section at borders (they hold a lot of good classics that are easy to understand) I came across the movie Water Ship Down. I read the back to see what it really was about, turns out its not about cute little bunnies. What this book really is about is what life is like from the point of view of a rabbit. And just like human lives things are not always pretty. I found that this book was very interesting, but I would suggest that you have an open mind about things. If you do then this book will take you in to the lives of a very mysterious creature."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"i love books like this. books that use personification of animals. definately the most gripping book. you gasp when one of the rabbits of the warren on Watership Down gets hurt. the author writes it so well that it makess you feel like you're in the world of the rabbits. also check out the REDWALL series."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Well it appears to me that this book is either loved or hated by many.This book has an abviouse following of fans (incliuding myself).This book must not be overlooked! Richard Adams is a good novelist with a lot of discription. To all who think reading about a flower for half a page is rubish becouse of how discriptive it is I suggest that you learn your abc's again becouse you read as slow as a sloth but lets not forget about your super short attention span.For the people confused about the freaking lapine luanguage i suggest you read the FINE PRINT at the bottom of the page to explain to you about the luanguage ,just a suggestion! Im not completly sure how many novels stay on the bestseller list for how long but I dont think they stay on very long. Watership Down went on 14 days after print and stayed on for more than a year. I do believe their are better books out their that I havent gotten to yet (i hope i bump into em!)but ill settle for this one and and the Lord of the Rings.I would say i am trying to get my hands on The Roads Less Traveld by M Peck wich was on the bestseller list for 694 weeks. Sounds good to me! In all for you mindless fools out their please I warn you Glue is for building things not sniffing. This book along with other R A books cannot be missed if their is a better book out their I hope I find it! for over a 2 years I have yet to find one!

I believe she read it several times as we were engaged in the haphazard pursuit of arriving at maturity and adulthood. I see it's rated nearly 5 stars based on close to 1,000 votes. And yet here I am, making it known to all and sundry that I just never saw the appeal of this book. I tried to read it several times--once out of curiosity, once because of a vague and mistaken impression I had to if I wanted to be 'well-read', and at least twice in my teens because I thought it would show common interests with girls I hoped to impress. I failed utterly on each occasion, flinging myself from the ramparts to escape the relentless patter of furry feet bent on prosecuting their War of Tedium.It's difficult to analyze this dislike. I enjoy fantasy and sci-fi; it's not as though I find sentient rabbits a very big leap from hobbits and Stormtroopers. Or very big hop, if you will. It's well written in the sense that the words he chooses are pleasantly deployed and harmonious, I just can't march to the tune he's calling. This may well be a love it or hate it kind of book, so the curious reader will have to decide whether or no to gamble. I apologize, sometimes that's just the best I can do. I rated it three stars in recognition of it's fans' abiding love as reflected by the votes here on Amazon, though obviously I enjoyed it from more of what may be called a one star perspective.

There aren't many books which completely capture you as does &quot;Watership Down&quot; with the tales of Hazel, Bigwig and Fiver plus the interspersed stories of such as the black rabit of Inle. You get absorbed by the politics of the Owsla and the terror faced in the warren run by the general. Such a beautiful book, exceptional, are words that come to mind. Its so easy to be living their story and the death of Hazel is unbearably sad.Truly, one of the very best."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have to say that I was disappointed when I finally read this book.

(Plus, don't get a rabbit without contacting your local House Rabbit Resource Network!) These are deceptively clever creatures with a strangely simple yet complex way of viewing life. I had no experience with rabbits before I met my friend with the bunnies and have come to understand and honor the lapine world. I helped her care for her ailing Rex until his final days, and I saw every kind of rabbit behavior you could think of. I was even honored by her female rabbit (Hazel!) by being allowed to see the &quot;happy dance,&quot; which defies description, but is an expression of rabbit joy that looks like ariel ballet.The passages where the rabbits forget what has happened in the past five minutes, even though it was harrowing or extremely unusual, is dead on. They are not stupid creatures by any means, but they do not hold memory like cats and dogs. I have seen this very thing and many others, and no one nails it like Richard Adams.Also a gorgeous tale of leadership, loyalty, and trust. The last two pages are simple and beautiful. Hail, Hazel-rah!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I don't understand why people are saying teenagers won't like this book. I'm thirteen and this just so happens to be my absolute favorite book of all time. There's so much adventure, mixed in with intriguing mythology, spine-tingling horror, and even some humor sprinkled in, that this book is impossible to resist.It starts when a group of rabbits are forced to leave their home before it is destroyed by housing developers, and from there the adventure doesn't let up. They encounter everything from a big scary seagull to two other nightmarish warrens, and all the while we learn more and more about rabbit mythology and how they live. There are one or two slow parts in the beginning, but once you get past those you'll be in for the ride of your life.I was SO disappointed to finish this book. I've read tons of good animal fantasy books, but nothing holds a candle to this one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down easily became one of my favorite novels. Its fascinating plot and beguiling characters could hook any reader, teenagers and adults alike. Richard Adams, the author, has an extremely incredible imagination. Throughout most of the story, I was on the edge of my seat, waiting to turn the page to see what befell Hazel and his followers next. At first glance, one might think that this novel is just a childish story about talking rabbits, but it's so much more. It reflects human life and character. Watership Down is tale of rabbits that leave their warren, in fear that a prophecy that their home will be destroyed is true. These rabbits, lead by Hazel-rah, encounter many hindrances and dangers in their search for a perfect warren. When Hazel's group finally finds this ideal home, they are faced with many harsh realities, including a full-fledged war with another warren. Watership Down has a little bit of everything in it: suspense, action, drama, even comedy. The list is endless! It imposes strong values of loyalty, friendship, determination, leadership, and standing up for what's right. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read, in my opinion, one of the most enchanting novels ever written. Once you read this book, you will never look at rabbits the same way again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER. I READ IT AT LEAST 5 TIMES (I LOST TRACK).

It had been one of her favorite books, but I had never read it. As soon as I started, I didn't want to put it down. The characters and story are terrific. It instantly became one of my favorite books. I've read a number of books since that I've also enjoyed, but none more so than Watership Down. I realize it is often considered a book for children or teenagers, but I don't think there are many people of any age that wouldn't enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is the story of a party of young travelers who flee their doomed homeland, seeking to establish a new home for themselves. The characters, are, as you've probabally heard by now, wild rabbits, but unlike most novels about animals, this one avoids the traps of sentimentality and anthropomorphism. The rabbits are taken seriously as characters - they have a well-developed culture and mythology and a distinctly lapine psychology. Mr. Adams did his homework for this one, and the result is a very interesting blend of rabbit lore and human athropology - some of the best parts of the book are the stories the rabbits tell of their culture hero El-ahrairah. No twee, Redwall-esque bunnies here, no sir.This book is one of my favorites; I read it once every couple of years, and it never looses it's charm. Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I finished reading this book today. I simply loved it! It is a book for all ages. A rabbit named Fiver predicts the downfall of his warren, and he and his brother gather followers and try to make their way to the downs so they may start a new warren. It was a wonderful fanasty-adventure story,a real page-turner. One of the things I liked about this story was that there was no hero; all the rabbits had an ability and helped the warren.

It is the story of a groups of rabbits, one of whom predicts danger for the warren. With his brother and everyone they can get to come, they trek across the english countryside looking for a new home, encountering many problems and trouble along the way. Some have called it a political allegory, and although the author Richard Adams has denied this, allusions can definetly be made to fascism and communism. A well developed book, with a structered plot leading up to a brilliant climax, I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"To all those who didn't understand it, I read this book when I was in second grade and loved it! It is my second favorite book, after The Godfather, even after six years (I'm in eighth now) of reading hundreds of books. I was not forced to read it, I did on my own and I'm glad I did. The story is so wonderful on so many levels. I've read it at least three times and look forward to reading it many more times in years to come. Try it again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Libby Springmeyer W131The novel Watership Down is an excellent tale about a group of rabbits' adventures in finding a new homeland for themselves. It sets examples of courage, strength, trust, and hope. Originally, the rabbits already had place of their own in which they lived. One of them had a bad feeling that something terrible was going to happen if they stayed. He was able to convince only a few others that they had to leave the warren soon to find a safer place to live. Going against the others, against all odds, they set forth on their journey. Once they left their homeland, they ran into numerous obstacles that stood in their way. The rabbits were confronted with many dangerous events such as; crossing rivers, roads, escaping from predators, and venturing through deep woods, all in hopes to find a safe new place to live. At one point in their adventures, they were welcomed into a warren already occupied by other rabbits, but had decided to continue on to find a warren of there own. Eventually, the rabbits found a place they had been dreaming of. A wonderful place called Watership Down, found at the very top of a large hill. The rabbits loved it there; they were able to look out over the entire valley. Although they had found their paradise, something seemed to be missing. They were lacking doe rabbits in which they would need to reproduce, and keep their clan alive. Once again, they set forth on yet another journey to gather some does to bring back to their warren. The rabbits were able to locate some does in a hutch at a nearby farm, but were unsuccessful in the attempt to free them. In fact, Hazel, the main character, was nearly killed in doing so. They had to look for does somewhere else. It wasn't long before they stumbled upon a warren; they would soon come to learn it was a very bad place. The ruler of the warren was the evil General Woundworth. This would be the most difficult challenge the rabbits had to encounter in all their adventures. A plan was made to gather some of the does from the warren. Bigwig, the leader, falsely joined into General Woundworth's clan in hope of persuading some of them to run away with him. After a well drawn out plan, and the extremely difficult defeat of the General and his captions, they were at last able to help some of the rabbits in the warren escape to find their freedom. The most interesting thing about this story is the way the rabbits look at death. They believe in the Black Rabbit of Inle, which is \\"fear and everlasting darkness.\\" The black rabbit will come and get you when it is your time to go with him, when it is your time to die. It is said that \\"he will come in the night and call a rabbit by name.\\" When one goes with him, they will have no more pain, be rid of all their weaknesses, they will be free. This black rabbit is thought to be working with the Lord Frith, which is their lord. They work together to bring about what was meant to be. Both the Black Rabbit and their Lord Frith were spoken of continuously in the story, which shows concern for death, and their belief in the heavens. At the end of the story the black rabbit sets an example of what happens to a rabbit when he come to take Hazel with him. He is finally set free."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"&quot;Watership Down&quot; is such a great book. It is simply a classic.

I personally think that the use of language is interesting and the names of the characters go along with their personality and style. I enjoyed the stories within this story which made it feel as if I were there. It has a great ending (which I won't spoil!) and is great for any age."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I asked the teacher that reccomended this book to me why it wasn't given any awards, like Newberry, she told me &quot;Because it's not a children's book.&quot; That statement is definitely arguable - it depends on the child that reads it and varies from person to person...but I admit a lot of kids would be over their heads.And if you're not a kid? Then you might find the plot of migrating rabits with their own vocabulary ludicrous. But this is a fascinating look into the world seen by the animals we so often take for granted. 5+ to Adams for a spectacular book - every time I see a rabbit I think of Watership Down.If you're planning to buy this book, DO NOT get the paperback. The binding literally falls apart after one reading, ownning to how long it is."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a classic children's tale, but I swear that few stories are as compelling for adults as well.

I love this book . . . the story is exciting, the rabbits have distinct and wonderfully drawn out personalities, there are moments that made me laugh out loud and moments that broke my heart, and it ends perfectly. A wonderful classic!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This strikes me as definitiely a \\"book of its time\\". First published in 1972 (after being rejected by 13, count 'em, 13 publishers), it is written on a \\"young adult\\" reader level and is basically a formalized cobbling together of stories the author told his children on tedious car trips. Each chapter is preceded by a literary quote, which after the first 20 or so becomes a bit precious and eventually pretentious. Obviously, it has quite a following, but it seems to me to fall into the same category as books as diverse as \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\", \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", or perhaps less complimentary, \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (which itself was published 2 years before this). All have their fans, most of whom first read their book at an impressionable age, and who seem more passionate than the material objectively deserves, because the story has some resonance for those readers. Those fans all find some sort of inspiration, or really self-confirmation, and tend to get irate if YOU don't \\"get it\\" too. Frankly, it struck me as an overly-twee cross between \\"The Hobbit\\" and Beatrix Potter. (And please, I *did* enjoy \\"The Wind in the Willows\\".) The female rabbits (\\"does\\") are essentially non-existant in the first third of the book, and are much-sought-after non-entities in the rest, useful only for perpetuating rabbithood (didn't know THAT was a problem....) The \\"lupine dictionary\\" ought to be a litmus test for potential readers: if this strikes you as charming, or clever, or creative, give the book a try. If you think that is just a mite affectatious, and have a hard time with rabbits having \\"names\\" like Hazel, Buckthorn, Pipkin, and Dandelion, I think you'll be happier with a \\"pass\\"."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Why is everyone so obsessed with this book? Let's see, it's nearly five hundred pages and covers the quest of - I lost count- some rabbits hoping to establish a new warren. Okay, sounds bearable, right? It takes 120 pages just to get to that point. They go through all these trials and tribulations while setting up and getting situated, on and on and on. By the time I reached the end, (it took some serious self-motivation,) I felt confused. After all the hype, all the wonderful things everyone says, this book is a sham. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they had read every other book in the world and were desperate for reading material. (like me) This is the most dissappointing book I think I've ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"People nowadays use the words 'masterpiece' and 'classic' maybe a little too much. There are only a few fiction books I really love among all the ones I have read; this is not one of them.People have said ther is suspense in this book, but bewarned its only at the very verye end. In the beginning I was almost put to sleep by the rabbits and their endless journeys. I enjoy intellectually mature books- even long descriptive books (e.g. Tolkien, Les Miserables)- but I couldn't get myself involved in this story to much of any degree. It just required too much energy to stay focused on this book because it didn't offer up anything interesting. The rabbits just kept going from place to place to place looking for a warren.If you have to read this for summer reading, be prepared for a long mundane tale. otherwise, just skip it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I suppose my threshold for silliness for books with talking animals (particularly bunnies) is \\"The Wind in the Willows.\\" Anything more sophisticated than that is preposterous, I think.Nevertheless, this aims to go several degrees more sophisticated than that. It succeeds in parts, but on the whole, it's hard to take it seriously unless you're a pre-teen girl. But if you are, good luck with the language.Now, maybe I just waited too long to read this. I had wanted to ever since I was a kid but never got around to it until middle age. Sure, I've seen the cartoon on which it was based years ago, but didn't think much of it. I was assured by those who had read it, however, that the book was much better (and deeper!). I guess I'm glad I didn't read this as a teenager: I think I would have given up after a few chapters. For a book with a bunch of talking animals, it contains an unreasonably high level of prose.There's another reason it was hard to get into: I've lived in cities all my life, so much so that I've never even seen a wooden fence, much less a cow. (I think maybe once I saw a squirrel.) Sad, I know; but the point is, much of the bucolic terms were completely flat to me: marjoram? meadowsweet? thistle bloom? kingcups? watercress? It's like you need a PhD in Botany to understand what's going on. (The cynic in me suspects the author doesn't know either, and was simply writing with Newcomb's Wildflower Guide propped open next to the typewriter.)There are points in the book's favor: the action is swift and things are helped along by short chapters. But Adams's characterization must be accounted a minus: there's plenty of rabbits along for the exodus, but it's hard to tell them apart.Worse, though, is the sustained pretension of Lapine, the language of Adams's bunnies. Why not just \\"translate\\" everything into English? At one point (p. 15), we're told the rabbits are going to \\"meet again here, fu Inle.\\" What does \\"fun Inle\\" mean? A helpful glossary at the back of the book tells us: it means \\"after moonrise.\\" What did it add to include the original expression? Why couldn't Adams have just written \\"after moonrise\\"? Why is that particular expression rendered in the original Lapine, but not others, such as \\"Is it true?\\" \\"Who is this?\\" and \\"Over the hill\\"?I'll tell you why: because the interlarded Lapine, like so much else in the book, symbolizes the flowery affectation in which the whole thing is steeped."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My family found this book for me at a yard sale for 10 cents. they all told me it was a great book, even my mom, who rarely reads anything but Black Stallion books and Romance novels.

The Redwall series is simply better. It doesn't matter to real readers if a book is a classic or not; it just matters if its good.

On their journey to make a new community they face danger from predators and other rabbits.Shortly after I finished reading \\"Watership Down\\" someone asked me what I thought of it. I did not know how to answer this question. I had been so preoccupied thinking about who are the fathers of two female rabbits' babies in the book to really think about how much I like or dislike the book. After thinking about that question for a while I think I can answer it better.I like how this book taught me a little bit about rabbits as well as entertained me. I did not know that female rabbits were the ones who usually dig burrows. I assumed that all rabbits dig burrows. The author, Richard Adams, based his book on facts and mentions Mr. R. M. Lockley and his book \\" The Private Life of Rabbit\\" in the Acknowledgment of \\"Watership Down\\" and in another part of the book.This book was a nice break from the type of books I usually read, which contain some kind of love story. The rabbits in \\"Watership Down\\" may feel attracted to the opposite sex but there is no romantic love story.Athough I did not stay up reading this book until one o'clock in the morning, reading it did cut into my TV watching time.Overall I do not consider reading this book a waste of my time. If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would since the answer of the question of what I thought of the book could be \\"Ok\\" or \\"I like it\\" depending on who is asking me and my mood at the time. A lot of times I am leaning towed \\"Ok\\" because that question I had about who are fathers of two female rabbits' babies really bothered me for a week or two after I read \\"Watership Down.\\""},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read Watership Down when I started high school some 25 years ago. I read it again every few yearsOne of the great things about the novel is that it can be read on a number of levels based on the readers age and understanding. I appreciated aspects of the novel at age 30 that I missed when I was 15.Watership Down is, first and foremost, an adventure tale about a bunch of rabbits trying to find a new warren and the friendships that develop during the quest. This alone makes it a great tale.Yet, it is also a political novel looking at and exploring the dangers of different types of governments. It is also a novel about faith and mythmaking and the importance of both in life.In short this is a novel that reaches people at many different levels. Most of all it keeps me young."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"\\"Watership Down\\" was Richard Adams' debut novel and was first published in 1972. He originally told it to his children to help pass the time on long car journeys. It won the Guardian Award and the Carnegie Medal in 1973 and is set in Berkshire, where Adams was born in 1920. It is, of course, about rabbits, and was made into an animated film in 1978 - the soundtrack of which featured \\"Bright Eyes\\", by Art Garfunkel.The book opens at Sandleford Warren in May, with Hazel, a yearling, and his brother, Fiver, feeding at sunset. Although brothers, the pair are very different. Fiver was the runt of the litter and, as a result, is a lot smaller and much more nervous than his brother. He is, however, also something of a seer and - not long after the book opens - foresees the destruction of their home warren. The pair bring the prophecy to the Threarah, their chief rabbit - who, despite Fiver's success rate, refuses to accept it. The brothers decide to leave anyhow, and mean to bring whoever wishes to come along with them. A number of others join them, including two Owsla members : Silver, a nephew of the Threarah, and Bigwig. Although they have little idea of where they're going, Fiver knows what they should be looking for and have an excellent leader in Hazel.This book has so much going for it, it's hard to write a review that will do it justice. Bigwig was a great character - an all-action rabbit (yes, really !!) whose name comes from the strange tuft of hair between his ears. However, he's not the only star. Other notable characters include General Woundwort, the leader of another warren and the baddest rabbit in England. (A vicious character, he'd leave your average bunny-boiler with badly burnt fingers and causes our heroes a great deal of trouble). Kehaar, a somewhat foul-mouthed (or is that foul-beaked ?) seagull, provides a certain amount of humour. He also helps the rabbits establish themselves after they arrive at their new home. The story is very engaging and is very well told. Adams explains the way rabbit society is structured, for example, including the role of a Chief Rabbit and his Owsla. As the story progresses, he includes a few words of the rabbits' own language and a few of their myths : these are very much centred on the great rabbit hero, El-ahrairah. An excellent book, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"But Danger, Quests, threat, deciet, dark secrets, folklore woven into a grand, colorful masterpiece.I cannot put into words how much I love this book. the story begins in Sandleford Warren with brothers Fiver and Hazel are going exploring around the area for tasty food such as cowslips, then Fiver sees a sign saying construction will begin soon. He doesn't know what it says, but has a horrid feeling about it... so much he convinces Hazel and a few others to run away from the doomed warren, such as Dandelion, Bigwig, Silver, and others to join them on a quest for a better life. I am going to list some things you might enjoy, if any are appealing to you, READ THE BOOK! If not, STILL READ THE BOOK! Got it? A doomed city, a strange vision, A large hole, a shining wire, a dark secret, hills, a bloodthirsty general, two unnatural warrens (rabbit cities, sort of) A battle, approaching thunder, a rushing river, a wounded gull, and a psycic rabbit.Watership Down is one of those books you'll want to talk about for days on end. Don't let talking rabbits fool you into thinking this is a sissy book- the rabbits get their fair share of blood, gore and torn muscle. If you like folk tales, also, teh stories about El-ahrairah, a rabbit folk hero, will win your attention and admiration with his clever tricks. Youwill be cheering for brilliantly in depth characters Fiver, Hazel, Bigwig, and all the others in their life-risking adventures on watership down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I only came across Richard Adams' \\"Watership Down\\" recently. As a rule I don't buy books without knowing at least a fair amount of information about the plot. However, I found the use of rabbits as the main characters to be an intriguing concept. So I bought it and have just finished. This turned out to be one of the better books I've read.The plot centers around a group of rabbits who leave their warren in search of a safer home, encountering all kinds of danger and adventure in the process. Adams' style of writing is accessible and enjoyable, and he writes in such a way that lets the reader get attached to the characters and care about them, especially Bigwig, Fiver and Hazel. Whereas animals used as the main characters in a book is commonly thought of as a children's story, \\"Watership Down\\" is anything but. This reads like any other adult novel. The tone is serious for the most part but Adams injects some good-natured humor here and there. From time to time he \\"stops\\" the action and explains to the reader why the rabbits are doing certain things, for the purpose of learning about rabbit culture I suppose.One could probably interpret this novel in many ways, depending on how one views it. It has a simple premise but revolves around many complex issues such as survival, courage, facing one's fears and the search for a better home, things which all of us have experienced. I would surely recommend this book. You'll never see rabbits the same way again. I would also recommend the animated film adaptation. Although darker in nature, it's a great adaptation and stays true to the book.P.S. Death to anyone who has ever ordered rabbit at a restaurant."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I can't remember why I ordered \\"Watership Down\\" out of the Scholastic book order catalog when I was in 7th grade back in 1974, but I am forever glad that I did. I'm sure I found the description interesting, and I am sure I was drawn by what sounded to be a more substantial story. Boy was I right.I was utterly gripped by Watership Down, and over the years have read and re-read the book - sometimes re-reading just the El-ahrairah portions.Just great."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You would think that a book about rabbits would be simple and boring, right? WRONG!!!! This book tells the tale of a group of rabbits who are forced to leave their burrow because a farm is going to be built there. It is the exiting, tragic tale of friendship and the terrors of of rural life as seen by a rabbit. What makes it even more believable is that the various dangers, such as snares and train tracks, are described as how they would be by someone or something who finds the idea incomprehensible. This touching tale is more than just that, though. I also think it is a commentary on how nature has been affected by development. A must read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is one of those rare novels that seem to create a world within a few pages. You know what I mean. The books they place high on the shelves as timeless classics, which are read 50 years from now by your grandchildren. It is a masterpiece. I have no reason to embellish, and in truth, doesn&iexcl;t need to. After running through the first chapter, I was hooked. I could very well have sat there and read the whole book from cover to cover. The novel is about a group of rabbits who have decided to leave their current warren to escape a disaster that was about to fall upon their homes. From there on they are thrust into a journey of fear and joy, where they finally discover their true &iexcl;home&iexcl;.The chapters where I had enjoyed this book the most were the parts that included the rabbit&iexcl;s references to man&iexcl;s strangeness. The Lapine try to explain tar-layered roads, cigarettes, boats, bridges, and automobiles from their view. And are usually not far from the truth, I guess the author is trying to show animals are not that different from us. Not only was I attracted to the suspenseful atmosphere of Fiver&iexcl;s forewarnings, I also cheered as Hazel, Bigwig, Blackberry, and the crew finally managed to learn the art of working together. Elation filled me with each scheme the rabbits hatched, and I jumped around with glee at each of their hard-won successes.Richard Adams has created life. He provides the rabbits with their own culture and myths, not to mention their own language! By constantly inserting vocab from the Lapine Glossary in the back, Adams enriches the story&iexcl;s realism and bedazzles the reader. He has created society after society with his seemingly parallels to communism, tyranny, and monarchy. An allegory, Watership Down has been called, and one that is said to reflect his personal views. Personally, I don&iexcl;t care. He has ensnared me with his loyal and intelligent rabbit character crew, and I have no wish to free myself from them."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When this book was assigned to me in English class, I was eager to see what this book was all about. I thought it was a joke. How could someone possibly write a novel consisting of rabbits adventuring around inseek of a new home. As soon as I began reading Watership Down I realized it was more then just a silly book about rabbits, but a heart-warming tale. It taught life lessons and showed the emotions of inferior beings to the world. Though this book is about rabbits it still is a book that should be read by a mature audience. You need to have an understanding of life and why the rabbits react to certain situations. The rabbits were just the chosen characters to present this real-life novel, any character could have been chosen. Don't back down just because they're rabbits, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of those books that leave an indelible impression upon the reader years after reading it. Yet when I re-read it again this past week, I was struck again with fresh wonder at the timelessness of the tale. Watership Down centers upon the extraordinary lives of a motley crew of rabbits. The cast of characters is unforgettable, from the clever and resourceful Hazel, the strong and stouthearted Bigwig, the story-spinning Dandelion, the jocular Bluebell, and the mystical Fiver.The beautifully wrought prose of Richard Adams reads like poetry at times. He makes the fantastic exploits of the rabbits seem utterly believable. He draws you into their world with masterful craftsmanship, and you can almost actually see, hear and smell the sights, sounds and smells that the rabbits do.One delightful feature of Watership Down are the tales of the cunning trickster hero El-ahrairah, who has many adventures with his faithful sidekick Rabscuttle. When Dandelion tells the tales of El-ahrairah, one gets a deeper insight into the world of the rabbits by hearing their mythology.Another tool that Adams uses to draw you into this wondrous world is the creation of rabbit language called 'Lapine'. Rabbit feeding is known as silflay. Moonrise is called fu Inle. Enemies are known as elil. A fox is a homba and more than one fox is hombil. Motorized vehicles, such as cars or trains, are known as hrududu. Paralyzing fear is called 'going tharn'. After a while, reading the Lapine vocabulary becomes almost second nature, but (at least in the hardback version I read) there is a Lapine glossary at the back of the book to help if you forget the meanings of any of the words.I have not seen the animated adaptation of this book, and I'm a little reluctant to do so, as I worry that it will not live up to what I would expect from a book of this caliber. Watership Down is truly a treasure and I highly recommend it to anyone. Despite the fantastic premise of talking animals, the novel exudes an almost tangible sense of realism. It has more realism than a whimsical book such as The Wind in the Willows. There is trickery and treachery, violence and war, and yes even death at times. But the story can still be enjoyed the young of all ages.~Sly"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I don't know what started the rumor about rabbits being cute, fuzzy, sweet, little animals. They're certainly not. Read this book, whch quite closely follows the behaviors of real wild rabbits and you'll find that they're the exact opposite. Watership Down is good from the very beginning, and the whole book is thrilling. It's one that you just can't bring yourself to put down. If you read it once you'll want to read it again. I also reccomend you buy Tales from Watership Down which, although it does focus more on the tales of El-ahrairah, is also good. Please buy this book. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams has skillfully crafted a simple fairy-tale into a wonderfully touching book. On face value, it is easily dismissable, due to the subject matter but the level of depth Adams delves into is amazing.

This astonishing action adventure thrill ride takes you up close with bunnies as they risk there lives many times.

The journey takes them through much discovery, excitement, and danger. All of these change their lives and help them grow smarter and stronger, you might even call them super rabbits midway through the book. Then they have to overcome the mighty warren of Efrafa. These rabbits are super mighty rabbits in their abilities of strength, organization, and take monarchy to a whole new level in terms of rabbits. Of course, this is only one of the many obstacles in their ultimate goal of finding a place for a warren and getting does to mate with to come to it. Well, as you can see this wonderful journey of rabbits trying to make their lives better is an exciting, exceptional, hard to put down book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It took me almost a year to start this book. It was on the classroom bookshelf, but it never interested me that much. Then, one morning, glancing at the bookshelf, I thought \\"Well, it was recommended to Redwall fans\\" even though I was falling out of love with Redwall.I am so glad I picked it up. I was drawn in at the first sentence, and could not stop reading.This book, yes, at first glance, is about talking rabbits. Well, OK, it is about talking rabbits. But it is so much more than that. It is probably the best book I have ever read.It is an adventure story, a collection of legends, a mystery, a horror story, funny, sad, deep, informative, scary. It is all of these in places, and some throughout. The rabbits have their own language and culture, but that doesn't make the story confusing, unless you try to read it aloud and discover that there are probably three hundred different ways of pronouncing Kehaar.So trust me- pick up this book! You'll never regret the choice!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When a small prophetic rabbit foresees a terrible danger in the warren, few believe him. Those few set out on a horrible and wonderful journey to a new home, a home where they will not be disturbed by men. After I started this book, I could not put it down. Watership Down is an excellent blend of action, adventure, and suspense. Although the characters may be fictional, the story is set in a real location in present-day England.This is a wonderful novel and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It's difficult to translate the plot and feel of an epic into a form that younger readers can enjoy, but that's just what Richard Adams has done here.Watership Down tells the story of a group of rabbits who, driven by the forebodings of a psychic bunny named Fiver, decide to abandon their warren and strike out on their own to found a new rabbit community. The group of rabbits sets out on a long and perilous journey, encountering every type of danger imaginable, and must pool their various talents under the leadership of the noble Hazel to survive.Something about these rabbits is so amazingly real that it's impossible not to get wrapped up in their lives. Adams has given them the power of speech and the ability to plan ahead, but they possess severe limitations that make their interactions seem realistic. Along the way, they find other rabbit warrens that have their own way of doing things, and Hazel's little band must find a way to forge a rabbit utopia that avoids the pitfalls of the societies they face.The ending involves climactic battle scenes with General Woundwort, a militaristic dictator who embodies bunny evil.Each of the rabbits in Hazel's group has a distinct personality that goes beyond embodiment of a stereotypical character trait. You will love each of them in turn, and also come to appreciate the culture in which they operate, complete with rabbit-only words and folk tales that resonate with meaning.Watership Down has the intelligence of a literary classic, and the accessibility of a great and moving read. This is the perfect book to transition a young reader from children's books to adult novels, and I wasn't at all surprised to hear that it has become a staple in some classrooms.Great books like this may only come into your reach once in a lifetime. I suggest that you grasp this one, and hold on."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I wasn't required to read this book in high school. I had heard of it, but not necessarily about it, and wasn't interested in reading about a bunch of rabbits. Last year I was scanning my mother-in-law's book shelves looking for something to read, happened upon it and thought. &quot;Why not?&quot;Much to my surprise, I was soon engrossed in the tale of a brave bunch of rabbits fleeing the environmental abuses of man and the elitest attitudes and folly of their fellow warren inhabitants.Without giving away any details, I will say that their encounter with the Efafra warren brought immediately to mind the quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin, &quot;Those who would sacrifice liberty for a little security, deserve neither liberty or security.&quot;It was a very karmic read in these days of the ill-begotten and ill-named PATRIOT Act."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book may not be for adults who have left imagination behind, or for anyone who's mind is in the gutter, but for everyone else it should be an enthralling read. If you go through and read these reviews, they are mostly 5-star ratings. That is because anyone willing to put aside the assumption that &quot;talking bunnies&quot; are all that can be found in this book has discovered that here lies a tale that holds adventure, triumph, struggle and defeat. The fact that the characters created are not human does not take away from the amount you can identify with them, or from the fact that the entire story is actually a metaphor for humankind. There are reviews suggesting that this book is dull, or lacks depth or action. These people may need to examine themselves, for they have obviously been too buried in a television society to grasp even the smallest shred of this story's magnitude. I am 16 and have been in gifted programs my entire life, so I find it hard to believe that the sixth graders giving this book horrific reviews took their eyes off their T.V.s long enough to consider whether or not it could have any meaning beyond &quot;bunnies&quot;. If you want to find out yourself, read this book and just see if you can put it down.P.S: For those that find the &quot;Lapine&quot; language used in this book hard to understand, there is a glossary. Adams' use of this is to make the book more original, which it does. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"In High School I was forced to read much of this novel...and I hated it. It felt grueling and bored the pants off of me...talking rabbits, give me a break.But recently, I felt the urge to give this book another try. I kept passing it over in the library before finally deciding to see what I remember. Three days later I had read it through and have thought about starting it again. Now this is one of my top ten favorite novels.The basic plot (without any spoilers, I hate when reviewers give away the whole bloody story) has to do with a few rabbits, Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and several others who leave their warren because of a horrible preminision seen by Fiver.After traveling the country side and running into some other rabbits with a terrible secret they refuse to speak of, the troop of bunnies make it to a large hill named Watership Down and begin a new warren. After beginning to settle in, something disturbing appears, one of the rabbits that remained behind in their original home warren has shown up unexpectedly with terrible news...I know the whole talking rabbit idea sounds lame, but this truly is a great, entertaning novel, and I think if you give it a shot you may just enjoy it.My advice: Don't Pay Attention to this Book or any other in High School. Every book you are forced to read becomes a hated enemy, Moby-Dick, Shakespeare etc. They all suck in High School, but when you get out, read them on your own for pleasure and you'll see the light."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book many years ago, and hundreds of books later it is still, without equal. It is absolutely my favourite book of all time. Nothing could be more beautifully written or as moving without being sentimental. It is exquisite, a wonderful story, as near to perfect as a novel can be. If you haven't read it, drop everything, including whatever you are currently reading, and read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember seeing the movie when I was a young child and it stayed with me ever since. I remembered certain scenes from the film all my life and it did affect me deeply because 30 years later, I still haven't forgotten watching it nor the title. I realized that I needed to revisit this story for that reason and decided to read the novel before seeing the movie again. I'm so glad I did!!!I absolutely LOVED this book, which I finished in a few days. It is beatiful, sad, funny, epic, and haunting all at once! This may be one of the best books I have ever read and I read A LOT.There are some parts that can get a little over-desriptive and boring but they are few and you will hardly notice. For me, the pace really picked up about halfway through and I couldn't put it down. This is definitely and ADULT themed book IMO since some of the trials and lessons are emotionally heavy.Bottom Line: READ IT!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I make a point to read Watership Down once a year. It brings a sense of peace and hope that nothing else can. Snuggle into an overstuffed chair by a wood fire, a glass of champagne in the dead of winter and let Hazel & Bigwig soothe your soul."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Whenever I am asked to state my favorite book, I always hesitate. I somehow feel I will be betraying all the other books that gave me such solace, joy, mystery, and adventure among their pages, if I don't name one of them as my favorite. That being said, if ever someone should hold a gun to my head and demand that I tell them my favorite book, \\"Watership Down\\" is certainly one I wouldn't mind listing. It is a warm, touching, and deep tale; funny, and yet terribly tense at points. I know that I felt my life was a little richer for having read the book when I finished it, and even if you don't end up feeling precisely the same way, I promise you that this book will not be a waste of your time. Quite the reverse."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is an amazing tale of brave worriers, strong leadership, and cunning trickery. I recommend this story for all people, young or old, fast readers or slow. I myself am a very slow reader, yet the pages seemed to be turning themselves without any notice of the time. Once I finished one chapter, I couldn't wait to find out what happens in the next.It all starts when a young rabbit foresees a cataclysm to come to his warren in the near future. He convinces around ten others, including his brother Hazel, to leave the warren in search of a better place. Every time they settle down, something comes out of the blue and forces them to go on with their assiduous journey. Until at last they find Watership Down, a hill close by another warren. Hazel and his companions made the deadly mistake in thinking that this other warren would be friendly, and they never dreamed of what would happen next.So don't be fooled by the cute rabbit on the cover, for that little bunny has no clue what's in store for him."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is an amazing book. It was a book my mother suggested to me. At first I didn't want to read it but she ended up making me read it. After the first few chapters I couldn't help but get stuck to it. After I got into the feeling of it I read it in a matter of days. This is something that everybody should read at least some time in their life. This looks like a kids book at first glance, but it is truly something you can never get too old for, I believe."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm thirteen, and naturally, when my mom buys me new books she says were some of her favorite stories when she was younger, I'm always a bit skeptical. After all, times have changed as well as writing styles. But when I began to get into this book, it drew me in like no other, not even the Harry Potter books.Of course, I didn't know the greatness of the book when I got it. So naturally I picked it up, read a few chapters, decided I'd read enough and put it down. But after a time of doing this, I suddenly realized, after a week or so of on and off reading (it is summer vacation, after, I don't have to read much), that I really liked this book, and by the last few chapters, my hunger for more of the story got me reading the last quarter of the book with not a single break. I read till at least one in the morning.This book is fantastic! For anyone who has not read it, it is about a band of rabbits, one whom forseas a disaster in their home warren, as they flee the coming disaster to their home and venture out to find a stable place to live in the vast world. They have many adventures together and even tell wonderful stories between themselves about their rabbit hero, El-Ahrairah (I think that's how it's spelled). This truly is masterful storytelling, in a way that leads you near tears when the story has ended, for you become so accustomed to each of the characters by then that the book becomes almost a comfort.I only have one thing to say that you must read, if you didn't care about anything else I wrote: BUY THIS BOOK! I haven't had such a good time reading a story since Harry Potter, and even that I didn't read so intently. Thanks for reading my review"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What comes to our minds when we pick up a book about talking rabbits? Do we expect a fuzzy, juvenile story, or even cartoon-like animals that might have hopped straight out of a Walt Disney studio?If these are our expectations when picking up Richard Adam's Watership Down, we are wide off the mark. It is expressly not a fuzzy story merely intended to delight little children. When it was first published in 1972, Adams and his publisher tried to convince the public that a story about talking rabbits can be serious material, to be read both by children and adults. And they were successful. Today, Watership Down holds a firm place among the British classics that are beloved by people of almost all ages.But before we get to the actual story, a little more needs to be said about Richard Adams. He was born in England in 1920 and studied history in Oxford. After serving in World War II, he joined the Civil Service, from which he retired in 1974. Throughout his life, he had a deep love for English literature, country walking, and the more traditional joys of English culture. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the English countryside plays such an important role in Watership Down, which was the first book he published.Books he published since his retirement from Civil Service include Shardik, The Iron Wolf and Other Stories, and Voyage Through the Anarctic. These, however, have not been as well received by critics as Watership Down.THE STORY\\"THIS IDEALLY SITUATED ESTATE,COMPRISING SIX ACRES OF EXCELLENT BUILDING LAND,IS TO BE DEVELOPED WITH HIGH CLASS MODERN RESIDENCESBY SUTCH AND MARTIN, LIMITED, OF NEWBURY, BERKS.\\"Such reads a notice board that is put up near a rabbits' warren. But since rabbits cannot read human writings, they do not understand that the sign spells the end of their warren. They do, however, have among them a weak, small rabbit called Fiver who has prophetic abilities. Although he cannot put his paw on it, Fiver senses that something terrible is about to happen. He warns the Chief Rabbit of the impending danger, but to no avail. Growing desperate, he and a few companions flee the warren.Thus begins a journey beset with dangers, death, grief, and a struggle for survival. The main characters are the already mentioned Fiver, known for his otherworldly insight; Bigwig, the biggest and strongest of the group; Blackberry, a rabbit with wits and brain power; and Hazel, whose authority makes him the future Chief Rabbit.The first main stop of the rabbits is at another, seemingly prosperous, warren. Once again it is only Fiver who senses that something is terribly wrong with the place. But they find out soon enough: Bigwig gets caught in a rabbit snare set by humans. It is then that the rabbits realize the truth about this peaceful warren: it is maintained by humans for raising and killing rabbits.Bigwig survives and learns his lesson of humility. As of now, he begins listening to Fiver.After overcoming more dangers, the rabbits finally start a new warren on a hill named Watership Down. The only problem is that they have no does among them; their warren will therefore die out within a few years. Spurred on by the desire to produce offspring, the rabbits go in search of does that are willing to join their warren. In this they get help from a seagull, who becomes a very unusual friend of the rabbits.As for the end of the story - well, that you will have to read for yourself.CONCLUSIONMy description above is far from capturing the beauty, depth, and melancholy of the book. For in the experiences, faith, and deeds of the rabbits, we see a reflection of our own lives. As Adams writes: \\"Rabbits (...) are like human beings in many ways. One of these is certainly their staunch ability to withstand disaster and to let the stream of their life carry them along, past reaches of terror and loss. They have a certain quality which it would not be accurate to describe as callousness or indifference. It is, rather, a blessedly circumscribed imagination and an intuitive feeling that Life is Now.\\"- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I like how the book dragged me in, but at first the story was not that interesting. As I started to get into the book I didn't want to put it down, I wanted to find out what happend next. I was stuck to the book. I liked how they had a special language for the rabbits. The use of such rabbit words like ni-frith, siflay and hlao-roo gave the book a unique flavor. The only thing that sort of thing that made me feeling like letting the book down were the El-ahrairah stories told by Dandelion, I just didnt enjoy the certain repetitiveness of the stories of El-arairah, those parts were very, very boring to me. This novel was one of the better novels that I have read in this past year. It had a certain glow to it.My overall impression of this novel was great, although I am not sure that I woukd reccomend this book to many other people. I say this because I dont think that many people would be so drawn to this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Hmmm...I think this book rating system is broken. It only lets me go up to 5 stars...hehe. It's that good.Right now I'm 16 years old, but when I was a 10th grader in High School, I read this book. But unlike many others, I didn't read it because I had to. In fact, it's not even required for reading at my High School. So why did I read it? Pretty much because I was bored and someone recommended it to me...and the fact that I had to find a book to read for a book report. I couldn't think of any novel I wanted to read at the time, but then I remembered being recommended to this book. I went to my local Boarders store and picked it up...but they only had the hardback copy...but I thought 'what the heck' and bought it for an extra 20 bucks. I'm just weird that way.By the time I finished the book, I could pretty much speak lampine fluently (rabbit language). The rabbit language really adds to the tone of everything. Instead of swearing their furry heads off, they would use words like &quot;hraka&quot;, &quot;embleer&quot; and most of all &quot;Frith.&quot; Everthing about it was...just...brilliant! This Adams guy had such an imagination way back when.Unfortunately, this book was one of those books that you can't really describe without alienating people. &quot;Oh, you've got to read this book about intelligent talking rabbits! It's weird but cool!&quot; See what I mean? They'll look at you funny and think you're joking.Watership Down makes you want to BE the characters. In a way connect with them, or follow them where they go, but only through the eyes of your own imagination. When you read this book, you can't be thinking &quot;Man, I can't believe I have to read this huge book by the end of the month.&quot; Doing so destroys the whole intensity of each situation given. Honestly, I thought the entire book was great, but if you are one of those people who want to know when the true action begins, think to yourself, &quot;I can make it to Part 3.&quot; This doesn't mean skip to part three, because you'll be beyond confused. Read the whole book, you WILL love it. Anyone who thinks this book is stupid is probably no smarter themselves, so take my advise and no one elses.One more thing, if you have not yet seen the movie, DON'T WATCH IT!!! Wait until you finish the book and get a picture of what you think each character would look like. When you watch the movie you'll be surprised.*sigh* I just know I'm not mentioning all the great points of the book...So just buy this book, read it, love and cherish it, and recommend it to everyone without using the word &quot;rabbit&quot; or &quot;bunny&quot;!

I think anyone should read this if they have time!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"That's right boys and girls: this is one of the most insightful, thought-provoking adventures in literature to-day. Thru the eyes of the rabbit, we are able to re-evaluate the lives of ourselves as humans and the way in which we choose to live in our world.The story is the adventures of a small group of rabbits forced to leave their comfortably mundane life by the evil human forces that has unfortunately also forced many of us humans to leave our comfortably mundane lives. The rabbits journey through unfamiliar lands, in search of a new home, food, love, and a meaning to their tiny lives, just as all of us do. En route, they are confronted by dangerous farmers, carnivorous predators, and unfriendly rival rabbits. They are also introduced to &quot;bunnies&quot; who are virgin to the ways of the real world, to whom they try to teach the ways of the woods, which every wild rabbit living in the world should know.The characters of the story include those of wit, charm, love, courage, strength, honour, insight, intelligence, humour, and motivation. The brilliant personifications are made that much more enthralling in that they are given all the realistic entrappings of true-to-life rabbits. They rub noses hello; their tails twitch when something bad is approaching, they burrow their homes, they graze on the grass, and they have their own rabbit religion.Perhaps the last is conjectury, but intriguing nonetheless. Yes, the rabbits have their own religion that includes a Jesus rabbit and his disciples. He is the one that so many stories have been told about, since he was the one who was able to connive and manipulate every situation to help his fellow rabbit and always win out against his enemies.Nothing, I can say could further describe the brilliance of Richard Adams' novel and its analogies and insights into the lives of us humans. It is an intricately woven tale, with a creativity which cannot be matched. The only other thing, which i cannot stress enough, is that you read this book. Yes, you can get it from the library, too, but you might as well purchase it, because you will inevitably want to read it again and again, and then give it to your friends to read again and again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of those beautiful books that catches your soul and holds it forever.

That book gave me hours of reading pleasure. The supurb writing style grabs hold of your imagination and takes it on a trip into the world of the rabbits.

Adams gives you a new perspective of this creature and how it views the world around it. (I have never realized the dangers that rabbits may face!) It is intriguing, humorous and exciting - ingredients of a great story. Something is always happening in the story, never giving you boring, slow periods. That is why you can't put the book down, you can't find a place to stop reading! The story also shows the beautiful side of nature - as well as the dark and evil. It has true imagination, descibed and thought out well enough to make this fantasy almost believable. The characters come alive and Adams gives them real personality. They are not merely creatures, they are characters. Real pain, real suffering, and real desperation is shown through words. The traditional &quot;happy ending&quot; is kept, giving you satisfaction at the end.

I am now a 7th grader, and cannot read this book often enough, even if my copy is falling apart. The characters are vivid and have good, likely personalities. The greater majority of them are the type that need leaders, and then, dun dun dun DUN, a leader appears, scared and inspired by the visions of his seer brother. A great book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love this book, Hazel, Fiver (especially) and all of the other rabbits in this book.

People who can't get past the fact it is written from an animals point of view don't see the relatioship to their own lives. It is a great adventure book about the struggles we all face to realize our dreams. The imagery and use of folklore make you believe the rabbits are human and make you care more about their ultimate fate than any book written from a human perspective I've ever read. I will treasure this book always."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school as part of the assigned reading, and quickly was immersed in the craftsmanship of the storytelling. A number of years later, I reread it. How fortunate for me! By telling the story through rabbits, Adams can remove human idiosynchracies that plague many situations. His ingenious development of rabbit mythology and a much used map make it possible for the reader to wholly enter the world of the Watership Down rabbits. The occasional breaks for description of scene are some of the most luxuriant stretches of writing I have seen...very moving."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have read this book 3 times over the past 6 six years and I never tire of the timeless story.

I know a lot of people are saying &quot;Talking bunnies, queer.&quot; To those people I have one thing to say, &quot;Lossen up!&quot; Its a fiction book, it doesn't have to be realistic. I had to read this book for an English Honors class and I must say I'm glad I did.

When I first started reading it, I hated it. I thought it was slow and too detailed. But when I got to the chapter &quot;Stranger in the Field&quot;, my opinion changed entirely. That chapter hooked me and it made me realize the book might be better than expected. You might come to a few dull parts, but don't worry, it will all change. Later in the book there are many exciting adventures, and you realize the detail is interesting, especially because you learn how the rabbits live in a suttle manner, it does not get thrown at you. I hope this helped those who are distressed."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderfull book that keeps you turning the pages.

And I have to say it's an amazing book. You will love Hazel Fiver Bigwig and the rest of the bunch. Don't be folled by the number of pages. I am 12 years old and I read it all. I think it's a great book for any ages. This book also inspired me to write one of the longest Amazon reconmendations I have ever done."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a excellent story of courage, endurance, and frienship personified onto one of natures cutest creatures, the rabbit. I first read this book when I was ten years old, and still the adventures of Hazel, fiver, bigwig, and the rest remain in my memory. In 25 years I have not found a book that shows the extent a creature will go to to survive. This book concerns itself with the tale of how a band of fugitive rabbits leave a doomed warren in search of a new, safe place to live. not only does adams recreate the world through the rabbit's point of view (an example being that a hrududu is a car because of it's sound,) he also creates a set of rabbit fairy tales, which are most interesting. The vivid descriptions and the story itself cause me to place watership down as the finest book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I understand some people thinks this book is bad.These people are people that dosen't know how to understand a good god damn book.You people think little bunnies that talk are silly.Perhaps you are the silly one.This book is a great book with thoughts brought into.Maybe for the dude that only read till pg.3 should give it a try till page.55."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm reading this in a GT reading class, and all we're studying is bunny language. It's hard to ignore the incredible similarity here with communism. I'm not a history nut, so I'm not sure if it symbolizes a war, but it seems like it. Anyway, it's a good book, and it's funny when there are strong political issues, followed by some problem with a tail. Well, you should read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is one that will truly change your perspective on the human race. It is written so that we can see how we really look and behave, but safely through the eyes of our furry friends. This book takes over where Orwell left off in Animal Farm. A brilliant alegory that weaves a tale much more complex than Orwell delivered. Not limted to totlaitarianism, Watership Down runs the gamut from the high of the greates triumph to the lows of mortal defeat. Adams is a classic storyteller with a flare that is rarely seen in today's writers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I must have read this book about a dozen times, at some of the most down periods of my life .... but I get back up again, lost in the sheer exuberance of the cycles of life which Watership Down rises on. Having grown up on the Downs themselves, and seen the recent Avebury road protests nearby, I need the escape from a consumer reality into this social fantasy, which makes sense as a way of living. There may be fighting and vicious warlords, but this is animal Nature, and only Nature, not the willful butchery of human centuries. As the Millenium casts it's shadow over us, let's return to the greatest novel of the century - great in it's simplicity and beliefs ; and after all that's who we really are."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"So, yes, its about a warren of talking bunnies on the move. Chances are if you can't get past the basic idea that the main characters are rabbits and that yes, dialogue indicates that they communicate with one another, then maybe fantasy and all its charms are lost on you.In short, if you can't get past the idea of &quot;talking bunnies&quot; then not only have you missed the point, but you've also picked the wrong book. This isn't a book for those without imagination, and this isn't a book for children or those with a weak stomach.What you SHOULD expect is a thinly disguised political commentary. You would be suprised how much rabbits and human beings have in common when looked at from the right perspective. And that's exactly what Richard Adams trys to do...put it in the proper perspective.The book is about freedom, about forming a little home, or country, of your own, and of living by your own ethical standards. Its also about standing up to tyranny and evil. Heck, I forgot to mention, its a pretty corking piece of adventure with a lot of suspense and some pretty good action. Take the rabbits out and put humans in, and you've got a pretty good Cold War thriller or Revolutionary War story. Leave the bunnies in and you've got a tremendous work of fantasy that also delivers a tremendous commentary on human nature.And its amazing how much we can learn about human nature from a bunch of rabbits.What's up, Doc? Read the book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Every time I read it, I get reconfirmation that it's the best book ever. Not only does it make for a great adventure book, but it's also right on the mark, rabbit-wise. For the last year I've been raising two rabbits as pets. It seems their mannerisms and actions were pulled right from the pages of this novel.Watership Down should be a necessary read before getting a rabbit as a pet. The book makes one realize how important freedom is to a rabbit. Of course, my rabbits aren't entirely free (they're not allowed to leave to go to a movie or anything) but they aren't caged, and get free run of the house, as well as occasional romps outside. From the way they play, and from their leaps of joy, I have a pretty good feeling they're happy living where they are.If you're looking for an incredible book for someone of any age, this is it. And if you know someone who has rabbits as pets, get them this book, please. The knowledge one can get from this book is priceless."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a story for all ages. It has every element that makes a story truly great: action, love, villains and, yes, heroes. It is a beautiful book, elegantly written, and its brief chapters make it very easy to read even if the reader has little time to do so. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is an utterly fabulous book, but the American edition (pictured) has a very slight omission (for some inexplicable, and indeed unforgivable reason), which alters the impact of a certain element of the story. (Omission, for those intereseted, is in the First Book, at end of the &quot;Hard Going&quot; chapter, when the rabbits run down joyously to the field.) So, two tips: 1. Make the effort to read this book, and 2. If you do, for goodness' sake make the effort to read the right one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the best book ever written.Richard Adams is a master of writing. I have read the book15 times and i am only 13.Go Keehar"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love this story. I just finshed it yesterday. It was an assignment from my teacher to finish it by the end of March, and I read it in 4 days. The characters seem real, and I'll never look at rabits the same way. In many ways, it reflects our own socity. There are many Bigwig's and not enough Hazel's and Fiver's. Don't get me wrong, I love Bigwig as much as all the others, but I'm just saying that there are quite a few like him. I can just imagin walking on that path and coming up to the burrow and watching the rabbits.....oh, i wish it exsisted."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have read well over 1,000 books in my lifetime (from all genres), and this one is still my favorite. The characters (mostly rabbits) are interesting and well defined, the plot is excellent, and the storyline flows perfectly. It may appear to the casual observer that this book is childish, but that is not the case. I read the book for the first time when I was 27 and did not lose interest for even one second. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure stories and/or stories where animals are intelligent and are the main characters."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership down starts out well but gets slower and harder to follow near the end. The story is ok but I wouldnt reccomend it"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is without a doubt the best book I've ever read. Anyone who thinks this book is just about a bunch of talking bunnies should try reading it! I promise they won't be disapointed. For fans of Watership Down, I recommend reading the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. The rats of N.I.M.H is also worth a look if you can find it. If you still have doubts, then try to get hold of one of these books yourself and give it a go. You won't regret it! WATERSHIP DOWN RULES!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book was great! I loveed the way Richard Adams told a story about bunnies, of all things! To us, rabbits seem to have no life and no emotions. But after I read the book, I now have a whole new outlook about rabbits and their life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My mother borrowed this book from a friend a couple years back. She never actually read it, so I picked it up and started. It was a little hard to get into, but I got caught up in it. It was full of Adventure, heroism, and happening. It was never at a slow pace, so I never got bored of it. I was nine years old. I still read it. I am twelve now. I took it to school to read in math class one day. The other kids thought it was stupid, a &quot;older kid&quot; reading about talking rabbits, so I lent it to another girl to prove her wrong. She now owns her own copy. I recommend this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The first book I ever read, and still one of the most extraordinary - an epic story of courage and survival against the odds as a wimpy group of lonely male rabbits &quot; having a fairly lean time of it with the does&quot; decide to up camp and set out for fresh pastures. The hawks, cars and tractors encountered en route are nothing compared with the epic bunny war that lies ahead, as our fluffy, bouncing heroes encounter a larger, more militarized group of bunnies (you will be sweating for these rabbits, I swear!) Rather than drawing paralells with our own conflicts in human societies, I simply enjoyed it as a great story, a brilliant evocation of the drama of life in the wild at grass level, and a beautiful statement of the dignity and vulnerability of all animals. You will never look at a rabbit the same way again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The wonderful ideas presented in this book..how can I explain? I have read Watership Down 9 times in 2 years. I am now reading it for the 10th time, and I'm only 13! I am in the process of getting The Private Life of the Rabbit from amazon.com. I can't wait! Anything that Mr. Adams rated so highly must be great! thank you so much, Richard Adams, you have made my life better with your books."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Full of suspense, intrigue, and compassion. The only disappointment I have is that there is no sequel. If your a fan of the Redwall Series, and books with that same idea, you'll fall in love with Watership Down. Once you've started, you will never be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me. After buying everything for my classes I had enough money left over to buy a hard cover copy of \\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams for $6.95, which for people who love books is certainly a great way of representing the ravages of inflation over the years. I decided to read a chapter of \\"Watership Down\\" each night before going to bed, thereby marking the beginning of my obsession with reading a chapter of something each day that has nothing to do with school. When my dorm roommate became as hooked on the story as much as I was he and I would read chapters aloud. Fifty days I got to the book's epilogue with the same sort of sadness that it was all over that I experienced getting to the end of the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.Living in the Sandleford Warren with its Chief Rabbit and Owsla maintaining a comfortable social order, Hazel and his little brother Fiver are content enough. But Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he warns that the warren has to be abandoned right away or they are all going to die, Hazel and a small circle of friends believe him and leave despite the fact that have no idea where they are going. Fiver envisions a great high place where they can be happy and safe, but there are a series of imposing obstacles to overcome, from not only humans and predators, but other wild rabbits as well. Consequently the basic story of \\"Watership Down\\" is the ancient quest for home, although in this case it is a new home that represents a wild rabbit's idea of utopia.The greatness of \\"Watership Down\\" rests on the sense of realism that Adams brings to his story wild rabbits. Adams studied Lapine life in R. M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of the Rabbit\\" in order to keep his rabbits real. But beyond the way rabbits live in nature Adams provides them with a history and a culture, represented not only in the stories they tell of El-ahrairah (the Prince with a Thousand Enemies), but their beliefs in Frith the lord sun, and their simple games such as bob-stones. When confronted with sticky situations they are able to use their ingenuity to come up with surprising solutions that are still within the realm of possibility for real rabbits. I always liked the way Hazel, Blackberry and the others have to work out these puzzles, straining for a leap of intuition and cognitive insight that seems just beyond the reach of their relatively simple minds. So while these rabbits are capable of doing more than others of their kind, Adams keeps their efforts remarkable rather than magical.We also pick up a few choice words from the language of the rabbits (e.g., \\"silflay\\" is to go above ground to feed, \\"homba is a fox), which ends up paying off with one of my favorite moments in the book when Bigway utters a simple but effective curse. The lesson of the story is clearly that bigger does not mean better, for Hazel is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the rabbits that he leads, but he had the best qualities of leadership. Each of the rabbits that join Hazel on the quest to find Watership Down and build a new life there offers something to the ground, and the distinctive personalities that Adams creates for each of them adds to the novel as well.Of all the books that I have that I like to pick up from time to time and read again my favorite parts, \\"Watership Down\\" is the oldest. As a children's story is it simply one that is too good for most children, but without the deep allegorical elements that afflict so many other great children's stories. Perhaps that is why this novel has become so beloved, because it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody. Having read the book again from start to finish, I was not surprised to find that it is still as good as I thought it was when I first read it many years ago."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It is heartwarming (in the extreme for me) to see so many glowing and informative reviews about this incredible book.I read Watership Down when I was in junior high and remembered liking it very much. Then life got busy and I pretty much forgot about it. But occasionally I'd see it on the bookshelves at my local library or bookstore and an itch would start in the back of my mind, telling me that I should revisit its magical pages. So this Winter, I did . . .How wonderful it is to visit such a fully realized world created by the human mind, but set in an anthropomorphic background (and foreground, too!).The story is about a band of rabbits---Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, Dandelion, and Bluebell---who set off from their comfy holes to find a new rabbit warren on the plains of Watership Down. They leave their original warren because Fiver (a small, brooding rabbit with 'The Sight') has a vision of it being destroyed. Not surprisingly, soon after they leave, they find out that the warren HAD been destroyed by big hrududil (tractors) that dug up the ground and killed all those who remained behind.The trials and tribulations of Hazel and his band of rogue rabbits carries the story along at a leisurely pace, not rushing to get the story out, giving rabbit history and mythology a few well-deserved pages, too.After Hazel and his fellow bunnies set up their new warren on Watership Down, though, they find that they have a serious problem: no does (females)! Without does, their new warren is doomed to failure, so they set about trying to locate some breeding stock. But what they encounter is a terrible warren known as Efrafa run by the overbearing and callous General Woundwort. The battle between Watership Down and Efrafa is terrible and exciting reading, even for adults.One other thing that struck me about reading this book (even years later) is that there are so many things discussed in it of an adult nature; rabbit miscarriages, battles, sexual connotations, death and dying, all are covered within these simple pages. And it's done so effortlessly (thank you Mr. Adams), the story's flow is NEVER interrupted.This book was first published in 1972 (a limited release no less) in England; the publisher wasn't sure if it would be well received since it really wasn't a children's tale, nor adult literature. Thank GOD they took a chance on it. If they hadn't, we would surely have been denied a true literary classic.A+ rating."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A lot of reviewers, teachers, and other people that like to make themselves sound intellectually mature, would tell you that in order to enjoy Watership Down, or any other book for that matter, is to read deep meanings in to every aspect of the book. Please, do yourself a favor and don't torture yourself in this way. Although it has all the characteristics of a great book, a modern day classic even, and could be full of sybolism and irony, I feel that it is best enjoyed by taking it for what it is: A great story about a group of rabbit's adventure, failure, success, self-discovery, and their long, journey. The story is set in the English countryside, with great descriptions of the surroundings as well as the rabbits and their lifestyle. It is told from a rabbits point of view, but one that knows human behavior as well, and somehow Adams makes the whole thing realistic. The book is about a group of rabbits that decide to leave their home warren after Fiver, a sort of psychic rabbit, tells them that danger is on the way. And so they begin a voyage that will change their lives forever. Along the way theyt encounter an evil warren, crows, a fox, rivers, a rabbit farm, and countless other dangers. Their final destination is a sort of &quot;rabbit heaven,&quot; a beautiful, safe, secure piece of l;and known as Watership Down. Also included in the book is a whole new language that Adams somehow brings the reader to understand, and tales of how Frith, the sun god, was so impressed with El-Arairah (a folk hero) that he granted him wonderful boons. When I was first told of the book I thought it would be a cute, kids book. I was completely wrong. This is a mature book that would probably be best suited for middle-school students through adults. I would recommend this book to anyone that isn't afraid to spend a little time, and become fully engrossed in a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book back in 1990 (at the age of 15) when I checked it out of the high-school library. Honestly, I had no idea how &quot;talking rabbits&quot; would keep me occupied over a long-weekend; but, coming off a one-month, up-til 2am every night reading adventure of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, I was ready to accept another recommendation from my English teacher. It's so unbelieveable how one person can actually produce such loveable characters and include them in such a detailed manner that actually makes you feel various emotions for each of them... From the hard-headed Bigwig, to the future-seeing Fiver and his wise older brother Hazel, this book offers characters that draw you into the book and do not let you even dare to take a break. Although the wonderful detail of the characters probably won't motivate you to volunteer for any &quot;save the rabbits&quot; organization, it might have you maneuvering your &quot;hdrudru&quot; down any given rural road in a more cautious manner during non-sunshine hours. And let's face it, how many of us love the book because it truly allows us to relate EVERYTHING to human life... The word &quot;tharn&quot; seems to be the favorite. The book is such a masterpiece that it's hard to believe anyone could pan it. There are a few flaws... the most annoying being that the name &quot;Hazel&quot; just doesn't seem to ring as a male. Throughout the book, I had to remind myself that Hazel was a male rabbit, and it was extremely annoying. Still, I can't justify giving this book any rating less than the best possible. The various sub-stories are so interesting and rich in detail that you'll probably find yourself reflecting back on your own life's journeys/adventures and putting yourself in the place of various characters in the story. Just when you've shed a tear of amusement for one of the characters, the book will quickly take you back to the &quot;present-time&quot; situation... you will actually feel a sense of security and warmness, then realize that although you were distracted along with the characters in the story, the situation still exists. It rarely gets better than this."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me and will once again astound my own college aged children as to what life was like in the last century.

The most dangerous elil, of course, is man.This is a wonderful novel that discusses the nature of leadership, teamwork, individual achievement, and struggle, as the protagonists seek to set up a new colony free of dangers from man as well as \\"elil\\" and even other hostile rabbits. Their leader, Hazel, is neither the strongest (Bigwig is that) or the cleverest (Blackberry is that) but nevertheless we come to see why he is the emergent leader to whom the others look for guidance and inspiration. This is a fine study in leadership.The novel never loses sight of its main objective, which is to entertain. This is a fascinating, well-written tale. The storyline moves at a brisk pace, punctuated with interesting episodes of struggle and insight, which always add to, rather than distract from, the main plot. The reader will come to care deeply about the various individual characters of the novel, cheer them in success and root for them in adversity. Adams' prose is superb. This book is a pleasure to read.This is a novel that adults will appreciate and young readers will love. It is indeed written at an adult level, but Adams' writing is so clear and crisp that younger readers will also appreciate and enjoy the novel. This is a timeless and classic novel that belongs in one's personal library and which most readers will enjoy reading repeatedly from time to time, and share with the younger readers in the family."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At the age of 9, this was the first novel I ever read, and as a result it became the yardstick by which I judge all other novels. Simply put, it is side by side with &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; as my all time favorite. I have never since read a more vividly imagined work than this world of rabbits in the English countryside. Straightforward Hazel, brash Bigwig and frail but visionary Fiver lead their ragtag band of outcast rabbits from their doomed home warren through an unbelievable series of situations and adventures. The blood in this book did not bother me even in the third grade, as it was not gratuitous or meant to shock, but rather to illustrate that the rabbit, a creature that we all tend to view as cuddly, is a part of the sometimes violent world of nature. Life is hard for even the cutest, most appealing of animals in the wild, whose every moment is taken up with struggle for survival. I doubt that anyone who has read &quot;Watership Down&quot; has ever looked at rabbits the same again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me. After buying everything for my classes I had enough money left over to buy a hard cover copy of \\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams for $6.95, which for people who love books is certainly a great way of representing the ravages of inflation over the years. I decided to read a chapter of \\"Watership Down\\" each night before going to bed, thereby marking the beginning of my obsession with reading a chapter of something each day that has nothing to do with school. When my dorm roommate became as hooked on the story as much as I was he and I would read chapters aloud. Fifty days I got to the book's epilogue with the same sort of sadness that it was all over that I experienced getting to the end of the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.Living in the Sandleford Warren with its Chief Rabbit and Owsla maintaining a comfortable social order, Hazel and his little brother Fiver are content enough. But Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he warns that the warren has to be abandoned right away or they are all going to die, Hazel and a small circle of friends believe him and leave despite the fact that have no idea where they are going. Fiver envisions a great high place where they can be happy and safe, but there are a series of imposing obstacles to overcome, from not only humans and predators, but other wild rabbits as well. Consequently the basic story of \\"Watership Down\\" is the ancient quest for home, although in this case it is a new home that represents a wild rabbit's idea of utopia.The greatness of \\"Watership Down\\" rests on the sense of realism that Adams brings to his story wild rabbits. Adams studied Lapine life in R. M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of the Rabbit\\" in order to keep his rabbits real. But beyond the way rabbits live in nature Adams provides them with a history and a culture, represented not only in the stories they tell of El-ahrairah (the Prince with a Thousand Enemies), but their beliefs in Frith the lord sun, and their simple games such as bob-stones. When confronted with sticky situations they are able to use their ingenuity to come up with surprising solutions that are still within the realm of possibility for real rabbits. I always liked the way Hazel, Blackberry and the others have to work out these puzzles, straining for a leap of intuition and cognitive insight that seems just beyond the reach of their relatively simple minds. So while these rabbits are capable of doing more than others of their kind, Adams keeps their efforts remarkable rather than magical.We also pick up a few choice words from the language of the rabbits (e.g., \\"silflay\\" is to go above ground to feed, \\"homba is a fox), which ends up paying off with one of my favorite moments in the book when Bigway utters a simple but effective curse. The lesson of the story is clearly that bigger does not mean better, for Hazel is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the rabbits that he leads, but he had the best qualities of leadership. Each of the rabbits that join Hazel on the quest to find Watership Down and build a new life there offers something to the ground, and the distinctive personalities that Adams creates for each of them adds to the novel as well.Of all the books that I have that I like to pick up from time to time and read again my favorite parts, \\"Watership Down\\" is the oldest. As a children's story is it simply one that is too good for most children, but without the deep allegorical elements that afflict so many other great children's stories. Perhaps that is why this novel has become so beloved, because it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody. Having read the book again from start to finish, I was not surprised to find that it is still as good as I thought it was when I first read it many years ago."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I stumble across a book or movie that I enjoy, I'll often come here and check out what other people have to say about it. Reading the one-star reviews often opens me up to the faults of the book or the movie, which I usually tend to block out while I'm reading or watching it. I must say that for Watership Down, that is not the case. Of course, Watership Down is not perfect (no book is), but I must admit I find some of the reasons given by one-star reviewers for their dislike (and, in some cases, even outright hatred) of this book dubious, to say the least.One reviewer harped that the book was unrealistic because it had talking rabbits. Um, that's probably why it's FICTION.Another reviewer complained that those who liked this book were insulting the opinions of those who didn't. I intend to insult no one with this review (and, if by some chance I do, I apologize), and I'm sure that the offenses several of the people who gave this book high ratings were inadvertent (though I'm positive the majority were intended, and I am sorry for that), but a lot of the one-star reviewers weren't exactly polite. I, for one, take offense at being called a weirdo, a person with no life, someone with a simple mind, a person who likes rabbits way \\"to\\" much, and an \\"intence\\" animal-lover, among other insults. For the information of all those concerned, I do happen to like animals very much, but why anyone would say this book is only for animal-lovers is beyond me. Rabbits tearing each other to shreds doesn't exactly sound like PETA's cup of tea.One reviewer said he gave up on the book because he read to page seven and nothing had happened yet. Uh, I don't know about you, but when I'm on page SEVEN in a book almost FIVE HUNDRED pages long, I don't exactly expect to be on the edge of my seat.A very common complaint about Watership Down was that it was boring and there were too many descriptions. As I recall, one reviewer claimed that descriptions of the grass the rabbits were eating lasted ten pages. Quite obviously, this is an exaggeration. Personally, I never noticed a description longer than half a page. If you want to read a book saturated with seemingly endless descriptions of the landscape, read The Lord of the Rings. While I love the story, I have never been able to finish the book.One reviewer claimed that Watership Down was \\"long and all about talking rabbits using words only an english professor would know.\\" On the contrary, I didn't find too many so-called \\"big words\\" in there, and my vocabulary is modest at best. Just a difference of opinion, I guess.Another thing I noticed about the one-star reviews is that the majority of them appear to be by children who were forced to read the book and found it \\"boring.\\" I find this unfortunate, because if these kids had been allowed to wait until their reading comprehension skills were developed well enough to tackle Watership Down, many of them might have enjoyed it.Finally, the one complaint that really irked me was that the reviewer couldn't \\"believe the author wasted so much time writing this book!\\" It calls to mind a reviewer of The Lord of the Rings who claimed Tolkien had way too much time on his hands and insinuated that he was a loser for laboring so long to create the imaginary people, places, and languages of Middle-earth. Please, people, tell us as many faults as you can find with the book, but don't insult the author. I, for one, am quite glad that Mr. Adams \\"wasted so much time\\" writing this book. I guess that makes me an \\"intence animal lover who has no life\\" and \\"likes rabbits way to much.\\"Of course, all of the above has been my very humble opinion. Again, I did not intend to insult anyone with this review (which turned out to be not so much a review as a rebuttal). I respect the opinions of all those who did not like Watership Down, even those opinions which were expressed in an insulting manner. Please forgive anything I may have said that may have suggested I held some negative view of your opinion. I don't want to be responsible for damaging your ego, or causing any harm to your mental state. We are all friends here, and I hope that this unfortunate difference of opinion has not caused you any distress.Please do not let the reviews on amazon.com persuade you one way or the other; read Watership Down for yourself and form your own opinions, as you should do for any book you think you might enjoy. As for me, I'm off to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is an amazing book. That someone could write 429 pages (hardcover version) on a real-life epic about rabbits and make it work is simply incredible, beyond anything I could ever hope to accomplish. You laugh, maybe, that one would want to write any exciting book about rabbits at all, but frankly, you can't imagine it unless you've been there.Watership Down is a story of the journey of a group of rabbits that flee their home warren after Fiver, the runt of his litter, has one of his premonitions of doom. It follows headstrong Bigwig, leader Hazel, storyteller Dandelion, and all the others, in their quest for a mystical hill over the next horizon, Watership Down. Spanning epic length, their passage across the countryside takes them to places darker than the rabbit mind can fathom. Throughout the story, the influence of man upon natural life often intrudes, for good or ill, or, more often, causing inscrutable confusion, like the machinations of a distant god. Even after adjusting to the hardships of life, the rabbits' subsequent search for does bring them to a sinister military rabbit community like no other, the mighty Efrafa. Granted that rabbits are usually stronger, faster, and smarter than other woodland creatures, these guys could kick Redwall to the moon.But seriously, Watership is a powerful book, and, as you've probably read from the better reviews out there, the morals of the lapine societies parallel many ethics and political ideas in the real world. It's a book that can be read on many levels, with the confrontation of death, destruction of the environment, and cost of freedom. I personally think the two great strengths of the book come from the creation of a rabbit culture and the development of the characters. Richard Adams has crafted a world with its own language and customs. The stories of the legendary trickster El-Ahrairah are fit for any book of fables, next to characters like Anansi or Brer Rabbit. They provide a nice parallel to the plot. And like all great stories, our heroes are changed by the experience of the journey. Hazel develops into a true leader of his rabbits and Fiver becomes a trusted, well, psychic prophet. When Bigwig finally stands against the General, we're cheering for him all the way. These are rabbits we care about.Obviously, this book is not for everyone. There will be those who refuse to read it simply because there are talking rabbits. But I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone with enough patience to read a thick book. If you have enough maturity to appreciate the Lord of the Rings for things other than orc-bashing, then by all means, read this!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My father read us this book (skipping what he thought were the boring parts) when I was in elementary school. I tried to check it out of the library, but was told I needed adult permission to do so (so glad library policies change!). Being the ever devious fourth grader that I was, I plunked down a quarter at the next library book sale and bought my very own second hand copy. I have read and reread that copy and purchased new ones. I think I have three at present. All this to say that this is one of the all time best novels ever written in the English language. Sweeping adventure, personal struggles, mythology, wars &amp; intrigue and wondrous travelogue all in one. If you have ever let the idea that this book centers on a group of &quot;bunnies&quot; keep you from reading it, put that out of your mind. The characters are based on Adams's military unit and they are quite human. At times frightening and at others laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book you will live as much as read. And when you give it a chance it will sweep you away."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"People look at me funny when I tell them that Watership Down, a book about rabbits, was the greatest book I've ever read (I've read it 4 times, the first time when I was in the 8th grade). In most cases, people refuse to believe me, so I buy the skeptic a copy. In virtually every case, the skeptic returns and admits that Watership Down was the best book they ever read. The book is simply fantastic from the first to the last page. When my wife read it, she would only read about 5 pages at a time of the last 25 or so because she didn't want it to end. It is that good. From the start your sucked into the world of rabbits and their struggles to survive against humans, natural predators, and themselves. The parallels with real world fascism, evil dictators, and the quest for true freedom is all too real. The last 100 pages will have you reading through the night with your heat pumping. One of the most engrossing, fantastic stories you will ever encounter. The writing is lush and superb. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, it certainly deserves it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Scanning through the previously posted reviews of Richard Adams's novel, &quot;Watership Down,&quot; one comes across a varied assortment of criticisms ranging from &quot;masterpiece!&quot; to &quot;terrible!&quot; It amazes me that a work of fiction could evoke such an uneven response from it's readers. That is, until one more closely examines the ages of the reviewers. Most, if not all, of the negative reviews posted on this site allege to be from high school and middle grade students who were &quot;forced&quot; to read this novel as an outside reading assignment. Of course, a book is &quot;boring&quot; compared to the allure of the outdoors, athletics, and the hypnotic charm of puberty. There's too many distractions when you're growing up: you're learning about life, about who you are, and selecting your role in society. Reading is not something that can be &quot;forced&quot; upon you. No one ever liked something they were &quot;forced&quot; into doing. Reading is something you have to discover on your own when you're ready. And if and when that time comes, read &quot;Watership Down.&quot; True, it will still be a book about rabbits, but if you read it very carefully, you might just learn how to be a better human. When your boss comes down on you at work, or when the bill collectors start calling, maybe you'll find yourself returning to the pages of Mr. Adams's book, seeking the protection of Bigwig, the foresight of Fiver, or the calming words of Hazel. Trust me, as well as the other reviewers on this site, and read the book. And once you do, you'll be comforted to know there really is a Watership Down in Great Britain, and perhaps maybe, there is a heroic band of rabbits who live there, too."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am not in the habit of judging others by what they read or don't read, but after reading some of the poor reviews (I think there were about 6 out of the over 100 reviews this book received), I feel compelled to answer their claims. First, it was stated that this book is not for kids. I think this statement discourages countless intelligent young minds from reading a true classic. (Incidently-for those who think this book cannot be enjoyed by children, the author disagrees-Richard Adams originally told it as a bedtime story to his own child.) As for the claims of students who said &quot;no one in my class liked it&quot;, to me this is simply evidence of a generation raised on video games and television-children and young adults who have no creativity and are devoid of imagination. Finally, I believe I saw 3 or 4 reviews that stated this book was lacking in action and adventure. Did you people even read this book? It not only was an adventure (every step of the way) for! the characters, but also for the readers mind. Now I would like to give my own review of this wonderful story. My first introduction to it was through my oldest brother-he had read it for school in the sixth grade and loved it. I was only seven when I first read it, and I was enchanted by the new world I had discovered within its pages. To me, the benchmark of a truly great author is to make the impossible believable. Adams accomplishes this task with ease in &quot;Watership Down&quot;. By creating an entire civilization-complete with government, language, and even a unique mythology, Adams draws his readers deeper into their own imaginations where anything is possible and gives them a new way to look at our own role in the unending cycle of life. My recommendation is to read this book as young as possible-and to reread it many times throughout your life. It will expand your minds and open the doors of imagination for your children. My praise and thanks to Richard Adams for a! job very well done!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"*****SPOILER*****I'm going to get to the meat and potatoes of discussing this book in a moment, but I want to share with you the circumstances under which I first read Watership Down. I didn't read it as a child and that's too bad for me. Three years ago, after a particularly nasty ice storm, I slipped in a parking lot late at night and lost consciousness. When I came to, I was in bad shape, but I drove home, took some Tylenol and went to bed (bad idea, but it's what I did to avoid the bankrupting cost of American health care). I even got up the next day and went to work, though I couldn't hear and I could barely walk. I figured it would pass.It didn't pass. My boss sent me to the hospital and it was a good thing she did. A cat scan revealed I had cracked my skull and bruised my brain. For three days I was under close observation and throwing up pretty much all the time. The doctor told me and a far more distraught Mrs. Ninja (then girlfriend Ninja) that we would have to wait and see when the swelling stopped how much of my cognitive function would remain. It's a terrible thing to sit and wait to find out if the thoughts you're thinking are the last clear thoughts you're ever going to have.I assure you, if I had been up to it, I would have spent that time finishing the novel I was working on as to die, or worse, go vegetable with an unfinished manuscript is a great fear of mine. But I wasn't up to it, so I read instead. Oh, I told my girlfriend and my family I loved them and comforted them as much as I could, but I was there for three days and that's a long time to go without a book. Mrs. Ninja understood and she bought me a copy of Watership Down.As I read Watership Down, I knew it was perhaps the last book I would ever be able to read, and I was okay with it. It would have been a great book to go out on. I'll stop with the melodrama as it came out all right. My balance has never been the same and I have some slight hearing loss, but all things considered, I got off quite lucky. I even finished that silly manuscript I was working on and have since written a better one and as you know from reading this blog, I have read many fine books since.But never before had the power of a great book been made clearer to me. Richard Adams took me out of that place and away from my worries, which were considerable. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but he did. I forgot about the nurses and the doctors and all the dreadful possible outcomes I was facing and was transported to the world of Hazel and Fiver and Bigwig and the wonderful rabbits of Watership Down. I forgot my own concerns and focused on my concern for those brave rabbits and their struggle.For those three anxious days, I was not at the hospital. I was in England in a warren. Never before had I so badly needed to be swept away and Watership Down did that for me. And in my more cynical moments when I'm convinced no one reads anymore and we writers are a relic unaware that our time has passed, I remember that experience and know that literature is as important and powerful as it ever was. I don't care that most Americans watch reality television instead of reading (well, I do, but what can be done?). I need great books in my life and as you're reading this blog (possibly while watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta), I can't be the only one.I almost don't want to tell you about Watership Down. It's an amazing experience that every reader should have at least once and if I tell you about it before hand, it may diminish it somewhat. How some readers feel about Lord of the Rings (I never did care much for all the eating and singing those hobbits did), how my mother felt about Gone With the Wind, how Stephen King fans feel about The Dark Tower (which contains multiple references to the work of Richard Adams)--that's how I feel about Watership Down. I love it as much as I love Batman, and if you read the blog regularly, you know that's a lot:) So I'll repeat: if you haven't read Watership Down, stop reading this review and go read it. For those of you who have read it, I have a job to do and it's time for me to get to it:Watership Down is the story of a group of misfit rabbits who leave their warren when they learn, courtesy of a psychic revelation, that their home will soon be destroyed. Fiver is the high-strung rabbit who has the revelation and he has many more before the novel is done, all of them useful. And why not? Humans have these intuitive revelations all the time. Don't believe me? Then why is it that airline reservation cancelations consistently go up ahead of a crash? I myself have had a few odd moments that caused me to alter my path and as a result, I avoided catastrophe (didn't happen when I was walking in that parking lot, though). These odd moments are the subject of another, kookier post, but I'll bet many of you Esteemed Readers, if you're honest, could tell me stories of having similar moments of intuition.Fiver convinces his buddy Hazel that they need to get out of town. First, the two try to convince their chief rabbit that the sky is falling. They are not taken seriously, of course, and in the end only a few rabbits high-tail it out of there, all of them boys--which turns out to be a real problem later. The rabbits rough it for a bit, attempt to join another warren, visit another, and eventually decide to start their own. But, of course, if their warren is going to last more than the current generation, our heroes are going to need some girls. The second half of the novel is some dude rabbits on a quest to get some chicks--what tale could be more universal than that?And that's the plot of Watership Down. Our protagonists have a clear goal and it's one readers will relate to: they are on a quest for a sustainable life where they can be free of death and harm. There is considerable opposition on all sides. After all, these are rabbits and there are farmers and foxes and trains and birds on all sides--everybody wants to kill these poor rabbits. At times, the oppositions seems insurmountable and that is the key to what makes Watership Down so very readable. Incredible opposition facing scrappy heroes that will do anything to achieve their universal goal. Write that formula down. If you want to have a hope of writing a novel with even a fraction of the longevity of Watership Down, and I do, I do--that's how it's done.Adams never lets up on these rabbits. They are always being chased or imprisoned or otherwise threatened and I assure you the pages will turn themselves. Thug life? Try Bunny life. This is my favorite thing about Watership Down: it is first and foremost a good story well crafted. Adams gives us lovable characters we can relate to and then shoves them in harm's way repeatedly. This probably isn't what makes Watership Down a classic, and in a moment I'm going to talk about theme and metaphor and all that other stuff your English teacher lives for. But notice, all of that is secondary and readers only invest time considering it because their primary need for a good story has first been met.The thing about Adams' rabbits is that they are truly rabbits. These aren't Disney characters who drive in cars, or watch television. They are rabbits and their world is the world of a rabbit. Their concerns are food, shelter, mating, and avoiding harm--which are the primary concerns of humans, no matter how much we like to otherwise trump up the importance of our actions. Every simile Adams employs is a simile from nature. Here's one of my favorites:He pretended to go back, but suddenly turned, rushed upon the shadows and plunged into the nearest hole faster than a raindrop into the ground.Adams would never write \\"he leaped into the hole like a car whipping into a garage,\\" partly because that's a terrible simile, but mostly because rabbits have no knowledge of cars or garages. The rabbits' thinking is entirely grounded in their world, and therefore the narration is as well. The rabbits have names like Blackberry, Dandelion, Cowslip, and even Prince Rainbow. You won't ever encounter a rabbit in Watership Down named Milkshake, or Lucky Penny, or Toilet Paper (too bad).The one conceit of Watership Down is that Adams' rabbits, though rabbits in every other respect, have the ability to think, reason, and communicate like humans. To be fair, given that they have this ability, it's a wonder they haven't developed air conditioned warrens or rabbit cars to drive into rabbit garages--but I'm making too much of this. After all, it's just a story, and if the rabbits were not human-like in their reasoning, we would not find them relatable characters over such a long novel. Humans are deeply narcissistic and we want to read about humans even when we're reading about rabbits.The difference then is that Adams' rabbits think and reason in rabbit terms. For example:The kind of ideas that have become natural to many male human beings in thinking of females--ideas of protection, fidelity, romantic love and so on--are, of course, unknown to rabbits, although rabbits certainly do form exclusive attachments much more frequently than most people realize. However, they are not romantic and it came naturally to Hazel and Holly to consider the two Nuthanger does simply as breeding stock for the warren. This was what they had risked their lives for.Don't worry. The female rabbits think of themselves this way also and they're cool with it. Before you start shouting about sexism, Esteemed Reader, two things: 1. These are rabbits, dude, not people, so chill 2. Although the first half of the book is boy heavy, there are some very strong-willed girl rabbits in the second half every bit as capable as the boys at many things, and better than them at other things (such as cooking and cleaning--I kid, I kid, and Mrs. Ninja just smacked me in the back of the head, which forced me to remind her of my gravely serious brain injury).All right. This is clearly the longest review ever, so I want to talk about three more things and then we'll call it a day. First, although it is perhaps unfortunate that the rabbits have done away with romantic love, it opens up the possibility of greater love. The rabbits love and fight for each other. They do not want does for themselves alone, though they will fight over them if there are not enough to go around. They want the does for the good of the warren. Everything the rabbits do they do for each other and they are stronger for it. Their warren reminds me of a hive in Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, and I yearn for this sort of community in humanity.Second, the main theme of Watership Down is a stroke of genius. The real story here is of the contrast between the different warrens the rabbits visit. In each instance, we are presented differently constructed communities, their strengths, and their weaknesses. What sets our heroes apart is the manner in which they will construct their community differently than these flawed societies. I will not speculate that these warrens are really metaphors for some known human society. Some may think that the final, mean and nasty warren the rabbits visit is a rabbit stand in for Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia, but I don't. I think the different warrens are simply communities of rabbits with qualities similar to the worst human societies. Oddly, there is no capitalism-gone-mad society of rabbits, perhaps because rabbits are far too clever to ever take serious the silly writings of Ayn Rand.For me, the most interesting warren is the second the rabbits visit. The rabbits of this warren are eager for more rabbits to join because they are living a lie. They live in a nice garden with plenty of fresh veggies and free from predators because they are protected by a human farmer. The catch is that the farmer buries wire snares all around because he is also farming rabbits. The rabbits of this warren accept that a few of them will die every year so that the rest can live in utopia (paging Lois Lowry), and they are eager to welcome new rabbits because the more rabbits there are, the better the odds on not getting snared. Here is what the prophet Fiver has to say about these rabbits:Don't you see? The farmer only sets so many snares at a time, and if one rabbit dies, the others will live that much longer. You suggested that Hazel should tell them our adventures, Blackberry, but it didn't go down well, did it? Who wants to hear about brave deeds when he's ashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he's deceiving? Do you want me to go on? I tell you, every single thing that's happened fits like a bee in a foxglove. And kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the great burrow? We shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! Help ourselves to misery and death!Third, I must comment on the ending, though I'll try not to spoil it. In the final act, Adams hits us with a Deus Ex Machina, which we know from dutifully reading our Aristotle is a major no-no. A key rabbit character is saved at the last minute by a human stepping in to help out. She is a god descending on the battlefield at the last second to make everything all right. This is this sort of shenanigan that ruins lesser works, but Adams gets away with it because his god from the machine does not resolve all of the conflict or even the most pressing conflict. Also, the poor rabbits go through so much hell for most of the novel, that in this particular instance the reader is likely to be okay with our hero getting one free lunch.I lied! There's a fourth thing, and then I really am done: Watership Down is an honest book, which is probably why it's been banned so often. I hope to one day write a book so effective it gets banned:) I said before that these rabbits are not Disney characters. Their world is real, and the real world is often a nasty, violent place, especially for rabbits. Adams is not willfully nasty, but he tells the truth and as always, the truth is somewhat unpleasant. For this reason, Watership Down is probably not appropriate for very young readers (although, neither is the world). However, Watership Down started life as a story Richard Adams told to his two young daughters on a long drive and I can't imagine the violence, or even the implied rape in this story, is any worse than what children have been exposed to already and certainly no worse than what they will be exposed to as they grow up.Whew. This may be my longest review ever and it is done. Make sure you come back on Thursday when Richard Adams, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, is going to be here to face the 7 Questions. And come again on Saturday for an interview with a surprise literary agent. And now, as always I leave you with a few of my most favorite passages from one of my most favorite books, Watership Down:They climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. The grass undulated about them. They peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.\\"It all comes from men,\\" said Holly. \\"All other elil do what they have to do and Frith moves them as he moves us. They live on earth and they need food. Men will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals. But I'd better go on with this tale of mine.\\"Hazel's anxiety and the reason for it were soon known to all the rabbits and there was not one who did not realize what they were up against. There was nothing very startling in what he had said. He was simply the one--as a Chief Rabbit ought to be--through whom a strong feeling, latent throughout the warren, had come to the surface.\\"Well, I can't quite make out,\\" answered Bigwig. \\"But if I understand him properly--and I'm not at all sure that I do--he says that where he comes from there are thousands of his kind--more than we can possibly imagine. Their flocks make the whole air white and in the breeding season their nests are like leaves in a wood--so he says.\\""},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I had to read this book for school, and it was great. The story seems weird but it is really great.Also, the first 2 chapters are boring but then it gets very good"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Finishing a very good book is always bittersweet. I finished \\"Watership Down\\" in awe of how well the story was written, wishing that the 400+ pages would have continued on to book two. Alas, the story is self-sufficient, and another story would be but a shadow of this epic.We meet Hazel and his brother Fiver as the story begins. We will soon learn that Hazel is quite intelligent and Fiver can foresee the future. Both Hazel and Fiver are outskirters in Sandelford Warren, and the Owsla, which are the large rabbits of the ruling class, typically push Hazel and Fiver around. However, there are strange things going on in the commons around Sandelford Warren, and Fiver senses that everyone must leave. Hazel and Fiver go to see the Chief Rabbit and attempt to convince him that the warren is in danger, though Fiver is unable to explain the nature of the danger. The Chief Rabbit does not believe Fiver's story, but Hazel is impressed with his brother's fear and decides that they must leave the warren.A small group of bucks, male rabbits, join Hazel and Fiver as they make their way into the unknown. Fortunately for the group, Bigwig, a former member of the Sandelford Warren's Owsla, has decided to join them, along with several other members of the warren. The journey to Watership Down is fraught with danger for the rabbits. There are elil, which is what rabbits call all creatures that hunt rabbits, everywhere. Yet, after a misadventure in an anarchistic warren where the rabbits are allowed to run free, but are harvested by a man, the Sandelford Warren rabbits make their way to Watership Down and build a new burrow.The warren at Watership Down has but one problem; there are no does. A warren requires does to stay alive, and the rabbits go off to seek does from Efrafa, run by the dictatorial General Woundwort, and from Nuthanger Farm, where rabbits are kept in hutches. It is the epic story of the encounters with the Efrafan rabbits and General Woundwort that will provide any reader with an excellent reading experience and make you wish for more as the last page lays flat.The story of the rabbits is well-written and has some factual basis. Richard Adams credits R.M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of a Rabbit\\" in his acknowledgement. This highly imaginative tale of a group of rabbits is as riveting as any epic story in fantasy that I have ever read. While I occasionally struggled with attempting to pronounce Lapine words that Mr. Adams created to describe the various aspects of rabbit life, in general this story was a relatively easy read. Though I will admit to having first read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and \\"The Hobbit\\" when in middle school, I believe \\"Watership Down\\" is much easier to read, and thus may find an audience with children in elementary school with the vocabulary of this book. I would feel quite comfortable having my children read this book as soon as they are capable of doing so. The 400 plus pages of this book may seem daunting, but the payoff is an absorbing tale that will take a persistent reader to an excellently crafted ending, and make that reader long for more.\\"Watership Down\\" is one of those books that avid readers continually seek and all too rarely find. The tale is original and nicely plotted. The writing is clear and coherent, rich in details that will beg a reader to come back and discover after understanding the rabbits' future. This book will be a joy to those who appreciate epic tales, particularly those based in fantasy. When I reached the end I got the warm fuzzy feeling I get when I read a good book that I like, but the vague sadness that it has to end."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is not some cutesy kids book about talking rabbits. This is a thoroughly engrossing, mature, novel; every bit as detailed and well-written as Tolkein's The Hobbit. It has all the makings of a classic: myths, folk tales, characters you care about, and wonderful descriptive language.Watership Down follows the tale of a group of rabbits fleeing from their warren after Fiver--a young rabbit--has a vision of disaster. Hazel (the leader), Bigwig (the loyal fighter), Dandelion (the bright storyteller), Fiver (the prophetic runt), Blackberry (the creative problem-solver), and others must travel farther than they've ever gone before to find a new home. Even when the rabbits discover a near nirvana, they still have dangers to face.A fast-paced, beautifully crafted novel, Watership Down will linger in your memory long after many books are forgotten."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have given my two best friends in this world Watership Down as gifts. Why? Because it's the only way I can see to give people I love another world, which they deserve. It's the only way I know to share with them a sense of love for nature and an understanding of the supernatural.Watership Down is tremendous. There's some people who have given this book one star, and sneeringly suggested Stephen King or Michael Crichton as acceptable alternatives. Well, in _The_Stand_, Stephen King not only quotes Watership Down, but pays it high praise indeed.This book is not for everyone. It's not for young kids (the violence is probably too disturbing). It's not for people who don't like too read. But if you love good fiction and are hunting for a phenomenal book--well, look no further.Is this the best book I've ever read? People that read voraciously, at some point, develop a list of &quot;best books&quot;. This is on my list.Read it. It might get on yours, too."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. It doesn't hurt that I'm a rabbit lover, but there's more to this book than cute, furry bunnies. If you're looking for a fluffy book without substance, pass this one up. It's a great read and hard to put down once you start.You can read this book a couple of different ways. You can take it at face value: a delightful book about a group of rabbits from their perspective. Their journey is filled with rich details: near misses, triumphs, and a tear-jerker for an ending. Adams peppers the book with words from the lapine language (didn't you know that rabbits could speak?). You can also look beyond the simpler story and look deeper at the symbolism that's intertwined into this story. Adams touches on many themes in this book (don't want to give anything away, but you'll know what I mean when you read it.)I chose the former, but was always aware of the latter. No matter what, it's an absolutely delightful tale that I've already read a few times. Join Fiver, Hazel-Rah, and the rest of the gang as they band together to boldly go where no rabbit has gone before. Laugh with them, fear for them, admire their courage; this is a classic that should be a &quot;must read&quot;."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is a story about a group rabbits trying to find a new home (warren). One of them named Fiver senses that something bad will happen to the old warren and this gets the whole story started.I thought Watership Down was interesting because there was lots of action and intense moments. I think that if the book didn&#65533;t have as much action, it wouldn&#65533;t have been as interesting. The one thing that I didn&#65533;t like was the fact that the first 20-30 pages were slow, but this was only because Adams spent this time introducing the characters.When comparing Watership Down to Redwall there are some similarities and some differences. Weasels and foxes are the predators in both Redwall and Watership Down. But rabbits have the main role in Watership Down, whereas in Redwall, most of the main characters are mice. However in Redwall, there are one or two rabbits.I would recommend this book to any fan of the Redwall series and anyone else who wants to read a good novel. My overall impression was that Watership Down was a well written novel. Richard Adams does a great job at pulling you into the book and keeping you there. So be warned that after you start reading, you may find that you can't stop in the middle of a chapter."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One of the novels we read was called Watership Down. The basic plot kept me reading, yet I was a little confused. What I liked about about it was how the rabbits stayed together as a team, and they all ended up happy in the end. For example, when they had to flee their warren from men destructing it, they stuck together. They tried to find a new warren, but that failed. Hazel led them all to a better life in the end though.What I disliked about the novel was how the rabbits ran into so much trouble, it made the novel a littlw hard to follow.This novel in not like many novels. When I read The call of The Wild, Jack London puts a dog through life threatening situations, also. The dog whatched out for himself and that lead to his survival. Hazel and Bigwig lead the pack to their survival as well. Without their survival skills, the pack of rabbits and the dog would of died.My overall impression of the novel was that I thought it was good. It wasn't my favorite novel of the four, but it was interesting. I would recommend it to people who like non-stop action. If they like more mellow novels, maybe not. I would recommend it to most people though."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"a great book. begining in the home waren and ending where only the reader can get to. when fiver makes a prediction he, hazle and a gang of rabbits from the warren run away to the dangers beyond to escape the dangers coming closer. just how many rabbits there were that left? i dont know but they were all males.How will they sovle the problem of dying out? Will they even make it that far? this is a fabulus book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a great book for all ages. It focuses on the adventures of a group of rabbits that flee from their home in order to escape a tragedy in their warren. The book has a mixture of scenes; some funny, which include some hilarious phrases from the Lapine language which the rabbits speak, others sad, such as when the situation the rabbits are in just doesn't seem to be on their side, and in some parts of the book, such as the many adventure scenes in the book, it is just impossible to put the book down. However, the book does start out rather slow with all the background stuff, but as you go on it keeps getting better and better, so if you are starting to read the book, you just need to keep reading.One of my more favorite parts of the book was the ending, which really was the point in the book that looked as if all was lost, however this was also the part of the book which really showed how much strength and courage these rabbits really had. That is what makes this story so great.Not only is it a great book because of its plot, but also because of how Richard Adams wrote it. You can tell that he spent a lot of time researching the rabbit's style of life, thinking up the plot and the language, and writing the book. Watership Down is not a science fiction novel, but it is a book that has a lot of feeling, and it's a book that really makes you think. So in some aspects this book is a better book than some that are out there, so if you are looking for a book to read I strongly suggest that you read Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book, Watership Down, was a very good book to read. The book was about a group of rabbits that flee their home before a land develoer destroys it. They find a place, called Watership Down, that ends up being their new home. When they realize that they don't have any does, female rabbits, they set out to find some and have a few adventures.I liked that the book had action in it. For example, it had action when Hazel, the chief rabbit, and his followers fought against the Efrafan rabbits in order to save Watership Down. Another time, they fought a cat at Nuthanger Farm while trying to get two female rabbits out of a box. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that sometimes it dragged on by giving way to much detail.This book is different from other books I have read because I have never read a book about talking rabbits before. Watership Down is similiar to other books I have read because there is action and suspense in it. The biggest suspense is when Bigwig fights General Woundwort, the Efrafan rabbits leader.This book is one of the best books I have ever read because of the story of the rabbits and their adventures. I would definitly recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It's hard to dislike Watership Down. Imaginative, engrossing, yet simple and concise, it's a epic tale to read and reread. At first it seems silly that rabits talk like educated Englishmen, but you grow used to it, then think it second nature. Richard Adams is not a brilliant writer, but he's a very good one. What he does have is a wonderful imagination, and it makes the book. No matter who you are, you will love Watership Down. The stories, the adventures, the characters, you care about the characters, are all well told. Read it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"i read this book when i first started my second semester english class because it was lying around and i couldnt find another book to read, but now, im glad i did read it. its a wonderful book, full of adventure of thrill.. it really left me on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what was going to happen next with Hazel and his friends, and the dictionary in the back is fun to look at when u dont know what one of the authors words mean. Best of all, kids of all ages can relate to the book, and even if your not a kid, its still a good book to read in your spare time. i reccomend this book to people who have nothing better to do.. enjoy a good story once in a while.. even if it is about a fantasy world of rabbits and their society.. although i did get wrapped up in the book, because the author uses imagery strongly, leaving you with an almost movie like version of the book playing in your head.. buy this book.. not becuase you can, but becuase i said so..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I, for one, think that Watership Down is a GREAT book. It's isn't your everyday, little 'smiley, fluffy bun-bun' rabbit book. Oh no. This is far from it. Hazel, a born leader, and Fiver, a streetwise and slightly eccentric character, are just 'kids'. Yet, when they team up with the strongest rabbit around, they successfully escape the danger of which Fiver predicts for the future. Bringing along some of the other bunnies (by using this term don't think I mean 'fluffy bun-bun'), they learn teamwork can save lives and freedom. So join this AWESOME adventure and BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I would like to state first off that THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK. Not only is the story more complicated for younger readers (and more than a simple \\"adventure\\"), its subject matter and themes are serious and not relevant to most children. That is evident in all the previous reviews by children (who were usually forced to read the book in school) who either call the book boring, too long or stupid. It is difficult for many to understand entirely what this book represents and as a potential reader, you must recognize that prior to a decision to read this book. That is not to say children can't read and enjoy this book; to the contrary, the story transverses all age groups (my point being that many people assume that because of the grade at which it is assigned in most schools it is written for children, which it IS NOT--can I make that clearer?). What children miss and what I feel is the essential ingredient to this work is in its allegory which manifests itself ultimately in Adams' portrayal of rabbits as humans. It is up to the reader how much of this allegory he/she wishes to embrace (and I'm sure I've embellished more than a few allegorical connections myself). It has been said before, but the rabbits in Watership Down represent specific and irrefutable, even if simplified, characteristics of the human race. They also live and breathe in a rabbit world littered with the political and social structures that dominate our civilization (as humans). Adams' work also describes, on a somewhat diminished scale, the attitudes of man towards nature; besides other rabbits, mankind seems to be the strongest enemy and most obstacles the rabbits must overcome are man-made.For these reasons (and many more not listed), I feel Watership Down is best read with these factors in mind, which to me make it a decidedly mature story and a mistake to be considered a children's book. There are many summaries of the plot below, so I won't go into detail here, except to say that it is a well written story and wonderful adventure that can be enjoyed on many levels. I would encourage you to read it and decide for yourself what it will give to you."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Most books are short but sweet and you only think about them for the time that you read, but this is one of those books that make you sad or happy for a long long time. This is a must see for anyone who wants an adventure. Traveling with Hazel-rah and his friends will be so interesting, you'll keep reading until this last word."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A classic. A must read. This book poses as a children's story but it is most certainly a must read for adults."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Though familiar with the story having seen the old 1978 cartoon version- which sticks very close to the book, by the way- this was the first time I've read Watership Down.In the beginning of the tale we meet Hazel and Fiver. Fiver has a terrible feeling concerning the welfare of the warren where they make their home. Litter mates, Hazel trusts Fiver's instincts, so he takes Fiver's warning to the Chief Rabbit. Of course the old fellow thinks little Fiver's is just a silly trouble maker and will have none of it, but because Fiver has never been wrong before AND his feeling of imminent danger is so strong, Hazel decides it's time to leave. (We find later Fiver was absolutely correct!)It's a not a very big group who leave searching for a new home, but through the trials they face almost immediately upon leaving, they become a tight knit group.What I love most about Watership Down is the Tolkienesque culture Adams brings to the world of rabbits complete with language, a history and it's tales & myths. I LOVE little Fiver and his prophetic gift as well as Hazel who steps up to the plate as Chief Rabbit in a thoughtful and even kind manner. (He befriends creatures that rabbits normally would avoid with an insight into the rabbits future survival that is almost as prophetic as Fiver!)The story itself is thrilling as we watch the group face danger all around,(and survive!), until they eventually settle on Watership Down. Even then, there a couple more trials they must face as they set out to find females to aid in their new warren life. The creepy rabbits of the Tharn Warren (also known as Cowslip's Warren) and Efrafa make me shiver as much as any character in a Stephen King novel!I believe this story has a lot to teach us about morality in leadership and also about being leaders- as well as followers. It's also serves as a reminder about our influence as humans upon the creatures of the earth. After all, we are all inter-connected, aren't we?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"General opinion here is that the only good rabbit is one on the other end of a shotgun, or in a pot. These ones I would let live, no problem. A quest story, with a little bit of environmentalism thrown in, a prophet, and a look at the politics of control, via your burrow fascism. This, of course, is all wrapped around a story that is designed to be accessible to children, to begin with."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this in high school and I fell in love with it. It's one of those novels that you tend to read and read again. I'm an author now and I feel that Richard Adams is one of the most influential writers for me.

Though it may be a bit long and wordy, it gives a sense of good revolt for the common good in the rabbit world.Hazel and Fiver are the most favored characters because of Hazel's brotherly patience and Fiver's innocent foresight. I would have liked to see the new Owsla Hazel entered into with the Black Rabbit and if the rabbits he shared the warren with are there also.What annoyed me is how Bigwig spoke to Fiver when they were in Cowslip's dangerous warren. *Rages at Bigwig* Bigwig, you wicked rabbit!!! You don't talk to Fiver like that!!! Fiver was only predicting what Frith gave him. You're a big impudent rabbit pile of waste yourself!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a classic book of journey, but that is not the best part of this book. The adventures these usually cowardly rabbits have are enjoyable and enthralling. Yet, it is the rabbit culture that makes this book so good. Few have perceived everyday animals as Adam's has shown us the simple rabbit. This book flows well and always leaves you wanting more. The only drawback is that it gives the reader little room for thought. Only a few places in the book does Adam's give us some sort of mystery, but they are small and often predictable. I loved the book and can't wait to read Tales from Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of my top five favorite books of all time. It's incredibly well written. If you like animals (in this case rabbits), action and captivating characters, you can't go wrong with this book. It's a marvelous tale of family, friendship, loyalty, courage and survival. Some of the descriptions are a bit lengthy for my taste, but otherwise it's spectacular. Also of note, the movie adaptation holds pretty true to the book and is a good alternative for those who have difficulty reading, though there are a few scenes that may be too graphic for very young viewers. However, I ultimately found the book much more satisfying, as it was wonderful creating my own mental images of these adventures. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have to admit, when my husband gave me this book for Christmas a few years ago, I thought, \\"Great. A book about rabbits.

They have to find a new home, one where they can live free, happily and with no humans. When they finally do make it to that place there are only male rabbits in there group so now they have to find they females that are held up in the Efrafa bunker like rabbit society without getting killed by both animal and human alike.My most favorite parts are where Dandelion tells the stories about El-ahrairah rabbit.

It was a very crafty plan.I thought that the theme of the story was finding your safe haven in life isn't always the easiest thing to do.In the book Watership Down by Richard Adams the part that I liked best was the whole book. I wouldn't want Adams to change anything about the book. Maybe add a sequel to it is about it. I don't recommend this to people who don't like reading or animals.

Yes, this book five hundred page long fantasy about bunnies. But it's also about survival against all odds, sacrifices and quick-thinking, and the struggle to create a thing called \`home'. Richard Adams, with the help of The Private life of the Rabbit by rabbit expert R. M. Lockley, has created a flawless world of rabbits and their many enemies compete with a religion and language of the rabbits.One day, Hazel and his prophetic but undersized brother, Fiver, are hopping through the fields near their crowded warren, Fiver has a vision of their home destroyed and insists that they see their leader and tell him that they must abandon their burrow and seek another. He, of course, doesn't listen, so the two create a motley band of travelers, including Bigwig, the fierce and powerful warrior, Blackberry the brilliant and thoughtful, Dandelion, the storyteller, and Pipkin, the loyal but totally useless. Their trials are many (including rabbits who live in the wild, but are being trapped and fed by humans), but they somehow survive and find the ideal place for a warren, and discover the captain of the owsla (the class of strong male rabbits in a warren) from their old warren, who tells of the horrible destruction of the warren; the only problem with the new warren is that there are no female rabbits. So the rabbit refugees manage to rescue does from a horribly overcrowded and cruel warren, and a farm (Hazel, now the undisputed leader, gets shot in the leg in the process), and so their quest is completed and their warren created.Set in modern-day England's forests and fields, Watership Down is, in my opinion, absolutely beautiful and highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love Watership Down. It's not just a story about rabbits - it's a peek at humanity and society at it's best and worst, simply from a four legged point of view. I read an average of 5 books a month and yet I make it a point to read this book at least once a year. After all these years, I still find myself looking forward to visiting with Fiver, Hazel and Bigwig. I recently took two books with me for a 12 hour flight to Greece - a new one and Watership Down. It was Watership that I read. If I were lost on a desert island and could have only one book with me, this would be the one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a captivating tale about a group of rabbits that have to leave the warren they've known all their lives. When one of the rabbits, Fiver, has a vision they decide to leave the warren. They take a few members of their warren with them on their adventure. On their adventure they go through many obstacles, but telling stories help lift their spirits. The main characters in this story are Fiver, a rabbit who is always paranoid about what is going to happen next, and his brother Hazel who tries to follow Fiver's ideas.

I read it aloud to my kids (over several weeks), but it is certainly appropriate and rewarding for adults. I was never \\"assigned\\" this book in school and would have missed it entirely but for an Amazon.com recommendation. I'm glad I found it. Adams accomplished something here, building a heroic and sometime pulse-pounding tale upon the short and otherwise timid lives of rabbits. The plot twists and turns are excellent, and ending the book required us (my kids and me) to say goodbye to some great characters. There are plenty of summaries of this book on this page and elsewhere, so I'll skip that - but trust me on this one. It's good."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Reviewers before me, both professional and amateur, here on Amazon and elsewhere have written with greater eloquence than mine the original and majestic brilliance of this book. I will just mention that the allegory of rabbits in exile is very relevant today.

He even locates the story in a real enough place, the downs of Berkshire."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I admit, going into this book I thought it was going to be terrible. It was not my favorite book, but it was kind of entertaining. It is not the kind of book I would usually read, so it broadened my horizons.I did almost fall asleep a couple of times, and I didn't really have a drive to read it(English assignment). I thought the whole plot got really predictable towards the end. I also thought it to be bland with no real variety in sentences. So overall, if your into this variety of books, you will probably like it, but if you are a literal thinker, you will probably find it boring and silly."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book keeps me tingling with excitement from the first chapter to the last. A gripping, vivid tale of how the young male rabbit Hazel, whose brother can see the future, is warned by Fiver that a dreadful calamity is about to befall their home warren. They go to the chief rabbit and tell him, but he proudly refuses to listen. Desperately, Hazel and Fiver gather together as many other rabbits as they can and attempt to leave in the night. They are stopped and told they are under arrest. They fight their way out and set out on a journey that will make them the hardiest, bravest, and smartest group of rabbits in all of the countryside. The daring Hazel, the little future-seeing Fiver, the smart and reliable Blackberry, the brawny duo Big-Wig and Silver, the great storyteller Dandelion, and memorable others form a superb company that crosses the downs of England searching for a new home. Finally after many tense abventures they come to Watership Down, distant enough from men and free enough from 'elil' (predators) to be a peaceful rabbit haven. All seems like it's going to turn out well until the rabbits realize they have made a terrible mistake. In leaving the old warren, they had not brought does. The new warren faces certain destruction if there is no way of securing a few females to help the warren grow. They are at a loss for what to do, when Hazel, whom they have elected chief rabbit, tells them to keep their eyes out for a bird in need of help. Luckily they find a black- headed gull and having saved it from almost certain death, beg it to fly and look for another warren in which they can find does. After much searching the bird brings back news of an over-crowded warren a few days' journey away. Three rabbits set out as an embassy only to return with a sorry tale of capture, inprisonment and escape with barely their skins, yet alone does. Hazel then pits his wits against the evil chief rabbit, Woundwort of the oppressed warren. With the help of Kehaar, the gull, he finds a boat tied to the shore of a small stream near Woundwort's warren, Efrafa. They astonish Woundwort and his soldiers by getting their whole company (along with the does they had stolen from under his nose) onto the punt - and biting through the cord, they sail down river. After more adventures they finally succeed in getting the does back to Watership Down. But they do not know that they have been followed closely by the spies of Woudwort. He, knowing the location of Watership Down, comes upon Hazel and his faithful friends, to wreck his vengence on them. The climax is such a glory of loyalty, bravery, resourcfulnes, and suspense that when it is finished I always find that I have barely breathed in the last twenty minutes.I have read it again and again and I never get tired of Richard Adams' all-glorious masterpiece, Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The subtitle is not entirely silly. Tolkien himself said that &quot;rabbit&quot; was one of the words lying behind &quot;hobbit.&quot; After all, llike hobbits, rabbits are insignificant little creatures whom one doesn't associate with grand adventure, but who turn out to be tough and resourceful nonetheless. I would be surprised to find anyone who loved the Lord of the Rings but hates Watership Down. Like Tolkien and all good heroic fantasy writers, Adams is interested in finding heroism and adventure in unlikely places, and in the way hope springs out of despair when we come to care about bringing salvation more than about being the bringer of it. Watership Down is quite literally about finding adventure in your own backyard. However, the place you, as a human, play in it is not very heroic. We are, we learn, the most vicious among the &quot;thousand,&quot; the enemies of rabbits. Unlike foxes, hawks, and other natural enemies, we kill not just because we are hungry but because, say, we are building a new housing development and a rabbit warren happens to be in the way. One of the many excellencies of _Watership Down_ is the way one identifies closely with the rabbits and then suddenly realizes, &quot;but I'm human! I'm one of the Thousand Enemies!&quot; Perhaps this will help us identify better with those human beings in history whose lives have been like those of Adams's rabbits--a continual struggle for survival against powerful oppressors. But mostly what one experiences in _Watership Down_ is the sheer joy of Adams's creation, from the myths about the trickster hero El'ahrairah, to the decadent rabbits who compose lyric poetry and create works of art but have forgotten about heroism and adventure (for a reason that I won't reveal), to the final, epic showdown with the totalitarian dictator General Woundwort, to whom the tiny, helpless prophet Fiver says with compassionate irony (given who seems to have the power at the time): &quot;Believe me, I am sorry for your death.&quot; And then there is the large and warlike Bigwig, who learns to accept gracefully the superiority of the greatest of all the rabbits, Hazel, whose leadership is based not on strength and fighting ability but on the ability to think ahead and, most importantly, to sacrifice himself for the others."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Having just read it for the second time, Watership down is by far my favorite book. When I was a child my aunt brought over the movie version of this book and I was always facinated by the story and the mythology of the rabbits, but when I tried to read the book it just didn't interest me. So, a few months ago I decided to give it another try as an adult and I am SO glad I did. This is a beautifully written novel about friendship and trust between this group of rabbits and I love it for the story of their exciting and sometimes terrible journey to find a new home. But I also love this book for the way it changed the way I look at the world and nature. I was absorbed into the culture, the attitudes, the language and the spirituality of these animals and now everytime I look at nature I feel that there is a life there which I never realized existed before. Watership down is a must read for all people living on this earth. Afterward, maybe people will think twice about destroying the wildlife that share the land with us!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of those books that has meaning for all readers, no matter what age. I read it for the first time when I was 15, and since then i have read it another 15 times, and each time I got something entirely new out of the book. It is mystifying, horrific, enchantic, and heart-compelling all in one. The maps and &quot;lapine&quot; dictionary in included with the novel are very clever, and hel to enhance the reader's imagination of the journey undertaken by Hazel, Bigwig and the rest of the group. Watership Down, in my opinion, is by far the best novel I have ever read. It is straight from El-hrair-rah"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is a novel that tells of how rabbits live in the world that we as people make it into. At the beginning of the story Fiver tells his brother, Hazel, that there is going to be trouble at the warren. Fiver could kind of see into the future and Hazel knew this. Hazel trys to tell the Chief Rabbit that all the rabbits were in danger and that they need to leave the warren. The Chief Rabbit will not go any where because of his pride. Hazel gets a group of rabbits together to leave and do their best to surrvive in the unknown world. Hazel and his friends run into many scary incounters that scare them out of their wits. They have to face the dark, being eaten, being run over, facing evil rabbits, and many more wild and scary opticles.In the end the fears that they under went was worth it. They even make new buddies. I feel this was a good book because Watership Down had many details and put you right in the middle of the action. This novel, as most novels do, shows a great lesson. It shows that anything can be accomplished if you really put your mind to it. I recommend this novel to all who enjoy adventure and fiction all in one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Of all the editions I have to favor the new cover for the paperback with the beautiful paining of the gate and downs. Not available in hardcover! After much shopping I picked up this hard cover version and was very very happy. A beautifully made book with truly great binding, paper, and cover (with or without the dust jacket). I'd still like to see the modern non-mass market cover in hardcover form but if you are going to gift Watership Down (as you all should) this is the most beautiful and quality printing available.

I read it in 6th grade and I had no trouble with it what so ever. Yes, it's about rabbit adventures but it's almost to good to be true. However it is a long book and so you have to be patient but once you get into the story you don't care if it's long because you don't want it to end. I actually cryed when it ended... no joke. I didn't want it to end because it was the best book that I had ever read. My dad had to convince me to read something else because I was actually going to read it again right after I had just read it. Read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, authored by the legendary Richard Adams is a masterpiece of human intellect, thoughts, and writing. This long (492 pages) yet fly-by book is full of action, courage, compassion, teamwork and friendship. The book starts with a clang of worrysome rabbits escaping their home-town burrow due to a virtual bunny-psychic having premonitions of something \\"bad\\". The group, headed by their pinnacle of a leader Hazel is soon on their way throughout the contryside. The \\"elements\\", death, which way to go, animals and the pounding thought of \\"is this worth it\\" linger around the clang of rabbits throughout the risky endeavour. The clang stumbles upon other civilizations of rabbits, rivers and more but their spirits are boosted when they find an abandoned burrow they call the \\"Honeycomb\\" and their new home. They also have to fend off another civilization lead by the sinister General Woundwart attacking their burrow and they meet a clumsy, stupid yet helpful seagull named Keehar. This stunning book is certainly enjoyable- as I've read it 3 times. This great novel has entertained millions of readers worldwide and will indefinately continue to do so for more millions. Richard Adams uses great vocabulary from cover to cover and certainly ignore the common comments- \\"That book is SOO Boring\\", because they must have a completely different book. I have yet to read the sequel- Tails From Watership Down. Will it live up to the standard of its predecessor- only time will tell!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of those rare novels where once you read it, you will remember it forever. A simple story made into a timeless classic of literature - about a group of rabbits escaping the destruction of their home, being led by their visionary saviour and searching for a new and promised land. Filled with unforgettable characters, rich narrative - a tale of friendship and love, betrayl and struggle, and just about every aspect a humanity. Richard Adams wrote many excellent novels, but this one is by far his greatest achievement. It's simply one of those books you fall in love with and do not want to end."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What's that, you say? Nearly all of the bad reviews for this book. They make me laugh and at the same time, weep for the future. You \\"kids\\" just don't get it. Yes, this book is about rabbits. No, it's not about cute, fluffy bunnies. It's meant to be taken seriously and will be by mature people with a modicum of intelligence who actually want to read a good piece of classic fiction. I fell in love with it at a very early age, but then I was always encouraged to read for pleasure. This wasn't forced on me as part of my studies. I highly recommend this to anyone equipped with the tools to handle it. All the others should stick to their comic books."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is definetely one of my favorite books. I love novels based upon animals, and the imagery and descriptive language Richard Adams has used is wonderful! This book was not assigned to me, I simply read on free will, and all 478 pages of my copy were an absolutely treat. Rabbits are truly unwritten about most of the time, and I have gained much more knowledge in them after reading this. The characters are also very cute, too. Hazel is a follower turned hero, and he discovers himself and at the end of this book, I was beginning to think of him as quite a special rabbit. You positively must read Watership Down for the splendid writing style and captivating story :)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"J.B. EmertWatership DownWhat I liked about Watership Down is that it is very exciting how Fiver can tell things are going to happen. He can tell if something bad is coming and there are a lot of bad and weird things in this book that he tells to you and explains what is going to happen. For instance, he knows that Hazel Rah is going to get hurt. He tells Hazel and even though Hazel knows, that night when they are going out to get does, somehow Hazel gets shot. That is one of my favorite parts in the book even though it is sad. Also one of the best and funniest parts in the book is when they find Keehar, the bird and Bigwig becomes friends with him. Also when they help Keehar and give him shelter for the night. Then after his pulled muscle gets better he goes out and flies for them. What this means is he goes out in the day time and looks for does which are female rabbits. They need females to start a colony. Kehaar does not come back for several days and they started to worry, but he did come back eventually.This book is way different in a lot of ways and the same too. It is different because they are rabbits and find out something bad it going to happen to the warren. They flee and go to someplace better. It is the same because all the books are dealing with someone or something living and have to try and stay away from their enemy. It is also different with Watership Down and a wrinkle in time because in a wrinkle in time they try to save their dad who disappeared and went back in time. They go after him and find a wrinkle in the earth to take them back in time. They find him and come back safely. In Watership Down they try to save themselves from getting killed instead of their family. They go through hardships as well and finally reach their destination and are safe.I would recommend this book to other people because it is very exciting and has meaning. You also get to feel for the rabbits and feel sorry for them because they get hurt. Especially, when Hazel Rah gets shot and just about dies. That is probably the most emotional part of the book, but it also makes the book a lot better. I like it and I hope others will too."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"J.B.

Watership Down is simply astounding. Mr. Adams keeps his readers captivated through various plots and dangers. Some of these dangers include Efrafa, watching out for elil, and leaving their own warren in the beginning of the book. This fellowship of rabbits has to dodge danger at every turn. This book's excellency is due to its most astonishing plots, and its precise descriptions of not only the band of wandering rabbits, but their surroundings as well. This novel is very enjoyable because of its description, and the adventures it takes the reader on. I liked this novel because of all of these things, and I would very much recommend this book to anyone because of the things it teaches and because of its heart-warming experience.When compared to other novels I have read, Watership Down would have to come out on top. I have never read anything like it. It made me feel as if I were a rabbit myself, enduring the hardships these rabbits face, such as having to dodge badgers, dogs, cats, and foxes at every turn. Most other novels, like Fifth Chinese Daughter, will take you into the city life that everyone is accustomed to. However, Watership Down takes you into the wild, and teaches us how poorly we can sometimes treat animals.In all, I would give this book five stars, being the best rating, because of its extraordinary plots and descriptions. I hope all who have a chance to read this book can."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You don't have to like animal stories to like this book. The good thing about it is that it can be enjoyed on multiple levels--as allegory, as adventure story, as fantasy, as cultural study--and usually, more than one at the same time.Watership Down can't be said to be about any one thing--there is a journey, there is a breakout, there is a battle, there is a siege. It makes the statement that to accomplish something, multiple talents are necessary--brains, brawn, and authority. Without Hazel, the rabbits wouldn't have made it. Without Bigwig or Blackberry, they probably wouldn't have made it. Even the smallest, Pipkin, had his moment of importance. It shows that to be a leader, you don't necessarily have to be the biggest or the strongest or the smartest.The language is compulsively readable and the characterization is superb. One can't decide exactly how to take the rabbits--they are so very human at times, yet at the same time completely wild. They don't love as we know it, but they feel the need for survival and freedom. Hazel isn't just The Leader. He doubts himself, he's afraid, he's sometimes even annoyed with the others, but in the end he's prepared to sacrifice himself for them. The novel is also very well-paced, especially for a 400-pager. It certainly doesn't seem like a 400-pager."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a great adventure book. In case you are wondering, the book is not about some kind of battle ship sinking, as the title may seem to imply. Instead Watership Down is the name of the area where a group of rabbits live.I know what you are thinking, &quot;Why would I want to read 400+ pages about rabbits?&quot; I had my doubts too; the first time I picked up this book, I only got about 20 pages into it before I gave up. Fortunately, I started reading it again about a year later and found it to be a rather engrossing tale.A group of rabbits, including the main characters of Hazel, Bigwig, and Fiver, leave their warren to avoid being killed when it is destroyed by construction. The novel tells of their journey to a new warren, its establishment, and the trials of keeping it safe and prosperous.Adams' use of approxiate quotes from various literary sources at the begining of each chapter gives the novel an epic appeal, and the stories El-ahrairah seem akin to popular folktales. The novel cultivates in a dramatic battle scene. No, Watership Down is not about elves and wizards, but give it a chance because it is just as entertaining as a fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My 5th grade teacher made me read this for a book report and I thought it would be the most dumbest book ever because of the cover.

I still love it. If you've only read it once, it's possible you would get even more out of it the second or third time. The evocative themes are very relevant to moral choices you might make at any stage of life. The integrity and courage of the rabbit heroes is astonishing. Appreciation of the writing inspires you to be a better person--braver and kinder. Nothing else compares to the adventure and relevance of this impressive literary work. One thing I noticed more as I grew older is the natural beauty of the English countryside Adams describes, and the sad theme of humans destroying the environment and habitats of animals."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of the most engaging books I've ever read. It's a classic, uplifting book and I recommend it to readers of all ages. The character development was wonderful. There are some tense moments to be sure. I came to care deeply for the rabbits and was moved each time they pulled together to get through their challenges as they continued to move toward Fiver's vision of their future. I cried at the end, not because it was sad, but because the book was over.It was all about survival, leadership, striking out on your own, operating as a member of a group to ensure success, overcoming difficulties through sheer grit and determination, and creative thinking in a crisis.... I could go on.I have read this book only a year after my first reading, and will read it again. I had no trouble with rabbits as the protagonists."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is truly amazing.Nobody who writes animal fantasy has ever equaled this .It is amazingly in depth,it includes detail on the language of the rabbits,the culture ,and the tails.The characters are well done (not at all flat)and it is very exciting.It's partly that I'm a Rabbit -Attic that I loved this so much,but than it would have been just as good if it were a different animal that he'd done it on.Hazel and his brother Fiver gather a hardy band of rabbits to leave the warren ,for Fiver senses trouble.Fiver predicted a flood that happened,so Hazel trusts him.Then it takes off from there.Eventually ,it turns into a (sort of)war between there new warren ,Watership Down,and a mysterious warren nearby called Efrafa.Now you must be warned that this book is extremely disturbing at some parts.It was so disturbing at one part that I had to put down the book and recover for a couple minutes.Be warned."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it. It is extremely well written and you can tell that the author has done tremendous research on rabbits. I have always believed that animals shouldn't be hunted for fun or for money. In the begining, I wondered why Hazel and his band of rabbits were so afraid of humans and then I realized that we have done this ourselves. We have made rabbits afraid of us because of the way we treat them. This is not always the case. Later in the book there is an act of kindness by a human to a rabbit. While reading this, I became part of the world of Hazel, Fiver, Pipkin, Bigwig, Dandelion, Blackberry, and others. The book is so descriptive that it can do that to you. It starts out with Hazel and Fiver frolicking through the warren in which they live. Fiver begins to get one of his bad feelings. This time it is for the rabbits to immediately leave their warren. Only some choose to leave, but for the others there only lies trouble. The rabbits set out on a journey that will certainly change, but maybe end their lives. Where will they live? Who will they meet? Will they ever find out what happened to their old warren? I was able to read this in a week, so it is not very difficult."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first I wasn't to thrilled to have my English teacher &quot;force&quot; me to read this book.

It let me escape from my stress full life to a world full of bunny rabbits. It was like a dream. I was into it from the begining to the end. I cryed at the end.

It's a book I've looked at over and over again through the years, and honestly thought that a novel about rabbits just couldn't be that engrossing. I was wrong, and I have suggested to all my reading friends who have also missed this treasure that they pick it up as soon as possible! It was delightful, and I find myself using it as a touchstone for any book I read now. My reading life can now be clearly identified into two separate periods...before Watership Down, and after Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"After I finished this book, I walked away from my kitchen table crying because it was so good, sad and amazing. If you haven't read this book yet, then get going! It's the best thing I've ever read, and I hope you feel the same way too. If anybody can walk away from this book unchanged, I don't know what else can make them feel something. I reccomend this book to anybody out there that knows how to read! But, I would be arrogant to say that I didn't find at least a few flaws. Mainly they were little things that I can't remember, so just read on yourself to find out the adventure that takes Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and the rest so far from home."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I loved Watership Down and though I'm only 13 years old and I am Dutch I fully understood the book and enjoyed it the whol way through. I think that the way Richard Adams describes the way rabbits live was very realisic, and even though talking rabbits seem a strange theme for a book, it was not boring in any way. While reading Watership Down I could feel with the characters and I was gripped by the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book when I was in fourth grade, and loved it. I remember they used to show the movie on CBS roughly once a year, and every time I would forget what it was about and enjoy it all over again. I took the book with me to the Soviet Union when I was in high school, and wound up giving it to a girl we were travelling with. It even got me hooked on Magic Cards, since the &quot;Thunder Spirits&quot; card has a quote from Watership down on it. I figured, if they're quoting WD, they can't be complete hacks.Very few books have gained the high place in my canon of stories that this one has. It takes an all-too human story - the desire to find and secure a place in life and society - and presents it from an alien angle. By writing about these rabbits, Adams is able to point out many qualities, both good and bad, that we ourselves possess. With gracefully handled allegory, Adams shows us how nobility, courage and trickery can overcome any evil, and can bring us to the promised land we have always looked for.What surprises most people upon whom I force this book is the characterization. One wouldn't expect, knowing that the book is about rabbits, to see the intensely well-defined characters that appear in this story. Everyone, from major characters such as Fiver and Woundwort to others, such as Silver, Blackavar and Bluebell, all have unique qualities with which one can identify and empathize.Somehow, reading this book always makes me feel a little more at peace with the world. I'm not sure why yet. Looks like I'll have to read it a few more times."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think this book was really great! My 7th grade math teacher recomended it to me. Thanks to him I have discovered another wonderful classic. I think Fiver was the most suspenseful character. What ever he predicted always made you wonder if it was going to come true or not. It made you want to keep turning the pages. This book also teaches you about the outside life. I think after you read this book it seems like you want to meet a rabbit in real life. And sort of get to know him. If you have not read this book read it its the best!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think Watership Down is a really good book if you like rabbits and reading about how they live.

I know there's danger there and we must leave!&quot; said Fiver. &quot;Oh, no can't you see Hazel! The field is full of blood!&quot; Fiver is a six month old rabbit who can sence danger when it's coming and Hazel is a 8 month old rabbit who is Fiver's brother and watches over him. If you want to know what the rabbits are fearing and what Hazel's reply to Fiver is then you should read it. This is a great book for experienced readers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is about a group of rabbits who sense danger. Fiver, Hazel, Bigwig, Pipkin and others go to find a new warren. They meet dangers and adventures. It is fantastic how the author makes the rabbits come to live, give them a religion, a character. Watership Down was gripping all the way through and I couldn't stop reading it. I recommend this, it is fantastic, I now even want the second book of it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've read this book in 9th grade and cherished it ever since. Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest of the Sandleford rabbits are spectacular characters, and you'll come to love them as if they are actually human beings as you read the novel. From dodging danger, crossing rivers, finding a new warren, so many things you will always remember. I recommend this book to people of all ages who's interested in adventure and excitement."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a plain and simple texted book. I didn't find any challenges in this fiction, which makes me question the motives of educators and why this book in particular is pushed so roughly towards readers at schools. There wasn't much conflict-i.e. action- except for the fact that the bunnies were the problems themselves...Animal Farm by George Orwell was much more of a challenge and a couldn't-put-it-down book. Oh well, fiction has always been going downward in the sense of working the minds, this one is an example of a simple work for the simple minds out there."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was too long in my opinion. When I read it I was in the fifth grade and recall that the book was a contemporary of Tolkien from England. The book was about the affairs of a rabbit warren and the small wars they fought among each other. The animals took on human characteristics, anthropomorphic characteristics, this aspect of the book was good but I think it should have been cut in half."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The only reason I read this at all was that it was assigned to me as a student. Other reviewers have pointed out that some books are better appreciated by an older rather than younger audience, but I can't imagine that being the case with this book. It was boring, monotonous, and devoid of any action whatsoever. A large slab of the book if I remember rightly, was devoted to descriptions of defecation.I can't imagine that I would appreciate it any better as an adult, and I will not be wasting my time trying to find out."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've waited for years to read this book, and by and large it didn't disappoint. Great story, interesting characters, largely fast flowing plot, and mostly a good metaphor: the metaphor of breaking from the herd, breaking from the old way, treating life as an adventure to be tackled, and taking risk and using ingenuity to accomplish a mission. I loved all that, and loved its message about the complacency of hutch rabbits (average humans!) - and how weak and lost we become when complacency takes over.BUT...The metaphor of the story ultimately breaks down because it becomes a \\"happily ever after\\" story. The whole purpose of the rabbits' ultimate mission in the second half of the book is to find ways to attract or procure female rabbits so they can mate, have babies, and just...ultimately live average, complacent lives. I admired their ingenuity in achieving this end, but what kind of message is this \\"end\\" in our modern world? Just more dating, mating, and procreating - exactly the complacency that is KILLING OUR PLANET.It's time for a new way: forget breeding like rabbits, stop the cycle of overpopulation, stop the spread of our species into new untamed lands, and instead scale back. Go within and heal our ancient wounds. Had the book had this message I would have liked it a thousand times more.Two other criticisms: 1) I found the mythical rabbit-and-God folktales within the book, the ones the rabbit storytellers told, to be EXTREMELY DULL. Once I realized they were not remotely an intrinsic part of the story I skipped them - whole chapters - to no great loss. That sped things up a lot. 2) The literary quotations at the beginning of each chapter were distracting and irrelevant, so after a few chapters I mostly ignored them."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is about a bunch of rabbits trying to save the destruction of their homes. It also talks about how the destruction of an animal's habitat hurts society. It talks about how society is impacted by the destruction of nature.I would this book because I believe nature and animals shouldn't be disturbed or destroyed. Too many houses are being built and the animals have no where to go."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"How can people rate this book a 10? It's about a group of rabbits that go on a journey to prevent themselves from an unknown tragedy in a warren that a small rabbit named Fiver had a premonition of. I mean it's a book about talking rabbits. I did enjoy the parts when they came across things during the journey, but I did not like the idea of rabbits as main characters. I am 14 and I don't think I'd waste my time reading this book again in ten years ."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've been forced to read this book for English class. Honestly, I liked some of the characters and their development was good, but the plot of this book was horrible. It was so boring, especially hearing about how plants look in the moonlight or rabbits \\"passing hraka\\" (hraka in \\"lapine\\" - another annoying feature- means \\"droppings\\"). I found the \\"El-Arairah\\" stories that were completely irrelevant to the main characters interesting and exciting. However, almost the rest of the book was ridiculously boring. If you plan on reading it, read a page a day for the next year and a half, that's the only way to stomach it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a book that my Gifted English class had to read and, as usual, over analyze. We read it over a long period of time with many tests, etc. and I was pretty disappointed. I know that with a story about talking bunnies you shouldn't expect too much but there was something telling me that this book may be a little bit more...I was wrong though. Blah Blah Blah is about all that I saw on the pages after about a week and eventually I just wanted to put the book down and begin stomping on it. I guess that in it's entirety it wasn't all that horrible but I have to ask myself if it was truly worth my time to read it and I am not sure what I would say. It has a lot to say but it could have been said in a much more condensed version. To be honest I could have cut at least a hundred pages from it and still been able to get the same message across. I guess that in the end I would have to say that if you really want to read this, go check it out at you local library."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"We read this book for an Honors English class this summer, and were not impressed. It was interesting to read Adam's idea of what warren life might be like, but this book is definately not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Reading 100 pages about how the rabbits &quot;silflay&quot; is not my idea of a good time. And what's with these funky names: Hyzenthlay, Bigwig, Chervil, and Thethuthinang? And do we really need to know about how they pass &quot;hraka&quot;?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The odd thing is I didn't find this book so extraordinary that it deserves 5 full stars (so many people over rate books) nor was it so horrendous to get 1 star (so many people don't know how to READ).

It faded from my thoughts quickly."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A fantastic book which I must beg you to read to your children.

People who don't like this book are UNEDUCATED. And as to the person who said the rabbits use words only an English professor could understand - you obviously only skimmed the book. The 'big words' were in Lapine, the language of the rabbits. And as to the reviewer who said that the main rabbit died at the end - uh...

I thought this book was going to suck when my friend recommended it. I mean by cover of the book you'd think that this story was going to be about these happy go lucky rabbits that have to find carrots. But not so it turns out that this book is about courage, leadership, and bravery as these rabbits journey into the beyonds in search of a place they can call their own.The story is pretty simple and I won't spoil any of it for you but I will tell you this: this storyis so wonderfully crafted and so beautifully told that you'll be hooked to it. Richar makes a great job of describing the characters and settings and such a beaoutiful job of bringing out your emotions in this book that you will change the way you look at things you will take this story and you will treasure it you'll fall in love with all the characters: Bigwig, Hazel-Rah, Fiver, Buckthorn, and all them \\"dam\\" rabbits and you'll cry at the sad, but happy and cheerful ending of this wonderful book.Overall: 5/5"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"By the looks of it, those who hate this novel pass it off as a children's book, or as rediculus, simply on the basis that it happens to star talking rabbits. I will try to withhold from being negative but...Anyway, the point is that the book is trying to convey an environmentalist message, you know, like how humans destroy nature and what its doing to the animals. You simply could not have done that had humans been the main characters. No, it HAD to be from the point of view of the animals. Saying that Watrersjip should star humans is like saying Tolkien shouldn't have made Middle Earth or that Feist shouldn't have made Medkemia... Why the hell would that make the story better? It would actually be worse because its farv more fantastic that way. We know Elves and Dwarves don't live on Earth, so putting LotR on Earth would be stupid. But how do we know if Middle Earth exists? We don't. Far more plausible.NO WHERE do the Rabbits talk to HUMANs, they're always talking to each other and occasionally other animals. This is plausible because we all know animals have some form of communication (Otherwise how would they keep PRides or Warrens together?). If they had ever talked to a person (not counting Fiver's dream later on) you critics would have a point.For me, I personally thought this book was great. Nice but rather simplistic story, and excellent characters. This book is MUCH better than the overrated Lord of the Rings trilogy.TW, About Rabbit Language... did you expect them to speak Plain English (all the time)?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of those books that makes you glad to be human, and capable of reading something like this - of being part of a larger universe. I read this book when it first came out in paperback and the wonder of it never left me. Years later I read it aloud to my son as I wanted him to know the same joy I had experienced in finding this great book. It is truly one of those &quot;must read&quot; classics. The premise did not thrill me at first. A bunch of rabbits look for a new home? Come on, talk about childish and trite!

This time though, I wanted a good quality copy hardback edition for reading again and again and this is perfect! I would recommend getting this edition if your thinking about it, either reading it again years after reading it the first time, or reading it for the first time. Its a treat to me to be able to read such a fine quality story in a fine quality edition. Excellent quality."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One of the best books I have read. Enjoyed it very much. Watership Down was recommended to be by a friend. I take the author at her word, that she was only writing the book for reading pleasure, and no relativity to human nature, but, whether intended, or not, there were many incidents of behavior of the rabbits that are common to human beings, at least to some (people) that I have known."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A lovely hard copy of the book with beautiful illustrations. My only criticism is that it's a bit big and heavy for small hands to hold which is a shame because it is a gift for my nine year old daughter, who loves reading but has mostly stuck to HP so far. She's started reading it though and really appreciates the quality and lovely writing. I am sure that once she gets into the story she'll be just as enthralled by it as I was at her age."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Of all the \\"summer reading\\" books I read, Watership Down by Richard Adams was the best. One of the things I liked about the book was that there was a world where animals could talk and do all sorts of human-like things. I liked that there were fights and a quest to find shelter in a new warren. I also learned something about rabbits and the way they really live. For instance, they live in big groups called warrens, instead of one rabbit all alone in the wilderness, which, before I read this book, I thought. Moreover, I learned that they are rough and ruthless, not cute and cuddly.There were not very many parts in the book that I did not like. The one thing that I did not like was that it started off slowly, but it was not that bad.Compared to my favorite novels that I have read, it was not that bad. The books that I would have rated a good solid five stars were the Harry Potter and Redwall series. I gave Watership Down four stars because I thought good but not amazing.In a way Redwall and Watership Down were alike. They were both about animal life including fights, foods, and habits. The real difference is that the animals in Redwall use weapons and live in fortresses.My overall impression of Watership Down is that it was a good, well written book that was interesting an enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to others because it was a fun book to read and did not feel like a waste of time. I wish there were a sequel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams' Watership Down is a tale about a small group of rabbits who decide to leave their home, when a young rabbit says that danger will be coming to the rabbits' home. In order to avoid the danger, a small group of rabbits leave at the warning, and start a search for a new place to live. After some time of wandering, the rabbits encounter several homes of unknown rabbits, who behave in strange ways. As they continue their search new mysteries and hardships are uncovered that must be overcome if the rabbits want to continue their journey, and live. After a prolonged trip the group learns new ways to live and a new place to begin their home. However, the new home not only brings new happiness it also brings new pains and sorrows.Watership Down is a great novel that really brings out how hard it is, for creatures of any kind, to move out of their home and into the wild, just because of what someone says. You begin to like many things about the rabbits and their many adventures that they have. Some great things about the book are when then the rabbits move from their home and first encounter what they have only dreamt about or heard about in stories. Some parts of the story are sudden and unexpected, but in most cases these happenings only add to the excitement and the thrill of the rabbits' adventures, however, in other cases these sudden happenings can make the story harder to understand if the reader was not paying much attention to what was happening. Another small downside is the book is a little long and it starts at a slower pace. But, this quickly changes into a fast paced story about survival and life.Novels can open up new experiences that many people won't see in their life, but only hear about. Books can also show people what the world is like, outside any one country. Novels about animals don't appear as often as novels about other things appear, but when a good subject is written they create great novels such as Watership Down. Some novels are as long as or even longer that Watership Down, but most novels are not nearly as fun, for any age, as Watership Down.Watership Down is a book that many could enjoy, and a book that many children, and adults could read with ease. I would say that if you enjoy reading books and can read English, Watership Down is a perfect choice for a good book you can read. The novel is not only easy to understand, but it also quick to draw people in. Even when a person hasn't read the book in a long time, Watership Down will still be in memory."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"For a summer reading assignment I read Watership Down. This was an excellent book with well-developed characters and great plot twists. I liked the action and many challenges in the book for the traveling rabbits who escape from there home \\"warren\\" (rabbit settlement) to find a better place to live, as the old warren is in the middle of a field that is marked off for construction. The rabbbits face many difficult challenges, like when the two smaller rabbits, Fiver and Pipkin, cannot swim accross a pond that the expedition of rabbits must cross. Blackberry, the cleverest rabbit in the group, solves the dilemna by putting the small rabbits on a piece of wood and floating them accross. This is only one example of the challenges Hazel, the leader, and his group faces as they try to find a home.Watership Down is more exciting than other novels I have read like Dicey's Song and Homecoming. There is more going on in Watership Down. Homecoming and Dicey's Song were not very exciting and they were predictable. Watership Down has many plot twists. Some times it is impossible to know what is going to happen next.Watership Down is a great book that gives the reader a frightened rabbit's point of view. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes animals, science fiction/fantasy, or anyone who wants a good long novel to read. The story is a little complicated, but a slightly above average reader will be able to read and enjoy Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember, as a kid, watching the animated movie on tv. Years later, I noticed the book on the family bookshelf. I pulled it down and started reading. I was lost in this makebelieve world with its own rules and language that Adams had created for me. Later, I joined the military and decided to put together my own bookshelf. I bought and read Watership Down again. Now the political messages started getting through, as well as the theological ones. This book is great but overlooked because people see a book about rabbits and move on by. Don't be this person. Escape to Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book when I was a junior in High School. I automatically loved it! I'm now in college, and it still remains my favorite story of all time, no matter how many new books I read! It's beautifully written, constantly entertaining, and is one of the few true page-turners. You will not get bored with this book. Without a doubt, it makes the list of things you should read during your lifetime."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I began reading Watership Down, I found it to be a bit difficult to follow. The European plants and terrain were all new to me. However, on the second page, I slowly began to be pulled into the lives of Hazel, et al. It is a delightful story told in an engaging way. A must read for animal lovers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I must first praise Richard Adams for the complete originality of this book. Adams introduces you to the rabbit culture telling you of their stories and the way in which they live. When a rabbit warren is in danger some flee to find a new home and other wait for impending doom. I have read this book twice in my lifetime and it still amazes me, it gives you the feeling of courage. You can tell by reading this book Adams has done his homework on the lives of wild animals. When our teacher first told us of this book I thought I would hate it. With no humans in the book (or only briefly mentioned) I thought it would be hard to relate to the characters(the rabbits). Adams does a fine job of bringing rabbits up to our level."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I liked Watership Down though it is very hard for me to understand at times.

After one of their friends has conniption and becomes convinced that their burrow is about to be destroyed, a band of bunnies leaves their home in search of some place to found a new colony of rabbits. The first two-thirds of this book is about their journey, the last third involves a battle undertaken against a headstrong rival warren that won't allow them to exist in their new home. The characters are brilliant, funny, and if you don't find yourself routing for them by the end I will be quite surprised. The world that Adams creates is complete in every way, including rabbit folklore, vocabulary, and even rabbit jokes. The adventure this book takes you on is not to be challenged and every climax seems like the end until the next one begins building to explode your brain even more. I dare any reader to finish this book and not swell with pride while thinking of Bigwig or Hazel or Blackthorn or any of these rabbits and the struggle they endure and persevere through to find a place that they can call home."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is a fascinating and complex book. It is full of hidden messages about society and how we live our lives. Being told from the prospective of rabbits softens the hard lessons and dramatic images of society. This book is a philosophical book that reads like a story. The distinct characters that are developed give this profound piece of writing the edge of a fantasy. You feel as if you are there, living through the eyes of Hazel, the lead rabbit. You see the different warrens, and you see the rabbits of each different community. As you read on, you are drawn into the lives of these rabbits as they search for a new burrow because their old one was destroyed by humans. You encounter many different ways of life, and you feel the tension of every dramatic encounter. You learn about different religions, governments, economies, education, and family. Each society of rabbits that you meet in this book is very different, each one mimicking different nations. Even with the great story the best part of the book comes when you finely start picking up on the fact that this book can be directly related to how we live our lives. This book will fast find its way to your heart, and the wonderful characters will make it stay. This book is best if you have a fascination with culture. However, you can enjoy it even if you couldn't care less about how society works.Zap 14 years old"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book kept a famly of 3 very engaged and happy for weeks.

I was looking to add a hardcover copy of this story to my library and this one is a very satisfactory addition."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You don't really need me to tell you. The eight hundred or so glowing reviews on this page (just so far) are at testament to the quality and beauty of this book. But if you're really reading this review without knowing anything about the book, here's a brief summary.The novel follows the tale of Hazel the rabbit and his various companions as they narrowly escape dangers in an attempt to establish their own warren (think of it as a rabbit community). It's tempting to interpret the trials that the rabbits face as if they are allegorical (there are spiritual themes, as well as lessons about unnatural behavior, helping those in need, and seeking peace before war), but in the preface Adams explicitly states that he meant nothing by the book other than to tell a story about rabbits. Although immersing one's self into the world of the rabbits -- including their habits and language (Lapine) -- takes a tiny bit of getting used to, once you are there, it's absorbing and real.Adams' prose is astounding and the characters are vibrant and distinct. For a book with such a large cast, rarely is it hard to distinguish one rabbit from another, and the conversations, actions, and obstacles that occur are imagined and related with stunning clarity. Obviously a naturalist, Adams demonstrates a keen eye for wilderness details. The pages seem to burst with the color, smells, and sounds of a world of wild animals.Others describe the book as flawless, but I wouldn't go that far. In spite of their evocative beauty, Adams' descriptions of the hills, rivers, and foliage are overdone at points. I wouldn't be surprised if the book contained, by name, every single native plant that could be found in the section of England where the action occurs. Although that level of detail is admirable, it is also distracting (I've never heard of most of these plants and even after reading the book couldn't tell you what they look like) and occasionally stabs at the pace of the novel.That brings me to my second minor quibble with the book. Although Adams has a craftsman's eye for detail and beauty, this works against him on a few of the novel's climactic moments. The action sequences seemed disjointed and clunky to me, especially since they relied so heavily on dialogue and -- again -- Adams' extensive use of detail. Ironically, there were points where he spent a paragraph or two describing a bridge or punt, and I still had difficulty picturing them in my head. It's a case of forest versus trees. Although Adams clearly knows he has a poet's ear for prose, he seems -- in just a few places -- not to realize that sometimes too many words can confuse rather than clarify.These are small issues (oh, and I didn't care for the constant epigraphs, either; they add literally nothing to the story, and after a time, I just stopped reading them) in what is otherwise an astounding book, which I would gladly recommend to everyone I know, young or old, jaded or no."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm currently going down the NPR listeners' list of the Top 100 Sci-Fi and Fantasy books. Watership Down was on this list. I had the vaguest sense that this was a book a classic, but aside from that, I knew only that this was a book about rabbits.So, thinking I was going to have a suffer through a silly book about rabbits in their silly little rabbit holes, I settled in and began to read. All the rabbits had names like Hazel, Big Wig, Dandelion, and Fiver, but for some reason these names fit their characters, and I nodded my head and said \\"okay.\\" I mean, what use for last names would rabbits have, since they don't have driver's licenses?When one prophetic rabbit convinces a few others that their home is threatened by men, I said \\"oh, that silly Fiver,\\" but I found myself concerned for the poor rabbits. Even worse, I realized I was thinking about these rabbits not as delectable woodland morsels but as individuals in peril.About a quarter of the way into the book, I realized that that clever Richard Adams had drawn me into a world with its own mythology, history, and vocabulary, and created a work not about rabbits but about courage, perseverance, and friendship.I give this book five stars.Three cheers for myths about rabbits!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember reading WATERSHIP DOWN when I was thirteen years old and it scared the heck out of me. In the flavor of RATS OF NIHM, Adams uses animals to tell his story. We follow a group of rabbits, who decide it's time to find a new home.Cute, cuddly rabbits make for a happy story, right? In this tale we are reminded that rabbits are on the bottom of the food chain. Large birds, cats, dogs and people all equal death for our lead characters.Lead by Hazel and his smaller brother Fiver, the group of rabbits start a dangerous expedition, which could destroy their entire warren. Hazel's group is befriended by other rabbits with devastating agendas and find help in the least expected places.WATERSHIP DOWN is an inspiring story of perseverance. We find out that even the smallest play important roles and everybody loves rooting for the underdog, or rabbit in this case."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The story was suspenseful,a cliff-hanger.

I have read literally, thousands of books, everything from Shakespeare and Dickens to Stephen King and Star Trek(all of which I enjoy) but Watership Down remains my favorite. All I can say about some of the other reviews is: No one with an ounce of intelligence or compassion could possibly hate this book. It can be seen from many different viewpoints, as a condemnation of man's cruelty to his fellow creatures, as an adventure story, as an allegory, and also as a story about wild rabbits. I love the stories about El-ahrairah and the Lapine words. Having rabbits of my own, I see aspects of the characters in their individual personalities.

This book is strong in characterization, giving each rabbit distinct traits and personalities, all very human. And you will probably empathize with these rabbits in their quest for a safe haven, just as I did.There are some faults, though: the rabbits constantly switch between using Lapine (rabbit language) words and plain English ones, which withholds you from enjoying the new lexicon Adams had came up with. And be forewarned: in some segments, Adams indulges in lenghthy descriptions, breaking the rythm he had stablished to his prose."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm one of the rare few teenagers that actually liked Watership Down. Even though it is about talking bunnies, I still enjoyed it very much, I even found myself nearly crying at the end of the book. The talking bunnies was a good idea, because it make you look at the bunnies as humans, not just another animal. The story is moving, the plot is good, I even want to reread the book. Now all I have to do is see the movie and read another of Adam's classics the Plauge Dogs."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Watershp Down&quot;.

If rabbits could talk, *this* is what you would hear them say. This is what rabbits actually would and *do* do, and with a touch of personification, Adams does a masterful job! The action, the conflicts, the poetry, all contribute to this beautiful geode hidden beneath that rock of steryotypes.

His way of writing life into animal characters is simply amazing, especially when you take into account how much he researched rabbits before writing this book. You can feel Hazel's resentment of being chosen leader as he must confront mutiny within his group of rabbits. A simple walk through the forest takes on a different meaning through the eyes of a rabbit. And the sheer inhumanity of man-traps is meticulously detailed and put in to perspective by Adams. This book is not just about a group of rabbits. It is about the sheer will to survive inherent in every animal on earth, including humans. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was probably the best book I ever read. It was suspenceful and enchanting. It started with two rabbit brothers, Hazel, and Fiver. Fiver was a sort of sphycic who thought their city was doomed. Only hazel and a few others believed him. These rabbits set of to find a new city to live in. They build their own city, and call it Watership Down. They journied to another city to get more rabbits to join their city. Rabbit officers follow them, and a war started. It was really suspencefull while they encouter all sorts of obsticles such as the cat at the farm, or the war between the two cities. I loved the stories they told. They told enchanting stories about gods and princes, heroes and tricksters. I became so attached to the charectors especially Fiver because he is cute and daring. He risked his own life as well as the lifes of the others on his crazy hunch. All around, I loved this book"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read Watership Down when I was 9 years old. I loved it. My father gave it to me after he read it and he loved it too. The idea of talking rabbits may not seem like a good basis for a novel, but the book Watership Down is truely great."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams must have had quite a fun time writing the adventures of this merry band of rabbits lead by a rabbit called Hazel. He not only made a book which is practically 99,5% populated by animals only, but he also developed the so-called &quot;Lapine dialect&quot; and a whole foundation ground of legends and mysticism in their world, with the daring tales of their folk hero El-ahrairah, as recollected by the storytelling rabbit of the lot, Dandelion. Its a magical book, for kids of all ages. Well recommended!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adams' eloquent tale of a band of rabbits searching for freedom and safety can strike a chord with humans as well. The bonds of friendship forged in adversity are easily understood by anyone who has withstood considerable odds and come out all right. Adams explains the lapine world through their eyes, complete with a &quot;Lapine Glossary&quot; for those not in the know of rabbitspeak. The protagonists are given very distinct--human, if you will--traits and personalities. Adams creates his own microcosm of our world by bringing up themes familiar to our own world and the creation of new civilizations: the development of leadership and structure, roles in a society, and mutual respect for the members of a competent cadre. Hazel-rah, Bigwig, Fiver, Blackberry, Dandelion, and the rest inhabit a world not unlike our own. This is an adventure, a fairy tale, a parable, and the makings of a legend and a classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams is by far one of the best authors who include so much detail that the reader feels that they are right there in the story. Watership Down is about a group of adventeurous rabbits who journey from their devastated warren and to Watership Down, a place where they can live tranquil lives. I first chose to read this book for a school reading project, and wasn't very excited. After the first few chapters, however, I read the book whenever I could get the chance. This book is my favorite, and I have read it 4 times finding each time even more exciting! I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read, for almost anyone will enjoy it. It is worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A warm and wonderful book. Sadness, happiness, defeat, victory, it is all told in this tale of a rabbit community suddenly faced with disaster."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This wonderful, heartwarming tale is about a group of rabbits lead by a rabbit named Hazel. It is great and I highly recommend you buy this book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I just read WaterShip Sown in about 3 days... I couldn't put it down! I thought that it was a great book! It was very detailed, and I felt as though i was not a reader, but an active partcipant in the book.... Fighting Woundwort, and creating the ner warren! The only thing I disliked about this book was all of the rabbit language... I was often confused by it, and I had to reread things, such as el a hraira and elil, I mean why not call them by what we know.... But all in all, a great book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a wonderful book! I don't need to say anymore as there are more than 100 other reviews here. I have to say, though, that if you like this book, you'll love the Redwall series that was written in the tradition of Watership Down. The author of the the Redwall series is Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book in eighth grade. I then read it my freshman year and my senior year. Each time I enjoyed it more. I would suggest this book to anyone that can read. It is definately not just about a bunch of rabbits. It's about the struggle of survival and overcoming incredible odds."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Excellent novel! Read in one sitting. **for the college buffs...this book takes an anthropomorphic dive into our own existence of morals and ultimate survival.** FOR THE REST OF US...extremely impressive look at our own lives through the non-offensive, universally appealing, rabbit. This book has it all! Survival and the continuing struggle for the right to see tomorrow...freely. Adventure abounds and involvement of the reader is impossible to restrain (I still speak 'rabbit' when the occasion warrants). The parallels are neverending to war, life, desire, suppression, on and on and on. Beautifully written and an absolute thrill to read. I've seen the movie..doesn't/can't compare with the book. Read first then rent the flick. This, I would recommend, should not be a book for the younger crowd nor for those immature in thought. I have told everyone about this book..those that love to read and those that do not. Did I say yet that this book has it all? FANTASTIC!!! p.s. amazon should make an exception and allow the critic to give '6' stars!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"of courage, cleverness, heroism, and love. The characters are a group of brave rabbits trying to start a new way home. It may sound like a kiddie book, but Watership Down has something for everyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"An apocolypse for rabbits tied in with war, friendship, compassion, rivalry, and spellbounding excitement. I read it through without pausing. A masterful role played by Richard Adams. From the Sandleford Owsla to General Woundwort, it was a great piece of literature that every child needs to be introduced to.-Evan Howard, age 12"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"If you don't read this book, either you are very busy or very mistaken! I read this book this year in English class had a HUGE test over it &amp; loved every minute of it! I loved the way way Adams gave the rabbits names, character &amp; attitudes. I loved reading the book out loud in class, taking notes &amp; whining to the teacher about letting us skip math class so we could read more! So read this book for the pure enjoyment of the book &amp; life from a different point of view."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I first picked up this book, I nearly put it right back. Who'd want to read a book about rabbits? However, it turned out to be a remarkably original book. It managed to give human feeling to animals, without becoming a &quot;kiddie&quot; book. It does lack the sophistication, complexity and sublety that the more jaded reader might be used to, but it more than makes up for this with the excellent writing and character development, especially that of Hazel. It is unfortunate that modern readers might feel distanced from the cold war and ecological underthemes of the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read Watership Down in the summer before 4th grade. I still love it!!! Watership Down is amazing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There are ONLY two kinds of people who didn't enjoy Watership Down. The first were too young to understand it--I'm talking maturity here, not chronology. The second were those who were disappointed that a book about rabbits didn't have more to do with sex. The former should stick with Goosebumps and Sweet Valley High until they're a little older. The latter should invest in a subscription to the smut magazine of their choice."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of the most thrilling reads of the 20th century. Adams manages not to stereotype any human counterparts in his portrayal of another life form. Watership Down will entertain readers of any age with adventure and cliffhangers, but deeper readings are possible for the more mature. The book's onion skin layers are a evidence of a work that transcends the bestseller list and becomes Literature. Please, read this book more than once. If you enjoy T.S. Eliot (or Lawrence Durrell's &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot;) you will feel at home in Cowslip's warren. I promise you a look into post-WWII English life that will teach you about human nature's cliffs and valleys through the Down's lapine characters."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the best books i've ever read. It also has some of my favorite characters created in literature. You really feel for those rabbits."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of the few books I have ever actually read twice. It was just as good if not better the second time around. A story about a society of rabbits would seem to be a most unlikely plot line for a book. Yet, Ricard Adam's manage to create a stunning masterpiece. I will cherish this book for as long as I am alive."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was very well written and easy to follow. I enjoyed reading the book and thought it to be an excellent example of literature."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm 14 years old, and was assigned to read this for Literature Class, I love it. I reccomend it to ANYONE who can read. You'll never look at rabbits the same way again!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adams shows a world not driven by greed, strife, and domination, but of hope, determination, and of life. These rabbits are an allusion of how an idealstic society should be where good triumphs over evil."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book years ago, but it is still one of my favorite books. If you have read this book and like it, (I don't think anyone would not like it!) I would suggest the Redwall seires to you, and also C. S. Lewis's Narnia and the Space Trilology. This book is for all ages, everyone would enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I had to read this book for seventh grade English class, and I think that is a very good book with interesting plot and character development, but sometimes there are long lulls where nothing really happens (for example when the rabbits are starting the warren on Watership Down). Also, the story dragged on and on. When I thought that it might (finally) end, Adams came up with another plot twist and started off on another great long adventure.To all you who say that it's unrealistic because the rabbits talk, consider this: IT'S FANTASY! If you want a novel with people, go read Tom Clancy, but I think that these rabbits make for very good characters."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my favorite book. The last 100 pages are amazing. If you don't buy it, it's your loss."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book is overall well enough written, but it does lack in plot and story sometimes, and it seems that the violence is put only into the story because as a decoy to the fact that there is no other thing to do at that point."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have read hundredes of books, but &quot;Watership Down&quot; is still among my favorites. The stoy is fine to read to little kids because the characters are interesting and and fun to hear about. Adults like this too. The different levels of meaning are many, making this a good story to read several times.The plot is skillfully done and very entertaining. It would be pointless to restate everything that has been said so many times already, but they are all true. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book has everything. From politics, religion, and social behavior. This book alows you to leave this world and enter the world of the rabbits. I read a review for this book by the Cincinnati Enquire. It said if you can read English , you have to read this book. They were right. I put this book in my top five that I have ever read. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I started reading Watership Down for a school book report and thought it was going to take forever (400+pages). In the beginning, reading the book was a chore to me. I soon got into the book and found that it wasn't so bad and by the end it had become one of my favorites. The only bad part about this is that now I have to write a book report!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One summer when I was about 10, our local library sponsored a reading contest. 'Watership Down' was the first book on the list. Judging from this title, I figured it would be a boring story somewhat like Titanic. When I found the book, I was surprised to find it a) so big and b) about rabbits?? Well, I read it 2 times, and bought a paperback copy a year later. I can honestly say this is the best animal story I've ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book, long as it is, is a good read for those who enjoy animal personifications in a metaphorical sense, however, I personally, did not enjoy it. The plot, though well developed, took many chapters to reach a climax.. so many chapters that interest was lost. A book for some, but not for everyone/"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams must be a genius to write such an excellent book! I am 12 years old and I had to read this book for school... I thought 'Oh great, another boring book' but HOW WRONG I WAS! It turned out that now I think THIS IS THE BEST BOOK... The movie was just as good. Although this book is rather long, your on the edge of your seat the whole time!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is probably the best book I have ever read in my life!! It has adventure suspense and excitement. Although I am only in fifth grade and I will read many,many more books this I predict this will be the best one. I have only read one of Richard Adams books but I know that he must be a creative genius.And can I just say to the person who said they got to page 3 and couldn't continue,you have to read just a tad farther with any book to get to a good part!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is great fiction -- it takes you out of your world and transports you to the fictional one the author has created so well that you remember the characters for years afterwards ... and they're RABBITS!My dad read this book to me aloud when I was a kid (8-9 years old) and I liked it because I loved rabbits. Re-reading it as an adult, I picked up on the philosophical commentary on life that the author weaves (skillfully) into the story and enjoyed it even more."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I thought this book was very good. The best aspect of the work would have to be how original the storyline was. It's the first book I have ever read that has ever dealt with the life of rabbits. There have been books like the Redwall series from Brian Jacques but it made the animals too human like. Also, the book was a good mix of the &quot;Defend the castle plot&quot; like in Redwall, and the &quot;long journey plot&quot; as in Lord of the Rings. In the beginning it started out as a &quot;long journey plot&quot; since they were journying from one warren and I just figured the whole book would be like that. Then once that started to get old they find Watership Down and all of a sudden it's a &quot;defend the castle&quot; since they build it up and defend it for the rest of the book. It was one of the best books I have ever read and the plot was definitly the most creative. If anyone disagrees I would like you to mail me at this adress."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book this last year (I'm 11) and when I was on page 200 or somewere like that I went out and boaght a hardback copy, and still had to read it all. This book is sooooooooooooo good. Lets just say it's gonna last longer than me!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is one of my favorites! Although many people (as shown in the other reviews), who have only gotten to page three, have seen that it is a terrible book. But, in my perspective, I can not see how anyone, just plainly reading up to page three could rate the book a one or two or three. This book in inspiring, with the rabbits trying to make a new home. When I was reading the part in which Bigwig almost passed away in the trap, I even almost cried. Even though I'm only eleven, this book seems great for a reader who enjoys bunnies and a great adventure!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I was about four, I fell in love with the annimations from the movie Watership Down, not actually grasping what the real meaning was. I never forgot the title, yet felt too young to tackle the giant book sitting high on the shelf of the public library. Finally in Jr. High I read Watership Down for the first time, and I continue to read it at least once a year. I have never been so touched by anything before, especially a book. I know some people don't like it, but they don't grasp the higher meaning of the story, or the detail and humanity of the characters. The movie is no where near as wonderful, but is a good reference for picturing and hearing the characters in your mind. I wouldn't know that the book begins with &quot;the priroses were over&quot; and ends with &quot;the first primroses were beginning to bloom&quot; (showing the never-ending cycle of life) if I hadn't read it over and over again; and I wouldn't have done that if it wasn't the best book I had ever read. Please enlighten yourself and read it. Don't forget the tissues."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Have you ever thought that something might be more or less than it really is, and then realized that it didn't really matter either way? What I mean is, whatever that something was has left you with an intangible memory; a memory that you can feel instead of one that you can only remeber. Well, Watership Down, to me, is that something. And I know that the story is one of talking rabbits, and may seem childish, but can something really be childish to a child? No. And we were all children once."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am currently a junior in high school and was required to read this novel. Although it is somewhat slow-moving at first, it quickly becomes quite involved and interesting. Although most of my classmates disliked this book, I found it has serious implications about human behavior, society and survival. I definitley recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am a fiction editor, as well as an avid reader of several different genres--and I absolutely loved this novel! Mr. Adams was inspired to write this novel after creating it as a verbal story to his grandchildren. I didn't read it until I was 25-years old--and I liked it so much that I found an antiquarian first edition to add to my library. I would recommend this to everyone! ADVISE FOR THE young REVIEWER WHO GAVE THIS BOOK A 1: GROW UP! Just because you read lots of books, doesn't mean you are emotionally ready or able to understand them. If you hated this book so much--perhaps you are too young to grasp the real message it holds. Try reading this again in about 15 years!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"If you like rabbits, or even are just looking for something to read, this is the book for you. One day, I had nothing to read. So i went to my bookshelf and found this book. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down!!!!! I love to read, and this is one of my two or three favorite books. So, add this book to your shopping cart today. And, when you are finished reading this book, there is a sequal, also by Richard Adams. It is equally good. :-) By Katie Brown"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It was about rabbits who travled a long way, from their old warren because one of the rabbits fortold that something would happen to that warren. It was a great book. I highly recomned it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The essence of literature. If you haven't read this, you're missing a lot.

It was truley amazing. I enjoyed reading it and learning about rabbits. My favorite character was Keehar."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the book I have been searching for, for some time now. I was enthralled from the beginning, taken with the idea of following Rabbits on an adventure. The alagorical sense of the book is clear from the start, but I let myself just enjoy the story the first time through, sure that I will disect this book over many future readings. I found myself unable to remain seated as I read 'Cry havoc! And let slip the dogs of war!' Shakespear for sure, but fitting in this epic novel. This book has all the adventure, suspense and glory of the great works in fiction, all told from a Rabbit's point of view. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for inspiration in their life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I chose to read this book for my 10th grade honors English. I was surprised at how great of a book it is... there is alot more to it than battles (although the battles are awesome)... Adams has crawled into the minds of Rabbits, and how well he does it. The story begins with a rabbit having a strong premonition of danger. They gather as many rabbits that will come with them and set out across the plains of England. They have to outwit predators, people, and other dangers like rivers to get to... well, they don't know where they're going! However, they soon catch sight of Watership Down in the distance, and head for it. They soon build a warren and try to live in peace. However, they find they have another problem to face when they realize that there are no female rabbits! They have to raid a terribly war-like and horrible warren to get them, and the accounts of battles for the rabbits to escape with their lives are enthralling! Only later do they learn what has happened from the home they left...I definitely reccomend this book to anyone who can read it. This is a great story that nearly made me cry at the end ( and I'm a guy so thats pretty tough!) READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I put it plain and simple, this was a great book.I don't want to make it look like I can't respect other people's opinions, but please. People put down \\"This book sucks!\\" and that's all. Give a reason.Here, I'll give you a reason it was good. Unlike other authors, Richard Adams actually studied about the animals in the book. You could believe what was happening in the book. I'm glad I had to read it for English."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The Secret Life of RabbitsWow!! If you haven't read this book before you really should. Primarily it follows the adventures of four or five main charactersHazel, Fiver, Big Wig and Dandelion and there followers. The cast is wide and varied and the detail is incredible. Mr. Adams has created a wonderful story here not just a story of rabbits fleeing their home in search of a better life. This story is also about their myth and culture and there are several chapters about the rabbit hero Elerray Ra kind of a mythological hero/ trickster god.Overall-Wonderful book, you can really have fun while you are reading it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is an engaging and charming tale of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Pipkin and the rest of their group in their quest for a safe home.I will outline briefly the plot for you and then go into some of the aspects of the book that I found really creative and interesting. Fiver and Hazel are friends in a large and peaceful warren when Fiver, who is a kind of \\"seer,\\" senses great danger for all the rabbits who live there. The two rabbits meet with their chief rabbit, but he does not act on their warnings, so they leave with a group of rabbits, including Bigwig, a member of the Chief's guard, to find a safer home. They have many adventures on their way to Watership Down, where they decide to dig their new place. Then, they realize that a bunch of guys without women aren't going to have a warren for long, so hatch two plans to recruit female rabbits to their new warren. More adventures ensue, and a clever, funny, nail-biting, exciting and touching ending is reached.It's such an engaging adventure story, and Adams tells it touchingly as an anthropological tale as well, including footnotes on lapine language (such as \\"Hrududu\\" for car, \\"elil\\" for enemies of rabbits, etc.) and culture and breaking up the line of the narrative with rabbit folklore of their trickster figure and their deities. The other warrens they encounter seem to be somewhat didactic plot devices in the book, but this aspect of the story does not overwhelm its charm and attraction.It's a beautiful book and makes me look at rabbits in a new way! I recommend it and I think it would be good for young adults on through adulthood."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"(On an aside, one person noted that the high school students were panning the book? I am a freshman who had to read this for her Honors English class, and I found it highly interesting. Then again, I am a bibliophile. Many people in my class find it cool as well, so generalization gets you nowhere.)Fiver predicts the downfall of the Sandleford warren, where he is an &quot;outskirter&quot;. To understand these terms you need to know the basic structure of a warren.~Chief Rabbit, who, obviously, is the chief. He's kind of pampered by the ...Owsla. A small army of sorts, who run the warren and check for dangers.They also get the Chief fresh lettuce, as he doesn't &quot;silflay&quot; (Lapine word for &quot;eating food above ground&quot;).There's everyone else, the outskirters.Anyway, Fiver and Hazel, his friend, get together a small band to leave the warren. They encounter many, many things along the way, like Cowslip's warren, where nothing is really what it seems. And they come to where they'll make their warren...Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Well, I loved this book well enough in grade school, and junior high, but by the end of High School the re-readability was just about nil.While the story itself is grand, the barely hidden commentary on human societies gets a little annoying (once you realize what you are reading). Much like Narnia, this book started to loose interest as soon as I realised what the Author was tying to do.Ah, to be young again... ^_~"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is an amazing, action packed book about a group of rabbits that leave their warren and go on a rigorous journey to settle in a new peaceful warren. The rabbits travel from their own warren because one of he rabbits named Fiver has a feeling that something bad is going to happen. The rabbit's brother, Hazel believes Fiver because Fiver has been known o predict things that have come true. A band of rabbits joins Fiver and Hazel to go on the journey. Some join because they are friends and others join because they don't like life in the warren. The story describes how this group of rabbits handle working together to stay alive, and dangerous situations. The rabbits travel alone over the open English countryside trying to avoid predators and unfriendly rabbits both trying to kill anything that crosses their paths. I liked the suspense and all the tragic events that occurred over the course of the story. The parts when the rabbits are hiding from predators and when they barely out run enemy rabbits. And when the rabbits hear news that their old warren has been destroyed and everyone died. Most chapter books will be long and have no interesting parts but this book is the opposite. The Author holds your attention through out the whole book and never leaves you bored. I gave this a five on the reading list because of action, sadness, and yet happiness. It has many sad parts like when one of the rabbits dies or get hurt. Yet all of a sudden the mood changes when they realize the rabbit is not dead, just badly hurt. They all jump for joy and there is a happy mood restored to the story. I advise this book to anyone who likes action and survival stories. And, oh yeah this book is told from the rabbits' point of view, so there are words you have never heard of. But there is a dictionary in the back of the book that tells you what the words mean."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This story ranks right up there with, 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Wizard of Oz', and \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" as one of the best adventure novels I've ever read. To be honest, when I first heard it was a story about a bunch of rabbits I wasn't very optimistic that it could have anywhere near as much action in it as it did. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that I was wrong in this regard.The main character is a buck named Hazel (not exactly the name I would have picked for a main character) who leads by utilizing the best assets of the other rabbits around him, each of which has his own special attribute. (They are either a good fighter, runner, storyteller, fortuneteller, tracker, builder, or has the ability to cheer everyone up around them with a good joke.)Due to a premonition that one of the rabbits received (Fiver), Hazel leads a group of rabbits to find a new burrow before impending doom falls upon the warren they lived in. On the way they have to avert many dangers and overcome several difficulties.At one point they find a burrow of rabbits who look in excellent health, but they have some dark hidden secret which they are not sharing. It reminds me of a scene out of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine' when the main character travels into the future to finds people being treated like cattle.Richard Adams does an excellent job maintaining all of the rabbits nuances while at the same time giving them additional human attributes. They behave in military fashion, have a type of religion, create art, play games, make up poems, and tell stories. (I especially loved the stories of El-ahrairah who is a very clever rabbit much like Brair-rabbit.)Some of the rabbits in this book have tried to better themselves. In some instances this is shown as a good thing, and in others it is quite harmful. This is done similar to how Mary Shelly in her novel 'Frankenstein' showed the effects of what happens when man tries to act like God.General Woundwort who is the villain is shown in both regards. His warren is prosperous and safe, but he eventually turns into a tyrant. He also has the strength to take on bigger animals than himself which is an unnatural trait for a rabbit.Overall I'd say this book was excellent, and I think it deserves to be listed as one of the best novels of all time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"WATERSHIP DOWN is a remarkable tale about the subjects of Leadership and Home all set within the world of rabbits. This classic is about how to lead others (a subject familiar to all cultures making this a truly universal story) and, surprisingly, the leader is not the smartest, strongest, swiftest, biggest, or most likeable of the group, but a leader who knows how to unite others, value others' contributions, and make decisions.A great book that gets better and deeper every time I read it. One of my absolute favorites."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"While the main characters in _Watership Down_ are rabbits, and they behave in very rabbit-like ways, the themes are very human: the displacement of a populace by a force both unjust and unstoppable, the fallacy of relying on physical strength and conventional wisdom rather than intelligence and creative thinking, the sacrifice of standing one's ground in the face of danger and death, and the loyalty owed to one's friends. I recommend this book for those who enjoy reading fantasy and literature, those who find pleasure in beautiful descriptions of the English countryside, and those who love animals."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I didn't read the book first. I saw an animated version of the book back in the early eighties. When I saw this version as a child it kind of scared me, especially the bloody scenes with the dog and the mean rabbits. But still I was mesmerized. This story has a spiritual quality unlike children's books I've read before. I felt my soul was being fed when I read some of the rabbit myths in the book. The ending was incredible. Reminded me that like humans, animals have a place in the hereafter. This was actually the third book that I've read more than twice by myself. Excellent use of myth, legends, character development and adventure."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My sister gave me this book for Christmas. I had adopted a rabbit (who was bound for slaughter) over the summer so I was especially interested in reading this book.As it takes place in southern England some of the terms and style of writing were unfamiliar to me, but I got used to it after the first hundred pages or so.Overall a great book for anyone. And you do actually learn quite a few facts about rabbits that might come in handy at some point!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have to admit that I was very skeptical of this book initially. I didn't think a book about rabbits could be very interesting, but I was certainly proven wrong. This is the best book that I've read in a long, long time. It has all the elements of great storytelling and it really makes you think. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It's quite a page turner and it kept me reading until late at night. I just had to find out the fate of the rabbits!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the great books of the centrury. Richard Adams has effectively captured a fictional representation of what life for a rabbit could be like. The adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, and company after successfully escaping the destruction of their original warren thanks to the warnings of one of their comrades is a delight for all ages. What I love most about this text is the details with which Adams has presented these animals. He has created a whole world, complete with language and mythology for these animals to draw upon. The pacing is quick and you can't help but plow through it. For me, much of the book was about finding home and what you were willing to do to not only find one, but also defend it (although Adams maintains it has no allegorical significance). I think this is one of those great books you revisit every year, finding new things with every reading. Buy it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Admittedly the premise of Watership Down by Richard Adams is a little silly, especially when you try explaining to people that you are reading this absolutely wonderful book that has adventure, romance, frightful villains, bravery and sadness-- and then tell them that the book is about a bunch of rabbits.However, by the time you finish reading the third page, you have forgotten that the characters are rabbits and you fall in love with Hazel and his brother Fiver. Fiver has always been a little odd, and he has a vision of a great danger approaching the pleasant little warren where they live. Although Hazel and Fiver try to warn the elders of the warren about the danger, the elders refuse to listen.And thus begins the amazing journey of Hazel and Fiver and their small group of believers as they cross dangerous territory filled with fierce dogs, a vicious, piratical rival rabbit's warren, and a great river to make a new home at Watership Down.Richard Adams has so convincingly created a society, legends and language for the rabbits that you absolutely believe that rabbits do think, feel, talk, and act as they do in the book. Along the way they pick up some unusual allies, not the least of whom is Kee-har, an injured bird the rabbits rescue and nurse back to life. Kee-har repays the kindness of the rabbits in many ways and also adds some welcome humor to the often tense and frightening scenes.If you have ever wondered if there is something better around the bend, and if you believe in friendship, loyalty and courage, try reading Watership Down. It is so much more than a book about a group of rabbits. It is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"For some reason I always thought that watership down was the story of a sinking ship and how its passengers were rescued. Boy was I surprised, wonderfully surprised. The more I read the more I wanted to find out what would happen next. I had a little trouble at first with some of the names such as Hazel for a male but that quickly passed as I became more engrossed in the book. The book is funny, sad, happpy and mostly a testament to courage and perseverance. I was thrilled with the group's triumphs, and saddened by their mishaps. On some levels this may be considered a children's book but it's really for folks of all ages who love a well-told story. This is not a book I will give away, sell, or dump in the garbage. This one stays on my shelf to be read again and again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"\\"Watership Down\\" and \\"Tales from Watership Dowwn\\", are great books. Both of them keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next part. Ireccomend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book should be read by all, the way he personifies the rabbits is grand, along with the ups and downs surrounding this novel. I don't really see any real reason that many would hate this book. The way he gives them a religion and the stories flows so nicely from start to end. It really changes your perspective on many things. I thought it was a great read and everyone would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've read Hemingway, Steinbeck, Conrad, Fitzgerald, and on and on and on. One tires of Hemingway's tireless digressions and narcissistic portrayals of himself. Steinbeck's attempts to create atmosphere in order to overcome substance just didn't seem to cut. I just don't like fiction because the author's seem to be living in a &quot;dream land&quot; and they then project this onto the written page. Then I read a book about a bunch of bunnies. In fact I read it twice. The first fifty pages will be hard reading. Simply because the bunnies are simply not very romantic and are simply trying to survive. The writing itself is incredible. But what makes this book great is that these bunnies are how people actually are in real life! We have always known people how are quiet but natural born leaders. People, at first, look down on them. But their dipolomacy and selflessness leads a group into safety. He is truly brave but not a &quot;natural born&quot; fighter. Then there is thefighter with a heart of gold and filled with good intentions. These people do not want to show how much they care so they are a little bit aggressive. And they are not diplomats. The first is Hazel, who isn't a small rabbit, but slightly less than average in size. Bigwig is the second. He is a large rabbit and a great fighter. The one rabbit who Bigfoot will finally confront is one big mean &quot;Momma&quot;. Whew! These type of people want power and control. The more power and control they lose, the more they want. They usually self-destruct. It's a bit different with this rabbit. Hazel will lead his rabbits among thick and thin. But the amazing thing is that he knows how to pick the talents of his group and he doesn't seem to have any real unique talent except to size up the situation totally. That and his unselfishness. He even calls on his weak brother, Fiver, for his intuition. But the main genius of this book is the exact match of bunnies with all the humans we we have met (which is really quite funny!). One bunny just conforms to his fate and takes everything that is tossed at him. I won't talk about this warren. It is chilling to the bone. I would rather watch the &quot;holocaust&quot; on TV. Stephen King, the horror writer, stated that this book can really &quot;chill&quot; you out with horror. What humans or rabbits can do under adverse conditions is quite sick and understandable. I keep &quot;blanking out&quot; when I remember that part of the book. The end comes in a smashing series of encounters in which you know that Hazel-rah (the leader) can not simply win. In fact, a very small chance. To see if he wins, buy the book and read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderful book with vivid description and an entrancing plot. The author shows the social behavior of rabbits and also shows how particular rabbits changed their ways of life to adapt to different situations. He makes you feel as if you are part of the book and the wonderfully developed characters seem to form a special bond with you as you face fear after fear and adventure after adventure with them. Fiver, a tiny rabbit, begins to sense danger in the flourishing warren he lives in. His friend, Hazel, doesn't want to believe Fiver but knows he he\\\\as an uncanny knack for forseeing what is to come. Hazel helps Fiver round up a small band of rabbits and together they set out on an adventure to get away from the danger Fiver feels and to find the high, dry ploace Fiver tells himis the perfect place to start a new warren. On their way they meet many troubles including encounters with eili (the rabbit term for enemies of rabbits such as foxes, owls, and humans) and even rabbits much like themselves, but with a dark secret. Yet, even when they find Fiver's perfect place, their struggle for survival doesn't end, it has just began. Watership Down has a complex, but enjoyable plot. Just as one conflict is resolved, another is introduced. You can predict what the rabbits are going to do, but sometmies they will surprise you as the plot takes a suspenseful twist. Suspense builds and keeps you with your nose in the binding. The ways the rabbits react to the conflicts show their distinct and unique personalities. Each character is different and as you read you get to know each one as if they wre old friends. Bigwig, a former Osla (rabbit army) member is a rabbit that you can always count on to be there when another rabbit is in trouble and will stay loyal to his friends at all costs. Fiver, whe seems to be a shy, young, and indeciseive rabbit in the begining of the story quickly changes as he becomes adjust to his new found riends. He, much to your surprise, ends up making many important decisions and isn't just a follower, but a stong leader. The author's writing style is one of my favorate parts of the story. He uses much rabbit terminology and adds rabbit language vocabulary into the tale. As you read, you get to know the vocabluary and this makes you feel as if you are really part of the story, talking with the rabbits. Watership Down may sound like a story that would be a fairytale because of the communicating rabbits and other animals. However, this story really seems very realistic and not very made up at all! I really enjoyed reading Watership Down. The plot, characters, and the author's writing style made is one of the best books I have ever read. I give this book 5 stars and recomend reading this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am 11 and I loved this book! I think the author did a wonderful job of describing the scenary in the book. I also thought it had good charactors and a creative plot."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is truly one of the best books that I have read. I do have to admit that the beginning of the book was a little boring, but if you can get past the first 100 pages or so, Adams makes up for it 10 times over! There are great plot elements, and when you reach a certain point in the book, you just can't put it down. There are also elements in the book that make you think about deeper things, which is why I like it all the more. Truly, this was a very worthwhile book to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"In the humble opinion of a 16-year-old, I don't believe Mr. Adams wrote this novel to speak to the masses about war or cycles of downfall in human society. I think Watership Down is simple, yet somehow it is something far, far above all that. It is written to be beautiful, to give us a glimpse of something beyond the monotonous, complicated structure we have given to our world. It is not hard to understand. Mr. Adams captures the essence of that feeling of unity, devotion, and accomplishment that comes from being together with others through time, building dreams with them, and learning to love them. That's why we love IT, and that's why it is so long- it is creating a memory so masterfully written that we feel we have lived it ourselves, and perhaps by the end it appeals to that desire within all of us to live forever with our Creator. If you want to be taken away, read this book. If all you want to know- or all you are capable of seeing- is the world you live in, don't bother, you won't like it. You're no less than me by any means. But I'm SO glad I can appreciate this book... it's a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was required to read this book for high school English. I assumed that I would hate it, though I loved to read. A really long book about rabbits? I thought, \\"You've got to be kidding.\\"Anyway, I just loved the book and it was one time that I actually kept up with (and even got ahead of) my homework.This book is a classic fantasy. It tells the story of a band of rabbits (from their perspective) that need to find a new home because theirs is being destroyed by humans for land development.You grow to love the characters and truly care about their plight."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book in 4th grade, and of all the stories i read back then, i remebered this most clearly. I even remebered how i came to lose my copy of it, and how annoyed i felt. I figured there had to be a reason for this, so i went looking for this in my skool library (im in 9th grade now). I realsied that i didnt know the name of the author, so i went to try to find this other book by Douglas Adams. I was surprised to find, right under Adams, Watership Down, the book i had been hoping to find. It was like God had told me to read it.Now that i have bored you with my random story, i will get on to my review:I realsied after i read it again how great this book is. It is so meaningful and great, and deeper than a simple adventure story. It cxan be a little slow at times, and the discriptions can be a little lengthy, but i have found that even the long descriptions are fascinating, and i didnt skip over them like i usually do with stories.I have read many reviews telling how this book is stupid because it is unrealistic, and how it is about talking rabbits. Or even how people loved this book because the rabbits seemed so human-like and told them about ourselves, and how they forgot the story was about rabbits at times. I loved this book because i believe opposite is true. The rabbit society is atonishingly realistic, especially in their reactions to humans and our society. The rabbits never acted in any way that you would not expect rabbits to act. Their language ability may have been above expected, but you can even sense their underlying naivety and ignorance. I loved how they could only count to four, and how everything above that they simply called \\"hriar\\" or \\"a thousand.\\" Their culture is very realistic and intriguing because it is so unlike our own. Their glorification of the theif and trickery i found to be an interesting contrast to our society, where \\"honesty is the best policy.\\" You really got a glimpse into not just another society, but a whole different species with a different outlook on life. Without this realism, the story would still have been great story, but empty of meaning or literary greatness.I have never ben able to convince my friends to read this book, because it is about rabbits. I believe that everyone should read it, merely because it's about rabbits."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"How could anyone not love this book? If you honor creative genius, this is the book for you. Admittedly, I first loved this book because I had a huge crush on my English teacher, but I've read it so many times since high school, I think the worth of the book stands on its own merit. If great writing stands on creativity and character (which I hope to always believe, pardon the split infinitive), then this book deserves pride of place in any well-read person's library. It is one of my desert island indispensibles, and after many years of great reads, it remains a favorite. Lovers of the written word, read this book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recently re-read this book since my son has to read it for English class. Even though I knew the entire plot, I still couldn't put it down. It was just as fresh and exciting the second time around. The characters are so marvellous you can't help but want them to succeed. I remember that when I read it the first time, I told my mom that I would never be able to look at rabbits the same way again. She told me that the book was really about people. But now, after re-reading the book, I have to disagree. People aren't as likeable as these rabbits. They actually learn from their mistakes."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Once I started I could not stop. It was amazing. The rabbits were so real, the description so vivid and so powerful, the storyline so moving. The rabbits are wonderfully complex, with human emotions and characters, yet are never unrealistic. If you ever get the chance to, you should read it.This story is basically about the journey and adventure of a group of rabbits. Fiver is a seer who anticipated danger and told his brother Hazel. They gather a small group of rabbits and escape death by a hair. Over the course of time, Hazel becomes the leader, or Chief Rabbit, while others establish themselves as important rabbits in their own right. They go through several adventures, interspersed with sub-plots of the stories of El-ahrairah, a lengendary rabbit, along the way. Richard Adams is a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is simply one of the greatest novels ever written. Although often considered a children's book, it really takes an adult to appreciate Adams wonderful tale in all its manifestations. The book has many themes weaved through it: ecology, man's place in nature, the nature of primitive societies (the parallels between rabbit society and that of pre-agricultural man are many), amongst others. However perhaps the most important theme in the book, and one I would like to explore a little in this review, is the importance of individual freedom.The Sandleford warren is destroyed because it will not, can not by its very make-up, heed the warning of Fiver. It is only freedom that allows the individual talents of Dandelion, Bigwig, Blackberry, Fiver and especially Hazel to blossom; to leave the Sandleford warren, understand the dangers of Cowslip's warren and defeat General Woundwort and the Efrafans.Many have compared the Efrafa with Nazism because of its military character. I feel the parallels with communism are stronger: Woundwort as Stalin, Vervain and his secret police as Beria and the NKVD, and the Owsla as the Party. The lack of freedom, the show trials, the great Leader, are of course common to both fascism and communism. However the strict regimentation, the fact that no one is allowed to leave, and above all the justification that oppression is necessary for the good of the group; these are all hallmarks of socialist states from the Soviet Union in the 30's to today's North Korea.Please understand that these are underlying themes only, the book is in its essence an adventure tale, and one of the most enjoyable ever written."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recently completed the book Watership Down by Richard Adams. The book is about a small group of rabbits who set out on a journey to find a new place to live. They come across many places and other rabbits on their journey. In the end, they find a permanent place to live.One of things that I enjoyed in this book is the action. An example of this is when Bigwig fights Woundwart to defend his group of rabbits and their does. Another exciting part is when Hazel goes to a near by farm and lets the dog loose and the dog helps the rabbits fight the Efrafa. This book is jam packed with action! What I also liked about this book is how the rabbits have human characteristics. They talk to each other and how they think(very clever and knowledgeable). Last, I liked how the rabbits accept other animals. Two animals the rabbits accept are a bird and a mouse that they meet. This shows how willing the rabbits are to give the different types of animals a chance to be their friend!As in every book there are a few things you just don't like, and in this book I didn't like how sudden things were. It can seem like the slowest book on one page, but when you turn the page everything is so fast. I think it should be a little more even.This book is longer than most other books I've read. It also is harder than books I've read in the past, but I was still able to understand. I have never read a book where the main characters were rabbits. All these things are what make this book interesting from other books.Overall I liked the book Watership Down by Richard Adams. I give it four out of five stars. I liked the tale of these rabbits abandoning their home and go on a journey to find a new home!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down tells the story of a bunch of rabbits (Hazel and his brother Fiver, Bigwig, Silver and others) who are forced to leave their warren as Fiver's sixth sense tells him great danger is coming. As they look for a place to settle down, not only do they encounter many enemies along the way, but also other rabbits with different ways of living, and who can sometimes be particularly unfriendly.They finally find an idyllic place to live: on Watership Down. As they settle down, they suddenly realise they've forgotten about something: females!The story goes on to describe their raids to capture does and bring them back to their new warren. They first manage to get a hutch female rabbit from a nearby farm, but soon realise that just one female is not enough.So they make for Efrafa, a warren not far from theirs, only to discover it is run by a certain General Woundwort, a tyrant who thinks of his rabbits as an army. In fact, these rabbits are prisoners, unhappy and unable to escape.So Hazel, Bigwig and their friends devise a plan to rescue some does, risking their own live in the process.From this brief outline of the plot and even from the cover of the book, Watership Down may look like a children's book. Do not be fooled: this book is full of violence and cruelty, not just between rabbits and their natural foes, but also among themselves. And you realise early on that, somehow like in George Orwell's Animal Farm, it's fundamentaly a critical view of our own human society, a way of showing us how we also can behave in a barbarous way.Anyway, I think the book is still suitable for children who will love this great adventure, as Watership Down is aslo full of suspense and once you've started, it's &quot;unputdownable&quot;! Moreover, its characters are very interesting and well developed, and in the end it's extremely amusing, especially when these rabbits take a look at us human beings...This book is not just for bunny lovers so hop along and get yourself a copy quick! And don't forget it's companion: Tales from Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"&quot;Watership Down&quot; is the adventure of a band of rabbits, who set out on their own. Led by the brave and intelligent Hazel, they search for the perfect place to build a warren. Fiver, the smallest and most timid, has what humans would call a sixth sense and can foresee the future. Thrown into the wild, the only thing they have to depend on is each other. Soon, they learn to rely fully on their senses and to trust one another. The band of rabbits overcomes many dangers, but in the end natural harmony takes over and everything works out.The tone that Richard Adams takes is clearly depicted at the beginning of every chapter. He gives a quote from another work of literature to set the mood and give insight into the chapter. He takes such close details with this that not a single quote is out of place. Adams also brings the rabbits to life by sharing their myths and language with the reader. He uses such intricate detail to describe the lives of rabbits and their surroundings that the reader gets the know life from a rabbits point of view quite well. The reader is left with understanding that Adams brought through in his writing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Very simply: my favorite work of fiction ever written. _Watership Down_ is the story of a group of English rabbits who leave their doomed warren in search of a better home. The company contains all the ingredients of an Arthurian court: the great, but humble king; the warrior; the bard; the seer. They have their inventor and their soldiers and their noble dream. These rabbits are armed only with their wits, their simple religion, and the mythological inspiration of an ancient hero. They play out their battles on the humble, legend-steeped downs of England._Watership Down_ has been described as a political novel based on the authors observations during WWII, but from all I've read, the book was mainly the result of Adam's stories to his two young daughters. While driving them to see Shakespeare's plays, Adams invented animal tales which he believed embodied the spirit, if not he setting, of the classics. He later worked the stories into the book that became _Watership Down_. It is a mark of the novel's scope that, although I read and loved it at 12, I was sitting in a 400-level university Ancient Classics class before I discovered the meaning of one of the chapter titles._Watership Down_ is one of those books that defies categorization. To call it a \\"children's book\\" would be a gross misnomer, although the book was written for children. To call it an \\"animal story,\\" would be as technically correct as categorically wrong. To call it fantasy would be odd, for it lacks the most prominent ingredient of modern fantasy-magic.That said, the book was magic for me. It deals with ethics, with leadership, with friendship, with biology, with war. The characters have remained with me long after the details of the plot have faded. Now, more than ten years after I first opened it, _Watership Down_ retains an honored place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What could I possibly say about this beautiful book that hasn't already been said? This book is magical.Although I regret admitting it, at 27 years old I was a latecomer to this unexpectedly remarkable story about a nest of rabbits fleeing thier warren to seek a home away from the destructiveness of mankind. Not to worry: it isn't a preachy environmental book, at least no more than Lord of the Rings is (courtesy of the talking tree-like Ents).But it's so much more than that. All great stories, from the Iliad to Star Wars, are simple on the surface and yet have deeper meaning underlying it. Watership Down is no exception and should be regarded as highly as most---if not any given---\\"great\\" works. Small children can enjoy the adventure and colorful characters, whereas adults can enjoy the social commentary and allegory (as well as the adventure and colorful characters, of course).Adams did a lot of research on rabbit life before writing his novel, and it shows. Not once do you forget that these are rabbits you are following. They recognize each other by touching noses; they discuss \\"passing hraka\\" (defecating) as frankly as we discuss what we had for breakfast; they routinely practice coprophagy (\\"chewing pellets\\": feeding on their own dung); they are uncomfortable sleeping aboveground; they can discern the differences among several scents on the air. The list goes on. You see the world not from a human's perspective but a rabbit's. The narration is rabbit-level, meaning the reader is down in the dank burrows and eye-level with all sorts of plant-life I never knew existed. (Adams must have done a lot of research on flora, as well.) Bottom line: These are true rabbits with rabbit-like qualities, not rabbits with humanistic attitudes and outlooks and intelligence. And yet there is something fundamental about these characters, something familiar and archetypal and, well, human.Speaking of archetypes, they're all here: the strong one, the prophet, the leader, the bard, the jester, the villian, etc. But, again, like those in all great stories, these sorts of characters are effective only if they go beyond the category under which readers often place them, and Adams does a fine job indeed making his rabbits familiar in the Jungian sense and, at the same time, unique.Who would have thought that you could sustain a story about rabbits (and, remember, these are REAL rabbits, not Disney rabbits) for 400 pages? But as I got closer to the final pages, the more melancholy I grew. I did not want this book to end. I did not want to leave Watership Down and say goodbye to Bigwig and Dandelion and Fiver and Bluebell and, hell, even General Woundwort. And Hazel . . . By Frith, if you don't shed a tear after reading the epilogue, you are congenitally unfeeling. It gives me chills now as I write this.I've gone on longer than I intended, but that just proves how much I love this book. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a stupendously marvelous book about rabbits. It starts out when a young rabbit named Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of foresight, sees the warren they live in being destroyed, and they must leave there at once, with as many as will follow. He convinces his brother Hazel, simply because Hazel knows the truth of his dreams. They approach the Thearah, the head of the rabbits, but that does not go well. So they leave the warren, and the story is of them traveling, trying to find a home, and at last succeeding. Then they have to get does from another warren, Efrafa, that is run very militarily by a rabbit named General Woundwort.That is a lot more to this novel than that extremely brief summary. You get to meet a grand sea gull named Kehaar. It is one of my most favoured books, and I know of none outside the fantasy market that touches its realm of invention.The best thing about this novel is how thoroughly researched this is. This is not regular anthropomorphic fiction, where talking animals are just caricatures of humans, or they're animals without that true sense of their nature. The rabbits in WATERSHIP DOWN behave like real rabbits. I'd go so far as to call this THE LORD OF THE RINGS of this type of fiction, with talking animals. Adams has taken the real behaviour of rabbits and set them in a wonderful story. The depth of his achievement never fails to amaze me. He totally makes a believable real world of the rabbits, and from the rabbit's perspective. Besides being a great novel, this makes this work stand out even moreso. All the places, including the place Watership Down, are real locations in England.Although Brian Jacques' REDWALL series is often hailed in comparision to this, in terms of actual scope of reality, REDWALL and all its incarnations is inferiour to his. Not that I don't like REDWALL. Brian Jacques has a very real gift of telling a rollicking good yarn, and his series deserves everything it gets. Its just that WATERSHIP DOWN is better in the sense that instead of taking animals and imposing them with personalities, with them losing their nature and taking on a definably human one, Adams did not go to that extreme. He balanced them with ultimately human traits necessary for the story, but still in keeping with their animal nature, with them behaving and acting like real rabbits. This is why I love this particular novel so much. It achieves a balance of animal and human qualities, of which so few stories in this particular genre attempt to achieve. Of course, not all these stories are trying to achieve that balance, or need too, because they are aiming for an entirely different point and are using anthropomorphic fiction as its vehicle, and that's alright. (Case in point: George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, which is as every bit as good as this, although it is sofor entirely different reasons.) It gives anthropomorphic fiction a new height and goal to shoot too:1. To take an animal, for purpose of a story, and with human traits and failings let us get to know the character and its surroundings.2. To take the character created, and to keep it in keeping with its real species. If it's a bear or an otter, have the bear and otter behave like real bears and otters. It makes the fiction so very much richer.The interaction between the rabbits and human society is an excellent treatise in its own right on man's dominance over nature. It gives a very interesting view on how animals interact and deal with us. They are two separate societies, and each must deal with the other. Of course, the humans have the overall hand. That is why, indeed, the rabbits led by Hazel and Fiver must forsake their home warren in the first place. On the Notice Board (name of the first chapter &quot;The Notice Board&quot;) there is a notice which reveals the humans will make a shopping mall or something like that in that location. Although this may seem strange, the only other books that I have read that gives a very interesting animal perspective on human society is in quite a different setting, with largely comic overtones. The HANK THE COWDOG books, a children's series greeted with enthusiastic response from both children and adults, gives a perfectly delightful view of human society from an animal's perspective. They are written by John R. Erickson (I'm proud to say I hail from his home state of Oklahoma, though now I am far removed from there).In conclusion, one of the books I love and respect the most. His depth of invention is amazing, his achievement, although in a much different setting, parallels the achievements of Robert Jordan and J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of those books I wished I had written (as H. G. Wells said of Sinclair Lewis' BABBITT, and, perhaps more importantly, Stephen King said of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES, another debut novel). I bought a hardback copy of SHARDIK, a novel of similar magnitude (or so they say.) I haven't read it yet. They say it topples this book, and if that is the case, Mr. Adams is even moreso a truly remarkable writer of novels."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I spent a month reading Adams' tale of a Rabbit Warren's growth and struggle to survive to my six-year-old. I was amazed at how into the characters she got--she was reading along with me at several points, and trying to get ahead. Although this novel deals with the rabbit in a realistic natural setting with all of their natural adversaries (foxes, mankind, other rabbits), she was not disturbed, understanding the book was a story.Adams creates an entire rabbit culture, making this tale not just a story, but an involved epic. I was impressed by Adams treatment of the characters, their unique individual traits, how they solved their problems. Each of the rabbits has something disctinctive, either a talent or an admireable characteristic which proves its use to the growing warren. This story builds on the bonds of community and friendship, and shows how intelligence, quick-thinking and effort can triumph over brutality and totalitarianism, and how team work can save the day. Woven throughout are stories the rabbits share with one another about the exploits of the legendary rabbit-prince El-Ahrairah.A well-constructed plot, if you enjoy intreague and adventure, this book will not let you down. Perfect for evening reading with the wee-ones, if you make it a nightly habit. Oh, and the two bunnies that mow our lawn at night are now nicknamed Hazel and Fiver :)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"WATERSHIP DOWN is one of my top ten favorite novels. It's about a group of rabbits who leave their warren when one of them has a strange feeling that something terrible is going to happen. It turns out that his feelings are right when their warren is destroyed by Men. The band of rabbits then have exciting and sometimes violent adventures as they search for a new home. Perhaps the most important of their many adventures is the freeing of the Efrafan does. This will help the main characters to breed and populate their new warren, IF they ever find it. This novel is a masterpiece. This is so for many reasons. The writing is almost poetic, and the dialogue is so natural that it felt like I could hear the characters talking. The action sequences are very well-written. The rabbits' behavior, while slightly \\"humanized,\\" is still very believable. This book's greatest strength, however, is that the reader cares about the characters. The strong yet vulnerable Hazel, who becomes the leader of his fellow rabbits. His young brother Fiver, who has the psychic feelings near the beginning of the book which start the whole story. The courageous and hot-headed Bigwig (who, in my opinion, seemed to have a Harrison Ford-like atmosphere around him.) The hopeful Hyzenthlay, who aids Bigwig in his attempts to free the Efrafan does. All of these characters are memorable, but the one who stuck in my head the most was the horrifyingly vicious General Woundwort. While he didn't give me nightmares, the character gave me a slight discomfort. Anyways, please read this terrific novel when you have the chance. Many people seem to hate the book because they said that it was too hard to understand. I don't know what they're talking about. I found it to be a relatively easy read. Trust me when I say that this is a fantastic story. Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"By Christina S. (...)Watership Down by Richard Adams is a wonderful fiction story that I loved. It started off a bit slowly, but very soon after, it became very fast paced. I would recomend this book to animal lovers, and those who just love a good read.Watership Down is about a bunch of rabbits who leave their warren. Fiver, one of the smaller rabbits, had a vision that danger was coming. So he and his friend Hazel head off with a few others to find a new place to live. They face many dangers, but eventually find a place. Yet even then, they have hardships to face. Many times I was driven to tears.In many stories where the animals talk and are the main characters, humans don't exist. What I loved about this book is that humans do exist, and play a major role in the story. I also loved how you could easily relate to some of the characters. Myself, I'm a lot like Fiver. Fiver is very small and quiet. However, there was something that I didn't like about the book.Richard Adams sprinkles the rabbit speech, Lapine, in with what they say. Some words you can remember the meanings of, like 'elil' (enemy). But there are some words that aren't used as often, so you have to look them up in the glossary. It tends to slow down the reading a bit.All in all, I loved this book. The one or two minor flaws that it possesses can easily be overlooked. The book is wonderful, and I would gladly read it again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Only the British seem to know how to write for children without talking down to them. While telling a gripping adventure about a group of rabbits, Adams also makes a strong statement about the nature of leadership, contrasting the intelligent and intuitive protagonist Hazel with the repressive and authoritarian General Woundwort. The book's environmental message is also as relevant today as when it was written."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think this is one of the best books of all time. Now when you think of rabbits, most of the time you think about the cute, fuzzy disney kind. Well the rabbits in this book are tough, and determined. It all starts out when a group of rabbits leave their warren because Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of fore-seeing the future, predicted that their warren would be desotryed. Led by Hazel, they must find a new home and a new life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a great book! You can read it on so many levels, and still enjoy it. If you are reluctent to read it since it is about \\"bunnies\\", then just try it. Surprisingly, it is very suspensful, and intellectual. I would definetly encourage this book to anyone of any age!P.S. I'm sorry for all the misspellings."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The story unfolds in the british countryside, a prophetic rabit runt and his brother set out on a brave journey to escape the possible destruction of their warren bringing with them the few they can convince.They encounter other warrens and examine various real world government styles, notably a totalitarian one reminscent of mid twentieth century ones.The story is also about survival, trying as they do to set up their own waren lacking female rabits. Courage, loyalty, cleverness, friendship take them through this in an amazingly suspensful storyline.The backdrop is an invented vocabulary reminiscent of Tolkien's elvish and legends of an ancient rabit hero that inspire them, and amuse us.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'll make this review really short and sweet. This book is the best book I've ever read. It totally tops &quot;classics&quot; like Catcher in the Rye or Oliver Twist, because this story has way more heart than those stories, and yet it's a compelling adventure, once you look past the fact that adams is talking about rabbits. Even though it's a long read, I promise that you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my most beloved book. I read this book when I was 10 years old in german language, the title is &quot;Unten am Flu&szlig;&quot;. Now, some :) years lager, I have bought an english version and read it again. English is difficult for me, but this book is definitely the book I love best."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"....It's about a group of rabbits who set out to find new land when one of the rabbit's brother feels that their area is doomed to be killed gruesomely. I wish I could describe it better, but there's so much to it, so much depth and beauty and happy and sad. Who ever you are, if you are reading this review you should read this book. It's truly amazing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership down was about a group of rabbits that leave their warren because a rabbit named Fiver thought something bad was going to happen. Hazel is Fiver's brother and he knew that Fiver usually could tell when something bad was going to happen. Hazel and Fiver had decided to try to persuade others to go with them on their long journey. They had persuaded Bigwig (who was part of the Owsla (the Owsla is kind of like the King's guards) and was very large), Pipkin (a quiet rabbit that obeys all orders), Blackberry (a wise rabbit that was very bright), and many others.When they started off on their journey they came across many dangers. The warren they used to live in sent Owsla to try and stop them. They came across a dog and then when they all thought that their troubles were over they came to a field where there were no elil. They met some other rabbits that were very large and had carrots every morning. They soon figured out with the help of Fiver that it was not safe. A farmer had killed all the elil to stop the rabbits from dying then gave them carrots and later caught them and killed them. Strawberry joined them.After they had came free of the rabbits in the open field they came across the perfect place to make their warren. They called this Watership down. They were very happy there and everything was going smoothly. Then one night they heard someone yelling Bigwig's name \\"Thlayli\\". Hazel went out to meat this strange animal and saw it was Holly and his friend. (They used to live in their warren). They let them into their warren and heard their story escaping from their old warren.Soon everyone noticed that they wouldn't last very long because they didn't have any does. They made friends with a great big white bird. This bird named Kahar had agreed to look around Watership Down for any warrens that has extra does. He saw two places. A farm with two does and two bucks. A warren called Efrafa that was overcrowded. Hazel decided to send Silver, Holly, and some others to go to Efrafa, while Hazel and Pipkin went to go talk to the farm rabbits. The rabbits that night except for one escaped. Meanwhile General Woundwort told Holly and the others no! That night Holly escaped from that cruel place. When they returned, most of the other rabbits set out to invade and take a bunch of does.When they got there only Bigwig went to Efrafa and asked to be in the Owsla. He tricked the Efrafans and with the does ran out. The Efrafans were close behind and then Bigwig and the does got on a boat. Hazel broke the rope and they went sailing down the river. They went back to Watership Down and only lost two does. When they got home they thought they were safe but the Efrafans were on their trail. The Efrafans followed them back to the warren but the Efrafans were again tricked and sent back to Efrafa.I liked all the action and details. I liked that because it is just my personality. I'll get bored watching television if it isn't exciting. I didn't get bored reading this book though. I didn't like the stories El-ahrairah. Those I didn't think were necessary. There was already enough going on in the book without the stories. My overall impression is that it is a good book. I would definitely recommend this to others. It takes a lot of time but it is definitely fun. Out of all the novels I read I liked this book and would say it was one of the better books. If you ever read it I hope you enjoyed it as much as me!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was a great book because of all the adventures Hazel's clan had. They ran from a human invaded home, ran into a large bird, and had many other adventures after setting up their own warren on Watership Down. This novel is much like other books I've read because these rabbits were constantly moving around and only stopped when they completed the task at hand. This is a great book and I would definitely recommend this book to other readers because there was always something going on and I always wanted to know what was going to happen next in this adventurous novel which always kept me reading."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"An absolutely fascinating tale of adventure!! The story is told from the view point of a group of rabbits. It chronicles their adventures as they leave their old warren and set out to establish a new warren. On their journey they encounter many elil (foes) and things that are not natural to a rabbit's nature. As you are carried along, you &quot;learn&quot; much about the rabbits nature and heritage. I would recommend this book to any animal lover. I would begin to use this book with freshmen. I will most likely read this several more times in my life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I disagree with the review first that was given, the one that said &quot;what teenager wouldn't cringe at reading a 400+ book about talking rabbits&quot; My friends and I are, unfortunatley, the &quot;popular group&quot; ( don't judge my,you don't know me, I am not a snob, I am a good person)and we all loved the book! My english teacher was so surprised that I finshed the book before anyone else, it wa cool.

It is the telling of the story, the interplay of the characters and situations, that make this as great a novel as it is. Indeed, if you have not read it, click the button, now: you won't regret it. To quote from Stephen King's _The Stand_, &quot;The thing turned out to be about rabbits, for Christ's sake. The stupidest, most cowardly animals on God's earth...except the guy who wrote that book made them seem different. You really cared about them. It was a pretty damn good story, and Stu, who read at a snail's pace, finished it that same weekend.&quot; Yes, it's that good."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was on my summer reading list for school last year. I picked it because the description made it sound interesting. However, it did not mention anything about rabbits, so I was surprised to find that the whole story was about talking rabbits! I &quot;got into it&quot; after a few pages, where in some books it takes a few chapters! I didn't want to put it down! I liked how each of the rabbits developed their own personality throughout the story. I especially liked the suspenseful, fast-paced ending. If you are looking for a great book, read Watership Down by Richard Adams!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adams is a sheer genius. &quot;Watership Down&quot; is the epitome of a modern mythology. The characters are not mere rabbits; rather, they are people with a culture, complete with language and traditions. The idea of using another species to examine culture, tradition, and prejudice is genius.The plot is almost as enrapturing as the characterization and setting. However, the most stunning part of the novel is Adams's use of rabbits as characters.A well-deserved five stars for my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is the best thing that I have ever read as long as I have been alive and I think it is the most wonderful thing in the entire universe! For Richard Adams to write such a fantastic thing astonishes me... to have the power to make something so extrordinary is beyond anything I ever thought of. I never imagined anything about talking rabbits could be so unbelievable. Deserves to be the 8th wonder of the world without second thought. That review on the front is the most true thing I ever read, &quot;anyone who can read English should read it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"No wonder so many people are going to homeschooling now; if these comments are indicative of what public schools are turning out now, then I say tear 'em all down. There's really nothing left for American 'culture' now but waiting for the fall."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is absolutely great. One of the best books I have read.

Adams is one of the most talented authors I have read; his writing flows and has a poetic charm to it. The book follows a group of displaced rabbits on a journey to find a new home, and led by Hazel, an unassuming yet effective leader, the clairvoyant Fiver, and the brawny Bigwig, the group travels through the countryside to a far off and unknown haven called Watership Down. With only bravery, guile, luck, and the mysterious visions of Fiver, the group attempts to overcome the substantial obstacles they face on their journey. This book stands as a parable of human society or simply as a wonderful and joyful tale that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Go on a fascinating adventure with many rabbits, forced out of their home and meet strange new characters along the way.

It seems in other books I have found that the auther can try to put to much action in only several chapters. The fact that Watership Down had stories based upon the rabbits belief only (some times) proved to stall the stories, on the other hand I found that the stories were an ingenius way to stop oneself from putting in to much acton. Therefore I will recomend Watership Down to readers ages 13 and up (unless of course you are a highly advanced reader and have found books of your age leval and up to 3 years above your age leval an insult to you. This has happened many times to myself)."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is my favorite book of all time. That's all there is to it. I've read it at least once a year since I was nine... it's almost a New Year ritual. The thing is... it follows all the natural rules of rabbithood, but at the same time each character has a distinct personality, each one is easy to identify with. It's a bit like Brian Jaques' Redwall... but with a more realistic(and often more adult)approach. The myths told by the rabbits are as entertaining as the story itself, and you find the characters resemble humans you know. Allegorical? You can see it that way if you want. It's also a wonderful story in its own right."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I just finished reading this book today,and I love it! I'm pretty sure that this is my favorite book.Watership Down made me laugh,cry,and think.The ending is really good - not happy or sad.The drama in the book is very dramatic,from the fields covered with blood to Bigwig's fight with General Woundwort.My favorite characters are Bluebell,because he's always making jokes,and Blackberry,because he's so clever.Fiver is kind of cryptic.Anyway, I would definitely recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It should be noted that the book was written by Adams for his children. For this reason, each chapter was designed to stand alone as its own story. Younger children will enjoy being read to in installments tracking the adventures of these rabbits."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"To start with,this book is a must read!I've tried to convince all my friends,but they say its too thick,not true!Lets start in the begining:In a small warren in Hampshire on the countryside,a small rabbit with an extra sense for danger named Fiver and his slighly larger less-figity brother Hazel go out to the feild to silflay (eat above ground).Hazel points out a large man-made sign,they cannot read it,but Fivers instincts react quickly and he breaks out in terror and only says things like &quot;We must leave!&quot;and &quot;Danger is aproaching!&quot; and such.Hazel talks to the Cheif Rabbit,but he does not believe them,so he and a small group of rabbits,big and small,set forth in the night in hope of a new home and a fresh start,so to speak.Their adventures seem never-ending,one after another.And when finally they do reack their special destination,a string of adventures continue to keep it there own and to keep their own lives.These characters catch your heart,and when its over,and unfortunately it will be,it brings tears to your eyes to see them go.As I said,this book is not too thick,any shorter and it would not be enough.This tale is one of friendship,bravery,adventure,and cunning.The tale of rabbits seeking a home on Watership Down will touch your hearts and stay there forever.Welcome to the world of Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"No one can resist a good adventure. I was a little apprehensive of reading a book that had a rabbit on the cover, but I'm so glad I read it. Not only it is a adventure, Adams brings in elements of teamwork, hierarchy of leadership, and problem-solving during crisis. It's almost like a business seminar. I fell in love with the rabbits that we followed from page 1 and I felt like I was on the roller coaster with them. It's a simply heartwarming adventure of rabbits who have to leave home and deal with life in the real world. It does not matter if these are rabbits or turtles or humans, the story applies to everyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The reason I got to read this book was on the back of a copy of Redwall by Brian Jacques(I'm a big Redwall fan), I saw the name of this book so I bought and read it. I thought it was great! It's about this group of rabbits that are leaving their large, comfy warren because one of them predicts that something terrible will happen...It's full of adventure and very absorbing. And again, it's a GREAT STORY!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A look through the many reviews of this book raises an interesting question: Is this book really a classic (a la Dickens, Eliot, Hemingway etc.)? I think my answer would be no. However, I do think it is an excellent introduction to those wonderful authors and I'm happy to see it's being taught in our schools.Watership Down is a very sophisticated form of popular fiction. Don't think so? Well, it provides at least three distinct social structures (the three main warrens), addresses the issues and complexities of leadership (Hazel isn't the obvious leader-type), and comments on differing psychologies (think of the denizens of the warren near the snare) all in the form of a complex allegory. It has other depths as well, but the point I want to make is that these are wrapped up in a compelling adventure story written from the unique perspective of fantasy. Add in the fact that it's gracefully written and you have a book that is appealing to young people but provided plenty of material for conversation and thought.Is it on the level of, say, George Eliot or Joseph Conrad? I don't think so. It provides a heroic and happy ending that while exciting, isn't convincingly realistic. In addition, though the characters are wonderfully drawn, they clearly &quot;wear&quot; white hats or dark ones when the real world tends to be gray.That said, I remember struggling through &quot;Lord Jim&quot; in high school and feeling like I missed alot of what was being said. Reading it 20 years later confirmed that opinion. It isn't that I was stupid in high school--I simply lacked enough life experience to appreciate the subtleties of what Conrad was getting at.I've always felt that teaching the great classics in high school is, at best, a questionable undertaking. Far better to teach a book on the level of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (and there aren't many books in this middle region between popular and classic), so that young readers learn how to read critically, than to have them drown trying to understand a complicated classic. After they learn critical reading skills, then move them on to a true classic.There are those who will say I'm condescending to kids suggesting this, but it's equally legitimate to suggest that it is arrogant to assume that ALL teenagers can understand the subtlety of books which adults write long tomes analyzing.Lest this tome makes &quot;Watership Down&quot; sound like a textbook, let me say that when I first read it 20 years ago, I could not put the book down. The last 150 pages carry the reader along like a tidal wave. I've read it several times since and each time I happily sank into the wonderful world of Hazel, Bigwig and the others. It's a book that both adults and kids can appreciate and it doesn't suffer with age. So maybe it's a classic after all."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Do yourself a favor and read this book. I guarentee if you not only enjoy this book and learn from it as well. As previous reviews have stated, Watership Down is an enjoyable book. This book also has a lot to teach anyone about friendship, loyalty and leadership. Having been in the military for four years a can attest that the leadership principles subtly interwoven throughot the book are true wisdom. This book has a lot to teach anyone in the bussiness of leading others. If you have kids read it to them for the story, they will love you for it. If not, read it for yourself, these rabits have a lot of good stuff to say."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I understand that some may have difrent views on this book. Yet, all i hear is &quot;it's bunnies, it has no action, the bunny talk is hard to understand, ad infinitum.&quot; We have dumed (if thats a word) down todays youth by only focasing on action and simple themes. This book works because its original. Lets count shall we? How many books have humans as the main charcters? Anyone? They were all great because they had action and simple words right? No. Lets face facts, this is a good book because it shows you things about human nature that you couldn't do with humans as the main characters.This is a Epic Poem and Hazel is the hero. The stories within the stories also make it an Epic Poem, and it is the way the trials and conflicts are set up to show the diffrent types of personalities of the rabbits. To those who say its dull, read the beginig agin. As the story starts out it shows adversity from the very begining. Not just action but some politics as well. It has factions, cults, and even a mystic element because of Fiver. I wish that I had had this book in class. I would have loved to have talked about the ideas and themes with others. It's been years since I read it but I still think about it and try to tell everyone I know to read it. Don't hate it because there are no humans as the main characters."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Read this book for the first time in fourth grade. Have read it at least 10 times in the years that have followed,with each reading bringing more to light. Pay special attentionto Hazel's examples of leadership in the book. And hey, find out what your buddy means when he starts mumbling in lapine.Check out the movie too--for the illustrations at the beginning if fornothing else."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites and ranks up withthe Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, and the TolkeinRings series. If you like this book, you might also like theMossflower books by Brian Jaques. Although Watership Down isa lot more sophisticated than the Mossflower ones, they arestill fun to read. Watership Down is a amazing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I avoided reading WD for many years, having made the mistake many people do, that this is a book intended for children. I couldn't be more wrong. From the first pages, I was enthralled and hooked on the story. It is unique, different from anything else you may read.Adams' detailed descriptions of the English countryside, down to the individual names of flowers and plants, added much to the ambiance of the story. But the rabbits of course are the real stars. Fiver, Hazel, Bigwig, Blackberry, and the maniacal General Woundwort, are all clearly drawn and very evocative. I ended up caring deeply for these rabbits and their heroic, epic struggle for their goal, a place they can call home.I will admit that when the Sanderford warren was destroyed, I put the novel down and could not resume reading for a month. It affected me that much. And when Hazel passed on at the end of the book, it was one of the most lyrical, poetic things I have ever read. It never fails to raise a lump in my throat, and I am a man in his late forties!If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and read this book. You will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Rabbits' lives are full of plants. Their homes, their food, their hotels, their restaurants, their grocery stores, their beauty in the world are the trees, shrubs, grasses, clovers and flowers. Rabbits live out in the wild, in a place where many modern humans take one glance and see \\"nothing\\" because there are no people, buildings or other man-made conveniences that they cannot live without. Rabbits can and do live without them because they have plants. People who blindly lump all plants together in their minds as \\"extraneous green things of little or no importance in our very important human world\\" may have difficulty understanding the importance of plants in Watership Down, and indeed the importance of plants to life itself by virtue of their fundamental place in the food chain as the primary producers on earth. Richard Adams knows and values plants, and describes them beautifully and individually, quite possibly in an effort to cure this plant blindness in much of modern society.Watership Down was published in 1972 at a time when the terrible conflict in Southeast Asia was far from resolved and the Cold War was still raging in the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Look for echoes of these world events in the gassing of the burrows of the Sandleford Warren, and the eyeball-to-eyeball show down between General Woundwort and Bigwig on the last page of chapter 38 in which Bigwig doesn't blink, but stands his ground (and proves victorious in the end). In today's American culture, if we think of gas in connection with war, we immediately think of Hitler, but I propose that the gassing of the Sandleford Warren is a better allegorical match with the Cu Chi or Ben Binh tunnels of Vietnam. The whole Southeast Asia War was a terrible secret that Americans in general, still to this day don't or won't talk about - like the terrible unspoken secret at Cowslip's warren of the snares.The last few paragraphs of the Epilogue do record Hazel's death. For those of you unable to grasp the meaning there, I am happy to translate. Paragraph one: \\". . . wild rabbits [only] live for two or three years.\\" and \\"Hazel lived longer than that. He lived a tidy few summers.\\" So, we know from paragraph one that Hazel lived to be a very old rabbit. Paragraph four begins recounting the death of Hazel. It happened in the spring, in March when Hazel was so old that he couldn't smell well or run well anymore and so had to spend most of his time as an old invalid, napping in his burrow. Hazel awoke from a dream, and the angel rabbit El-ahrairah was beside him. Hazel was able to recognize El-ahrairah, from his shining silver ears. The rabbit god, Lord Frith had given El-ahrairah those special ears after he lost them to the Black Rabbit of Inl&eacute; at the end of chapter 31. In the next-to-the-last paragraph in chapter 31, Lord Frith said to El-ahrairah, \\"I have brought a few [gifts] for you. A pair of ears, a tail and some whiskers. You may find the ears slightly strange at first. I put a little starlight in them\\". We also know that it was an angel rabbit with Hazel because the visitor was able to invisibly pass the sentry keeping watch at Hazel's door. The angel rabbit El-ahrairah was there to relieve Hazel of the tiredness of old age. He said in paragraph seven of the Epilogue, \\"You've been feeling tired, but I can do something about that.\\" In an earlier chapter we learned that rabbits always go out of the warren burrows and wander off to die alone, away from the other rabbits. Again we are reminded of this fact in chapter 46 when General Woundwort's rabbit Thunder finds Fiver cold and comatose on the floor of the Honeycomb, apparently dead. General Woundwort asks, \\"What do you make of it . . ? Rabbits don't die underground.\\" The angel rabbit El-ahrairah explained to Hazel in paragraph seven, that he could join the angel Owsla [in rabbit heaven], and he would take him there now if Hazel was ready [to die]. So in paragraph eight, Hazel went out with the angel rabbit, that no other rabbit could see, and since \\"[Hazel] would not be needing his body any more, so he left [his dead body] lying on the edge of the ditch\\". Once Hazel had died and left his old, decrepit, slow body behind, he was able (in the final paragraph) to easily follow the angel rabbit El-ahrairah, running and leaping off to rabbit heaven in the woods with the spring primroses, where Hazel would be able to watch thousands of rabbits prosper down through the generations in the warren that he had founded. Richard Adams chose not to use the words \\"angel\\", \\"heaven\\", \\"death\\", \\"dead\\", or \\"die\\". He knew how sad Hazel's death would be for his readers, especially young readers who often are not ready to face death or accept it. Angels and heaven are human concepts, and rabbits aren't human after all, even though, like us, they do die. Richard Adams penned Hazel's death in such a way that each reader is free to experience their own personal feelings and beliefs about death, and either face it or not. The fact that many reviews here have chosen to deny Hazel's death is testament to Adams' skill as a writer. (And in some cases quite possible that some readers view an epilogue as extraneous, unnecessary extra reading gladly skipped.) If young readers grow in life and maturity, and come back to re-read Watership Down, they may then have a new viewpoint and thus find more meaning in Adams' words."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Alright, the first thing you need to know is that this is about rabbits. Yes, rabbits, and not a childrens book. It is a long book, and it is a complex book. Even if you don't understand the complexities of the allegories that are involved with this book, it is still a fine read. The writing is superb, and the characters pop right off of the page. This book will stay with you long after you read it. Not for its amazing points it makes, although they are in there, but really for its terrific storytelling, and wonderful language. You can tell that this book was a labor of love for Richard Adams. I don't need to describe the story for you, that is done above. I don't need to talk about the allegorical significance of the various parts of the book, that is done in colleges all over the country. What I do need to tell you is that if you read this book you won't be sorry. I promise you won't even remember they are rabbits except in the smallest sense of yourself by the time you are a quarter of the way into the book. By the end you might even find a tear or two for the ending. So read it, enjoy it, and than pass it along to someone who you know will like it. That was how I got it, and I have cherished it ever since."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I would not suggest this book to kids under the age of nine. This is a very long book and has extremely advanced vocabulary. The beginning is kind of boring and chapter 18 is the first actual exciting chapter. The last five chapters of the book are very exciting. I highly reccomend this to adults or teenagers who like very very very descriptive novels."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is among my favorites. The rabbits are well decribed and personified, yet not to a point that is unimaginable. You feel sadness and anger at some points, and happiness, too. The journey the rabbits make is very perilous, and once you begin reading the end chapters, you'll find the book hard to put down, even though it was hard to put down in the first place! I would not recommend this book for children younger than 11, because of a few curses, and the fact the book is very large. Watership Down is a great book that any animal lover must read!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I work in a bookstore, and on a slow day, I found this book while shelving. I didn't know much about it, but I was curious enough to start reading. I found that I couldn't put it down, and was amazed that Richard Adams could make rabbits seem so human and still make them seem like rabbits. I loved this book, and was suprised I hadn't read it earlier. I would recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is such a delight to read. At one time I didn't want to read the book because it was required for a class in school. Now, so many years later, I re-read it on occasion.

Before I read this book I hated to read because I thought it was boring a dull, but after I read Watership Down I found out what an exciting world some authors can bring you into.I mean I at first got this book for summer reading (for school) because my grandmother said it was a great book, but she did not tell me it was 400 and somethin' pages. So, I said Britt you have to read a book it might as well be a 400 and somethin' page book.As soon as I started reading I was automatically I was pulled into this wonderous and magical world of rabbits. I mean Richard Adams makes you feel you are one of Hazel's mighty crew, and because of that I plowed through this book in three weeks, which is incredibly fast for me. I recomend this book to anyone of any age who does not like to read or loves to read.Summary: Fiver, Hazel's little brother, has this horrible preminition of something horrible hapening to their warren (group of holes or a rabbit comminity). Hazel tells the cheif rabbit, he does not believe them, and will not leave thier warren. So, Fiver convences Hazel to get a small group of rabbits together and leave the warren. You will have to read the book to find out all of the adventures they go through looking for a new warren."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Simply put, 'Watership Down' is my favorite novel of all time. I have loved it since I was a small child and continue to revisit it every couple of years. Each rereading of the tale of these amazing and 'human' bunnies never fails to move and thrill me. If you've never read this classic, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. &quot;Talking rabbits&quot; or not, these are some of the most memorable characters in fiction."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A friend recommended Watership Down as a great book to read and she was right. I could not put the book down. I even set my clock to get up early before work to read this book about rabbits. The characters Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and all the animals seemed human, and I kept forgetting that these are fairy-tale rabbits and not humans. The only thing that was wrong with this book even though it was 400+ pages was that it was too short. Watership Down is a book for young and old alike. Great Book"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I advise everyone to read this book, it's a wonderful tale of adventure. Many times I stayed up till eleven or twelve at night reading it. Though its sort of slow at the begining it will only get better and better as you read more. This is a story about a band of rabbits fleaing there warren from (at the time)an unkown danger to find a new, safe home. The rabbits encounter problems on their journey that they must overcome to survive. Eventually they find a beautiful, safe home. They are in peace until they realize they are missing a key point in their warrens survival, and as they discover a soloution it will lead them to a danger that could be worse than any other they have ran into before. This is a great book, all the rabbits in this story carry distince personalities that help make this book so exciting to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There are no right words to describe this book. When I was little my sister read the stories from it to me and my other sisters and I fell in love with the characters. Several years later, I saw the book in the bookshelf and recognized it, read it, and fell in love with the characters all over again. This is a book you can read by yourself, with children, or other adults. Watership Down wasn't a book I could read just once or twice. I read it so many times my mom threatened to burn it (thankfully she didn't). I still cry each time at the end of the book because it's time to part with the characters, but they're still in my heart, and someday I would even like to get around to visiting the real place, Watership Down, and envision the story again. I recommend this book to everyone I know and I'm still trying to convince several people to read it. I have noticed these two things about the people who have started reading it and stopped because they didn't like it: they read it on and off and give up too early. If you read a page and put the book down it becomes harder to fall in love and know the characters and be able to appreciate them. Please don't make the mistake. No one needs to miss out on this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You will love this book--it's as simple as that. I was on a train to Biggleswade, England, a couple weeks ago, and it was sunset. There were a bunch of bunnies out in a brussels sprouts field--no doubt at silflay--and it reminded me that it was once again time to read Watership Down. This isn't a book one reads; it's a book one inhabits. You will be transported! Adams has the most incredible touch with the English language--his main characters are so gentle, so touching they'll make you weep. There's savagery in it as well, which can even be shocking at times. And the tales that are interspersed within the novel are works unto themselves (You'll just roar at Rowsy Woof!) I'm an American who now lives in England, and the portrayal of the gentle English countryside is worth the read alone. You will not be disappointed--read this book at once! (P.S. To this day I still refer to the old heap of a Dodge that I had in high school as &quot;The Hrududu!&quot;)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book is not about rabbits like you may think. It is a tale of exile and survival. It is a novel of adventurous rabbits that have to desert their home and venture forth to find a new home. One glorious adventure one afeter an other. Once you start to read it you won't want to put it down. It is a good book for all ages."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"&quot;Oh great, a book about rabbts,&quot; is the first thing I thought when my 9th grade English teacher handed this book out last year. Even after reading the first couple chapters, I wasn't convinced the novel would interest me- but it turned out to be one of my favorites. As a group of rabbits travels through a forest to seek a new warren, at the deranged advice of one of the younger rabbits, Fiver, Richard Adams explores some of the world's political systems at the time in the different warrens. Some of the lovable characters they meet along the way, such as Kehaar, a Black-headed Gull, keep humor in the sometimes dark novel. You'll most likely have to read this book in school, but if you never had to, I really recommend you buy it. It sure ain't just a bunch of rabbits to this Texan!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have been reading the reviews on Amazon.com for this book, and decided that I should put my 2 cents in. The first thing that is so utterly captivating about this novel, is that although the main characters are rabbits, they become much more than that as you get into the story. Some people have claimed that this novel is full of weak characters and nothing put descriptions of the texture of plants. However, is a rabbit that strategically plans a complicated battle against a heavily secured rabbit society considered weak? I can't imagine someone claiming that the characters in this book are not full of depth and character. The wonderful thing about Richard Adams is that he creates an entire world for you, but it is more than that, he makes it believable. The rabbits in this book have complicated societies. Each rabbit warren has a different political system. The rabbits also have muths, legends, and heroes. People have also complained that Mr. Adams should have done this book with humans, but that would have wreaked it. Rabbits are a fresh realm, if Mr. Adams used the human realm we would have far too many preconceived ideas about the way that things should be. However, when you look at the world of the rabbits, you can incorporate many of the aspects of our world and view them from a totally different perspective. It is my personal opinion that anybody who says they &quot;hate&quot; this book is simply someone who doesn't appreciate fine, intricately designed literature. I hope that one day, these people will realize that there is more to literature than non-stop action with no details. Literature is a web of plots and sub-plots mixed with an array of character build up that makes a novel that can't be put down.In short, I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who loves or likes to read. With that final note, I bid you farewell."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first, when I started reading Warership Down by Richard Adams, I thoght it would be about rabbits eating grass and talking. I was wrong! Watership Down is an exciting book that will have you wanting to read more. Each charecter has it's own personality and you feel like you really know each rabbit. It can be read on many levels as a reader and it doesn't matter if your a kid or adult, you'll like Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"...This is my favorite book in the whole universe, and loved it with every fiber of my being.

Nothing can top it.I would advise every avid reader of the world to read this, and its sequel, which, though less wonderful than its original, is still extremely good."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK VERSIONBOOK DESCRIPTIONA small group of rabbits leave their warren in the English countryside when one of them (a small rabbit named Fiver who has the gift of prophecy) foresees bad things on the horizon. The book chronicles their adventures as they seek a place to build a new warren. Under the leadership of Hazel, the band of rabbits faces many obstacles--from how to cross a river to the lack of does to the penultimate battle with a warren run by the evil General Woundwart.MY THOUGHTSI cannot believe that I didn't read this book until this year!! Originally published in 1972, Watership Down has been sitting out there my entire life and yet it took me until 2012 to read it. All I ever knew was that it was a book about rabbits. The simplistic book description is also deceiving. Yet it took only an hour of listening for me to realize that I was in the presence of greatness--a true 5 star read. Watership Down was an incredibly satisfying, rich and magical reading experience--the kind of book that transcends age and time. In my opinion, it deserves a place on the list of best books of all time, and it certainly has earned a place on my list of all-time favorite books.What makes the book so satisfying is that it works on multiple levels and that Adams strikes the perfect balance between reality and magic. Not only will the book satisfy children looking for a gripping adventure tale and rabbit folklore (the book grew out of a series of stories that Adams told his daughters), it will also satisfy an adult reader, with the rich personalities of the rabbits (we all have a Big Wig in our lives, I'm sure) and how well the rabbits' lives translate into our human lives. Although Adams talks in the introduction about how the book is not an allegory, it is not difficult to see the differences between the leadership approaches of Hazel and General Woundwart.Perhaps the best choice that Adams made is that, although these are talking rabbits, he makes them grounded in reality. In the introduction, Adams talks about how he never has his rabbits do anything that a real rabbit wouldn't do. These are not rabbits who build little houses and wear clothes like Peter Cottontail. They are wild and natural rabbits and they live as such. When faced with an obstacle such as how to cross a river, they come up with a solution that felt realistic, plausible and yet seemed like a huge leap of logic for a rabbit, which is why Blackberry (the \\"smart one\\") had to come up with it.Adams even gives the rabbits their own language (Lapine), which I found myself easily adopting. (Their word for tractor or car is hrududu, which, when pronounced by an awesome reader like Ralph Casham, sounds just like a vehicle engine as interpreted by an animal.) It became commonplace to hear words like silflay (going aboveground to feed) and know exactly what they meant.Another wondrous touch was the rich folklore and mythology that Adams creates for the rabbits. One of the ways the rabbits keep their spirits up and adapt to their surroundings is by repeating the stories of El-Ahrairah, one of the first rabbits, whose exploits and trickery are woven throughout the book. I adored these stories about El-Ahrairah and enjoyed seeing how the rabbits would adapt the story to their present situation.The other thing I loved about this book was that Adams doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of life. The rabbits face real danger, including death and injury. Yet these moments are leavened by moments of triumph, peace and sweetness. There were also moments of comic relief (the pidgin talk of the gull Keehar and Big Wig's take on the world just tickled me). In addition, Adams writes one of the most beautiful and satisfying death scenes I've ever read in literature.Nothing I can write can really capture how wondrous and satisfying and pleasing this book was. If you've not read it yet, please get a copy (either in print or on audiobook) and read it as soon as possible. You don't want to miss this book like I almost did. It is brilliant on so many levels, and I applaud Adams for creating such a wondrous work of literature that hits all the right notes.ABOUT THE NARRATIONRalph Cosham was the narrator I listened to, and he was pitch perfect. He captured the voices of each character perfectly--from Pipken's timidity to Big Wig's warm-hearted bluster. At 15+ hours, this was relatively long listen but I never once tired of it and could not wait to immerse myself in this world over and over again. It was with a real sense of loss that I finished this book.RECOMMENDED FORThis is as perfect as a book can get and I recommend it to everyone. If you haven't read it yet, I strongly urge you to do so. I shall definitely be reading/listening to this one again, and I cannot wait for my son to be ready for it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderful story for kids and adults alike. Richard Adams tells the adventures of a group of rabbits forced to leave their home and strike out into unknown lands to build a new warren. The story is told from the perspective of the rabbits, each of whom has a personality all their own, with strengths and weaknesses. We're introduced to the rabbits' language, customs and culture, and we get to hear some of their own legends of mythical heroes throughout the book. Adams does a great job of writing from an animal point of view, where man-made things are strange and mysterious, surroundings are explored from the ground with sight and smell, and we feel the rabbits' fear of larger animals and \\"elil\\" (rabbit predators).The story itself has a good rhythm, alternating fast paced action with slow paced descriptions, with an exciting ending and an epilogue that brings the tale to a satisfying close but leaves you wanting more.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was the first \\"big\\" book I ever read. The synopsis on the cover was intriguing and the story was engrossing. I found myself drawn in to the life of a group of rabbits who experienced all manner of danger and adventure after their brave departure from a comfortable rabbit warren. I remember feeling a sense of loss after the story came to a close and I could no longer read the further experiences of the rabbits --beings who I felt I had come to know as well as siblings. The descriptions of rabbit behavior (and other animals) on the beautiful English countryside setting were realistic and simple at the same time. I often recalled fondly the copy I'd found at the library as a child and imagined that I'd read it to my children in later years. After reading the Harry Potter series to my children, they asked what we could read now that it had ended. I immediately thought about Watership Down.

They may be gripping or fun, but that does not make them good literature. Too often, the characters lack depth, based around stock stereotypes, like cut-paper dolls, like summer blockbusters.2) \\"It has talking bunnies.\\" -- Firstly, this is no Disney tale, like Bambi, or as the National Review may think, Dumbo. Secondly, as to whether talking animals somehow discredits a book from being good, I cite Animal Farm.3) \\"Too much description\\" -- Some authors, like Robert Jordan, write books with description that serves no purpose to the overall plot and atmosphere. This book is not one of those books. The artfully crafted description creates vivid scenery important to the plot and to the imagination.4) \\"Made up words\\" -- If you think making up words is a crime in literature, you've just ousted A Clockwork Orange, as well as Lord of the Rings. I did not find the usage of fake words uncomfortable.But then again, I love classics (Camus, Dostoevsky, Bronte, Nietzsche) and modern fiction (Card, Murakami, LeGuin, Calvino).

The first time I read this story I was a little confused at first, but that is because Adam so thoroughly immerses the reader in the rabbit's culture. While that may sound strange; in fact, it's wondrous and thoroughly engrossing. The rabbit folklore in this story is part of what makes Watership Down unlike other fantasy novels. The characters are heroic, but their heroism is complicated by the fact that they are rabbits and thus are prey to all types of predators. How and why they escape their doomed warren is mystical and dangerous. Hazel's emergence as a leader is gradual and inspiring. This is a story that can be read again and again and will always delight."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think Watership Down is an informative and imaginative book about how rabbits live in society. Even though the book is fictional, it takes you into the lives and journeys of a group of rabbits formed to leave their home.

Symbolism is embedded in this novel through different species of animals working together for one common goal. This novel can be enjoyed by all. I first read this book in 8th grade and I just finished reading it to my own students. I recommend reading this classic book to all lovers of suspense, mystery, and adventure."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I had a trusted friend tell me that he had a riveting, suspenseful book for me to read I was excited. When he told me that the book was about bunnies, I thought of \`Thumper' from Bambi, in some sort of Schwarzenegger movie with grenades and machine guns. However, the trust I have in my friend outweighed the ridiculous images I had in my mind of the Easter bunny as a pirate, or Bugs Bunny driving the van in a heist.All that being said, \`Watership Down' by Richard Adams is an extremely suspenseful book that makes your heart-rate skyrocket while you bite your nails, and pull your hair in anticipation of the unfolding, brilliant plot. The tale is about a group of rabbits, primarily Fiver, a peculiar runt that has prophetic abilities, and Hazel, a good hearted rabbit thrust into a position of leadership. The two decide to leave their warren with a few others due to the odd supernatural feelings Fiver receives concerning the future of their home.Their departure resultsin a compelling page turner that effortlessly engages the reader. At face value, the story really only has events that you would imagine occur in the dull life of rabbits: finding food, mates, and shelter. But Adams has a keen ability to create a sense of desperation within the reader for the rabbits to accomplish this task and does so this through his masterful character development. Each rabbit has their own distinct characteristics: some are eerie, some likable, some hysterical, and some downright frightening. The quirks, speech, and other unique qualities drove me to caring deeply for the outcome of Hazel, Fiver, and all of their peers.There are also segments blended within the \`Watership Down' of the rabbit's mythology and folklore that read as entertaining children's stories. These elements mixed with the \`Lapine' glossary in the back of the book to help you decipher rabbit words for things like: tractors, badgers, and droppings, envelop the reader in a fantasy world that is actually a beautiful depiction of a real place seen through the eyes of wonderfully crafted rabbit characters.Watership Down is a must read that I will proudly place on bookshelf number 4 of 5.[...]"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down.

This is not a comprehensive list, but it will do."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams states rather casually in the introduction to this 2005 edition that \\"Watership Down was never intended to be some sort of allegory or parable. It is simply the story about rabbits made up and told in the car.\\" Well, that must have been some drive, because students of the book have been expositing upon its non-allegories since it was first published in 1972.For instance; the final self-sacrifice of the mythical El-ahrairah to save his people; or Fiver the prophet of doom; or the character of the Black Rabbit; or the terrible rise of Woundwort. These may be unintentionally similar to historical or biblical characters, or merely representative of the subconscious imagination of a man who had survived WWII. A man who now lived under the shadow of communism, the cold war, Vietnam and jolly ol' England's slide into Socialism following the ruins of empire.What I find preposterous is the idea that the various rabbit warrens portrayed were not allegories of some sort, particularly Cowslip's (Shining Wire) Warren and Woundwart's Efrafa Warren. These two warrens symbolized the quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin; \\"Those who would trade liberty for security deserve neither.\\" Both warrens were unnatural, with the first being a total sacrifice of the traditional ways of the wild rabbit for the security from want. The second being a total sacrifice of freedom for the security from danger.What these warrens achieved in their fictional realities were reflective of the shadows that Mr. Adams himself lived under at the time. The easier of the two to understand is the police state of Efrafa Warren, representative of the Fascist states brought to rubble in the war, and the looming Communist behemoth of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European vassals. The much harder to understand is the Shining Wire state of Cowslip's Warren, with its generations gone of lost traditions and its embrace of death.Cowslip's Warren is the much more frightening of the two because it wasn't representative of the \\"other,\\" as the Soviet Union was to the people of England in 1972. The Shining Wire Warren, with its promise of unwilling sacrifice, loss of culture, destruction of history and turning away from religion; that was the state of \\"becoming.\\"Whether Adams knew it or not, the Shining Wire Warren was a foreshadowing of what England was becoming. What England is today, and how much more England will be in the future.In the human condition, freedom from want requires unwilling sacrifices that rob a culture of its very soul. For instance, the unwilling sacrifice of the elderly due to the expense of medical procedures. The unwilling sacrifice of history, culture and worship that are stolen from the young due to political correctness. Unwilling sacrifice leads to unparalleled selfishness. The only thing these people refuse to sacrifice, once all that had made them a great people is lost on the altar of Socialist Utopian theory, is the belief in the lie that there can be security from want."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I never read this book in high school like others, but as an adult and bunny enthusiast I figured it was about time I read it! And wow! This book was great. It took a few chapters to catch my interest, but it became increasingly harder to put down each night. It was like a rabbit version of The Hobbit. But giving it more analysis, there were a lot of thought-provoking ideas in the book about society and government.I think the author must have spent some time being a rabbit himself! It was very well-written from the rabbits' points of view. It wasn't like someone decided to write a thinly-veiled political book disguised as a story about rabbits and threw something together. It is obvious the amount of research that went into writing about how the rabbits lived and thought. There were times when I was reading the rabbits' explanations for the world around them and I could only laugh, thinking, that's exactly what rabbits would think!!I was also really impressed with the characters in the story. For rabbits, they had so much more personality to them than a lot of the human characters in other books I read. I like to give stories what I call \\"The Star Wars test\\" - can you describe the character without saying what they look like or what their job is? Of course, not every single character in this story, but for many of the main characters, yes!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'll jump on the bandwagon and laud this book. I only got around to reading it in 2008, and it was hands-down the best book I read that year. Certainly a classic I'd like to revisit one day and read to my kids. The \\"fantasy\\" elements aren't too stylized, the dialogue isn't too intricate, but it comes across as an engrossing epic tale. Perhaps it's amazing for that fact alone... Is there such thing as a simple epic? ;)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love this book! This epic is like The Lord of the Rings with rabbits! There is great emotion and danger within the pages of this novel and one will become immersed with the language and imagery and will find it difficult to leave it to return to the real world. This is what Tolkien's work always did to me and I was happily surprised when Richard Adams was able to do the same thing with Watership Down. The book read quickly and I loved every minute of the experience. I was sad to see the story end and I highly suggest anyone who loves epics to do themselves a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Wow, for a story about rabbits, this was a pretty exciting tale. Adams does a great job of bringing you into the story and making you care about these small critters. They still retain their rabbitness, but you feel empathy for them as you would another human.When his brother Fiver predicts that tragedy is going to befall their warren, Hazel gathers as many people as will go with him to set off for a new place that will be free from danger. With a small band of rabbits, they face much hardship and dangerous foes in search of a place they can call home. Eventually, they come to the Watership Downs and find a place high on a hill that proves to be the perfect spot for their new warren.There is one problem however, the only ones who escaped where males. They need to have some does in order to get on with their lives. With a daring plan they set out to gather does only to be brutally beaten by a warlord in charge of another warren. After nearly dying, they decide to devise a plan and get back at this evil foe and make sure that they expand their warren any way possible.Even though they are rabbits, the characters in this novel are amazing and full of depth. They all have their own distinct personalities but still act like rabbits. There is no amazing feats of daring that a normal rabbit couldn't do. They all operate inside their natural limitations.Adams has an easy going writing style. I found it particularly interesting that he developed his own \\"language\\" for the rabbits. As a linguist it was interesting to see how he chose to use both the English language and the rabbit's natural along with the pidgin language they used to communicate with other animals. It showed great complexity. His writing is very clear and descriptive and he describes the rabbits movements very accurately. I could picture easily what events were taking place.As a bit of a warning, as much as this could be a book for children, it has some very violent aspects. The rabbits fight frequently and their injuries are described in detail. This could be frightening for younger children. Another part of the book I didn't particularly care for were the stories the rabbits told. They just seemed like filler and I wasn't that interested in them.A great book to be sure and I can see why it is highly recommended. I'll definitely look into his other books and perhaps the cartoon based off of the book.Watership DownCopyright 1972474 pages + maps and Lapine GlossaryReview by M. Reynard 2010"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a lengthy but charming book about a troupe of rabbits who leave their warren with its oppressive social structure to make a better life. The rabbits are anthropomorphized about half of the time. The rest of the time they are portrayed realistically with the behaviors, enemies, foods, and type of homes that characterize wild rabbits in Britain.The realistic part was my favorite aspect of the book. Adams is thoroughly knowledgeable about the lives and habits of rabbits, and it was fascinating to learn about them in so much detail.The anthropomorphic aspect was also interesting, though. It is political allegory, social commentary, and a moving story about fictional characters. We see four different types of political structure in the various warrens: an priviledged aristocracy (in this case, entitlement is conferred not through bloodlines but according to superior size and strength); a society that is accepts the periodic sacrifice of some of its members in order that the survivors may enjoy a life of pampered luxury; a totalitarian society that values safety over freedom; and a democracy in which everyone makes decisions together.Because this is a plot-driven novel without a great deal of character development, it has the feel of a fairy tale or allegory (although with much more detail.) This makes it less emotionally intense than it might have been, but I think that Adams made the right choice in writing the book in such a way. He struck a balance between the portraying the rabbits as natural and as anthropomorphized. To develop their characters and personalities more deeply would have been to humanize them, to take away their \\"rabbitness\\".I didn't like the made-up rabbit language, though. I realize the purpose of it - to impart a sense of foreignness - but it isn't successful. The made-up words are substituted too randomly and arbitrarily, when an ordinary English word would have worked just as well (better, actually.) The invented language ends up just being irritating, to have to keep flipping to the back of the book to look up words in the glossary. (Doing that on a Kindle makes it even more annoying.) Even the author seem to get tired of it - I noticed that except for frequently-used words that one soon learns, he uses the \\"Lapine\\" language less and less as the book progresses.Watership Down is a well-written and very unique book that can be enjoyed equally by both adults and older children. No wonder it is a classic!(429 pages)Quotes from Watership Down:\\"I'd have him love the thing that wasBefore the world was made.\\"- W.B. Yeats, quoted in Watership Down\\"To come to the end of a time of anxiety and fear! To feel the cloud that hung over us lift and disperse - the cloud that dulled the heart and made happiness no more than a memory! This at least is one joy that must have been known by almost every living creature.\\""},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Hazel lives with his smaller brother, Fiver, in the Sandleford Warren with lots of other bucks and does organized around the Chief Rabbit and his Owsla (a group of guard rabbits). Fiver's a bit of a prophetic and has odd, sometimes unintelligible visions. One such vision is of a terrible danger coming to the warren and in his fear and conviction convinces Hazel the Chief Rabbit must be notified. In order for the warren to be safe, an evacuation order must be made. Unfortunately, neither Hazel nor Fiver is believed. However, hope is not lost: one by one rabbits start to appear in support of Fiver and are willing to follow the two in their journey to escape the unknown danger and start their own warren. Along the way they run into rivers, foxes, gulls, mice, cats, a dog, traps, unknown devices made by man, and strange new rabbits.When I tried explaining what this book was about to my brother, it came out something like this, \\"It's about a bunch of bunnies and they're trying to find a spot to make a good warren and then they realize, \`hey, we need some does' so they try and find some does and then there's these other vengeful bunnies with lots of extra girl rabbits but they don't want anyone taking them and then...\\"That's not too coherent, but in a nutshell Watership Down can be broken into a few parts: fleeing the warren, settling into Watership Down, needing does to fill the Honeycomb, and the journey that takes them to hell and back just to get some, as Kehaar would put it \\"mudders.\\" It can't just be about that though (well, it can be, but it isn't), and so the adventures of Fiver and Hazel are enormous and test the very strengths and weaknesses of lapine endurance, friendship, and ingenuity. Initially, the group sets out with 10 additional rabbits (even the Chief Rabbit's nephew comes along) and grows, by the end of the book, to 32, plus kittens (baby rabbits). I thought keeping track of twelve rabbits with distinct personalities and dialogue was hard to do. Richard Adams kept throwing more into the mix! To make it even better (or worse, but really he's adorable), there's also Kehaar, a gull with an Austrian accent Hazel and Fiver's warren befriends, and an unnamed mouse companion.The large cast of characters aside, Hazel and Fiver have a lot to contend with themselves as they cross the wide unknown, but they have a few advantages on their side: bravery and open mindedness. Those are, I think, two of the most powerful ideas behind Watership Down. As the group first sets out, they encounter their first obstacle: a small river. There's a lot of confusion, wariness, and a bit of despair as the rabbits feel the limitations of their own traditional methods of travel. Everyone is tired and afraid; no one wants to cross, even though they can swim perfectly well; no one wants to leave little Pipkin and Fiver--the youngest and most exhausted of the bunch--behind. With a little bit of ingenuity and some convincing, they fashion a raft out of a piece of driftwood and float the pair across. I make it sound more simple than it actually was (in one sense, it's quite simple). That's the beauty of Richard Adams' writing: he turns a small river crossing into a test of skill and intelligence, the first challenge that forces the rabbits to act in very un-rabbit-like ways to save themselves. They confront their sense of propriety and overcome expectations in this, only the first obstacle to reach Watership Down.Hazel and Fiver's group are pioneers and radical in their ideas and methods (does aren't the only rabbits that can dig out a warren). They go against tradition but never once compromise their integrity or resort to fighting when talking will do just as well, if not better. Everyone is kind and patient, but most of all: welcoming.I really adored the spirit of each rabbit--Adams writes from the intimate knowledge that inordinate amounts of research and devotion brings and uses terminology and descriptions that are innately natural to lapine movement. He not only convinces us their gestures are those of rabbits, but that from the very depths of their being they are calling forth some collective rabbitness that turns out to be the very core of sentient creatures everywhere. With beautiful passages such at this:\\"When several creatures--men or animals--have worked together to overcome something offering resistance and have at last succeeded, there follows often a pause--as though they felt the propriety of paying respect to the adversary who has put up so good a fight.\\"p. 215 Watership Down, Scribner Trade editionAdams invites a contemplation that goes beyond rabbits pulling down a hutch door. Their efforts are appreciated long after we stop to consider the absurdity that Adam has imbued with such gravity. The actions of rabbits are on a rabbit-scale; Blackberry and Bigwig (my favorite, aside from Kehaar) have tackled a new, strong adversary and won. In thinking of their feat we must consider a time when we, too, have felt the pause of success Adams refers to. As the moment comes to us, finally we understand and so believe in their courage. As the door falls, we may see a little rabbit in ourselves--that part of us that, like those of the Honeycomb, is all \\"warm hearts and brave spirits\\" (p. 279).If you haven't already read it, I highly recommend Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was very disapionted to read all the negative views about this book. This is a wonderful read. One of those rare books that you will pick up, reread again, and find something new in it you didn't notice the first time. This is also based on how wild rabbits behave in the wild. So yes, it would be natural for the male bunnies to view females as 'breeding stock.' However, if you do read into what the bucks are saying about the females, esp the hutch rabbits, they do show some general concern for their welfare. They are just not a romantic species. Believe you, i breed rabbits, and that point is very true. Boy bunnies generally do not care about the females unless they can mate wth them. They do not give a flip about female rights.I highly recommend reading it. This is beautfully written book. The portrayal of the countryside the rabbits wander thoughis excellent. They have adventures one right after th eother that makes you want to skip ahead a few pages to see if they will be OK."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"In the author's note beginning this read, Adams states that he struggled to find a publisher, as the characters of bunnys was childish, whereas the storyline was very adult.And thats what I thought this book would be like. Well the storyline was very adult, kinda like Gulliver's travels. The main crew of rabbits travel the countryside and encounter trails and tribulations which (apparently unintentionally) are allegories for human society.The whole rabbit thing is done brillantly, from a rabbit's perspective the world is a dangerous and fascinating place, its a bit like a fantasy novel with supernatural creatures, except the creatures are of course dogs, foxes and human vehicles.As an older book Watership Down, does have a longer-winded feel about it, with lots of stories within the story and build-up to the final confrontation.I remember my first experience of this book was actually the movie (intially dismissed as a child's Animals of Farthing wood type thing) Then I happened to catch my younger brother watching towards the end, where there were rabbits totally tearing the s*** out of each other and brutality in all corners.Highly Recommended :)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Some stories forever change the landscape of literature. They permeate through the varied genres of fiction, beyond age or demographics, and somehow manage to speak to everyone, to see the world in a little better light. Richard Adams wrote just such a work in \\"Watership Down.\\"The story, now published in several editions and the subject of a fairly well done animated movie, follows a band of rabbits who strike out from the apparent safety of their warren into the unknown English countryside. Pricked by the intuition of his wan brother, Fiver, Hazel convinces a small group from the warren that the time has come to seek a new home, one where they can live free from danger and away from the restrictive regime of their chief rabbit and his officers. The way is fraught with danger from both the expected predators (mankind being the most potent, albeit oblivious), as well as some more surprising antagonists. They discover that life among rabbits in the outer world is far different from anything they have ever known. When, at last, they reach Fiver's promised destination, they are thrust into war with a tyrannical and expansive neighboring warren, led by a powerful warlord known as General Woundwort, the conclusion of which contains perhaps the finest epitaph for a battle scene ever penned in the English language.Interwoven throughout the entire novel is warm prose, dynamic characters, beautiful depictions of the country (that obviously flow from a life spent in appreciation of nature), and, perhaps most interestingly, a richly imagined mysticism for rabbits which comes to guide some of the higher aspirations of the heroes. The impressive breadth of the novel makes this among one of the longer fantasies of its time. But it is worth reading every word.Indeed, the world of reading is a far better place because of \\"Watership Down.\\"-Matthew Lucas (author of \\"A Roar in the Pinelands\\")[...]"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was in great shape when I received it in the mail.

It is a wise, real and beautiful story of life, the struggle to overcome hardship and the joy of the simple gifts that are part of our journey. The fact that the characters in Watership Down are mostly rabbits is secondary to the action. It is a great adventure full of images that refresh the mind.I have read this first edition once a year at least since 1972, and I am about to order another copy -- hopefully the type will be like the original -- which has been read until it has totally fallen apart.I think this story is not for everyone.

I originally wrote the following in 1999 on a Watership Down discussion forum that no longer exists . . . (There are spoilers included, or they can be considered \\"things to look for.\\")It depends on where you are in your life when you read the book. I read it for the first time when I was about 30 years old. I found it interesting, but that was about it. I was VERY busy with children and a career at that point in my life. Not much time to get too deeply engrossed in anything. Was nothing more than a good read.I read it for the second time when I was in my mid-40s. It was a completely different read then. It meant a lot more to me. It represented a story of daring and courage - of a willingness to forsake the known for the unknown. Courage.I then read it several more times thereafter. My emotional attachment to the characters became an obsession. I studied the rabbits as if they were actual persons. All, except the rabbits of the shining wires, were given redeeming attributes, and even there Strawberry (I believe it was), was ultimately redeemed. There was Hazel's (the chief rabbit) wisdom. He wasn't a rocket scientist, but he drew on each rabbit's strength to the groups best advantage. There was Bigwig's courage and strength. Fiver's supernatural powers. Clover (the biker chick)'s willingness to just go. Blackavar's selfless loyalty to a good leader. Even Pipkin, assuming it would lead to his death, went with Hazel to the farm out of loyalty to the one who would not let him be abandoned. Then there was the fierce General Wundwort. He forgot he was a rabbit, designed mainly to be food for the rest of the animal world. He'd kick anybody's butt - rabbit, cat, dog, man, he didn't care. Ya gotta admire that kinda attitude.I'm convinced Richard Adams never intended half the influence and impact his first novel would have. He wrote several others following that, but I only read one other (\\"Traveler\\" from the viewpoint of Robert E. Lee's horse), and I didn't think much of it.And, I've yet to say something about Richard Adams' colorful writing style. I have several favorite passages, for several different reasons and depending on the mood I'm in. For example:\\"A few minutes later, there was not a rabbit to be seen on the down. The sun sank below Ladle Hill and the autumn stars began to shine in the darkening east - Perseus, and the Pleiades, Cassiopeia, faint Pices and the great square of Pegasus. The wind freshened, and soon myriads of dry beech leaves were filling the ditches and hollows and blowing in gusts across the dark miles of open grass. Underground the story continued.\\" (\\"And Last\\" - last paragraph)\\"A few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished into the copse beyond. A magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on the empty slope, flew closer to look. But all that lay there was a splintered peg and a twisted length of wire.\\" (\\"The Shining Wire\\" - last paragraph) I admire those passages for the feeling of here and now and immediate transitioning to the vast universe and time eternal. Sorta hard to explain.I also like: \\"Such was Woundwort's monument: and perhaps it would not have displeased him.\\" (Epilogue) For the salvation Adams provided the General notwithstanding his assault on Watership Down.And: \\"And sometimes when they told tales on a sunny evening by the beech trees, he could not clearly recall whether they were about himself or about some other rabbit hero of days gone by.\\" (\\"Epilogue\\") For the sweet sadness at the knowledge that wise Hazel is getting old and his memory's starting to fade, signaling that his part in the greater scheme will soon be over.And then Pipkin for bravery when he knew it would mean certain death for him: \\"Oh Bigwig, cried Pipkin, 'let me stay out there with him [fiver]! You'll never miss me, and I can go on trying [to revive Fiver] ---\\" (\\"Bigwig Stands His Ground\\")And Bigwig's courage and loyalty after he'd already been half torn to bits (it this regard, he was a lot like Woundwort): \\"My chief rabbit has told me to defend this run and until he says otherwise I shall stay here\\" (\\"Bigwig Stands His Ground\\")Finally, the story ends where it started, acknowledging the \\"circle of life\\" (decades before the term became popular). First sentence: \\"The primroses were over.\\" Last sentence: \\"Hazel followed [El-ahrairah]; and together they slipped away, running easily down through the wood, where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.\\"When you read it, if you get half of what I've gotten from it, it'll become one of your favorites too."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Somehow I missed this book some years ago, but when reading Jamison's book, \\"Nothing Was the Same\\" I understood it's importance from her references to it. Utterly delightful and captivating. You really become involved with the characters and ideas ."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"For our family's summer reading selection, I picked the mammoth four-hundred-page Watership Down by Richard Adams. Some novels will feel like an endurance test just four pages in. Without fail, whenever I read Watership Down, those four hundred pages feel to me like a summer holiday. My husband, who groaned at the idea of reading such a long book about rabbits, instead has eagerly returned to the book whenever he has a spare minute.\\"The rabbits arrived at their new home - but I'm not even halfway through the book,\\" my husband observed. \\"What in the world can happen next?\\" Richard Adams never ceases to amaze me with how he handles pacing. On the surface, his rabbit tale is a fairly simple one: rabbits must escape their doomed warren and find a new home. In less capable hands, Watership Down would have been half as long and packed with chases, storms, brawls, and catastrophes. But Adams never hurries his tale. Often he stops to leisurely describe the scenery or to wax philosophical. Sometimes he even dedicates an entire chapter to a rabbit folktale. Yet these interludes rarely feel like interruptions; rather, these interesting descriptions, musings, and stories of the rabbit god Frith and the great trickster El-ahrairah increase the momentum. Adams also never resorts to implausible plot twists. Instead he is perfectly content to tell his simple tale and trust his readers to listen--and so we do.I am astounded at how imperfect and yet captivating are Adams' rabbits. Take Fiver, a runt who has been blessed with the gift of prophecy. Then there is Fiver's older brother, Hazel, whose greatest strength is his ability to identify and trust the strengths of others. By speaking with conviction of his trust in his brother's visions of doom, he convinces a small band of rabbits to leave the warren and seek a new home. Yet even he also makes errors in judgment. One day to prove his greatness as a leader, despite desperate warnings from Fiver, Hazel sets out to rescue pet rabbits from a nearby farm - and almost meets a violent end. Darker characters also exist. For example, let me introduce you to Strawberry who lives in a different warren. He hides a dark secret, which almost becomes the downfall of one of Hazel's companions. Despite his betrayal, he eventually joins Hazel's warren and becomes a great asset. And then there is Captain Holly. One of the powerful elite at the Sandleford warren, he attempts to arrest Hazel and his fellow rabbits to prevent them from leaving the warren. After failing to do so, he later seeks refuge at Hazel's new warren and becomes a valued contributor. These rabbits are fallible, allowing Adams to present many stirring moments of heartache and redemption.Adams considered the Berkshire countryside to also be a character in Watership Down. He certainly lavishes great attention to it. In a random survey which I conducted of twenty books for young people, over half of them dedicated their first paragraph to introducing character. And by character, I mean a human being or least an animal. Half of the books didn't refer to setting until the second paragraph or even the second page. And when they did, they often only dedicated one sentence to description. A particularly generous author may perhaps devote an entire early paragraph to setting. In contrast, Adams spends the first three paragraphs on the landscape. That's not to say Adams wastes time waxing poetic. In each paragraph, he details the scenery but also the place of the rabbits within it: \\"The May sunset was red in clouds and there was still half an hour to twilight. The dry slope was dotted with rabbits--some nibbling at their grass....\\" Those paragraphs might be long, but they effectively establish a tone of peace, which within a few pages is quietly interrupted. Readers are all the richer for how saturated in reality Watership Down really is.\\"No author today would think of writing a four-hundred-page book about rabbits,\\" my husband observed. Adams himself did not begin with such an audacious goal; Watership Down started out as story told by Adams to his daughters on car rides. As the years went on, his daughters encouraged him to share his story with the world, and finally he took the plunge and set the tale to paper. But Watership Down received so many rejections that Adams considered publishing it himself. Then a small-time publisher named Rex Collins accepted it for a two thousand copy run. Since that time it has rightfully sold millions of copies."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read Watership Down as a middle school student. My father had suggested it to me.

Unless you like to torture yourself with horrible literature, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I don't believe this, some of the people here gave a bad review and then some of these fans insult that person and his/her opinions. the jerks!

There are plenty of books about talking humans that aren't pure fantasy. why don't you read those?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was so incredibly boring,. I wish I could give it a no-stars rating. I mean, who cares about a bunch of rabbits. The story was very confusing and got me totally lost. All that happened, was rabbits did this and rabbits did that. There were a few occasional parts that were remotely interesting, but not enough to make it worth reading. I would have stopped reading as soon as I started it except that I had to read it for school. But if you are thinking about getting this, I recommend you save yourself the time and money."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I really did not enjoy Watership Down. As a student in juinor high school it was very boring to read. I did not want to read a book about rabbits and their problems. The book did not match my interests, so it made me dislike it even more. If i didnt have to do a project on it, i would not have finished reading the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"We are reading this book together as a family. My husband reads aloud, the kids listen, and I struggle not to leave the room. My 9-yr old daughter has repeatedly asked: \\"why are all the rabbits boys? Are there going to be any girls soon?\\" Yeah... This is a fantasy, so one imagines the author had a fair amount of room to add talking rabbit females to the plot -- if he wanted to. But for most of the book the female rabbits are relegated to anonymous \\"doe\\" status, as in \\"the does are raising the young and if they get nervous, they might not give birth to as many young.\\" The male characters are developed in much detail. At this point in the book, the protagonist rabbits are getting ready to wage war with a rival tribe, which includes \\"taking their does.\\" In other word, \\"to rape and pillage.\\" Wonderful! In general, I see very little merit to this book. It is rather protactracted and dull, as other readers have noted, and I don't like the message it is sending to my kids, girl or boys. We will finish the book, as a matter or principle, but I can't wait. In my opinion, a piece of \\"hraka.\\""},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book turned out to be in a deplorable state than what it was advertised by the seller.

That's one word you'll say after reading this awesome book.It starts out pretty boringly, and you'll get tired of it soon. If you then drop the book and read something else, I feel sorry for you.

It was aired on HBO at that time and I remember being enthralled with the animation and fell in love with the characters. But at that time I did not really understand the complexities of the struggle that the story revolves around. When I was 16 years old I read the book for a high school english class, that was when I fully grasped the story. It is with out a doubt one of my very favorite novels. The characters are developed so well that you forget you are talking about rabbits. You feel like transported into another world completely. I would consider this required reading for all high school age children."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is without equal, and I pity anyone who can not appreciate it as a masterpiece. It is a story about comraderie and relying on each others' special abilities. Where else would you find the skills of 'story-teller and runner' (Dandelion), 'statesman' (Strawberry), and warrior (Bigwig) given equal billing within a group of individuals. I am a personal friend of Richard Adams and have hiked the storyline from Watership Down four times from start to finish. Yes, that's right -- in case you didn't know, Watership Down is a real place, and all the locations listed on the map in the front of the book are still in place, probably much as they looked in 1972. Another interesting fact, the characters are loosely modelled after officers with whom Mr Adams served during World War II. Hazel and Bigwig, in pacticular, are modelled after two specific individuals. So, how can this be a story about just rabbits? As I have stated above, this story is about a group of individuals who depend and rely on each other. As Richard Adams says, in one of his most eloquent passages, &quot;They had come closer together, relying on and valueing each other's capacities. They knew now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives depended, and they were not going to waste anything they possessed between them.&quot; Sounds like what you'd expect from a group of soldiers in a life-and-death situation, doesn't it? Oh, pity the poor fools who can not comprehend the meaning of this book. &quot;A rabbit who does not know when a gift has made him safe is poorer than a slug, eventhough he may think otherwise himself.&quot;"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"it was a fun book, nothing i would really ever admit reading to my budies, but nevertheless fun. there are deeper meanings and i didnt have to look to hard to find them. over all the style of writing was excellent, and the characters were believable even for talking rabbits. rent the animated movie, it is almost trippy."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"That pretty much summerizes the entire book, though no simple statements can do this work justice. I mean, who else could take a concept so fundamentally silly as rabbits and actually make it valid literature?Besides that, it's also a damn good story too, enough for all ages, and all ages should read this novel. It emphasizes freedom and the decisions to do what you want to do without anyone else ordering you around. And Adams manages to do that without becoming preachy or condescending.It must have took a lot of effort for Adams not to make this into a term paper on rabbits, but he pulled it off and the effort shows. This is one of the few books that deserved the word classic when it was printed and still deserves it twenty years later, and will probably still apply twenty years hence. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the only book I read for three years. I enjoyed it so much, I had to read it over and over again.

Ever. Not this year, not this decade, but E-V-E-R. In my whole life. Tears came more than once, and when the story ended, I had trouble starting a new book for a solid week because I just could not find anything that held my attention or even peaked my interest. Its like eating a meal prepared by a five star chef and then trying to eat McDonalds, nothing will ever taste the same again because I will always remember the way that this... I can only say masterpiece* made me feel.Also, I got this book in Kindle edition, and I must say that wherever a Lapine (rabbit-ese) word or statement needs to be explained further, there is a very tidy link in-line with the text, which you can follow, and then follow another link in the explanation that will take you directly back to where you were before. Bravo to the e-scriptionists!*(because I have reached the bounds of my grasp of the English language, which IS my first language, and cannot think of anything that actually describes it well enough...)PARENTS, PLEASE READ:I picked up this book because a friend of mine told me I need to watch the movie, and I do not like to watch a movie based on a book without reading the book first. I was always under the impression that it was a children's novel and that I would finish the book in a couple of days and probably snicker at a cheesy, over-softened story about rabbits hopping through fields of flowers. I was shocked at the length of the book when I opened on my Kindle, and by the end of the first chapter, I knew that I will not let my children read this book until they are well mature enough to grasp the meaning of the words without being left with nightmares.If you are a parent who is thinking of reading this novel to your child(ren) then please pay attention here:End of chapter one, VERBATIM QUOTE -\\"Back to the burrow?\\" whimpered Fiver. \\"It'll come there - don't think it won't! I tell you, the field's full of blood!\\"The entirety of the book follows a similar theme, from rabbits being strangled to death or near by men's traps, to rabbits clawing and ripping each-other's ears off, this is a mature novel. Suitable for middle- and high-school students."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read \\"Watership Down\\" in 5th grade about 6 months ago for school and it was by far one of the best books I have ever read. One of the reasons I liked the book is because it is fictional but has a non-fictional feeling. It is a great book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a tale about a group of rabbits that leave their home which in the story is called a warren. After they leave they end up having many close encounters and they also meet lots of new rabbits. Some nice and some mean. The rabbits also face various challenges that a rabbit would not normally do. They also meet some old friends and stop at a couple other new warrens. Sometimes the rabbits talk in their own language, which is called Lapine. The book has translations for all of it though. There is lots and lots of detail in the book. Sometimes that is good, but sometimes not so much, because sometimes it can get a little bit overwhelming. Overall \\"Watership Down\\" is a great book. I highly recommend it if you want a fictional book with a non-fictional feel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Well, being a jaded hedge fund manager this book was an awesome diversion. I read constantly and this is most probably my all time favorite book. Suspenseful, warm, sad, allegorical. I just loved it, recommended it to everyone I know, and will hopefully read this several times between now and when I meet my black rabbit."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my favorite book. I know that it's about rabbits, but really it's so much more. This book is about civilization and community and survival. It's about friendship and freedom and mythological stories.I first read this book as part of my High School Freshman English summer reading requirement (Thank you Mrs. Gollander). I dreaded it then because all I could understand was that rabbits were talking and running around. Later in my life I read it again. And then again.Watership Down is the greatest book written in the English language. There are some basic reasons for this:(1) Adams uses rabbits to express his themes of leadership, loyalty and friendship, and society. In other novels, or in real-life, we see ourselves as having much control over our environment, when in fact we have very little. By making rabbits the centerpiece, it's easier to see the large external factors. These factors are very difficult to see when we are engaging in our everyday lives.The rabbits are also quite innocent. The picture we get when reading the novel is that, despite the fact that there are good and bad rabbits alike, all rabbits are ultimately innocently pursuing what they think is right. Even General Woundwort is pursuing a conservative, fascist agenda in an attempt to preserve his society (and his power). This is true to life. George Bush wasn't trying to kill thousands of Iraqi babies, but it happened. We can't lay the additional blame of intentional murder, no matter how bad the accidental results were.(2) The society is a combination of 3 important aspects: religion or spirituality, dreaming for a better life, and surviving forces beyond our control. Aren't these the very same that we face in our lives? By exploring these themes, Adams is giving us insight to how important they really are.(3) The eclectic. The vast rabbit knowledge and interwoven rabbit lore, vocabulary, and actions indicate a parallel society that has its own unique aspects. It removes the rabbits from the human world enough to pursue a comparison between human society and these rabbits without stating the obvious. Had the author used rabbits without the unique aspects of their society, it would have been rather like a weak treatise on society written by a college student for their senior thesis.(4) Readability. This book was assigned to me as summer reading during my transition to high school. I didn't fully \\"get it\\" then, but I certainly understood what I was reading. Better readers than me would certainly grasp the full meaning of the novel at around the same time in their lives (7th or 8th grade), though coming-of-age novels are probably more applicable at that time. This is probably a book for college students and beyond; the novel is thoroughly accessible to people who are interested in the 3 important themes listed in number 1 above.(5) Lack of Dogma. There is no centralized dogma about society, other than the obvious notion that fascism is probably a bad thing. The author doesn't argue that one specific style of government is best for people, but that people who work together for a common good can lead society in the right direction. Of course, it's up to you to decide what kind of government best espouses this notion.This book challenges us to face the things that threaten our way of life. It tells us that if we act justly and honestly, things will turn out for the best."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the first book I read by Richard Adams and I loved it. What a wonderful allegory of the human condition in the story of a bunch of rabbits looking to find a safe home. The part about the beautiful park-like setting where the rabbits who lived there never mentioned a rabbit that disappeared and was no longer among them (because he had been harvested by the cook)was stunning. They didn't mention the missing rabbits, indeed denied they ever even existed, because they didn't want to admit they were fed well and taken care of for eating purposes and not just living in a paradise. You can't believe how you can get caught up in a story about rabbits. But you do. And you don't want it to end. Unfortunately I was so delighted with this book that I got others by Adams. But his Maia and Shardik were just disappointing. Sometimes an author just has one great book in him. Like Harper's To Kill a Mockingbird and Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I always carry a copy of this book with me and if anyone asks about it I will hand it over to them. It is one of THE BEST books of all time and deserves to be shared whenever possible.To those of you who say it's only a book about rabbits, you obviously haven't read it. To quote my brother, who refused to read it for years and then finally did to get me to leave him alone, \\"You think it's a book about rabbits but it's really a book about humanity.\\"Hazel is an all-time great \\"everyman-anyman\\" hero. Introduce someone to him today."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was so deep and descriptive, that many people told me a kid my age wouldn't be able to understand it. But Watership Down was a book that was just my taste, creative, animal-associated, and filled with the characters that make fairy tales seem boring. I couldn't have loved it more.Watership Down is about a group of rabbits who live together in their warren. Fiver is the runt. He is thought of by most as a useless, pitiful little blighter, attention-seeking and weak. The only rabbit who sees Fiver as otherwise is his brother, Hazel. When Fiver receives an ominous feeling that things in the warren will soon go worse than astray, Hazel is the only one who believes him.Throughout the story, Hazel, Fiver, and several well-chosen companions travel away from the only place they've ever known in pursuit of a home where men will not trouble them and they'll be free to live in peace.Easier said than done."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read \\"Watership Down\\" back in the 1970s on the recommendation of my grandmother, who cited it as her favorite book. Indeed, as others have said, the story captures you very quickly. Yes, the characters are rabbits, but it is not a children's story per se. The characters are so well drawn they grip you immediately and you care very much about them. To me, it is more an allegory relating to evnironmental destruction and loss of natural habitat. Scenes from this book still linger in my imagination many years after reading it (albeit only once). Weird, but I often still think about it when driving along looking at the landscape and trying to imagine the actual length of land the rabbits traversed and the trials they encountered on their way to find a new place for their home.This book is full of adventure, integrity and love. It captures the imagination and doesn't let go."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was reading this wonderful book again and a friend saw it and asked what it was about. I didn't answer immediately because that is a difficult question to answer. Finally I said it was about friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice. Then...\\"Why is there a rabbit on the cover?\\" I went on to explain it is about rabbits but that is secondary to the power of the story.I visit this book every five or six years and I just completed my fifth reading so we go back aways, like an old friend from junior high. It is my most beloved book from childhood but it is not a children's book. There is violence and dark imagery so it is more along the lines of the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"The Hobbit\\" in its grand adventure.The narrative is fully engrossing as we meet our new friends and take the journey with them. We learn their language and customs and beliefs and it doesn't take very long before we forget these are rabbits that talk because there is no time for that. There are dangers at every turn and it is in how they face these dangers that is where the true heart of the book lies.Sure, their adventures are fantastic yet realistic but it is the little moments between characters that has endeared them to me. Another Amazon reviewer summarized it best...\\"it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody.\\" When I first read the book twenty something years ago I wanted to be a little more like Hazel and Bigwig. Now, twenty something years later, I still do."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book, overall, was nothing short of AMAZING!!! It was really good quality writing, though sometimes the descriptions got lengthy, and the beginning was a little bit hard to get through. But as the drama unfolded, it was full of action, from Cowslip's warren to getting the does and escaping from the General.I loved the ending of the book and couldn't be more satisfied. I usually am left with a feeling of discontent at the endings of books, usually because the ending was inconclusive or ridiculous and didn't serve to wrap up the book. Anyone who is not sure about reading it, just read the whole book so that you can get satisfaction from the conclusion.The storyline was really captivating to me and hopefully to others. If you don't have patience, though, or are not a fan of fiction, then maybe you should steer clear of this book. It is very long, and even though it is exciting, it takes a while to finish. It also personifies rabbits, which to some may sound ridiculous, but its done by Richard Adams in such an interesting and thorough way that you can totally imagine all of it happening.If you're not sure whether its the right type of book for you, I would suggest at least forcing yourself to read Part One. The action unfolds from there.Even though some descriptions of the rabbits' surroundings were pretty long, they were of good quality and served to help you visualize the setting even more.I LOVE WATERSHIP DOWN!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a great book all about rabbits. It is definitely one of my favorite books. It has lots of great action and a fast moving plot. It also has some great characters, with good character description. The cover has a peaceful image of a rabbit on it but this book is warlike. There is fighting and death and gore. However, there is also an engaging storyline about the rabbits' adventures.When Fiver, who has prophesizing powers, warns that the rabbit's home of Sandleford Warren will soon be destroyed, few believe him. So a small band of rabbits who believe Fiver leave the warren, hunting for a new home. They meet many groups of rabbits, all with different customs and peculiarities. This is an exciting story about some rabbits on a quest for survival. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Alright, so now that I have gotten your attention--I know, I just rated this book one star, but you see, I noticed as I was reading reviews that my eyes skipped over all the millions of five star reviews, and went straight to the one stars. I hope I'm not being confusing, but what I am TRYING to say is that I actually love this book, and I just used the whole \\"one star thing\\" to grab the readers' attentions.I have a lot of friends who have blatantly stated that \\"this book it terrible.\\" I hate to have to say this about smart people, but my opinion is that if you don't understand the meaning of this book, you might as well read only for entertainment because you will never be able to understand great literature. Want proof? Just look at the other entire one star reviews. None of them are eloquent. None of them give a good reason as to why it wasn't good (other then the fact that they personally didn't understand it).What IS so great about this book, anyway? I can answer that! First of all, the emotions of the characters are so vivid that you could cry over them. When one of them, Fiver, is seized with fear, you really do care, you really do understand. Each character has so much depth that everything they do is such a \\"them\\" thing to do. I find myself smiling as if watching an old friend when Hazel does this, or Bigwig does that.Another great thing is the fact that they are so definitely rabbits. They don't understand everything that humans understand. They function differently, they fear different things, and Richard Adams so flawlessly portrays this that the reader is almost oblivious at times. You just accept it all and sometimes sit back and marvel at... well... just everything!I could talk and talk all day about this book, but then no one would read my review, so I will stop now. I really hope you have been either: a) convinced to read this book or b) made to feel very guilty for not liking it. All right that is all I have to say. Good day."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Okay, but deals too much with environmental stuff. Also, I disliked the character Fiver"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Hello again, dear reader. Once again it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, Professor Emeritus of American Literature. What better book to study than a British book about rabbits (or &quot;Bun-Buns&quot;). Now, many of you foolish young scamps may be thinking &quot;Ho, that book can't be very interesting! Rabbits can't talk!&quot;. That just goes to show that I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, am much more cunning and intelligent than you, a foolish stooge. These bun-buns are magical and can communicate almost as well as I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone! This, dear reader, is known to literary fellows like I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, as &quot;Retention of Belief&quot;. Yes Yes. I first read this (excuse the witticism) novel novel (I'm sorry if you did not understand, dear reader, but than, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, am Professor Emeritus of American Literature, while you are a foolish heathen bumpkin) when I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, was a youthful rogue of 50. My biddy had just punted me, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, from our formally cordial nuptial-bed (She had some notion about 'rights of the female' or some such nonsensical drivel--never fear dear reader, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, quickly put that to rest!) and I trudged down to the extra nest of quilts in the parlor. Unfortunately, the Lord our Maker did not see fit to give even I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, peace! Tossing and turning, my keen, intelligent eyes fell upon a book with some form of mammalian creature on the cover. Having just finished the wonderful collegiate-edition book, &quot;The Rats of NIMH&quot;, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, was in a bit of mood for tales of woodland folk. But I digress.So, a short synopsis of this story. I would recommed this manuscript for rambunctious misshaps between three and six years of age.Watership Down: A Tale of Bun-BunsA Novel Not Written by Professor Emeritus Johnstone because He Chooses To Pursue Other, Much More Important Things That A Foolish Novelist Could Never Comprehend.1. A group of Bun-Buns leave the &quot;Warren (Funny that, as I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, always thought Warren was a person!) because of a pigglety young squirt-of-a-rabbit who is undoubtedly in need of a good old-fashioned labotomy2. A bun-bun named Hazel (a pseudonym for his real name, which is Walnut) takes charge, much like I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone would have done. Unfortunately this Bun-Bun seems to be a cad and bounder!3. All the Bun-Buns die, for they are stooge-bun-buns and are no match for the might of humans.And there you have it. I personally feel the title is rather nugatory (much like the writer in comparison to a Professor of American Literature). I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, would have titled it more appropriately as &quot;Bun-Buns: Fact or Fiction?&quot; but alas, some foolish mortals like Mr. Adams will not listen to his betters.Hark, I hear daylight approaching merrily down the lane! It is time for prayers and flaggelation! So until next time, dear readers, I wish you a luke-warm farewell.--Yours, Etc.Professor Emeritus Percy Q.

Fairytale rabbits are for little children, not true readers. If you are a parent or babysitter that is searching for a wonderful child's story, then Watership Down is definitely the book you should be looking for. Children will love the talking rabbits and all the other animals. Although, young children may not be able to understand some of the ideas presented in this book. For example, the rabbits leave their warren in the beginning because of cruel humans. But how could humans be so cruel? The happy ending is always appreciated and should put your little children to bed easily after the scary, horrifying images presented through General Woundwort. Again, this really is a children's story, so please don't try finding a way to enjoy it as an adult."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My Middle-school is making me read this book over the summer, and since it is for school, it makes the book less interesting. Maybe if schools would suggest the book rather than forcing it, kids would find it interesting and a classic book. But rather, the schools are forcing children to read a book that at often times is confusing to some children under the 6th grade level of reading. The book has an interesting story line with many plottwists, but it seems to draw on about the same subject for too long and I often found myself fidgety while reading it. I recommend for enjoyment over a few months, but not have to rush and read it within 3."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Having heard many opinions that this is a \\"great story,\\" a \\"classic epic,\\" and a \\"thrilling adventure,\\" I had to read it for myself--and boy, was I let down. Here's why.1. The book is contrived--not a seamless integration of parts and whole, but a series of raw, abortive events hammered into the mould of an epic.2. The book is predictable. If you were an alien from another planet, who had never read a human-authored story before, you might approve. But, being someone who has actually lived on the planet for a little while, I can confidently say that there is almost no originality here.3. The rabbit gimmick falls flat. The idea of substituting rabbits for humans seems to have exhausted the author, and he seems to think his gimmick of dressing up a bad story in rabbit fur is enough originality for one book. It's not.4. I don't care about the characters. The rabbits' characters are never developed enough to make me want to care. They're two-dimensional, simple, predictable, cookie-cutter, and, like a coloring book, the author always stays within the lines (yaaaaawn).5. This book is too long. Cheers to the author's work-ethic for dragging this out to fit the \\"epic\\" genre. Jeers to the author's aesthetic sense for not recognizing that his rabbit tale is not strong enough to be an epic.On the plus side: having read the book, everytime I see a rabbit, I get an uncanny sense that I've visited their world. Adams does have a way of emulating the tiny minds of rabbits. But then, why would you want to cram your human intelligence into the mind of a rabbit, anyway? It's like trying to force yourself inside a mailbox--it may be exciting at first, but then it just gets silly and painful."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book when I was in 10th grade and I enjoyed it then. I am now 35, my three children are in school all day and I am ordering the book to read again. I have been waiting until now to re-read it because I wanted to have quiet time to relish the story. It is a wonderful lesson in life. Yes, they are rabbits, but they are rabbits that every one can relate to.I am hoping my 10th grader will pick it up and read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the novel I have recommended to friends and students for years. I've read it several times to my fifth grade classes and even shown the video for comparing and contrasting activities. My students this year seem to lack listening skills, so I am playing the four hour audio dramatization in bits. This has the extra bonus of introducing kids to radio, as this version was originally broadcast on PBS radio. But of course, it's the book that I keep coming back to. What a wonderful allegory of human societies. If only homo sapiens were as honorable as Hazel and his warren."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Hazel and Fiver - brothers - try to convince the Chief Rabbit to evacuate the waren when Fiver forsees danger befalling it. When he refuses, Hazel and Fiver round up as many rabbits as will go, and set out in search of a new home. Read on to find out about Cowslip's treacherous warren, how they befriended a black-headed gull named Kehaar,the raid on Nuthanger Farm, the assault on Efrafa- a warren led by the fiendish General Woundwort- and stories about the rabbit prophet/hero, El-ahrairah. You have to read this book; it's really intense!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I really liked Watership Down mostly because it was descriptive, exciting and interesting and I never wanted to stop reading. I also liked how the rabbits faced so much danger and always acted on instinct. It was really amazing the differences between all the rabbits, especially Fiver and Hazel (2 brothers). I liked how mean and determined General Woundwort was and how bent he was at getting back at Hazel and Fiver. The author shows great contrast between rabbits and humans culturally, in the book. The rabbits think roads and guns are almost supernatural, while they're part of everyday human-life. When I first saw the book I wasn't sure it was possible to write 497 pages on rabbits, when I finished I knew why. I recommend the book to anyone who likes animals, or a great book and has a lot of time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This amazing masterpiece by Adams will captivate readers of all ages. Children will love its characters and adventures, which I feel rival those of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit'. As a baby boomer, I was struck by the definition of leadership as embodied by Hazel, courage as embodied by BigWig, and conviction as embodied by Fiver. A must read for those who can read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This story isn't just about some bunnies going on a journey to a better home. It is a touching story about some rabbits to go out to find a new home without knowing the tradegy and horror to surpass them throughout the journey. With characters like Fiver, Blackberry, Hazel, &amp; Bigwig altogether with the writing, the pictures, the descriptive language used in this book all make it a true masterpeice of the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read! My teacher suggested it to me in sixth grade, but I didn't pick it up until this year, eighth grade, for a book report. As soon as I started, I couldn't put it down! It was wonderfully written! I fell in love with every character and each one's bravery. I'm sorry I didn't read it sooner!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I don't understand how some of you people can say this book is boring. It may be at the beggining but most books are. And about childish characters, how manly are the pigs and sheep in Orsen Wells's ANIMAL FARM. This is one of those books that makes you think. They aren't talking bunnies, they're animals that speak in their own language among themselves. They also have distinctly human traits: compassion, honor, loyalty. These animals work together to make life better for themselves. If you want a book that will make you think, laugh, and cry this is the one. I read it twice in a months time and I am still not bored with it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love this book because it is really exciting! It is so great I want to read it again and again and again. I thought Bigwig was really funny. I loved Hazel. He is funny and smart and clever. Who would have thought to chase the Efrafans off with a dog? I like Fiver. He is weird."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One of my favorite books and one I have returned to again and again...I can't count the number of times I have re-read Watership Down, but it seems from some of these other reviews I'm not alone. Aside from the fact that it's just a thumping (no pun intended) good read, it's also a marvelously subtle and provocative exploration of what makes for the perfect leader. While you're busy enjoying the adventure (and believe me, it's a heart-pounder), it may also occur to you to ask why is Hazel the best leader for this group of rabbits, a position soon acknowledged by all who follow him? After all, he's not the strongest (that's Bigwig who has the most physical courage among them all), nor the cleverest (that's Blackberry, the one who comes up with all their &quot;tricks&quot;), nor the most visionary (Fiver is the &quot;prophet&quot; who sounds the warning time and again), nor does he have the history of being in charge like Holly the former Owsla captain does. What does Hazel have that the others don't? I don't mean to say that Hazel isn't courageous, or clever, or visionary, or purposeful in his own way, but he also has what I'll just call a certain mental poise which allows him to harness all those traits in himself, as well as(and this may be more important) tap them when they appear in others at crucial moments. Or maybe this is just a way of saying he has an uncanny ability to inspire trust and loyalty in others, enough so that they will put their lives in his hands. This all may seem a bit much to read into what appears to be a simple child's tale, but part of the immense charm of this book is its expansive ability to allow and even encourage speculation of this sort. It's a warm-hearted but unsentimentalizing story, enthralling and generous as the best stories are. I envy anyone who has yet to stumble onto this treasure."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book when I was around 11 years old during the summer reading program at the library. I re-read this book almost 20 years later and was as engrossed in it as I was the first time. 20-odd years ago it was a fascinating story of what-if's, today it still is.Politics are politics, no matter if you are man or mouse.... or rabbit. The battle scenes in this story are amazing. You can almost feel each scratch and bite. I recommended this book when I was 11 years old and I would recommend it again today to everyone of any age."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my first review and I only have a short time me being in school and all. I thought that the author was able to really capture the hardships and life of a rabbit, even though this was quite fictional. I actually believed that I was there watching the rabbits. It had a good plot and story line and never let me down once. My name is Astal and the next chance I get i will have a better and longer review. Look for me on other books and I wil be around. Again this has been my favorite book of all time and will remain till I can find a better one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book Watership Down is a book about rabbits.Now I now you are thinking great a book about muddyburrowers. But it really is'nt, if you have read thebook Fire Bringher then you'll find that it hascopied Watership Down. Watereship Down is mostlyabout a quite scrawny rabbit called fiver. He, just in Fire Bringher, Has seeing powers. He sees that builders are going todevelop the rabbit warren, so he and his brother, anda few assorted rabbits willing to leave the warren.They pass thruogh many adventures in this great book.If you like adventerous books about spiecies that canhardly protect themesevles (such as hobbits in the Lordof the rings.) This is a great book for you!!!!!!:)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I picked up this book from the \\"give away\\" pile at home to read on a horrendously long plane ride and I found it so engrossing that I couldn't put it down. It is incredible how the story makes the characters human enough to create sympathy and interest in the reader and yet they remain true to their species, so they do not seem \\"humanized\\". The characters are dynamic, learning from each other and from their circumstances, gaining maturity and wisdom. There is a good balance between developing the plot and description (necessary for the reader to understand the dynamics of rabbit communities and to appreciate how rabbits view the world). I found the rabbit mythology, their own form of religion which reminded me of the greek myths, fascinating. These \\"myths\\" were very naturally woven into the plot, stories that rabbits told each other to amuse, inspire, distract.I suppose the most unbelievable part of the book, is the fact that despite facing the most dire circumstances, none of the main characters die (only peripheral ones do). I was also disappointed that there were few, if any, memorable female characters (though the lack of females in the community drives the plot in the latter part of the book, so I suppose females are not entirely marginalized, but they are objectified).One might think a book about rabbits as just \\"fluff\\" (no pun intended), but this story explores so many important themes: vision, loyalty, courage, faith, being true to oneself, acceptence of others/cooperation, etc. I think the animal element would appeal to children, yet the content of the book would be equally interesting for an adult."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Quite possibly one of the most entertaining and insightful books I have ever read, concerning the various aspects of the world and the panorama of life that moves within it. This is a delightful and cherished tale that touches on different points of human society and civilization, and carries with it a depth that only a literary masterpiece can achieve."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm just chiming in to back up some of the younger reviewers below. This is an excellent book, definitely one of my top ten. I was 46 when I first read the book, and it spoke eloquently to me. I think I'm going to start rereading it tonight..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When a friend toled me to read this book, I didnt think much of its discription, but once I began to read, I fell in love with thies charictors! Its about a band of rabbits trying to find a safe home. They go through all sorts of problems as small as crossing a rode to as big as escaping an army of angry rabbits. This is a geat book in witch you can see the world through a bunnys eyes. Do not turn this book down because there are talking animals. after a wile you wont even know they're rabbits!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I chose this book because it was on a list of classics and near-classics. When I first saw it, I was dismayed--it looked so long! But this tale was so riveting that I finished it within a few days--even staying up into the early morning to keep reading it. Please don't be turned off by the fact that the book is about rabbits! (I almost was.) You will discover much about yourself and about human nature through reading this amazing book. It's well worth the time you will spend reading it. I went right out and got the sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down.&quot;"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I highly recommend this novel. It is very interesting!! A must have. The anthropomophized rabbits show basic human characteristics that are required for their survival. They overcome many problems that they meet throughtout their journey."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"i loved this book. i stayed up untill four reading it. i loved how adams created a world for the rabbits and a whole language/fairy tales for them. I was sad to see the book end because it was so great."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first experienced the amazing lapine world in Watership Down at the age of 7 when my mother read it aloud to me. I was absolutely entranced by the different characters, the epic feel of the journey (which would seem as mere miles and months to humans), and the deeply entrenched mythos that tells the rabbits their place in the world.If you enjoy the deep world and characters of Tolkien, you will find this book to be endearing and riveting. This novel is not just for children or for high school English; it is for everyone and is an experience to share with the ones you love."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There is very little I can offer to the many heartfelt reviews of this classic, moving book. One thing I can suggest is that if you have children, encourage them to read it by their early teens. While they may not know it at the time, the experience of this novel will be a watermark in their adolescence that will stay with them through life. This book is magic, and subtle enough in its power to reach into our lives many years past the reading."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership down was an exelent book. This was the best book I have ever read. It has very suspensfull momments and great batteles. There was great adventure and pretty cool moments. If you like books where animales fight this is the book for you.This book is so good you will wish it never ended.this book is better than most redwall books by far it is more realistic and it is just better. When I read the readwall book I thought I had found my favorite books but after I read watership down. I did not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I let my nine year old daughter read this book against all of my friends' advice.I believe this story represents life without the color lens glasses that we often want our children to wear. My daughter came to know the harsh realities of life very early in her life when she lost her father four years ago. She understands that death is part of life. She knows that you need to persevere and follow your dreams never give up even when you stumble you must get up and continue. Watership Down has enforced her believes. I am very happy good material as this exists. Thank you very much, Richard Adams. A proud mom."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was a bit hesitant to reading Watership Down at first. I was afraid it would be a boring story about talking rabbits that lived out their lives in a warren (and 475 pages of it!). I was completely mistaken. Although, it was about rabbits, in no way were their lives unexciting. The story, in fact, was not boring at all. Richard Adams does an amazing job with this book. He takes an idea that is not particularly enthralling and creates an epic adventure story. The farther I got into the story. The more I wanted to read. It just kept getting better and better. I had to constantly remind myself that the characters were rabbits because they were flawlessly given human traits. Before reading this story, I could not understand why it was so praised. Now I see, however, that this book is truly a masterpiece. I recommend this classic to anyone who likes adventure stories."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for years and steered clear of it because it was a 'book about rabbits'. I just finished reading it with my 12 year old son and we both adored it. It is realistic, suspenseful and at times funny. I know both of us will read it over and over. I just ordered the DVD as well."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You will be absolutely awestruck by the world of rabbits portrayed in Watership Down! This has got to be the best novel about rabbits ever, and if there is any book that can remotely rival it, I will be surprised.Hazel's brother, Fiver, was born with some sixth sense that can tell him whether or not there is danger. When Fiver senses that there is going to be danger, Hazel immediatly starts trying to get rabbits to join them. They set out on their wonderful adventure early on in the book, which allows plenty of room for action. My favorite part is towards the end where the does form Efrafa and the rabbits from Watership Down are in hot pursuit by General Woundwort.This is an awesome book, with the animals not in silly roles where it feels like the author isn't repecting the animals enough. Hazel and the rest are great and you shouldn't miss this book for the world!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This novel is without a doubt the best ever written. It is a book that will make you think about life and death. When I found out about it I thought that it might be a little silly. But after I began to read it I realized how wrong I had been about thinking it was going to be silly. It was anything but silly. Watership Down makes you see what it is like from an animals point of view. I thought this story was sad but very good. If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would. Do not hesitate to buy this book. Buy it because you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It was Sunday night, I needed to pick an Outside Reading Book for English class the next morning. On my shelf I spotted Watership Down, a book I never was interested in reading. Nonetheless, I chose it out of neccesity, and computed that to get through the tedium I expected it to be, I would have to read 3 chapters a night. I sat down and began to read...but there was no chance I was going to stop reading after 3 chapters. It ensnared me with its depictions of a world we miss, depictions that author Richard Adams illustrates in vibrant detail. I ended up finishing &quot;the bunny book&quot;, as my friends dubbed it, in less than 3 days.All one needs to know about the plot is that one of the characters, Fiver, has a premonition: death and destruction is coming to the warren in which they live, and they must flee or die. Fiver's brother Hazel beleives him, and attempts to convince as many rabbits as they can to leave the warren and save their lives. The vagabonds set out, at the mercy of the overwhelming number of enemies rabbits have, not to mention the cruelty of their own kind.....they set out to find a home, and what a glorious adventure it is.This book is wonderful on so many levels. It vividly creates characters until the reader feels that he or she can not only understand them, but relate to them and their problems. It not only creates a language for these characters, these rabbits, seemlessly integrated through expository footnotes and a dictionary in the back, but an entire culture as well. The reader learns of the complex rabbit hierarchy, from the despot Chief Rabbits who have their food brought underground to them to the outskirters, &quot;all too accustomed to getting the short end of the stick.&quot; We learn of the rabbit's God and Underworld, their folk heroes and their legends. The book is also a political allegory: when one analyses the different warrens, paralells can be seen with Fascism, communism, and other political systems. Adams also puts an applicable quote before each chapter, alluding to past works such as Julius Caesar and Greek Mythology. The quotes are always pertinent and ascertaining how they pertain to the chapter is enjoyable. But on top of all that, this book is an adventure story of the highest order, a truely enthralling piece of literature that is truly the only book that I can say, &quot;I laughed, I cheered, I cried&quot; about. Im not much of a crying man, but Adams' characters are so well drawn it is impossible not to become attached to them.Please, all of you, do yourself a favor and read Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read Watership Down the first time within about 6 months of its release over (sigh) a quarter of a century ago. I re-read it for the several dozenth-time over the Christmas holidays just because I hadn't read it cover to cover for several years.Watership Down is a spectacular story of heroism and fear, of an overwhelming need to find a home, of glory and battle and of just plain old bunnies. In the end it doesn't matter which level of the book you read - whether deep in the layers of metaphors or shallow in sheer fun of being a rabbit sprinting in the morning dew - Watership Down works. We're all a little bit of Hazel-rah's intellect, and a little bit of Bigwig's courage and a little bit of Fiver's insight and a little bit of everyone who's ever set out on our own to find a new home.Read it, enjoy it, love it, remember it, use it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is the story of a small band of rabbits traveling to find the perfect place to settle down and build a warren. A great danger had been predicted to come to their old warren by a young rabbit named Fiver. On their search for a new home, the rabbits encounter elil (other creatures that eat rabbits) and other warrens with horrible secrets. But when they finialy reach the perfect home, they realize that they have no does, and without does, the warren fails. So they decided to steal some does from a warren who had to many already. But that warrens cheif rabbit does not want to share.This story starts out in Sandleford Warren and progresses through Frith Copse, past Nuthanger farm, and ends in Watership Down. In many ways, the story seems real except for the fact that there are talking rabbits, and the Lapine (rabbit languge) is unique and fun to learn.There are about 3 main charicters, Hazel, the leader of the group, Fiver, a small rabbit who predicted the fall of Sandleford Warren, and Bigwig, a tough rabbit who helped a lot in the ultimate plan to get does.This book is wonderful and thrilling. It leads you through a world of danger where your only pretection is your own cleverness. It gives you a swirl of emotion, sometimes sad, sometimes exciting, sometimes extremley happy. You never know what will happen next. The charictors, plot and description all add up to a perfect book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Reading this book was the best experience i have ever had. It opened my eyes and broadend my horizons. It's basicly about a group of rabbits who leave their warren and try to find a new home. It makes you think like a rabbit and feel their feelings. I am reading the book again and I am still learning and discovering new things about Hazel (The main character) and his compainions. A must read for anyone who can read English. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first the only reason I chose Watership Down was because I needed a good long book and I had started reading in about the 7th grade and never finished it because I couldn't really get into it. I actually enjoyed this novel. I read about 50-75 pages in 7th grade and started reading it a couple of days ago and couldn't put it down. It didn't appeal to me at first because the fact that bunnies were talking and doing human things sort of bored me. I don't know if I liked that at the beginning humans were the enemy. The whole concept of it was very strange like rabbits talking in their own little language. It was very out of the ordinary because most books you read are concerning other human characters that you can relate to but you don't realize that you can relate to these rabbits. They had hardships just like you and I . When I was reading this it seemed like this novel wasn't just about cute little bunnies but it had a deeper topic. The outside of the novel was simply about bunnies but I think the whole theme was about survival and the dangers that wild animals have to deal with. The novel starts out with two characters Fiver who can see into the future and Hazel who is one of Fivers friends . One day Fiver has a feeling that something bad is going to happen to his home, Sandleford Warren. When Fiver and Hazel decide to tell their leader, he doesn't believe them. The two rabbits decide they must take matters into their own hands and leave and a few other rabbits go with them, Bigwig, Dandelion, Pipkin, Hawkbit, Blackberry, Buckthorn, Speedwell, Acorn, and Silver. They begin a long journey in search to find a new home. While on there journey that somwthing in fact did happen to their home. It was completely demolished to make way for a building development. Along their journey they encounter many animals such as cats, dogs,birds, other rabbits and even humans. Overall I really did enjoy this novel. I didn't think I would like it because I thought the plot was stupid but in fact it is not and we could all relate easily to this novel. I would suggest everyone read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember this as a favorite when I was young! I bought the book for my daughter, a bit apprehensive at first, thinking she may be intimidated by its size or the way it was written. She can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I like this book very much because it was filled with action, drama &amp; comedy. For example, it has 12 rabbits that have to travel on a dangerous journey to escape danger and start a new warren (home).The characters are a mix: strong, smart, weak...One knew how to lead and by working together they all got to a place on top of the hill where they were safe and no one got hurt.Renee L. age 11"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a charming story for anyone 12 and older. Adams does a superlative job developing the character of each rabbit and telling a believable and engrosing tale of how they endured hardship in their quest for a new home. This book belongs in the Hall of Fame - along with the Tolkien Trilogy and the C.S. Lewis Narnia series. If you loved those, you'll love this one. The movie was very bad - but the book is very, very good."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This action-packed book is full of adventures and excitement. Every moment of this wonderful book is exciting. It is like it has a grip on the mind to urge you to continue reading. I have read this book twice and I wouldn't mind reading it over and over again. Everytime, something new and extraordinary happens. I feel like I am on an adventure with the rabbits. I recommend that everyone should read this MARVELOUS book and other books by this author. Tales from Watership Down is another exciting book about stories that is told from the rabbits of Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recently read this book as a summer reading assignment for school, and I was struck by the author's understanding of the nature of the characters (rabbits) of this book. This book was by all means worth reading, even though I would not have rated in on my &quot;Top Ten Books&quot; list. If you enjoy nature, wildlife, adventure, or just a good story, I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"As I looked over our home library I asked my husband &quot;What shall I read now?&quot; &quot;Try Watership Down&quot; he replied. I picked it up and began to read. &quot;Rabbits?&quot; I thought, &quot;I hope this doesn't turn into another Animal Farm&quot;. I have been pleasantly surprised. This book has been a wonderful adventure with inner twined legends and incredible character detail. I haven't put it down for the past five nights. I find my own heart pounding and my own breath shallow as I read from page to page and wonder how they will ever get out of this predicament. I recommend this book for anyone who loves a story that will stick with them through out life. I know it will with me."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was very very interesting, but some of the words and the descriptions are a little confusing. The rabbits in this book seem REAL!!!! I was actually GLAD that this book had small type and was thick. I loved every bit of it!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My wife says, \\"order it\\", so I ordered it. I've never read the book and this ones a gift for a grandchild. My wife says it's one of the best books she ever read as a child. Beyond that, it's what I expected."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Great Story! I totally think about animals (rabbits) differently after reading this. WaterShip Down tells a mind-blowing journey of exile rabbits. It wasn't long before I realized that the rabbits were supposed to symbolize the Pilgrims in coming to and colonizing America. The author, Richard Adams, does an excellent job of showing this connection. At many times in reading this book, I forgot that I was reading about rabbits! The author lets you know about each rabbit specifically, and makes you feel like you know everything about their culture. There was an intricate balance of adventure, danger, and heroism, but it is never too melancholy. The only thing I could think of adding, would be a little bit of humor. This would be a great book for anyone wanting a challenging read, but keeps everyone on their toes."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There are just too many books, which dwell mainly on our human perspective of life and the world about us. This book presents the rabbits viewpoint as humans encroach on their home-front by developing lands and pushing them away, endangering their existence in the wild. Apart from being a very good story in itself, it presents the rabbits' habitats and serves as a reminder to think about other species co-habiting on this Earth with us. Along similar lines, I would like to highly recommend the new book, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot; by scientist-author, C.B. Don. Like &quot;Watership Down&quot;, it is a compelling story, but in the form of an exciting science-fiction fantasy and it too opens the mind to the perspective of another species --- the essential pollinator honeybee society, which accuses humankind of endangering their habitats by our thoughtless, global polluting practices. Like the marvelous classic &quot;Watership Down&quot;, this book is surely also a must-read for all caring nature-lovers, who enjoy a fantastic eco-novel!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I LOVED this book! So far it is the best book I have ever read! I really liked the way the bunnies acted and all of the stories they told. It didn't get boring because it was about different things the bunnies did. Like leaving their home, making a new home... I loved it from the beginning to the end!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have sincerely never read a better book in my lifetime. However, in order to enjoy it you need to have an open mind and a sense of imagination. It may seem difficult to begin, but once you've been drawn in to the story, you will never want to stop reading it. I sometimes feel the necessary urge to watch a movie twice that truly gets to me, or gets me so excited and full of some sort of magical, inexplicable energy that I cannot get it out of my system until I have seen it twice. This was the first novel that clutched me so, and the summer before ninth grade, when I had to read it for school, I ended up reading it twice, feeling the vivid emotion as intensely the second time as the first. I've lost count of how many times I have read it now, and every time I read it I pick up on new, exhilarating details. The story is simply charming, with numerous metaphors and adventures. It is one of those books where you feel yourself sitting up in anticipation, as well as jumping up and down with joy. This novel is also just as humorous as adventurous, in fact, it's hilarious. Clearly, WD contains EVERYTHING a good novel, in my opinion, should: adventure, humor, a touch of sadness, friends, life-and-death situations, imagination, metaphor, intellect..etc. etc. I could go on forever, but I will stop now. Please, at least give this book a chance: if there is even a slight possibility that you could be blessed with the intense, thought-evoking feelings it has awakened in me, then it's worth it. This is my favorite book of all times."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"SO good!!!!! EVERBODY should read it!!!!!!!!! If there more stars I really give it 100/100"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The first time I read Watership Down, I was around eleven or twelve. I had seen the movie a couple of years before (during its first theatrical release, to give you an idea of how long it has been) and when I had the chance, I got the book. I still read it every few years, most recently this summer, and I never regret the time I spend on it. The character development is magnificent. Of course, the rabbits have to be human-like to carry the story, but the author keeps enough of their animal traits to be convincing. They are rabbits, not people in fur coats. I know some young readers find the book hard and long. I felt that way the first time. I hope you will try it again in a few years; you might find you understand and enjoy a lot more of the book the second time around.The reviews I have read here tend to focus on the allegorical aspects of the book: the rabbits represent people, struggling with issues in our society; their concerns represent Cold War anxieties; and so on. This is all true, but I find the book more interesting for the insight it provides into the environmentalism and animal-rights activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Both trends resurface in the other Adams books I have read (of which I think Plague Dogs is the best, but it is so graphic and heartbreaking I would not recommend it to most people). Back in the 1950s, people were sometimes showered with fallout from aboveground nuclear testing. Imagine living in a culture with that level of disregard for the world around it, and you will begin to appreciate why humans are so scary in Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"\\"Come on then, Hazel!\\"\\"I'm coming!\\"\\"Hurry up!\\"\\"I'm coming!\\"The rabbits streaked through the long, wavy grass. I think Watership Down gives the message that animals think and feel the same as humans. They would have to, to get away from predators. If you kill an animal, doesn't it bleed? I think the author got through to me because I'm going to do a report on this excellent book.\\"Come on, let's go silflay!\\" (Eat grass)\\"Sure, Bigwig!\\" Their back feet kicked warm dirt as they hopped to the bright, succulent green grass outside. Rabbits are like humans in their own way. They may not wear clothes or stand on two feet, but they communicate more or less the same way. They will talk and send messages they way you communicate which brings me to the conclusion that if rabbits communicate like that, so must other animals. I think the book gives off the image that even though they don't talk to you with words, that doesn't nessecarily mean they aren't talking.\\"Grr, Ruff Ruff!\\"\\"I'm going to get you!\\"\\"Ruun!\\"The rabbits flee from the Black Labrador's terrible jaws.\\"That was a close one!\\"The rabbits in Watership Down show you that it is a dangerous world because there aremany predators. In the middle of the book, Holly, one of two rabbits that escaped, tells of the poisoning of the rest of the rabbits by humans. This problem of predators shows throughout the book. Whether predators fox, dog, cat, human, or other rabbits, the animals struggle to survive like you or me.\\"You know the rules. Take him away, and let him off with a ripped ear!\\" General Woundwort (rabbit) glared as the poor gray rabbit was led down the hall, kicking and struggling. People can be cruel, right? Well, so can animals. The rabbits of Owsla, a whole population ran by a bad rabbit by the name of General Woundwort keeps animals underground until a certain time marked by a bite or scratch on the rabbit. If a rabbit escapes and get recaptured, the punishment may be that they will make you blind. If they capture rabbits from another den, those rabbits will probably live at Owsla for the rest of their lives. Just because humans think animals are cute and fluffy doesn't mean they aren't cruel.\\"Something bad is going to happen!\\"\\"Ok. We'll leave, Fiver.\\"\\"We've got to leave, very, very soon!\\"The rabbits (some of them) left because Fiver's bad feelings. Humans have a sixth sense sometimes also, like any animal. Not everyone left, and the rabbits who didn't leave were slaughtered. Don't humans leave a place if they feel they are threatened? Well, that's exactly what animals do.\\"We've found our new home, and we'll live here for a long, long time!\\"\\"Yes!!\\" Bigwig cried.Throughout Watership Down, the rabbits show great courage. Whether helping fellowrabbits or escaping the jaws of a predator, they always make it through unscathed. I think the important thing is that he author made his point with words. The rabbits could have been cruel like some others, but they were mostly kind. When Fiver predicted they had to leave, the rabbits left and didn't look back. I can always vision the rabbits standing on their hind legs, brown fur ruffled and their pink noses twitching."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The other reviews will give you lowdown on the story. I simply wanted to give praise where praise is due. Outstanding tale."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I liked the book because it was funny in some parts. The made up words were interesting and the charecters were orignal. I didn't like how the made up words were used because you couldn't tell what the author meant to say.I think the best part of the book was were they were in the corn field playing and eating. The worst part was were they were traveling because it was hard to follow.The most vivid story elements were the charecters to me. The setting was also well done but, need some work in places. Overall this book was good reading."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Delightful and enchanting story about a group of rabbits that leave their home in search of a more secure life. Of course they encounter myriad obstacles and adventures along the way, but the charm of the novel lies in its creation of a lapine culture, including a language and a story-telling custom. The rabbits ultimately end up in a struggle for their freedom and for the right to live in accordance with nature. I think you have to be a botanist to get through some of the descriptive paragraphs,which often read like a laundry list of trees and plants. Otherwise it's a very original and engaging story....A"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is definatly one of the best books I have ever read! Don't scoff at it just because it's about rabbits! When you're reading the book you get so absorbed into the story you forget that they're bunnies! I read this book because I had read the Redwall books and it was always being reffered to in the reviews on the inside covers of those books, and it got me curious. So one day I went down to Borders and picked it up. The rest is history! I read this book, 400+ pages and all, in two days! That's how absorbing it is! Read it and I promise you will have your eyes opened, you will never look at rabbits the same way again!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Yep. This is my favorite book of all time. I've read this book so many many times and have never gotten sick of it. Recommended to me by a friend when I was in my freshamn year of high school, I read it in about 2 days and it's been my personal favorite since. The one book I would recommend to EVERYONE. It's got adventure and drama but it's a book about rabbits... you know, like bunnies. It's weird how the rabbits face so many trials, one has horrifying visions, they tell their own myths and legends, conduct wars, and exist in such a terrifying environment. This book could have been about a group of people but from a rabbit's perspective the tale gains so much more depth and meaning. It's probably the only book that actually made me upset when I got to the end of it. Yeah, it's pretty sad... but it's also touching and that proves a lot. It can be pretty hard to find that one book, which is so powerful and well written that you get attatched to the characters and actually get sad when the story is finished."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Don't be intimidated by the aspect of rabbits as main characters, this is a truly brilliant work by Richard Adams! I am very much interested in books involving animals... If you've enjoyed works such as: Poppy, Redwall, Wind in the Willows, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, Plague Dogs, and The Dark Portal, then I'm sure you'll love this. The rabbits take on an almost-human role as they fight to survive using their resources and wits after having to flee their home warren on an impulse by Fiver, a runt rabbit with a keen sixth sense. They are faced with many problems on their journey- fear, uncertainty, tricksy predators, and most of all, the desire to return to the safety of their home. A very moving and colorful tale, I recommend Watership Down to any animal or classic literature lover."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"at first this book was hard to get into, but about into the second chapter it was very interesting...you had to &quot;be the bunny&quot; to understand it it was different to read a book from this point of view. we usally read books that are from a persons point of view, this is why this book was interesting to read. i deffinetly recommend this book to everyone &amp; anyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first I was drawn away by the fact the book dealt with rabbits but I read it just the same.

The entire thought process that went into this book is quite amazing...."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the 2nd. or 3rd. time I've read this really very good book by Richard Adams and I like it more each time. It isn't just a book about rabbits, it's a book about life, danger, tragedy, humor, adventure, overcoming adversity , death and legacy. The gamut of one's emotions are touched and it's difficult not to want to finish the book at one sitting. Through Mr. Adams's narrative you can almost experience the warmth of a burrow, the kinship of comrades and the incredible thrill of overcoming obstacles on your path of survival. This is a story that should live forever in the hearts of all adventurers regardless of age."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The writing is so beautiful and the story is just so gripping, it wont let go of you.

The book was very good and a wonderful what i like to call &quot;beach book&quot; and very entertaining. It grabs your emotions and takes them for a ride in the spell-binding book. However, it is a parts very slow, and i understand the reasoning behind it, so i can't complain much but some parts were a little dry, but i do belive that every person should read this book during you life"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, by Richard Adams, is a tale that shows courage, determination, teamwork, human nature, ethics and adventure. It can't be said to be about one thing. One subject in this book is rabbits living in a village must flee their habitats, because of destruction by land developers. The rabbits try to search for a safe place, but every corner they turn, danger meets them. Character development is extraordinary, many of the characters are just like humans, because they are talking animals. Adam's uses old folk writing styles, with a \\"lapine\\" glossary for the language of rabbitese."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A thousand stars! A million stars! Watership Down is a classic, and deservedly so. It's simply one of the finest works of fiction in the history of fiction. Buy it and read it RIGHT NOW."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The title of this review is, as best I remember, a jacket quote from the first edition of _Watership Down_ I read. Unlike almost any other, it accurately reflects the experience of and reasons for reading and rereading this book._Watership Down_ is sometimes spoken of as a fantasy, a political allegory, and I'm sure much else, but at its heart it is simply beautiful storytelling. The 'lapine' myths are canny, pointed, and exciting, while the main storyline keeps you rooting for the good guys while still understanding the motivations of the few villains. It's great to gain such \\"insight\\" into the private lives of rabbits :-) (much like Poortvliet & Huygens's _Gnomes_) but that's not why we read Adams's masterpiece. We read it to identify with a great literary journey, one to give us strength in our own sojourns."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I can remember years ago as a teenager seeing this paperback in a local bookstore and being intrigued by its warm, lovely cover art. Picking it up, I read the plot synopsis on the back cover, but couldn't at the time fathom from the description that the characters in the book were all rabbits. I didn't think much about reading it until a guy I had a crush on did a book report for it in our 8th grade English class. Upon hearing his praise and high recommendation, I bought it soon afterwards.... and was immediately entranced/blown away by a masterful, powerful tale of a band of brave rabbits who leave their endangered home in search of a new residence safe from harm and untouched by humans. I couldn't put the novel down if I'd tried!! \\"Watership Down\\" remains to this day one of my all time favorite books, and I would have to add that Richard Adams is one author who I have held in the highest regard for 20+ years. Few other authors have left such a huge impression upon me as he has with this amazing tale of love, hope, sheer terror, survival, loyalty, tenacity, intelligence, wit, and trust. Each character is distinct in the way they think, act, etc., that after a time, I nearly forgot that I was reading about rabbits. Adams really fleshes out their personalities brilliantly and makes you genuinely care about their struggles and triumphs. There was an animated movie that came out in the 1980's that was quite good and followed the book for the most part (the film is also accompanied by a breathtakingly beautiful soundtrack that fits the feel/themes of the story perfectly). However, I would very much recommend readling the book first as it is still superior, and also goes into quite a bit more detail regarding the rabbits' own unique language, folklore, and religion (of sorts). The book (and movie) both moved me to tears when I reached the ending, but I was left with a great feeling afterwards nonetheless. \\"Watership Down\\" is a fantastic portrayal of spirit, determination in the wake of adversity/destruction/death. I love this book immensely and it effected me in ways that few reads rarely have. It will always have a special place in my book collection, and most importantly, my heart."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book has outlasted many favourite-books-of-the-moment in my life. I continually come back to it, rereading it with great pleasure each time. It's the kind of book where you suddenly feel the need to read passages aloud.On the surface, a simple tale of talking rabbits. Yet I would never classify it as children's literature. An adventure with heroes and villians, peril and friendship, but it's even more than that. There is a subtext that can be interpreted to represent issues about government and society.Yet at the same time, the rabbits seem very realistic. Not just humans in rabbit form. Most have trouble with complicated concepts, ie. when they need to cross a river and two of the rabbits are too tired to swim, only one rabbit understands the concept of hitching a ride on a piece of wood to float across. They also encounter a rabbit warren that is more intellectually advanced, having created art and poetry. The main characters have trouble grasping these concepts.The characters are well-developed, as is the rabbit culture they come from. They are very much like primitive people, with an oral tradition of mythology but little concept of anything outside their own life. They see everything; other animals, plants, structures, etc as how it relates to themselves.It's a book that can be read on many levels. Adventure or allegory, everyone can take something from this story. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It has been almost 4 years since I read this book and the memory of its magical story is still as fresh in my mind as it was when I read the last page - sadly, knowing that no book could ever duplicate its splendor for me. The tales within took me on a journey with new friends who seemingly had been in my life forever."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is timeless. Grabbed me as it did so many decades ago. A great read for young and old and - getting rare these days - offers plenty to chew on. Long may these rabbits live!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The last time I read this book I was in middle school, and as I remember, I got bored with it about halfway through. Coming across it now by happy accident, I thought I would give it another try. It is a weird book, fun, not quite children's tale, not fully, thematically adult. It contains some interesting social commentary, with each rabbit warren being representative of a certain type of social order. I like the fictional rabbit ethnography, the rabbit stories and rabbit art forms. The story drags in parts, but can basically be divided into: Hazel's crew leaves their home warren; Hazel's crew encounters a \\"kept\\" warren; Hazel's crew begins a new warren at Watership Down; Hazel's crew deals with and resolves conflicts with a neighboring, Mussolini-fascist type of warren. Scattered throughout the novel are efforts at securing female rabbits for Hazel's new warren; beneficial inter-species friendships; fights and frictions between the different rabbits in Hazel's expanding crew. Adams is really into the plants of England's countryside, so be prepared for descriptive passages of weeds that go on and on. Still, I guess from the perspective of a rabbit, those passages would be pretty important, right? Anyway, it's a good read that covers a lot of ground, and is highly imaginative."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I do believe that of all my books, this is my favorite. What I love most is that each rabbit - though very different from the others - has an important part to play in their survival. Whether leader or mystic, warrior or jokester, they all make a diffrence. What a great teaching story!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There are some books I feel every teen should read. Especially in light of recent current events. Today's children & teens sometimes have no real concept of how lucky they are to live in a free society.This in such a book to remind them that things could be so different!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Never in your life have you envisioned rabbits the way that Richard Adams portrays them in this book. They are leaders, followers, thinkers and most importantly heroes. They travel far away from their homeland warren and are just incredibly complex and interesting to read about. Some classics you read and you ask, why is that a classic? Others you read and instantly know exactly why it is a classic. This book is a true classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recently read this book, and I have to say that it is one of the best works of fiction I have read in quite a while. Most of what I think are the outstanding features of the book seem to have already been mentioned in the reviews already posted. However, I will discuss some of the ones that particularly appealed to me.Richard Adams manages to create a completely self-contained and credible universe for the rabbbits who are the central characters of the story.Clearly he spent a lot of time researching the lives of rabbits, (he mentions his debt to &quot;The Private Life of the Rabbit&quot; by R.M. Lockley in the Acknowledgements section). For me, the point that most clearly shows the care that Adams has taken is the very careful and enjoyable outline of the mythology of the rabbits. They even have their own Creation Myth!! I also liked the occasional telling of the mythical exploits of El-ahrairah the Prince Rabbit at various points in the story. Adams manages to build a totally beleivable rabbit mythology.It has been said that the inclusion of a map in the front of a fantasy book is a bad sign, as it usually means that you are going to be dragged into every part of it at some stage, whether you like it or not. However, in the case of this story it mercifully proved to be not so. Indeed, the maps assisted the story rather than distracting from it.The plot is well thought out. One tiny quibble I have with the plot is that the central characters dont realise that they will need some females to populate their new warren till they have actually reached Watership Down. The getting of females forms the central plot of the second (and most exciting) part of the book. However, this is a minor quibble and it is necessary to sustain the story.The characterisation was good as well. (I particularly liked General Groundwort and Keehar). I'm starting on Shardik in a week or two. I hope it's as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a brilliant book which keeps readers intrested from start to finish. As soon as I began reading this book i fell in love with the charecthers and the plot. This is an absoultley brilliant book"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I would describe this book as sweet, but yet full of suspense. One of the best novels of all times!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I've been reading all the reviews, and I can't understand these people who say it's too long, it's boring...........I loved it. I had to pick a book to read for a 10th grade project, and this was recommended to me by a friend. I wasn't sure I would like it-I'm a horse fan-but I loved it. I was into it from the very beginning. The characters-all rabbits- are very interesting and dynamic. I especially loved the made-up rabbit words, confusing to some people, but i thought it was cool. The story is about a group of rabbits who flee their home in search of a new one. On the way, they encounter hardships and problems as they try to establish a new warren. More characters are added as they go on, and each scene is more interesting than the last. I finished iot in a week, I couldn't put it down. A few not-so-good words, when your get around Keehar-the seagull-so watch out if you read it to little kids. All in all, an awesome book, I recommend it to everyone who can read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"There are not many books that if you said were about bunnies that you would want to read. This is that one you would want to read. Watership Down, by Richard Adam, is an excellent work of fiction that draws the reader into the novel and leaves the reader guessing throughout the novel. I would recommended this book to everyone I know, for it is memorable and unforgettable.Richard Adam writes through the eyes of wild rabbits, which leave home on the pretense of the main character's brother's, Fiver, ability to sense danger in the near future. The story travels with a band of smaller, weaker, male rabbits that do not know the first thing of creating a colony. Adam Tries to foreshadow most events within the story and uses the characters and events as a microcosm. Throughout the book many themes seem to appear, but the overwhelming theme that is constant in the novel is the overcoming of good over evil and the will that people have to push forward.As a memorable book there are always memorable ideas and enigmas that seem to dawn on a person, and these occurrences is what makes a memorable novel or story. One of the most memorable parts of the novel is how these rabbits overcome the impossible and defeat their fears and hardships. Another memorable theme of the novel is the loyalty that these rabbits exhibit throughout the novel. The loyalty shone between brothers and those who were once enemies are all displayed through the novel. The microcosm of the novel is one of World War II and the presence of evil lurking. This is evident with a character in the story that is very self-righteous and selfish, which combats the characteristics of the antagonist.The struggles of man between choosing good and evil and those who are pulling you in to conformity, which are addressed in this novel, will be images imprinted on your mind forever. Through the experiences of the characters in this novel one may see the faults of society that the author tries to bring to light to his reader and his implications of leadership and loyalty expressed by his characters are things that we should learn, and for this I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a great book! I statred this book at about 8:00Am at the begginning of school and finished by the end of school at 3:00PM (To do this, I completley ignored my schoolwork and concentrated on reading this book).Basically, tis book is about a rabbit named Fiver, and when he has a &quot;premonition&quot;, 11 other rabbits join him, believing his fears to be true.Otherwise, excellent book. Nothing objectionable and easy to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book in elementary school and remembered it being simply fantastic. As I have re-read it over the years, I now understand why. The characters are incredibly real and the story is engrossing with it's unique look at animal life. The author does an excellent job of creating a realistic rabbit portrait (their habbits,language etc.) while managing to keep the rabbit characters incredibly human. Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry and company are as impossible to forget as any human being creation. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first saw the cartoon movie when I was only 10. I was so enthralled with the imagery that was in the movie that I checked the book out of the school library the very next day. I remeber that it was a hard back book with a map of the fields inside the cover. It took me all of one week to read the entire book. My teacher thought I should have read a shorter book to do my report on as the book was so long. I received an A+ as I usually did on my reports. I highly recommend this book for kids, and adults. It is one of my favorite all time books.The imagery that you get from the book is so much more than the movie tried to provide. The book deals with the society of a warren of rabbits. How they deal with each other, leadership, their culture and their journey on finding a place to call home."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I reread this magnificent book whenever I need an escape from stress - and it is just as exciting every time. What a masterpiece! I absolutely love it - from the characters to the descriptions of the landscape to the storyline that sweeps you along like a river. Thank you to Richard Adams for this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Now, take note - I am emphatically not a fan of fantasy. In fact, I recommend limiting yourself to just this book as far as the genre goes, as the rest of the genre is mostly sterile, unoriginal, and hackneyed (and rips off this book a lot, too). This book, on the other hand, rocks on every level, because it has something that most fantasy (and most books in general nowadays) lacks - some absolutely wonderful characterization and imagery. Who could forget Fiver and his unsettling yet poetic visions (for some reason I keep associating his trembling hallucinations with Richey James, lyricist of the Manic Street Preachers; rockin' band, by the way)? Or Holly's own rather genuinely disturbing account? Or Cowslip's warren? Or the rabbit stories? And so on, and so on.This book is rife with unforgettable imagery like that, and it is one of those few books that can be treated as a non-ridiculous allegory. True, it's not quite high-school reading (middle school the highest, sez I), but it's an absolutely necessary book to read at that age level. If you read it then, it will stay with you for the rest of your life. And sure, Adams gave us a real groaner with the execrable sequel - but this is one of the most imaginative and thought-provoking children's books in existence. I may be compromising my reputation as a Deep Intellectual by reviewing a children's book, but this is the one book that's worth it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When my sixth grade teacher put this book on the required reading list, I cringed at the thought of reading all 400+ pages of it. The talking rabbits I could deal with, but over 400 pages worth? Little did I know how involved I would get into the lives of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and the rest.Ever since, I've read and re-read Watership Down. Every summer. For five summers now. And I've enjoyed it increasingly. As I took more history classes and studied human nature, I began to draw parallels between the lives of the rabbits and the different types of warrens with examples from real life and history. Efrafa is a dictatorship, Threarah represented those who were destroyed because they could not or would not change, and Hazel is a true leader. He could inspire his bunch of hlessil to keep moving, kept their spirits up, and always knew when to ask for help.I will always be thankful to Richard Adams for this insight to humanity...through rabbits, no less. It revealed connections and character traits about real life that I undoubtedly would have learned but definitely much later in life. So I will continue to re-read my copy, all the while finding new nuggets of truth scattered around like the rabbit holes of Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is a novel about Hazel and his band of rabbits who escape from their overcrowded warren after Fiver, Hazel's brother who can predict the future, warns them of a disaster that will strike the warren. On the journey to find a new home, Hazel and his followers face drowning as they try to cross a river, being attacked by predators, and hostile rabbits from other warrens. Hazel manages to steal does from these warrens and bring them to his new home on Watership Down. After one final encounter with an angry rabbit general and the help of the seabird Keehar, the warren is free from danger and Hazel's rabbits are able to live peacefully. Watership Down is an exciting book that is almost impossible to put down once you start reading it. If you like adventure books that are a little different or that have a twist, I would recommend Watership Down to you."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down will survive as one of the great classics of Twentieth Century literature. It is the anthropomorphic tale of a rabbit warren that must flee the impending destruction of its bunny hole in the English countryside by advancing urban sprawl. They set off on a journey of adventure and discovery toward their new home, Watership Down.The beauty of the book is in its deceptive complexity. As a multi-layered work, it appeals to a wide variety of readers by satisfying their needs at many different levels. For those who just like rabbits or warm and fuzzy animal tales, Watership Down competes with The Incredible Journey, Black Beauty, or anything by Disney. For those interested in intriguing plot-based fiction with good action and character development, look no further. And surprisingly, for the discriminating reader of literary fiction, Watership Down provides a sophisticated corollary to the ironies of advanced human civilization, reminiscent of Animal Farm, yet less sardonic. A great read for all ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the first book I ever read. At or about age four, my father (an english teacher) read it with me. I give a lot of credit to Richard Adams and his novel (and my dad, of course); he gave me a benchmark with which to compare fiction. This is a story with many levels, and I'd suggest it for MATURE readers of any age. It's a story of a group of rabbits that escape certain death when their warren is destroyed by a land developer. They set out across the english countryside in search of the promised land. Fiver, the runt of the litter, and his friend Hazel organize a midnight escape when the chief rabbit ignores Fiver's premonitions of doom. With Bigwig, a brave and powerful veteran of the warren's &quot;police&quot; team, Hazel's gift of leadership, Fiver's insight, even a sarcastic seagull named Keehar, and others, they pursue a dream. There are analogs here of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. Mr. Adams paints quite a picture here; common places and things assume different, often darker qualities when viewed from just 4 inches off the ground. Of course, Watership Down is a place that really exists. During a recent trip to England, my dad finally had a chance to visit Watership Down. He was taken by the site, and says it looks much like he'd imagined it, only better. Anybody that says they didn't like this book must either be very shallow, or extremely attention deficient.I've read this book well over 20 times, and I STILL can't put it down. If you HAVE read this book, then read THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE RABBIT. It's the nonfiction/reference book Adams read to prepare for Watership Down. He refers to it by name in his novel, and it's a very interesting follow-up read if you enjoyed Watership Down. Also, don't miss out on his other novels, like The Plague Dogs, Traveller, and others. The former is a tale of two dogs that escape from an animal research center. The latter, the life and times of Traveller, the horse that General Robert E. Lee rode in the American Civil War, as told! to a housecat by Traveller himself. Civil War buffs will definitly get a kick out of Traveller's take on the war, and it's aftermath. Watership Down is still my all time favorite book, hands down. Give it a chance, and you will be mezmerized by a world you'll want to visit again and again, I promise. Heck, someday I want to go to the real Watership Down myself."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I scroll down this page and I see mostly 4 and 5 star ratings. Good for those who like this book, I mean, I absoluely LOVED it! But then I see some 1 and 2 ratings, and I just have to look at these reviews. I don't see any good reasons for not liking this book. All I see is, &quot;Why base a book on rabbits?&quot;, &quot;Would be better with humans as main characters&quot;, &quot;hard to understand&quot;, &quot;had to read it for school&quot;. First of all, I though this was a spectacular book, and I read it by myself, on my own, and I'm only in 7th grade! Second of all, it didn't have to be hard to understand. There was a glossary in the back of my book, and there were even footnotes! As for those who didn't understand why this was just a story about rabbits- It's called IMAGINATION! What kind of boring books would we have if each one was about humans and real life and the same old stuff we deal with everyday? It would be terrible! And writing this book from the points of view from rabbits was a very good idea. It allowed readers to be able to see what it might be like to be in the shoes (or paws) of someone else. To everyone who doesn't like this book, you have to look deeper than the words! THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK! (sorry about the errors in this review)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, The Thoughts of a 7th GraderWatership down is a very different novel that any I have ever read. I like how Richard Adams added suspense and made you want to cheer for the rabbits at times like when they are escaping from Efrafa. I will not lie, I thought that some parts of the book were very uneventful. When they left the very first warren I think that they should have taken some does with them. I thought that their journey was not my favorite part but I enjoyed trying to put the pieces together when they reached Cowslip's Warren. The most exciting part was when they were escaping with Bigwig from Efrafa and they went on the boat. It was suspenseful when Dandelion almost missed the boat. I also had fun reading about their trip to Nuthanger farm. I was very surprised that they beat the cat. Another one of the best parts was when they had the fight when the rabbits from Efrafa came to take the does, Blackavaar, and bigwig. I also liked the part when they first discovered Watership down.My overall impression of the book is that it was a pretty ok book but I think adults would enjoy it more than kids would. It's like an acquired taste. Some like it and some don't. I would recommend this book to people who don't mind reading a little while until they get into it. For people who want action from the start I strongly do not recommend this book to you. I thought that I didn't understand the book as well as I do after writing about it. It was an interesting novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams's quirky masterpiece is what you might have gotten if J.R.R. Tolkien had written _Wind in the Willows_. It's a book that would have made C.S. Lewis weep tears of joy, if he had lived long enough to read it. This is the epic story of a group of rabbits who wander across the English countryside looking for a place to found a new warren, after their old home has been destroyed by developers. For once, the word &quot;epic&quot; really is warranted. _Watership Down_ has many echoes of classical literature. The basic story line resembles Virgil's _Aeneid_--the apocalyptic destruction of an established society and the flight of a group of exiles to establish a new home, guided by prophecy and beset by dangers. As with the _Aeneid_, the second half of _Watership Down_ is taken up with the rabbits' attempts to establish their new home, and their struggles with their neighbors, both human and animal. Like the early Romans (though this story comes not from Virgil but from Livy) the rabbits are all male and have to abduct females from elsewhere, and this brings them into conflict with the viciously formidable General Woundwort, a rabbit dictator of great personal valour combined with utter ruthlessness (who could easily have been the model for the Killer Rabbit of Monty Python fame). General Woundwort's totalitarian warren is one of the two obvious pieces of allegorical satire in the book. The other concerns a society of fat, decadent rabbits who have forgotten the ancient myths of their people and live a life of ease tinged with a fear that they don't dare to name--a chilling portrait of our own society, surely. But most of the book can be enjoyed without thinking of such things. Adams has created a world with meticulous detail--the only greater achievement along this line in modern literature is the _Lord of the Rings_. The rabbit myths, customs, and language seem utterly real. Like all the best animal fantasies, _Watership Down_ gives you rabbits who are both extremely human and extremely rabbitlike. Adams's character portrayal is impeccable, and his style has exactly the range and power needed--grandiloquent at one moment and tenderly mock-heroic at another. For anyone who loves imaginative literature, this is a book that must be read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams' \\"Watership Down\\" is an amazing book that richly deserves all the kudos it has received. This great novel should be considered an all-time classic work of fiction -- of any genre (i.e., fantasy, allegory, science fiction, political), and for any age. As with almost any great novel, \\"Watership Down\\" can be read on many different levels, and at many different points in one's life. And, contrary to what a few VERY misguided reviewers have claimed, this book is \\"just a bunch of words about rabbits\\" only if you think that George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" is a lighthearted tale of pigs and cows, or JRR Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is just some stupid adventure story involving weird creatures like elves and hobbits. Uh... I don't think so!At its most basic level, \\"Watership Down\\" is, as described on the book's jacket, \\"a stirring tale of adventure\\" by a group of rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by humans, then running into many more \\"hare-raising\\" adventures as the book proceeds. If you read the book only on this level, what you have is an exciting book which you won't want to put down until you have finished it...which isn't bad! But if you never looked beyond this level, you'd be missing a lot.For instance, you'd be ignoring (to quote the book's jacket again), \\"a timeless and powerful parable about society and its relation to the natural world,\\" plus (this is NOT a complete list by any means): 1) an anthropomorphic, highly believable battle between Nazi/Stalinist totalitarianism (the Efrafa warren of General Woundwort) and a Western, liberal Democracy (Hazel-rah's Watership Down society), with a detour to Cowslip's decadent, cynical, soft, and deceptively dangerous warren (Weimar Germany of the 1920s? The United States today?); 2) a generally (but not totally) unflattering look - as seen through the eyes of Nature -- at humans and human civilization (senseless cruelty and destruction, stupidity, suburban sprawl, but...the potential for redemption through significant acts of kindness, at least by a child); 3) an illustration and examination of various leadership types, and specifically, what makes a leader? (size and strength? cunning? vision? ruthlessness? caution? organizational skills? ability to provide economic/material benefits to the masses?); 4) a look at the place and importance of mythology and religion in society; 5) an inquiry into the meaning of friendship, fear, courage, etc.; and 6) the creation of a unique culture and language (\\"Lapine\\"), a la Tolkien, which is highly effective (although not nearly as extensive as Tolkien's languages).In sum, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read (and I've read \\"hrair\\"). Fascinating, complex, moving, beautiful, unique. Hop right out and get this book!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a stupendously marvelous book about rabbits. It starts out when a young rabbit named Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of foresight, sees the warren they live in being destroyed, and they must leave there at once, with as many as will follow. He convinces his brother Hazel, simply because Hazel knows the truth of his dreams. They approach the Thearah, the head of the rabbits, but that does not go well. So they leave the warren, and the story is of them traveling, trying to find a home, and at last succeeding. Then they have to get does from another warren, Efrafa, that is run very militarily by a rabbit named General Woundwort.That is a lot more to this novel than that extremely brief summary. You get to meet a grand sea gull named Kehaar. It is one of my most favoured books, and I know of none outside the fantasy market that touches its realm of invention.The best thing about this novel is how thoroughly researched this is. This is not regular anthropomorphic fiction, where talking animals are just caricatures of humans, or they're animals without that true sense of their nature. The rabbits in WATERSHIP DOWN behave like real rabbits. I'd go so far as to call this THE LORD OF THE RINGS of this type of fiction, with talking animals. Adams has taken the real behaviour of rabbits and set them in a wonderful story. The depth of his achievement never fails to amaze me. He totally makes a believable real world of the rabbits, and from the rabbit's perspective. Besides being a great novel, this makes this work stand out even more so. All the places, including the place Watership Down, are real locations in England.Although Brian Jacques' REDWALL series is often hailed in comparison to this, in terms of actual scope of reality, REDWALL and all its incarnations is inferiour to his in a particular sense. Not that I don't like REDWALL. Brian Jacques has a very real gift of telling a rollicking good yarn, and his series deserves everything it gets. Its just that WATERSHIP DOWN shows more craft in the sense that instead of taking animals and imposing them with personalities (which could be said of NARNIA and other heavy weights in this type of literature as well), with them losing their nature and taking on a definably human one, Adams did not go to that extreme. He balanced them with ultimately human traits necessary for the story, but still in keeping with their animal nature, with them behaving and acting like real rabbits. This is why I love this particular novel so much. It achieves a balance of animal and human qualities, of which so few stories in this particular genre attempt to achieve, which really creates a deficit in this facet of literature. Of course, not all these stories are trying to achieve that balance, or need too, because they are aiming for an entirely different point and are using anthropomorphic fiction as its vehicle, and that's alright. (Case in point: George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, which is as every bit as good as this, although it is so for entirely different reasons.) It gives anthropomorphic fiction a new height and goal to shoot too:1. To take an animal, for purpose of a story, and with human traits and failings let us get to know the character and its surroundings.2. To take the character created, and to keep it in keeping with its real species. If it's a bear or an otter, have the bear and otter behave like real bears and otters. It makes the fiction so very much richer, although naturally it will confine the work in certain aspects.The interaction between the rabbits and human society is an excellent treatise in its own right on man's dominance over nature. It gives a very interesting view on how animals interact and deal with us. They are two separate societies, and each must deal with the other. Of course, the humans have the overall hand. That is why, indeed, the rabbits led by Hazel and Fiver must forsake their home warren in the first place. On the Notice Board (name of the first chapter &quot;The Notice Board&quot;) there is a notice which reveals the humans will make a shopping mall or something like that in that location. Although this may seem strange, the only other books that I have read that gives a very interesting animal perspective on human society is in quite a different setting, with largely comic overtones. The HANK THE COWDOG books, a children's series greeted with enthusiastic response from both children and adults, gives a perfectly delightful view of human society from an animal's perspective. They are written by John R. Erickson (I'm proud to say I hail from his home state of Oklahoma, though now I am far removed from there).In conclusion, one of the books I love and respect the most. His depth of invention is amazing, his achievement, although in a much different setting, parallels the achievements of Robert Jordan and J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of those books I wished I had written (as H. G. Wells said of Sinclair Lewis' BABBITT, and, perhaps more importantly, Stephen King said of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES, another debut novel). I bought a hardback copy of SHARDIK, a novel of similar magnitude (or so they say.) I haven't read it yet. They say it topples this book, and if that is the case, Mr. Adams is even more so a truly remarkable writer of novels."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is the best book I've ever read. I am 13 year old male and I loved it. It is about a group of rabbits led by Hazel, Bigwig, Holly, and Bluebell that flee their doomed community and strive to build a new, perfect warren, envisioned by the prophetic Fiver- and the book is less than 1/2 over! The book is over 400 pages but personally, it was so exciting that it seemed too short when I read it. The first 100 pages aren't very exciting at all- but don't let that throw you, because the plot thickens. In fact, I found it so intoxicating that now that I'm finished, I feel upset because I still want to hear more about their adventures. I look forward to reading the sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot;in the near future. Fellow WD fans, e-mail me at yhwh_86_40475@yahoo.com!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I picked up this book after finishing Tolkien in a state of looking for something to read. None of the trite fantasies available at the time would do, and I was skeptical when my father recommended a book about rabbits, but I was not let down. Watership Down is an incredible piece of literature that will have you staying up until dawn, no matter what your age. The odyssey of the main characters is a fascinating journey with a rabbit's idea of utopia at the end, kept alive with brilliant animorphing of hares and other creatures along the way. Excellent beckground, personification, and storytelling make this title shine. And unlike many modern YA and fantasy writers, Adams knew when to stop. Too much of a good thing can be the death knoll to an author's work. The lack of a sequel does not stop readers from looking back on this work throughout their lives, and most will probably read it several times through.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book became an instant favourite of mine the moment I read it at the age of eleven; and, indeed, I can't count the number of times I've read it since then. I find it very grounding, with its poetic descriptions of nature and it's primal account of survival, all masterfuly depicted from the lapine point of view. This book really soars when it tells of the fables of El-ahraihrah; Adams does a masterful job of creating an animal mythology that underscores the trials of his protagonists, Hazel, Bigwig, and Fiver. I can't help to imagine that Kenneth Oppel must have been inspired by this book when writing the \\"Silverwing\\" series, for it seems to have some similar echoes. In any case, Watership Down is a classic, and I never hesitate to recommend it to the kids I teach. It's beautifully written, contains high adventure, and strengthens the spirit. Somehow it manages to be sentimental too, without being melodramatic--truly, a remarkable feat."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Before I first read this novel, the idea of talking rabbits brought me to mind of Thumper from the movie 'Bambi', or even worse, Harvey the invisible rabbit, from the old James Stewart movie.But the rabbits from Watership Down are much more down-to-earth and many-layered than those creatures. These are not cartoon animals with magical powers or humans in bunny suits. Richard Adams has so seamlessly blended natural rabbit behavior with higher level thinking that it seems almost, well, natural. He has ingeniously retained the way real rabbits live in their real environment, to such an extent that if any human being were to step into the novel at any time and observe these rabbits' doings, he/she would probably not suspect anything out of the ordinary was going on at all.The way the rabbits work together to solve problems in this many-adventured read is fascinating, yet not necessarily an impossible stretch of the imagination. Some part of me was always left wondering, \\"Hmmm.... is it possible rabbits might really do this?....\\"This is an endearing novel full of courage, ingenuity, humor, inspiration and a tangible sense of place. Adams never takes the easy way out by resorting to magic, and yet he has created a masterpiece that is magic itself."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the BEST book I have ever read.

It opens up when a rabbit (Fiver) has a vision about their home being destroyed, and he and his brother Hazel escape with a few other rabbits to find another place to make a home. They go through many dangers and adventures, including a warren (rabbit house) filled with crazy bunnies. They eventually make it to Watership Down and start another warren, and in a few days, they find another rabbit from their home warren (Holly) who tells them that their warren was,in fact, destroyed by men and hrududil (cars or tractors). But eventually, as soon as they are settled on Watership Down , they realize that their warren will not survive for long without does (females), but the only warren anywhere nearby is Efrafa, which is controlled by the terrible General Woundwort...This book is an excellent read, and I DEFINITELY recommend buying it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My dad told me he would buy me this book.

BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I realize what one reviewer said was true, that WD is an allegory of the Iliad, but Adams makes this obvious, I think, with the quotations at the beginning of each chapter-a handy literature guide for us non-college going folks.I find that Adams, like CS Lewis,skillfully uses collective myths (unlike Tolkien, who just copied them verbatim) to create this tale, then takes it a step further to explain why we need stories and legends in our own lives. As the rabbit Buckthorn says in Cowslip's warren, \\"El-ahrirah is a trickster, and rabbits will always need tricks.\\"This statement is proven time and again by the rabbits' adventures. It's a good read as a child, but as we get older, we recognize the characters and social mores of Cowslip's warren and Efrafa, and appreciate the lessons learned. If you are into anthropology and sociology you will probably especially enjoy it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I can't add too much to the plot descriptions and praise already posted here.

I hope that I'll find even more in it next time I read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the most unique and interesting books I've ever read. Richard Adams chose rabbits as the characters of his animal fantasy, a different and more interesting choice than most. The creation of the rabbits' society was well-thought and brilliant, along with the legends that the rabbits told one another.The story is aabout a group of rabbits, who decide they must leave their warren when Fiver, a young buck rabbit among them, has a strange feeling that something bad is coming. His older brother Hazel leads a small group of rabbits out of the warren, in search of a new home. But when they do find a new palce, they discover that they have no female rabbits, and they must find a way to bring some to their new warren.I would recommend this book to anyone 12-up, and I only dropped one star because it is a little drawn-out in some places, but it is still gripping enough to keep you reading it until the last page. Also, the author never really explained how Fiver came to have his strange sense of foreboding. Since this is one of the most important elements of the book, I would have liked for it to be explained. But other than that, this is a wonderful classic that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my favorite book outside of the horror genre. It is full of social and political undertones, beautifully described, and well researched into the nature of wild rabbits.I tend to avoid most animal books because they usually focus around one or two animal heros that meet some tragic untimely doom and their human owner or whatever cries and buries them, etc. etc. you get my point. This book has it's share of death and tragedy but it also has it's share of triumphs and rescues. It is a saga of short lived creatures, so in rabbit terms - it's practically generational. Tragedy befalls us all at some time or another. This book deals it's blows in natural doses. It's easier to take that way.If you are considering reading it, please do. I don't even think of it as a childrens novel, though I supposed they could read it if they were intelligent enough to understand the underlying themes."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I don't quite understand how any one can find this bookoffensive.

Anitially I thought 'how good could a book about rabits really be?' but this book isn't just about Bunnies. it is about taking notice to things you otherwise may have gone through your life being oblivious to. It makes you understand what kind of world this is for ALL of the creatured in it. Not just humans.

Like there's how the rabbits got their sense of smell, there's the Hole in the Sky, and there are all the stories of what happened after the Black Rabbit of Inle.

Lewis's 7 Chronicles of Narnia books to him when he was 6 years old. I think the Narnia books can never be beaten - but Watership Down is the first book we've shared since then that has come even close to Narnia adventures. One of your reviews notes that some TV-video-game generation kids may not relate to such books - NOT TRUE! My son loves his Nickelodeon and other TV shows, as well as all his video games and his various athletic and other activities. However, I know that any &quot;spirited&quot; and active kid who is fully attuned to all these modern electronic and other diversions still can savor a wonderful book like Watership Down when read aloud by a loving parent. We LIVED through Watership Down. My son read some of it to me while I was driving on a long trip - and I could hardly wait to know what was to happen next as I drove! The suspense was wonderful; we cried in many places; then laughed out loud at other parts. WHAT A JOY! I encourage EVERY parent out there to share this book with his or her child. We haven't read the sequel, &quot;Tales,&quot; yet but will very soon.Can anyone out there suggest similar experiences?

You cannot get any better than this in the fantasy world."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I put off reading this book for many years because I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I shouldn't have done so. This book is one of the greatest adventure stories I've ever read -- even if the main characters are rabbits. Their characters are so well drawn, with words from their language thrown in just for fun, that you can hardly wait to hear what happens to them next. I heartily recommend this one. You'll fly through it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A fantacy tale which immerses you in real personalities and comparisons to everyday life. After getting involved in it, you hardly realize that isn't a real story. The plot begins with a group of rabbits who run away from their home in search of an easier life. I know it sounds rediculous, but bear with me here. The challenges they face lead them to the perfect settling place, but they realize they forgot to bring any females. Whoops. They plead with an overcrowded community to allow some does to settle with them, but the strict leader refuses and captures the representatives they sent. A daring rescue ensues which results in a happy ending to all of their troubles. You must read this novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am 14 and loved this book. The people who gave it bad reviews don't know what they're talking about. This book does have action and adventure and is not about Blackberry coming home with females. Anyone stupid enough to think that just because talking bunnies are in it it is not a good book should be hurt. Also you would have to be pretty stupid to think this book doesn't have action and adventure."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of those books that you have to keep forever. It's full of adventure, humor, and can be a real tear jerker. If you have just read the first chapter, and didn't enjoy it all that much, keep going! It gets better and better as you read on. If you really enjoyed this book, you should also try reading the Redwall series, by Brian Jacques. They are a lot alike, except for the fact that there are previously 11 of them."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"if you liked the trilogy of the rings, you'll love this adventure about bunnies (yes bunnies, get use to it) searching for a new home. My brother almost didn't read it because he thought a novel about bunnies was &quot;the stupidest thing&quot; he ever heard, but after the first chapter, was was pro-bunny all the way."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It was amazing. I resisted reading it for a long time due to the &quot;bunny&quot; premise, but I found it wasn't like that at all. I finally finished it last night and got very teary-eyed. It was a beautiful story with a political undertone, and I found it very moveing."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You may scoff at a novel about rabbits. And since it's usually found in the sci-fi/fantasy section of most bookstores, that may further disuade you from reading this book.Don't be fooled! This is a classic tale of adventure, heros, and villans. Richard Adams has written a story which will have you so absorbed, you'll find it hard to put down. If you're afraid of a &quot;Peter Cottontail&quot; story, quit worrying.I'm just wondering if Rowsby Woof will ever get to finally meet the Queen..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Despite what the cover, and certain sixth graders, might tell you, this isn't simply a story about talking rabbits. I literally just finished reading my incredibly worn copy again for the upteenth time, and I honestly can't think on another book that can touch it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This has to be easily the 2nd best book I have read in my life next to The Giver. When I looked at the cover I thought, 'Okay, talking rabbits. I can deal with this.' And did I! This is a great, must-read book! To all the 4th graders who said it 'sucked' and gave it a one, how about you actually read it instead looking at the back of it!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember, in fifth grade, having a wonderful teacher I respected. He recommended this book to me. I immeditatly ran to the library to check it out only to find that a friend of mine had it. I pestered her to finish so that I could read it. I loved it then. The only thing which I did not like at that time were the quotes at the beginning of the chapters. I was too young to understand their significance (especially the ones in French). That summer I went to visit my grandparents (who have a very extensive book collection). I put their copy of Watership down in my suitcase and read it at least once a year from then on. Now, eight years later, I have read that paperback copy to shreds. I received a first edition copy of it for Christmas, and I can honestly say there is nothing I would have rather gotten.This book can speak to an individual on many levels. When I was in fifth grade it was a nice story. I didn't understand the significance of many things Adams used to illustrate his points. I enjoyed it for the plot, the action, the suspense, the characters. I still enjoy those elements, they are, in essence, the backbone of any novel. Every time I read this book I discover something new, it fleshes out. I see all the layers of my understanding and enjoyment underneath the new one. I can not look at this novel as a two-dimensional skeleton of a book. For me, it is very much a vitalic entity."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think this is the best book i have ever read. I'm in grade 12, and it's very very refreshing after pouring over all your Chaucer and Shakespeare. I just love it. You can read it like an allegory to human life, you can read it like a story of good and evil, or you can read it like a simple little rabbit story. Also see &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, which is essentially the same story (he even mentions Watership Down somewhere in there). You won't be sorry if you read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book when I was in the fifth grade. I liked it, but it was kind of challenging to read. This book is about a group of rabbits that live in a field. One rabbit suspects danger, and so the group goes on an adventurous journey to find a new home. It's a suspenseful story. I recommend this book to young people who like animal stories."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Bunnies!!! I read a lot of stuff... a lot of very different kind of stuff, and I really liked Watership Down. If you didn't get to it in high school, you should definitely pick it up now."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"If your're interested in animal fiction books, read this. Nearly all the animal books I read say &quot;Inspired by Watership Down.&quot; Heres a summary of the story: A band of rabbits leave their warren after sensing an unstoppable danger. They face hundreds of hardships until they find a home on watership down. Then, after finding that their old warren had been bulldozed, they are caught in a war over a few does. The ending won't dissapoint you; it's the best finish I've ever seen. So read Watership Down!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"~This is a book with something more than a story. It is almost parallel to our own society. The story is one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Had to read this for Enlish class in High School, and fell in love with it before the book was even half read. The type of book you would never pick up off the shelf, but once you begin to read, there is something magical that happens. You begin to beleive and feel the pain and happiness of these characters. Never has a book with such a story ever touched me the way this book has. You must give this book a read, you will not be disappointed, you will be amazingly surprised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~Although this book gets dull and drags at times, the cute rabbits make up for it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Very few people ever see the deeper more sinister levels of this book. As a student of wolrd class systems, this book is a tangible study of different socio-economic structures. Beyond that, it is a great adventure story about some living creatures looking for a better life of freedom and equality. I think all of us can appreciate THAT struggle. Without it, where would we be? We would not be Americans, that is for certs."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book twice and it was great. i loved the way the rabbits faced conflict and heroism. it felt you were in the book with the other rabbits. i really think you should read it!!!!If you like rabbits, read this book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It has been years since I read this book but I remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember not being able to put the book down and about steeling moments during the day to read. The book keeps you constantly on the edge. It is about more than rabbits. It is about good and evil, communism and democracy. To this day, I crnge when I see civelisation encroching on what might be a warren of rabbits.This wasn't the best book ever, or even one of the best were written, it was okay. Nothing fancy."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A classic story of loyalty and survival. Simply an incredible story. It's intriguing, terrifying, and gives the reader much to think about in terms of social status, government and friendship. High schoolers will love the polotics."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The first part of the book was boring I put the book down every five minutes.But at about 350 I couldn't put it down. I think it was the best military strategy."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My granddaughter has been waiting to get this book for a long time (grandma wasn't on the ball). She loves it. She is 10."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A young rabbit named Fiver sees a vision of blood and death--danger is coming to the rabbit warren! Thus begins this classic fantasy book for middle school and teen readers. Fiver tells his brother Hazel and they flee, along with nine other rabbits.The first several days of travel out in the open are harrowing, but they think their luck has changed when they happen upon another warren. Unlike the overcrowded warren they left behind, this one has plenty of room and they are invited to stay. Only Fiver senses that all is not as it seems. When one of their band almost loses his life, they learn the warren's deadly secret and must leave.Eventually they find the perfect spot for their own warren, a large hill called Watership Down. However, Hazel soon realizes they have a problem: without female rabbits to have babies, the warren won't last long. They come up with a solution, but carrying it out will test Hazel's leadership and the mettle of all of the rabbits to their limit.This middle school book tells an exciting story and is beautifully written. The lovable characters range from Hazel, the thoughtful leader who learns not to overreach himself, to Bigwig, the aggressive fighter who faces death more than once, and Fiver, the gentle, otherworldly psychic whose visions guide the group. One great charm of Watership Down is that tales of a legendary rabbit hero are sprinkled throughout the story. Whenever the rabbits face a dilemma and need inspiration, they lift their spirits with tales of a rabbit's courage, cleverness, and derring-do.Richard Adams had a hard time finding someone to publish this book for middle school readers. Publishers thought that a story about rabbits was for babies, but that the writing style was for adults, so who would read it? Lots of people, it turned out. In 1972 a small publisher took a chance on the unusual novel and it's still in print. I love Tolkien, but this is my favorite fantasy novel. I can't count how many times I've read it.Reading level: Ten and up. Good readers of 10-11 should do fine with it, unless the more adult writing style is off-putting. From comments I read online, many parents read this book aloud to their children and it is enjoyed and discussed by all."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The title of my review says it all. This book was read aloud to my Grade 5 class by our teacher and it had a wonderfully powerful inspirational effect on all of us. I read it to my son nightly. Everyone should have this book read to them."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read a lot... For the life of me I cannot think of how I missed this book until now. If I began to list the superlatives that come to mind, no one would believe me. But you simply must read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It's been at least 20 years since I first read this book - and coming back to it after all that time has been just as enjoyable.What I appreciate more this time around is the lessons the book teaches on effective leadership and ethics of equality and representative politics. Those are two topics I never would have noticed reading this in my pre-teen years. We'll worth rediscovering."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I recieved my pruchase right on time. It came earlier than expected and I like that. Its in very good condition too.So far I'm on the ark where the rabbits plan to go to Efrafa. Its a real surprise. The movie which I watched before this is completely different. I'm not sure why the movie left out some things in the book, but I'm not gonna fault it on that. If a movie followed a book completely it would be many hours long. I'm really enjoying this book so far and can't wait to see what happens next. I might even watch the movie again and compare the two. First off (SPOILER!!!!) Alot of things in the book are more disturbing. An example is the destruction of the old warren. Holly and Blackberry's description on the events leading up to them finding Hazel and others just disturbed me. Not only were they attacked by humans, but thier own kind. Sounds similar to some human situations. Plus the whole tearing dead bodies apart detail...~shivers~. Efrafa is also described in more detail. In the movie the only thing I knew about Efrafra was that it almost represent a communist country or Dictatorship and Hazels warren represent Democracy. I'm not sure if this was done intentially or not. I would actually say in the book its even more obvious.I must confess when I first read WSD I almost expected another book like Erin Hunters Warriors or that series about the wolves. I got something even better! WSD is definately a must read. I'm surprised not many schools have this and Plague Dogs in thier library. It feeds my inner fascination with nature. This, Plague Dogs, and its movie adaption are definately underrated. I don't know many peaple whos read it. If you love WSD you will also love Plague Dogs which is more disturbing, but just as fascinating.NOTE: Im updating:) I just finished and I must say this is one of the best books I've ever read. When the story was over I felt like I just lost my best friend. You follow this group of characters, who are rabbits all the way to the end and when its older its sad, heartwarming, and beutiful at the same time. I came closer to crying reading this than I did watching the movie. This book just pushed the Warriors series out as my favorite fictionous nature book. Not only is it one of the 100 greatest animated movies, but 100 greatest books. This story just earned a new fan! I can imagine how Plague Dogs is."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I started reading this book already being a fan of the film. However although I think the film is excellent the book is better. The book has more to offer. Like most books which have been adapted to film, you can get more of an idea of the characters and their purpose from the book. Even if you know the story and certainly if you dont it should appeal to people of all ages. The rabbits are endearing and the story is exciting, funny and sometimes sad. The world of rabbits and the folklore created is just wonderful."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"nikki ferguson--Enjoyed this classic more as an adult then when I was in school. Favorite line, &#34;Silflay Hraka!&#34;"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first I was hesitant to read a book with all animal characters but my girlfriend really recommended it to me, so I began. I'm a firm believer in writing style and authors mattering more than the story itself. I'm not saying the story is bad - because it's a very good one - but the author's creativity and writing style are what I loved about this book. This is a very fun book to read and it's far more exciting than I expected a book of it's nature to be. I highly recommend for all ages - especially adults since it seems like it may be perceived as a book for the youth."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"most definitly a 5 star review. loved the book. brilliant mind to come up with this type of literary masterpiece. talking rabbits, that isnt a book for children. brilliant. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am reading Watership Down right now and Ithink its the best book Ive ever read.

I wascompletely immersed in the book for the month it took me toread it (it was pretty long for me at that age). I thoughtabout the story constantly, drew pictures of the characters,and even dreamed about them. When I finally finishedthe book, I started to cry. The ending is moving, yes, butI was crying for another reason as well: I was terribly sadto be at the end of such a wonderful journey. For a timeafter I finished, I experienced a strange emptiness. I hadalways been a voracious reader, but suddenly I couldn't findany books that satisfied me. Everything was rendered palenext to the beauty of Watership Down. I began searching for&quot;another Watership Down&quot; to read, a book that would be itsequal. I never found it.As I have gotten older, I've found that my admiration forthis novel has not dimmed at all. In some ways, I appreciateit even more as an adult.

I envy themthe experience of reading Watership Down for the first time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a novel you will never forget.

If you don't love this book, you are missing out on somemagic in your life!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is one of the most insightful and moving books you could ever read.The characters by creation are rabbits, but are human in nature and attitude. This storyis much more then a fantasy story about rabbits trying to survive, it invokes thoughtsin regards to how we as a society exist. Contained within it's pages are many of lifeslessons only acted out by rabbits rather then humans themselves. If there is one bookyou ever give to your children to read, this should be it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A perfect tale of innocence and the desire to improve one'slot in life.

I asked him what is it about, he said \\"Rabbits.\\" Me: \\"Rabbits?\\" Him: \\"Rabbits\\" Me: \\"Rabbits?\\" Him: \\"Yes, Rabbits!\\"In the end, I did not buy the book nor did I in the near future. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!When I finally did decide to buy and read the book, I was enthralled. Is there a perfect book/read? I don't know, but here's another story.I was reading Watership Down at work on a Friday. Time came to pack up for the day. After being half-way home I realized I forgot Watership Down. There was no way for me to go back and get it, and I was not going to be back at work for another two days. To make a long story short, I bought another copy of the book and finished it over the weekend.Watership Down is a remarkable book. BUY/BORROW IT."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I won't repeat the 700+ reviews for this book, but I do have some comments on the many 1 Star Reviews.I went through and couldn't believe all the one stars that were given to this book. Yes, it is about Rabbits. No, it is not a children's book. Yes, it does give detail descriptions about everything. These are things that make it GOOD. I read this book when I was in 7th grade (on purpose) and I loved every minute of it. The world that Richard Adams has created is one of masterful work. Maybe it's because my IQ is not below 75 that I love it. If you want just the story, watch the movie. If you want to read one of the greatest things in print today, get the book. Or if you hate reading, get the audiotape even and listen in the car. Trust me, if you go in with no prejudice, you will love Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"this book has a sort of hobbit appeal. you get to know the rabbits and love them in a very personal way. you feel like you can understand the meaning in their lives. hazel is such an admirable and lovable hero. the book transports and makes your heart soar."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When people ask me to describe &quot;Watership Down&quot; I inevitably say that it is a book about rabbits. More than that I cannot say without waxing long (which I can do in a review).Watership Down is a wonderful story on so many levels. There is an exodus and harsh journey, the dream of a good home and good life, the philosophical question of safety and long life vs. an exciting life and so many other things. The rabbits in this story are alien enough to be rabbits but the reader can still associate with them. We care about Fiver, Bigwig and Hazel as they go through their lives, which are so different than ours but still make sense. Their quest is for the same things that humans want - happiness.This novel is fantastic because it takes us to a different view of our world. It paints a portrait of animals weaving tales (the legends of El-Hariarah are one of the best parts of the novel). The dialogue and description are both fast paced, as is the action. Overall this is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read and will remain Richard Adams masterwork!As an end note, I cannot recommend any of Richard Adams other novels. Shardik was decent but the rest IMHO were endeavouring too much to make a point, haranguing on his own political crusade."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What's amazing about this book is that you can be anyone to enjoy it. If your a reader from the age of 13 to 95 you will find it hard to put this book down. The characterization of these rabbits are more multidementional than humans in most fiction. A well thought out, wonderfully paced book that will pass from generation to generation. Give this book to your children and grandparents alike. No one should miss the opportunity of reading this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A classic, is a classic, is a classic. Just because you were forced to read it in school and weren't smart enough to apply yourself, doesn't change the fact that it is a well deserving CLASSIC. I also notice that most of the people who disliked the book, couldn't even spell while submitting a review. Of course it takes imagination to fully appreciate any novel. It is a direct reflection of society. Perhaps if some of you who complain that it was a bore acted as some of the characters did, our society would not be the pitiful mess it is today-by the way...you harsh critics are all the narrow minded type, who would have perished in the old warren because you were too shallow to recognize good sense when you saw it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book when it first came out in the early 70's. I was just a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Working in my studio I love to listen to books on CD and I've been searching our local libraries for this book for a while. No one had it so I finally purchased it. I just finished listening to it and hated for it to end. I read all the other Richard Adams books, too, as a youth.I plan to listen to this book several times over the next few years, and then will likely donate it to our local library."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Who knew a story about rabbits searching for a home could be so moving, powerful and relatable?

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a surprisingly compelling story about a group of rabbits forced out of their home and made to find a new one, encountering hardships of various kinds and the usual archetypal heroes and villains along the way. The facts of the story are mundane in a human sense even while being important in a rabbit-ish sense. Yet, strangely, the story, characters, and developments are far more interesting than one might think they'd be, for being a story within the small world of rabbits. There's a significant amount of insight into people, their motivations, and morality along the way -- even if those &#34;people&#34; are rabbits in the story (distinctly rabbit-ish rabbits, at that). And the story is presented so beautifully, with excellent descriptions, backstory, and even legend and myth, as to be compelling even in the confines of a story about rabbits. I haven't read this book recently, but it continues to stick with me, both for having a highly interesting story and for presenting good &#34;literary value&#34;. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have read Watership Down twice and so enjoy this wonderful adventure of a group of rabbits leaving the only place they have known because one of the rabbits has a premonition of a horrible event about to overtake their safe and comfortable warren.

When I first saw how many pages it was, [497] I really didn't think I could read that long a book on talking rabbits. I was WAY wrong!!! This is the very best book I have ever read. It is about a band of rabbits who leave their warren [home] to search for a new one because one of the rabbits sensed that somthing bad was going to happen and wanted every one to leave. On the way they have many exciting, happy, and sad adventures. I like how none of the characters have the same personality. My favorite character would have to be Bigwig. I like the dialouge because it is a mix of English &amp; Lapin {rabbit language}.There is no obscene language so children of all ages can read it. I ended up thankful that it was so long because I just didn't want to put it down. I would sometimes stay up till 12:00 a.m. reading.

Aren't young peope taught about themes, imagery, symbolism, I mean, just plain how to appreciate a great book. One that is subtle, doesn't have themes jammed with a sledgehammer down your throat, that brings emotions out of you other than fright, sex, violence and disgust in the form of heavy gross-out parts? I mean many of the modern writers that we admire like King, Straub, Steel, Crichton, Grisham, Saul all read these classics, which helped them to become the best-selling authors that they are today.This book is wonderful, its got everything - Adventure, action (war, violence, blood and gore), horror, suspence, comedy, tradegy, magic, a little romance, mystery, unforgetable characters, morales, social values.Someone actually stole my dog-eared, missing cover, paperback edition (no, not because it was on a required reading list but just because it was pretty good), and I went mad, trying to get another copy.

His portrayal of rabbits with &quot;human traits and tendencies&quot; soared over the undiscovered frontier of literature with such freedom that no force of gravity could have this story suffer a swift and sudden fall from grace. The rabbits and their distinctive names and terms, and their legendary hero (El-ahrairah) were all characters within one of the most creative stories ever told. Just forget Brer Rabbit and Bugs Bunny; they're lone &quot;wolves&quot; who only get themselves into mischief, and don't believe in forming partnerships. They cannot compare to the wonderful way in which these rabbits stick together as they wander the wilderness throughout the story, enduring conflict with different societies, as they search for a new &quot;warren&quot; in which to run their lives after fleeing from a doomed society falling to the cruelty of mankind. It was very different to step out of man's shoes and see mankind through the eyes of rabbits. Never before have I read such a beautiful story with such a universal appeal. I believe that this should be read by all students in school who are able to read at the level at which it is written, and young and old folks alike should get as much enjoyment from it also. It touched my heart and made me value respect for all God's creatures living together on the earth that He made for us. Thank you, Mr. Adams, for reminding us all that rabbits, like humans, need to use earth's resources to survive also. Now, if only someone would write a story about life seen through the eyes of...say, eagles, an endangered species."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The first time I read this book I was in the seventh grade. I am now almost thirty years old, and it still remains the most enjoyable novel I have ever experienced. This story has everything a reader would want in a bood; adventure, suspense, romance, and betrayel, all the while maintaining a certain amount of mysticism. Yes, the characters are rabbits, which may not seem credible to most readers at the start of the novel, but very soon into the story you begin to realize this is not just a tale about bunny rabbits. It is a tale about a small group of wanderers forced to flee the only home they've ever known. Once out in strange and unfamiliar country, they must rely on each others strengths and capabilities in order to survive and build a happier, sturdier future. Along the way, they encounter all kinds of enemies, from foxes and dogs, to man and all of his unnatural creations, to the mos evil enemy of all, that of their own kind. You will be forever moved and touched as you follow the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver and their friends. I can't imagine anyone coming out unchanged after reading the incredible story of the rabbits of Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I am up to page 400 and I still do not see why everyone is raving that this book is one of the best books of all time. I understand that it must be an alagory for something, but what? What keeps me going while reading this mandatory book is the number of pages that I have passed, and the hope that it will all be worth it when I finally get to the &quot;sad ending.&quot; What I do not like, though, is how most readers are stating that if you do not understand the book you are a shallow person. Some books I feel are difficult to read through and to understand completely, and I don't think that those who have a hard time with it should be put down. Perhaps I will feel differently when I myself finish the book, but that is my feeling at the present time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I know that I already wrote a review, but it was mainly for the review contest. I felt that I needed to write something inresponse to the very few people who could stoop to write that it was poor.Anyone who does not read a whole book has no buisness reviewing or giving a critique on it. You cannot say that this book wasn't exciting considering that most of the time thier lives were in danger and that there was a huge batte filled with suspense.I honestly doubt that there is a giften and talented class out there that would have a hard time reading this book. Maybe it just isn't a very bright class. People that are intelligent understand the true ability of the write and excellent story plot. My father read this to me when I was in fifth grade and I was enchanted with it. I could not bare to put it down every night and I have read it many times since. This is the best book ever written for young and old. IT's a true classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Interesting beginning -- not easy to read on a casual basis -- often I was sidetracked by the numerous \\"created\\" words for rabbit language -- Perhaps I will try once again later -- many other reviewers raved about this book -- I must be missing something .."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'd always heard that this was one of those must read books. A classic of English literature. Yet, despite being repeatedly told to read it no one could ever explain to me what the book was about. I'd get some vague synopsis of rabbits, coming of age, environmentalism, tyranny, etc. I could never fit together just how all of that was suppose to come together in a book with rabbits as the central characters. I got my hands on a cheap copy of the book, still not sure if I wanted to read it, and dove in. It turns out that Watership Down is a good book. I think though that other books do what Adams was attempting better. The story in Watership Down reminded most of the Lord of the Rings, just with rabbits and more expository lore. I think Tolkien did it better too. Think high fantasy with rabbits. I came away slightly disappointed. Not because Adams failed to engage me, rather my friends and acquaintances had failed to accurately portray the book to me and in so doing inflated my own expectations."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"\\"Watership Down\\" is one of my all time favorite books. I never thought a book about English rabbits could be as thrilling, meaningful, and multilayered as \\"Watership Down\\" is. It is very Englishy, and I personally love everything English, but if you think that would keep you from reading this book under normal circumstances, please, please perservere! There is so much to be gleaned from this classic novel. It was written as every story should be written: for the sheer love of story-telling. Also, it follows the pattern of many other hero-journey stories, but it doesn't stop there--there are more stories to be had after reaching \\"Watership Down\\". Intertwined with the story are both Rabbit Language and Rabbit Mythology. Richard Adams is a great author and spinner of yarns. Please read this book. It is so awesome. Don't let the fact that it is anthropomorphic, or considered \\"children's fiction\\", or got a bad review from \\"nicegirl\\", who clearly missed the point, which was probably miles and miles above her head in the first place, prevent you from reading this amazing novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is clearly the finest book ever written. Period. The stories within the story, i.e., the El-Ehrairah tales, as related by Dandelion, the master storyteller, are as good as, or better than, anything I've read. And yet, in this book, they are a mere aside -- a bonus. That's how great this novel is. What a joy it was to re-read it at age 40, savoring elements I undoubtedly missed at age 14. These rabbits are more endearing and more engaging than any human characters I've read about. No one could come away from this book without a reverence and friendship for Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry, Holly, Silver, Pipkin, Kehaar and of course, \\"Meester PigVig.\\" Even the annoying Bluebell is likable by book's-end. Finally, the way Adams has the storytelling doe interwine El-Ehrairah and Rabscuttle tales with the \\"real\\" stories of Hazel-Rah, Bigwig and Fiver is nothing short of genius. If you read Watership Down before, read it again. If you have never read it, please run to your nearest library and get it now. It is pure \\"flayrah\\" from page 1 to page 481. Long live Hazel-Rah!Also, read a more recent Adams tale, The Outlandish Knight. Another gem from the master."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"this is my favourite book i have ever read. and i've re-read it several times, every few years or so.it is exciting, charming and interesting. i recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book, so loved by scholars, has an equal appeal to those of us who just plain love a good story well told. Mr. Adams's rabbit characters are at once alive, interesting, and believeable. It took an amazing art to wind this woodland story into the sophisticated, complicated novel it is. Hats off to this modern classic, and may we all grow to be as wise as Holly."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is about a group of young male rabbits forced to leave their warren, and set out a journey of bravery, courage, and survival. The charismatic characters and thrilling action lead the rabbits on an interesting journey.The main character in the book is a rabbit named Hazel. When Hazel's brother, Fiver, predicts a danger at their current warren, Hazel gathers other young rabbits willing to flee to establish a new warren on their own. On their journey, they are attacked by rats at a farm, must cross a river, and come to a warren with a false sense of security.With every single obstacle, the rabbits come closer to each other and trust more what each rabbit has to say. When the rabbits finally meet their destination, a hill called Watership Down, they feel they have found a home.The rabbits need to find does so their warren will be secure for future generations. They have to go to another warren to get some of their does. They face a dictator, General Woundwart, and win a battle for the does. I believe this book is appropriate for ten year olds through adults. The obstacles faced by Hazel and his friends represent obstacles that people face throughout their lives."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The primroses were over...and,...where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.

For that, I am forever thankful...I have re-read this book probably a dozen times in the last 25 years and each time I am amazed by the story.

You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":". . . it might be. It's all right for children, but is not a children's book. A novel involving a society of rabbits. They interact with other rabbits, other animals, and people. As you would guess, the behavior of the rabbits is metaphorical for the ways in which people often interact with and treat each other. A masterpiece. If you haven't read it, you've got a gaping hole in your reading resume. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is typically billed as a children's classic, but I would recommend it for readers of any age who can appreciate epic adventure, deep and fascinating characters, and a true sense of suspense and conflict that is not easily come by.Whenever a friend of mine is looking for reading recommendations, one the first things out of my mouth is, \\"Have you read Watership Down?\\""},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"As always being an very avid bookworm, (even long before kindergarten) I hereby state that anyone who has not read or who doesn't own this superb novel should either be arrested or deemed to pay a very high fine!! (Lol! just kidding!) At 30 years of age, I remember vividly reading this novel as a freshman in high school for English on a mandatory basis. I was immediately spellbinded from start to finish. Gloriously written with the use of very picturesque words which ignite happiness, fear, and sorrow, this novel is truly indeed one that is not meant to be banned or ignored. Even though it illustrates life and the world as viewed from animalistic perception, please DO NOT immediately assume that it is a children's book! In reality, it is meant for anyone who is 12 years of age and over."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, authored by the legendary Richard Adams is a masterpiece of human intellect, thoughts, and writing. This long (492 pages) yet fly-by book is full of action, courage, compassion, teamwork and friendship. The book starts with a clang of worrysome rabbits escaping their home-town burrow due to a virtual bunny-psychic having premonitions of something \\"bad\\". The group, headed by their pinnacle of a leader Hazel is soon on their way throughout the contryside. The \\"elements\\", death, which way to go, animals and the pounding thought of \\"is this worth it\\" linger around the clang of rabbits throughout the endeavour. The clang stumbles on other civilizations of rabbits, rivers and more but their spirits are boosted when they find an abandoned burrow they call the \\"Honeycomb\\" and their new home. They also have to fend off another civilization led by the sinister General Woundwart attacking their burrow and they meet a clumsy, stupid yet helpful seagull named Keehar. This stunning book is certainly enjoyable- as I've read it 3 times. This great novel has entertained millions of readers worldwide and will indefinately cntinue to do so for millions more. Ignore the uneducated common remarks of \\"Oh that book is SOOOOOO Boring\\", those people MUST have read a completely different book. Richard Adams uses great vocabulary from cover to cover. I have yet to read the sequel- Tails From Watership Down. Will it live up to the standard of its predecessor- only time will tell!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The main characters of Watership Down may be fluffy little bunnies, but the novel should not be written off as a children's book. It has enough danger and drama to keep the pages turning until you realize in disappointment that you have reached the last one. At the same time, it has something more to offer. Beneath the bare bones of the plot, an unseen hand paints a charming portrait of the English countryside in the green and yellow tones of midsummer. These pastoral images are all the more enchanting when seen through the eyes of a rabbit, and the more you read, the more you actually begin to think like one. At the first sign of danger, a rabbit's instincts tell him to go underground, into the safety of the earth. This is the more subtle message of Watership Down - reconciliation with Mother Nature. Out on the down with Hazel-rah and the rest of the warren rabbits, simple days yield simple pleasures. Happiness is found in the warmth of the sunlight and the lazy hum of the bees in the tall grass. Nothing else is needed, except a friend or two to share the moment. This is the message that Richard Adams has conveyed through his skillful painting of words."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Many have described and debated this incredible novel, but I am here to tell you one thing and one thing only. This book is incomparable and will haunt you lovingly for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The story just takes you along on each adventure each rabbit experiences. Your emotions ride the roller-coaster till the very end.The movie was also excellent!!Once you read this, it will stay with you forever!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is amazing, you could read it for hours, and it takes rabbits to a whole nother level. 481 pages just isn't enough in this book, and has quickly become my personal favorite. I don't understand how anyone could dislike this book. If you don't buy this book, you will deffinatly be missing out. This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My mother read this story to me when I was about nine. I've re-read it several times, and even seen the movie (yes, there is one). Who would have thought a story about a bunch of rabbits could be this good?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This was a real page turner. It was especially exciting when the author gave you a red herring throughout the book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my all-time favourite book. I first read it when I was 8 years old and I couldn't put it down! The characters are really well described and when your only a couple of pages into the book, you feel as if you have known them all your life. My favourite characters are Pipkin, Blackberry and Acorn. He tells it realistically, like when he writes about the wood floating on the water, rabbits might not really understand that in real life. He also points out how hard a rabbits life is and the dangers they can face and what they might think of other objects.The secenery is really well described and that makes it seem real. I went up to Berkshire, near where I live, to see the place that Richard Adams based the book on.Its worth the visit.The second book and the video are great to. Check them out if you have'nt already!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This epic about a traveling band of rabbits is a classic. Rarely can a writer write about animals that is INTERESTING as well as FACTUAL. Bravo, Richard Adams!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is great. I would read this book after you see the movie. There are a few things in the book that wasn't in the movie and very few things that was in the movie that isn't in the book. It's great. I also have Tales of Watership Down which I haven't read. I also have the movie which is great too. Even though some of the words are confusing but I like how that there is a dictionary in the back of the book so you know what the words mean. It's a great book and something always happens!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I won't go off and say that this is simply the best novel ever written. I will say, however, that this is an outstanding novel. If anyone wants to enjoy a well-told and captivating story with classic story-telling elements then I strongly suggest they pick this up. It's quite humorous to read the comments of those who gave it one star. Not only is allegory lost on a portion of them but they don't seem to want to accept a different culture. &quot;The predators are portrayed as evil&quot;. Well, this story is being told by the rabbit's point of view. Therefore, anyone who wants to kill/eat the main character is naturally going to be viewed unfavorably. Honestly, think of something else except for neadless nit-picking. I love how some readers are disgusted by the idea of &quot;hraka&quot; or feces. Get over it. It's part of life. Rabbits don't absorb everything into their body without needing to pass &quot;hraka&quot;.Anyway, it's very good and I suggest you read it. Don't make the mistake of passing up such a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Adams has outdone himself here. He spun a tale of rabbits having voices and talking amoung themselves. He tells of the troubles that they endure adn the dagers they conquer. This is a very detailed story that should be read by every person who has a feel for good, quality books. This book comes highly recommended by myself, my friends. (and my English teacher!)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it. It is extremely well written and you can tell that the author has done tremendous research on rabbits. I have always believed that animals shouldn't be hunted for fun or for money. In the begining, I wondered why Hazel and his band of rabbits were so afraid of humans and then I realized that we have done this ourselves. We have made rabbits afraid of us because of the way we treat them. This is not always the case. Later in the book there is an act of kindness by a human to a rabbit. While reading this, I became part of the world of Hazel, Fiver, Pipkin, Bigwig, Dandelion, Blackberry, and others. The book is so descriptive that it can do that to you. It starts out with Hazel and Fiver frolicking through the warren in which they live. Fiver begins to get one of his bad feelings. This time it is for the rabbits to immediately leave their warren. Only some choose to leave, but for the others there only lies trouble. The rabbits set out on a journey that will certainly change, but maybe end their lives. Where will they live? Who will they meet? Will they ever find out what happened to their old warren? I was able to read this in a week, so it is not very difficult."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the worst book I have ever tried to read in my entire life. I could barely get past the first 100 pages. If you are thinking about reading it-don't. Despite critic's ranting about how great this book is suppose to be, I think if you read it, you will find your opinion to be contradictory to these statements. It should be taken off all required reading lists. It is pure torture to endure, and is a poor excuse for a piece of literature."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"400 pages of talking rabbits.........who run into the same problems over and over and over and over again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm not a native English speaker and found the English difficult from time to time but WHAT A GREAT BOOK!

The perfect rhythm, the perfect characteristics, I couldn't praise it enough!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this novel when I was in the fifth grade. I was immediately sucked into the world of Hazel, Bigwig and Fiver. I was utterly enchanted by the story at the time and I have to admit General Woundwort scared me the first time I read this book (lol). I've read this wonderful book every year since then and with each reading I find myself whisked away to the world of these amazing little rabbit-characters--an escape from the pressures of real life. Each time I read it I take something new away. I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for something different than the usual horror, romance, supernatural thriller, or mystery. I hope you enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would give this book anything less than five stars. It is one of my favorite books of all time, and I am an avid reader. Put it away for a couple of years, and then read it again. You'll love it even more."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This has been one of my favorite books for years. It's fairly impressive how the author was able to make talking rabbits keep so many of their \\"rabbit-like\\" characteristics and oddities. His ability to make the seemingly simple world of rabbits seem so dark is also one of the things that makes me love this book. Overall, it's an impressive piece of work.This item in particular seems to be of good quality. The book and its dust jacket came with no defects that I've noticed, and the construction also seems to be quality."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I picked up an old dog-eared copy this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade at a yard sale. The lady selling it said that I wouldn't like it that much. It sat at home for the longest time until I was in 7th grade English class. There was this one particular section in the text book we had that intrigued me. It was various excerpts from the book that was part of a lesson on punctuation. After reading and rereading that particular chapter many times over it sparked a long forgotten memory. I had this book in my possession.....I must read this book. So the first thing I did when I got home at the end of the day was run into my room and dig out that forgotten dog-eared paperback book. It was at the point that I was in love with anthropomorphic stories and Watership Down in particular. For a week I read that book in between classes, in study hall, and on the bus. By the end of the book Watership Down had become a immediate all time favorite of mine. I have since reread my old copy of the book until the cover fell off and the book fell into 3 pieces. It's still stashed in my book case cover and all.Now at my age I was an advanced reader. But I wouldn't suggest Watership Down to a kid younger then 4th grade unless they are an advanced reader. Some scenes are rather graphic and detailed. If I remember right I just about lost it during study hall when Bigwig was in the snare....I thought he was about to die and I was on the edge of tears. If you have a middle school aged student who loves to read (especially Redwall) I am quite sure they would enjoy Watership Down. I would also highly suggest this book to any high school student or college student that must write a book report. Why not read something that is interesting and has plenty of themes to explore.I would love to own either a Kindle edition or a nice hardcover copy of this book for my little collection of favorite childhood classics so that it can sit between White Fang and Redwall. Sadly the Kindle edition is rather over priced when compared to others and the actual dead tree format."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Most people say this is a sad book, I personally love it!! It felt very relaxing and soothing to read such a well written book of the world of rabbits. I really love it and I think a teenager would be suitable in reading it, I don't see this as a book for a young child."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Once again Richard Adams immerses the reader in the realm of the animal world. His ability to portray. with honesty and understanding, is at its finest in this tale."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is phenomenal. It was read to me when I was a child, and I have since returned to it as an adult. It is the Lord of the Rings of animal stories; Adams creates an entire world, complete with languages and mythology unique to the animals themselves. The characters are rich and varied, and they each have their own function/role within the story. The story itself follows the classic hero arc, but it is entertaining and surprising despite that (and it is a classic for a reason). This story is a must read for adolescents/young adults and adults alike, particularly for animal lovers. It is not one you will soon forget. It is hard to find anything negative to stay about this story - it is a bit long, and at times is not the easiest reading, but it is important to remember that it was written decades ago. All in all the story is extremely engaging, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It's kind of sad that I have gone as far in my life and have never read this book. I, like I'm sure many others, have heard of the title in the lists of great children's literature. But I am so pleased that I have finally had the opportunity to read it. Upon opening it was I immediately drawn into the incredible world of rabbits as imagined by the author. There's so much fact, but it's dressed up with the magic of animal government that has been successful in so many stories. This is a method that works.The story involves a group of rabbits who, upon discovering their warren won't last much longer, leave to start their own. Lacking females, they decide to ask for does from a nearby warren, only to find themselves in battle with rabbits very different from their own.The characters are richly imagined and richly detailed. Entire rabbit cultures and mythologies are built up. This is an adventure story in the truest sense and I am thrilled to have finally read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"As C.S. Lewis once said, \\"Sometimes fairy stories say best what's to be said.\\"Great stories have the capacity to shape us in a way that few other things can. They give us characters who exhibit virtues worthy of emulation. They show us how to persevere in the face of conflict, against villains, nature, and our own fears and failures. They inspire us to dream big, and to pursue our dreams against all odds.In Watership Down, Richard Adams has given us a fairy story of the highest order, and one that would certainly have pleased Lewis and his friends. Indeed, it now occupies a space on my bookshelf alongside The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, and The Man Who Was Thursday. Like those books, it is sure to be pulled off the shelf many, many times!Would you believe me if I told you that this epic adventure full of heroism and suspense was a story about rabbits?Whereas most fairy tales immerse us in a place outside our own world, this one actually re-introduces us to a world we already know well (Watership Down is a real place in rural England), but in a totally different way. Told from the perspective of a colony of bunnies, this typical countryside is transformed into a vast and alien place! The several brief glances into the bizarre world of men add to the realism of the story, while often providing a chuckle as well (how would you describe things like cars, cigarettes, and boats if you had never seen them before... and you were a rabbit?).Besides the completely believable setting, Watership Down contains another vital element to a great fairy tale: well-rounded characters to whom readers can relate. Hazel, the main protagonist, lacks remarkable wit, intelligence, or strength, but possesses key leadership qualities, such as kindness and the ability to delegate authority and trust his friends. Bigwig is the impetuous sidekick who is good in a fight and loyal to a fault, but whose rash decisions often backfire. Blackberry sees the world differently; he can figure out how stuff works, and can devise a plan for just about any scenario. Bluebell is the jokester; Dandelion the storyteller. General Woundwort is a wonderfully detestable villain, but even he occasionally draws the sympathy of the reader.To round out the tale and draw readers fully into it, Adams has provided the rabbits with their own language (the book includes a Lapine glossary) and history. One of my favorite elements of the book were the stories-within-the-story, often told by Dandelion. Rarely do these stories actually advance the plot, but they reinforce the power of storytelling itself. They also reveal what passes for the rabbits' \\"religion\\", including a creation myth (complete with a \\"Fall\\" after El-ahrairah, the first rabbit, angers Frith, their \\"God\\") and an afterlife for rabbits who have \\"stopped running\\".A reader could enjoy this novel on many levels. As a simple story (which is all Adams ever claimed it to be), it is a pure pleasure to read. Yet, as with any truly great story, there is much to ponder here. As they seek to make a new home for themselves, the nomadic heroes encounter two vastly different rabbit civilizations, each portraying a society that has in some way sacrificed liberty for security, health, and wealth. The moral dilemmas our heroes face are familiar ones; how might we react in similar circumstances?Whether for intellectual fulfillment or \\"mere\\" reading pleasure, I commend this book to you highly. Tolkien's mark of a \\"true\\" fairy story was a sense of joy imparted upon readers. Watership Down certainly meets that criteria!\\"Far more powerful and poignant is the effect [of joy] in a serious tale of Faerie. In such stories, when the sudden turn comes, we get a piercing glimpse of joy, and heart's desire, that for a moment passes outside the frame, rends indeed the very web of story, and lets a gleam come through.\\" ~ J.R.R.

But Watership Down is neither -- it is a wondrous, deep, exceptionally written book about rabbit society that could have just as easily been written about people, and in a certain sense is exactly that. No less sweeping than Dune except, you know, with rabbits, this is a book that is surprisingly intense, remarkably insightful and brilliantly clever. Even if you have not a whit's interest in fantasy, warfare, societal analysis or, um, rabbits, you should read this book. It will surprise you, engross you and (most importantly) entertain you."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Can you imagine having the power to tell the future, good or bad? What would it be like to know that someone is trying to capture and kill your community? Can you picture moving from place to place? Well, that's what happens in the fantasy book Watership Down by Richard Adams. If you love rabbits, fantasy, and wonderful characters this book will be great b for you.Fiver is psychic and he can see the future. He saw a vision of humans destroying the rabbits warren, so the rabbits flee. Hazal is the small leader of the rabbits, he helps them astoblish a new home called Watership Down. The male rabbits realize they need does from another warren to mate with. They try to steal the does, and they are successful. Eventually, after a long journey the rabbits settle down in their new warren.When I was reading this book I kept thinking, '' Is this book ever going to be over ?'' I got so bored of reading five hundred pages about bunnies that have to find does to mate with. however I like how each chapter started with a poem. I thought the author did a great job dragging the story on and on and on... When I finished the book it was a great accomplishment, because I wanted to STOP reading after two pages into the book.I would recommend this book to people unlike me, people who like fantasies that go on and on and on... I think this book is for older people, or an audience who doesn't get bored by five hundred pages about rabbits that go on a very, very long journey. And I think there are people who will like this book.By the Best"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"this book is HORRIBLE, i had to read it for school, other than that i would have never read this 495 page Bunny Book, i don't recomend it for anyone who gets bored w/ small details, and boring writing, so please DO NOT waste your money on this book!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Although Richard Adams's writing talent is evident, this book is NOT a great reading experience, especially if you like to read books where any action whatsoever takes place. This is a good book to assign a mature, insightful person, not a kid. Even in a gifted and talented class in school only three people were actually able to finish it (I was one) and only ONE person (a boy who enjoys reading classics and loathes suspense and excitement) liked it. Dull, dull, dull."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"too much about fake stuff. had to read it for school. failed all of my tests because it was the worst and most boring book I have ever read!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I was a little girl my mother read this story to me.

For lovers of middle school fictions, bunnies may excite you. Though mature and readers searching for a more challenging read should find some other novel to try on."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book, by Richard Adams, was piontless. I was forced to read this for my Senior English class and I feel that it was the biggest waste of my time. I would only suggest this book to those who have nothing to do except to read about bunnies. There are many &quot;bunny&quot; terms that make the book hard to understand, and it is pointless. Watership Down is only for those who enjoy bunnies and Frith."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the worst book ever. Do not read it. I pity those like me who have been forced to read it. I was bored out of my mind. Who ever heard of talking and fighting rabbits anyway?

This book is not recomendable at all!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book full of pitiful and weak character. This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke. If you like reading about a weak, horrid, dull, whiny, annoying and above all...pitiful female character with no soul, passion, or feelings but greed, this is the book for you.Watership Down is one of the worst books with animals as main characters I've ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a story about totally ordinary rabbits. For all we know, all rabbits may act like these when confronted with difficult situations, only we have not noticed. Maybe they travel in slightly bigger groups and are slightly more fearless than we're used to seeing, but there's nothing that differentiates these rabbits from those that live in your backyard. This story takes place in a totally ordinary setting in the author's part of rural England. The imaginative part of this novel is how the various rabbit characters interact during their exodus from their native warren until they find a new home.The prophecy of Fiver, the resourcefulness of Hazel, the strength of Bigwig, these are the characteristics that keep the Sandleford rabbits moving even as they encounter enemies in the form of dogs, foxes, men, and the dreaded automobile. The name of the legendary patriarch of all rabbits \\"El-ahrairah\\" says it all - in Lapine, it means \\"he of a thousand enemies.\\" During their journey, the rabbits tell stories of his cunning to keep themselves and the reader entertained.This book is for everyone. Its insights on trust, friendship, and community are priceless. It is filled with adventure, suspense, ingenuity, and humor. Rabbit behavior is true to nature, according to R. M. Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit. The reading level is not complicated, and there is a glossary for those of us who don't speak Lapine. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I admit I was reluctant to begin at first, and the book was boring, but after 100 or so pages I was completely hooked. The suspense is amazing and it's just a wodnerful adventure, if you can keep from getting distracted. The imagery is splendid and the mix of tragedy, action, and those awesome El-ahrairah stories just made it thoroughly enjoyable for me. There's a reason this book is a legend for nothin, people."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Great literature is one that inspires the imagination. This book does that by taking a world we think we are familiar with and turning it into an adventure in which you end up relating to the characters in a way not thought possible. This is a fantastic book and, I feel, a classic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this when I was perhaps 8 for the first time. I see all these young people on here saying how boring and 'detailed' it was, and I want to shake my head because it's a shame they can get bored at a book that IS so detailed.It's a book about talking rabbits?No. Sure, the main characters are rabbits that have their own language, but the themes, subjects and concerns of these 'talking rabbits' should strike home to anyone that has the imagination and insight to get past 'lol omg talking rabbits!'.To this day, this book remains one of the most haunting, touching, and -humane- novels I have ever read. I pick it up every couple of years for a re-read, and it never fails to affect me profoundly in some way.I also was so enthralled with the story as a child (it is fair to say this book is a 'hard' read for kids under 10 or 12, but it can be done for someone who loves to read and think beyond Harry Potter-class stories) that I had a pet rabbit named General Woundwart."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Since I don't own rabbits nor do I like rabbits, I was suprised to really enjoy this book. I always find it interesting when an author uses animals to craft a very human story. It involves fath, friendship and cooperation plus so much more. These rabbits are shown that freedom is worth fighting for, and it really is inspirational. Read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"We often wonder if animals communicate and this book allows you to put those thoughts into a fantasy reality. A great adventure story that will make you laugh and cry."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When a friend mentioned that he was in the midst of reading a book about the adventures of rabbits, and suggested that I pick it up - I kind of scoffed at the idea. Rabbits? Adventure? Yeah, right.Yeah. He was right. This story of a few brave rabbits that choose to leave their home rather than suffer a terrible fate was not easy to put down. In search of a new warren and a new life, Hazel and his band of rabbits face some serious adventure that most certainly matches up against that of any trendy teenage wizards.They are cunning, they are clever, and although they didn't all get along at first, these rabbits grow to appreciate what each character brings to the mix. As a reader, you'll appreciate them too... They are alive, and they are intent on risking it all to thrive in a new place.After finishing the book I was left with the feeling of total satisfaction that only one of the greats can deliver. Filled with legendary heroes and evil villains alike - I am embarrassed that I ever wondered if rabbits could raise the bar.Read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember reading this over a period of about a month when I was in 7th grade and as soon as I finished it I went out to buy a copy of my own. This is one of the 3 best books I have ever read. It is about as mall group of rabbits whose regular home gets burned and demolished because of a new settlement being built. They escape and go on a long journey and come across many circumstances (good & bad) to try and start their own colony elsewhere. They lose or almost lose a bunch of their friends, pick up new friends (not just rabbits) and go to war with another rabbit colony all in the process of trying to start a new life and colony of their own. That's a brief review of the book but I don't want to give the story away too much, Get the book and read it you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I loved this book, and I was sad to see it end. It is a moving story of a group of rabbits leaving their home because of a forthcoming danger, and head out to find a new home. Hardships along the way, but also many chances for the rabbits to prove their courage.There really is no way to describe how much I loved this book. If you are looking for a captivating adventure, this is the book for you. It holds you from page one, and each character, though rabbits, and other animals, is very real and defined, with various personality traits that are recognizable in humans. I see this as a fable for humans to follow in some ways on courage and perseverance, and friendship and love.Good for all ages, this would be a wonderful book for a family our friends to share together."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"We first read Watership Down the week it came out in the 1970's, thanks to some advance buzz from people who had picked up copies in England or Canada. We were hooked from the first page by this allegorical novel that uses rabbits to explore the concepts of leadership, courage and survival. In particular, it was enjoyable to read the mythological tales that the rabbits told at the end of the day. Adams wrote so beautifully of the Hampshire countryside that we were compelled to visit Watership Down when we went to England in 1975. The pictures we took there can be seen at http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/libraries/tballard/literary.htm .This is a special book for anyone who wants a good adventure combined with a serious message."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams does a spendid job portraying the struggle of a group of rabbits in search of a place to thrive when their previous home falls prey to the actions of man. It is an enjoyable read, he presents a well thought out world for these creatures, and he does a good job in showing us our world through their eyes. I strongly recommend it for any who are interested in our impact on our natural world and for those interested in reading about epic struggles."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"romping across the English countryside may seem like a walk in the park for us humans, but for the rabbits in Watership Down it's a life-and-death struggle to start a new life after the destruction of their own home. their travels grip the reader by vividly illustrating the dangers they face, from deadly foxes and weasels, to man-made hazards, or even facing off against fellow rabbits.Adams creates an entire culture around the rabbits, outlining their success (and failures) through the tales of heroic figures from the rabbits' past. these stories compel the rabbits to take risks that will allow them to secure a new home, and ultimately continue their peaceful way of life.the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the other rabbits are described through the distinct personalities and traits that Adams gives them. while their actions may seem anthropomorphic, their physical reactions are rooted in how real rabbits act in the wild.not for the faint of heart, this lagomorphian expedition will make you look upon common rabbits in an entirely different manner from now on."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"In Richard Adam's fantastic book, Watership Down, he shows the true life of rabbits with lots of great detail. After reading this book, we no longer think of rabbits as cute fluffy bunnies, but aggressive, wild animals, as Woundwort expresses, when he says \\"I told you once, that I would kill you myself.\\"Watership Down takes place in a field in England where a warren, or where a group of rabbits live. Hazel and his brother Fiver stumble across a sign in the field that says that the rabbits' home is going to be industrialized. To escape the danger of the land development, Hazel, Fiver, and a few other rabbits flee the field, trying to find a new place to live. Along the way, they meet a variety of friends and enemies, as they struggle to survive. Mixed in with the adventures of Hazel and his friends, are the tales of El-ahrairah, the infamous rabbit trickster.There are a lot of other interesting details in this book. The rabbits have their own language, for example, \\"silflay\\" means to feed outside, a \\"hrududu\\" is a car, \\"pfeffa\\" is a cat, and \\"elil\\" is enemies. The rabbit language makes it a little hard to understand the book, but there is a glossary in the back of the book. Another one of the interesting details in this book is all the animals that the rabbits meet. For example, the rabbits befriend mice and a gull that saves their lives more than once. The rabbits also encounter many vicious animals, such as a fox, cats, and a badger, all of which try to kill our brave rabbit heroes.We enjoy this book, although it's hard to figure out what the actual plot is because the rabbits seem to overcome what looks like the main problems quickly and easily, and there never seems to be a long-lasting main problem. This is a good book for animal lovers because there were at least fifteen different types of animals. Each different animal is captured with superb detail by Richard Adams. We like the book because it was very well written, and we would recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a extraordinary tale of exile and survival. It is a story of prophecy, heroism and leadership. This is an epic novel of a group of adventurers who desert their doomed existence, and venture forth against all odds on a quest for a new home with brighter horizons and a sturdier future. A remarkable journey filled with suspense, heart thumping escapes and sparkled with incredible vision. This book has quickly become a classic as it is a great story of literary depth and spiritual triumph. You will love every moment as you tremble through the trials and experiences of these beautiful characters, while you marvel in the wonder of this author's brilliance. Richard Adams has created an enchanting and beloved treasure with this one."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Once you get to the end of this book you'll probably go through all the pages at the back, desperately searching for more of it. If you don't read it, you're missing something. And who says the first 100 pages aren't good?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, by Richard Adams, is the best book I have ever read. It is a touching and suspenseful story that takes us into the minds and hearts of a warren of courageous rabbits fleeing their home.Although many people would think that this book would read like a fantastical fairy tale, it does not. Richard Adams simple, vivid, flowing writing forms a beautifuly woven tale of suspense and drama, terror and tragedy, love and joy. And despite the fact that the characters are animals, this author finds away to make them human and realistic, from the basic needs to their fated enemies.This story begins on a warm summer eve while the Sandleford warren is at silflay(grazing). It there goes to the bond and trust between two brothers, Hazel and Fiver, that lead them to round up as many rabbits as possible in order to flee their home in the face of danger. The story then takes you through the hills and forests and across the rivers on the course of their flight. The tale tells of their adventures and troubles that do not end even at the sight of their new home. From their new warren they must search and eventually battle a group of troubled and warlike rabbits in order to survive.This story takes you beyond the bounds of traditional imagination, into a world filled with understanding and balance with nature. It creates friendships and troubles for creatures that have so often been ignored in society. This classic has paved the way for many more that follow in it's wake. By all right this book should belong to everyone, young and old, and treasured as a classic to love and hold and to read over and over again. I present to you Watership Down, the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership DownThe book I choose to review is Watership Down, written by Richard Adams. If I were to rate this I would give it three stars. The reason for that is this wasn't the greatest book, but it also wasn't bad. Some of the good features of the book were the vivid details and the realism of the life of a rabbit. Other good sections of the book were the ones that contained fight scenes. The author described the battles so well that they were easy to picture. An example of a great battle was when Bigwig was in Efrafa and he had to fight the sentries and the Owsla so the does could escape. I also liked it when Bigwig fought General Woundwort in the Honeycomb. A part of the book that I didn't particularly enjoy was the beginning. I didn't like the beginning because all they did was travel. The book also started with so many characters and I didn't really know who they were. It took me a little while to understand all the rabbits' names and the language they use, Lapine. After the rabbits had just left the Sandleford warren, I wasn't too interested when they crossed the stream floating on a piece of wood or when they traveled thru the heather. From the time when Hazel and his friends left Sandleford and while they were traveling above ground, hlessi, I wasn't very interested in the book. The first time the book got interesting was when the travelers encountered Cowslip and his warren.The book I am currently reading is the latest Harry Potter book. Watership Down is very similar to it. They are both about the same length because Harry Potter has fewer words on a page. This book is like all the other Harry Potter books because they all have fighting and blood in them. Watership Down is also similar to another book I have read called the Hobbit. The two books are alike because they are both adventure books. All of the books I have listed in this paragraph all have one thing in common and that is that I enjoyed them all.Before I actually read Watership Down I thought it was going to be terrible because normally a book about rabbits would not interest me. It's safe to say that this book is far from terrible. Now that I finished this book I've realized it is actually pretty good. If this book would not have been assigned I most definitely would not have read it. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure books and doesn't mind a lot of fighting. To read this book you do need a lot of time because the book is long. Even if someone really doesn't enjoy adventure books or fighting I would still recommend it because it has a great message. The message given in this book is to not stop trying for something you want even in the face of fear and death. I would also recommend this book because it is great literature and always keeps a person interested. This is a great book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I'm in seventh grade, and I have read tons of books in my life, but this has to be the best. Throughout the entire book, the band of 11 hlessil(homeless rabbits)venture away from their home warren due to a fearful premonition by the small rabbit Hrair-roo(Fiver). Along the way, they run into friends and enemies, surprise and danger, in their search for a new home.Whether the rabbits are meeting new creatures or listening to stories of the great El-ahrairah, experiencing the likes of the outrageous seagull Kehaar or battling head on with the forces of Efrafa, you will find something excellent. As their new leader Hazel-rah makes decisions with cunning where a human would break down and weep, they press on, searching for the ultimate life. And as they do so, Hazel-rah finds the greatest honor for any rabbit in any time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Nothing short of a masterpiece, \\"Watership Down\\" does for the English countryside what \\"The Jungle Books\\" did for the Indian jungles - and, like \\"The Jungle Books\\", should first be read in pre-adolescence but becomes even more profound upon rereading as an adult.We are immediately introduced to two of the three major characters of the novel. Fiver, a small rabbit prone to visions of the future, receives a mixed blessing - a horrendous vision of the destruction of his warren, as well as another of a promised land - a land of safety and security. Insistant that the whole warren must be evacuated post haste, he is assisted by his self-assured brother Hazel, who agrees partly because he has lived his whole life watching Fiver's visions come true and partly because he is becoming weary of the warren's inequality and wants a better life for Fiver - and by extension all the other rabbits who will never become members of the elite Owsla and face a rather bleak future. Their mutual admiration and devotion are the emotional center of the story.We are introduced to the handful of rabbits that they are able to convince to defect, most because of Hazel's influence or because they were discontented anyway rather than that they have faith in Fiver's visions at this point. Chief among them is Bigwig, a commanding Owsla member whose support is an unexpected surprise.As the story goes on, they face many natural and man-made perils, reach Fiver's Down, learn the fate of their original warren, attempt to create a just government and attempt to ensure the survival of their new warren by attracting does to immigrate (the original immigrants are all bucks)It all ends in a nailbiting climax in which Bigwig faces the evil fascist General Woundwort, who vows to personally kill him for spearheading a rescue of oppressed does and a buck from his warren; Fiver faces a quieter but no less gripping battle for his spirit when the realm from whence his visions come threatens to overwhelm him; and Hazel makes a desperate bargain with their god Frith, the personification of the sun.It's actually their more subtle traits that make the rabbits - and the book - so fascinating. We admire Bigwig for his bravery, but love him for refusing to attempt to become a dictator and - after a few hard-earned lessons in humility - acknowledging the merits of those superficially weaker than him. We admire Fiver for his courageous stands when he knows he's right - even when at one point it threatens his relationship with Hazel - but love him for his constant struggle just to remain sane in the face of an ability that might be a public treasure but is also an appalling personal tragedy. We admire Hazel for his heroism at Nuthanger Farm but love him for his integrity and political vision.There are moments of humor - particularly involving Bigwig's unusual friendship with a friendly, flamboyant seagull named Kehaar who's a favorite of fans among the supporting characters, but it's the vivid descriptions of the horrors of rabbit life that will haunt you once the novel is done; like the visceral description of the inevitable holocaust that Fiver predicted as well as more subtle terrors such as when Fiver tries to explain to Hazel that he isn't at all sure that the realm from whence his visions come is particularly friendly.An exciting, deep tale that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is probably my favorite book of all time. It's one of those remarkable books that manages to tie together the qualities that matter most to me. The plot is full of twists, the writing can't be beat, and the characters are incredibly believable. The rabbits are not so fictitious that they carry around swords and walk upright, but nor are they the boring, fluffy creatures one might imagine. They have a whole culture of their own, which includes Lord Frith (the sun) and a whole language called lapine (What? You thought rabbits were stupid? Silly you).The story starts with Fiver, a small rabbit with special kind of gift, who warns them that they must escape, because some great evil is coming. He only convinces a few, and they set out, wandering and vulnerable, onto a course that includes fear, hate, and tenderness. They meet some pretty twisted rabbits (which give ME the chills), and plenty of elil (enemies). One of the funniest points is when they're finally settled, happy on a hillside after days of traveliing unprotected, and they realize there aren't any females. Obviously this is another problem that leads them into yet more adventurous acts.While this book is wonderful, I've found that it's extremely difficult to convince someone to read a book, when you are forced to begin, &quot;It's about rabbits...&quot;. After the first sentence, they become uninterested.No really, listen! It's a GOOD book about rabbits..."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"but leaves me feeling empty, I miss them.

The type is large and clear. A wonderful introduction from Richard Adams tells us how the story was born. Wonderful art shows itself through out. The front cover almost feels like smooth leather, even though it is not. Full color picture on the front, on the spine, wonderful words of wisdom from the story on the back cover. No words can describe how beautiful this book is. If you're a fan of the story get it...don't even think about it. If you're just a lover of beautiful books for your library get it. This is wonderful and I can't wait to go on the journey once again with this wonderful band of rabbits. I can remember when Peter Benchley re released Jaws about a year before his death, in an introduction he told how Jaws never made it to number one on the NYT, because as he put it: \\"a man name Adams wrote this book about these pesky rabbits that just wouldn't budge to let me get to number one.\\" Tells you everything you need to know about this book. BTW it is not a story for young children. I would say age 11 and up, there is some violence and blood due to battles the Rabbits have. Would be a wonderful Holiday gift. And the price for this is FANTASTIC! So beautiful. It will go on the shelf with my other leather bound favorites. It's a good investment. One leather bound book I purchased on here for $20.00 two years ago is no longer available and is selling second hand for $1,000.00. Never know what could happen with this. Oh go on, you know you want to, go for it...you only live this life once."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This was a tough book to review. At first glance, some of you may question how could a book with life-like rabbits be an interesting read? It was an interesting read, no doubt about it, but the long descriptive runs took a toll on me. It was one of those books that I wish I could like a little bit more.The amount of characters in this book were tremendous! It was tough to follow all the rabbit's names and only near the end did I finally get accustomed to the warren present. Likewise, some of the names of the rabbits were so difficult to pronounce or read, but I pressed on because it was an enjoyable book.The story in some ways was overly descriptive for my taste. I'm more of a straight to the point reader and I love books that are fast paced. Watership Down, on the other hand, focused a lot more on the visual experience. It was great storytelling indeed, but like I said earlier, it was a bit too much for me.Overall, I'd recommend this book to those who would like a reading challenge. It wasn't that bad and I wouldn't mind reading it again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My daughter had to read this in English her Freshman year. She could not stand the book. This is a classic though and perhaps if she reads it again when she is older she will come to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Going into this book, all I knew was that it was a classic that was about talking bunnies. Now, I've never been a big fan of rabbits, but I decided to give this a try anyway. I mean a five hundred page book about rabbits? I had to see what this was all about.After the initial charm wore off, I was bored. I found all the rabbits to be interchangeable, and some of their folklore confusing. But, it got better as it went on, especially those final 200 hundred pages. I found some of their chapter-long fables distracting, as well as a sudden switch to the human world. There would be random comments about baseball or something to describe a situation, and it would draw me out of the story. I also didn't like the portrayal of does as just sex-objects, which would make me have less sympathy for the rabbits plight. I have to say, for the most part, I forgot they were bunnies. The writing was easily read, and it wasn't to hard to follow. If I was a tad smarter, I could figure out all the parallels between bunny warrens and human government, but I'm too lazy for that.Even though it is usually marketed as a young adult book, I think anyone can enjoy it. Overall, it was a enjoyable fantasy and quite epic."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"How anyone can not like this book or the characters is beyond me! Richard Adams manages to capture everyone's desire for freedom, love, friendship and doing away with bullies. He writes with urgency too, so that whether he's writing about a danger the rabbits are facing or telling a funny story you become caught up in the moment. Yes it's a story about rabbits, but it's so much more - those that can't see that aren't in touch with their inner child! Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is for people who like adventure stories. I first read it in high school and I still read it from time to time. You will fall in love with the characters. You will be transported into another world, a world filled with danger, myths and legends, a bit of humor, and excitement. If you loved books like \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\", you will love this book too."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a great book. Everybody should read it.

This is a great book for a family to gather around and read to each other."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is simply a good story to be enjoyed. Is it the best adventure story every written? no. Does it change the world? no. Do you find yourself absorbed in the tale enjoying all the emotions felt by the characters? YES. It is a great read with lots of heart and you find yourself cheering the little rabbits along. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story and has imagination that hasn't been tainted by the video game generation.

It was such a favorite that I reread it many times since then. I still see it the same way - an adventurous tale of survival against many obstacles and against all odds. A great addition to any child's (and adult's) reading list."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I bought this wonderful book as a gift for my fiancee. It's one of her all-time favorite stories, and our previous copy had pretty much disintegrated over the years of use.

Recommended reading, for sure."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Outside Reading Book ReviewWatership Down by Richard Adams is an entrancing, engaging novel that chronicles the adventures of a band of rabbits that, through personification, are given human qualities.In this novel, there takes place the journey of a band of rabbits, led by Hazel and his brother Fiver who leave their warren because Fiver, who seems to have an inexplicable sixth sense and exceptional instincts and perception, even for a rabbit, feels they are no longer safe there. After seeing a billboard near his warren, Fiver gets an uneasy feeling about the fate of his home and tells his brother that they must gather as many rabbits as they can and leave the warren immediately as he is sure that something horrible will soon occur there. Hazel then proceeds to gather a band of rabbits, comprised of those who believe Fiver and those who are discontent with their place in the hierarchy at the warren and want to leave. The rabbits endure many perilous adventures and eventually are able to form their own warren which right from its formation undergoes many trials.What I found fascinating about this book was Richard Adams's use of famous quotes and passages from historical works to start off each chapter. The quotes, if interpreted correctly, also help to foreshadow the events to take place in the chapter. Watership Down teaches many lessons and parallels many aspects of the human world teaching the rabbits about the outside world and themselves as well. The novel cultivates the overall themes of the book- leadership, trust and reality. Hazel leads the rabbits through many perilous dangers which lead to his companions' absolute trust in him and Fiver. The book also expresses the nature of reality, showing unfortunate facts such as (as Mr. Jepson would say) \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" and showing the sad fact the although animals kill for food and out of necessity, humans potential for harm is limitless and without compassion or thought. This is shown by the callous way in which the humans bulldoze and kill all the rabbits in a warren without mercy or thought so that they may build their houses. This is expressed by the rabbits with anger, \\"All other Elil (rabbits word for living creatures) do what they have to do and Frith moves them as he moves us. They live on the earth and they need food. Men will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals\\" It also, however, shows reality in a happier light highlighting the relationship of the rabbits extolling friendship and faith. What were very fascinating to me were the parallels of the warren Hazel and his band run into on their journeys, Efrafa to a totalitarian state, a communist state and an oligargic government; Efrafa is run very differently than other warrens, while many other warrens have a \\"monarchy\\" such as Hazel's home warren which is ruled by the \\"Threarah\\" or Chief Rabbit, or council in control, Efrafa are ruled over by General Woundwort, a rabbit who has fought for his power and maintains peace by absolute control. Woundwort issues strict schedules about when who can feed where and even marks and categorizes the rabbits. He rules using fear, and the same occurs in a totalitarian state where the dictator controls every aspect of the lives of his subjects. It had the same effect that Hitler had upon the German people, the atrocities and evils he committed were minimized, dismissed and covered up, but what he did for the German people was perceived as great, bettering their lives (if you were Arian of course) and making them feel strong and proud of the heritage. This nationalism was also felt by the rabbits of Efrafa who Hazel hears them praise, \\"Did you see his body? No. Did anyone? No. Nothing could kill him. He made rabbits bigger than they've ever been--braver, more skillful, and more cunning. I know we paid for it. Some gave their lives. It was worth it, to feel we were Efrafans.\\" In most other warrens such as Hazel's original home warren, the Chief Rabbit rules with the help of his \\"Ousla\\" or police which help to protect and serve, cultivating the Threarah's will, or in some other situations, protecting power with force. This parallels an oligarchy or the rule of the communist party in the Soviet Union in the late 1900's, as those in the communist party (which was ruled, along with the rest of Russia, by Stalin) enjoyed special privileges such as being able to shop at different stores.I thought that this book was extraordinarily well written and the lessons one learns from it are exceedingly important. Watership Down takes the triumphs and troubles of humanity and expresses them from a different point of view, with the result being an award winning novel about what one is truly capable of. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of twelve who appreciates a wonderful story and is able to read between the lines to interpret the true meaning of a work of art such as this. Five stars."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My 12 year old brother borrowed it from the library and left it in his room one day. I wandered in, picked it up, and could not put the book down for the next five hours. It was amazing. The rabbits were so real, the description so powerful and the storyline so moving. While it may not be suitable for younger readers (my brother said he didn't really understand it, and anyway it's a bit too long for him) everyone older will definitely be able to enjoy it. And they should, too. Honestly."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This novel was wonderful!

One of those rare books that holds your attention from start to finish, is hard to set down, and leaves you thinking about the story and its characters for days afterward. It surprised me that some of the folks who reviewed it did not see it as such, until I read closer and found that most of these were kids being &quot;forced&quot; to read it for classes.

It appeared to be, and was for about the first 100 pages, a rather dull book about rabbits. About the only thing I admired at first was the 'Lapine' language and the mythology which was a bit creative. The society of the rabbits was as would be expected- big means good. After they came to Cowslip's warren, things were interesting for a while, but then quickly became bogged down until they met Kehaar.

The characters are far more developed, and their personalities are far more unique (it seems every readwall characters name is martin or logalog) Most people i find who hate it were required to read it for school ( i said most not all) and perhaps they just didn't want to read it so they went in with a bad attitude.

The story itself is powerful: The lead character is Hazel, who starts out low in the hierarchy of rabbit society and unsure of himself, but through the course of the story, he rises to meet the challenges of leadership with compassion and sensibility, eventually leading his small band of rabbits to a new home they must then defend. I love Bigwig's big, brave heart and Fiver's courage. The author does a great job of creating a strong sense of 'rabbit society,' complete with language, mythology, and mannerisms.Really, if you haven't read this story, you need to."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adam's Watership Down is an amazing story of epic proportions worthty of El-ahraiah himself. It deals with a tale of great bravery, courage, and loss of a group of friends struggling to survive and find their home. The story follows the journey of Hazels, Fiver, and their many companions. Even though the subjects of the book are animals (particularly rabbits) instead of people, this novel doesn't fall short in any grade, in fact, it surpasses all the marks.The classic story begins with Fiver, one of the books main characters and a rabbit with what some would call psychic abilities, foresees a great danger heading to destroy his homeland. After warning all his neighbors and countrymen, only a few come with him on his journey to find a new warren, or home. Amongst those are Hazel, Bigwig and Blackberry. As the group journeys across the land, they encounter other rabbit countries and many elil, or enemies. They eventually find the fate of their old warren and go on many daring mission to help and protect their new home. Hazel and his friends even befriend a bird that helps them along the way.Watership is nothing shot of a truly astonishing, heroic, awesome story that is l more than worth its weight. At nearly 500 pages, some may be turned away by its large size, but every page is more than worth reading. The imagery and detail that this book provides really makes you feel like you are there, alongside the rabbits in their everyday struggle for survival.Read as the friends escape from crazy places where rabbits are much more like squirrels and dogs. Watch as they fight off cats and other elil in epic battles. Discover how they build up their new home, and if they can keep safe from enemy forces.Watership Down is a true classic story that will be treasured for many generations to come and will become a huge part of English history. It is truly one of the best books ever written and one that we can all relate to. A statement about his book, by the St. Louis Post Dispatch, said that \\"Everyone who can read English should read it.\\" This is very true, for it is a truly astonishing book. I can grantee you that Watership Down will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I bought this as a gift as I had read the book before and thought it would be a suitable present."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When Fiver has an ominous premonition that death will come to the warren, his brother Hazel leads a pack of willing bucks out into the wide world. Their journey takes them through challenges and strange encounters, and Hazel must grow to be a cunning leader that he may found and protect a better warren in a safer land. Although it requires a certain suspension of disbelief, Watership Down is remarkably faithful to the animals which inspire it. The constantly involving plot can make for slow reading, but on the whole this is an intelligent, compelling, strongly written work. I highly recommend it.Watership Down differs hugely from most anthropomorphic animal stories in that in that it remains quite faithful to its source. That is to say: these rabbits are rabbits. They do not wear clothes or cook meals in a kitchen; I'm not a rabbit expert, but it's clear that Adams has researched, and for the most part his depiction of rabbits and other wildlife is convincing. Sometimes the novel does stretch the suspension of disbelief--the rabbits don't have human lifestyles or intelligence, but there are still an unbelievable number of unusual rabbit behaviors, from singing and laughing rabbits to a militarized warren. Nonetheless, Watership Down is refreshingly realistic, and the story is all the more compelling for the fact that it could indeed occur in the country downs.As a novel rather than a concept alone, Watership Down is sometimes slow but largely skillful. The premise--that a group of disaffected rabbits leave one warren to found another--is only mere glimpse into the overall plot, which includes a journey across the countryside, dealings with two other unusual warrens, and a lengthy search for does. The plot is constantly unfolding and the book is quite long, and so it sometimes feels like slow going. Once the reader adjusts to the unfolding plotline, however, the book becomes easier to read--and it is remarkably well written. With thoughtful detail and a complex plot, lifelike characters and skillful writing, Watership Down is on the whole an intelligent and strongly written book. It is heavier fare than many anthropomorphic-animal stories, and it has some faults, but on the whole it's a joy to read, engaging and thought-provoking, with plentiful interpretations which will stand up to rereads. I was very satisfied, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down by Richard Adams is part fantasy, part children's book and all charming. This has become a true classic that is universally loved. Richard Adams first created Watership Down as an oral story for his two daughters on a long road trip. When he was finally finished, they encourage him to write it down in book-form as it was better than almost any book that he read to them each night.This story is about a group of rabbits. But unlike many fantasies, these rabbits don't do anything they wouldn't normally do except to talk to each other and other animals. Brother rabbits Hazel and Fiver live happily in Sandleford Warren, until Fiver has a premonition that something terrible is going to happen to their home. They convince a group of rabbits to flee Sandleford and seek a new and safer warren. The rabbits go through many travails and Adams details them all in great detail. Perhaps the most dangerous expedition involves the search for female rabbits to help populate their new warren. The rabbits have their own language, Lapine, and Adams provides a glossary of Lapine terms at the end. This edition also includes a new introduction where the author tells how he came to write this book.I'm not much of a fantasy reader, but I grew very fond of Hazel, Fiver and their companions."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"it didn't hurt that the edition i bought was the one by Puffin Books--the one with the cute brown rabbit sitting by the corner of the cover. i just couldn't resist smiling like a loon at the picture at times in between reading chapters, there were times i expected it to wriggle it's nose at me. and more often than not, i wanted to have a live one on my lap to cuddle whilst i was reading.i was tickled with the way Adams vividly portrayed the mannerisms of the rabbits especially in the company of their friends--when they touch with each other's noses, when they nuzzle and bump with one another usually for comfort and assurance, when they stop to nibble in a huddle, and even the way they heal another's wounds by licking it's fur. it's an endearing and refreshing look at the way these little critters presumably live their lives. there are no childish conversations with humans, no dressing up as humans, and certainly no aspirations to be human. they just are. and that's what made their adventures exciting and believable, you'd hardly notice that it's a pretty thick book.this novel explores so many aspects: deep friendship, unswerving selflessness, fierce bravery, and so on; not to mention the underlying currents of the often destructive human intervention in wildlife. i'm gratified to have met Hazel and his wily group. definitely one of the best i've read in a long while, in any genre."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"2nd time I've read this beautiful novel. It is captivating to the point of chores not getting done. You're there in the warren and you've become one of the family."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, a book that defies all normality in your normal about animals. The epic story of Fiver, a brave, second-sighted rabbit who predicts of a terrible danger that is about to fall upon the warren. As many of the rabbits doubt him, a few rabbits that do believe him follow him on an epic journey towards a place that is away from all danger, a promised land of sorts. Through out the perilous journey, the rabbits discover how to hold on together and find the place of their ambitions. Watership Down is a must read book, filled with adventure, romance (sort of), mythology, and lots more. It's Lord of the Rings with bunnies. Richard Adams is genius to manage to create a whole society of rabbits with their own language, religion, form of government, and human-like emotions. This makes \\"Homeward Bound\\" seem like a cake walk compared to what these rabbits have gone through. You must read Watership Down, it's like nothing you have ever read before. This book also has memorable characters, such as Kehaar, the white seagull who is the comedy relief of this book with his strange accent and tendencies to go off in a funny fit of rage or Bigwig, one of the rabbits who seems cold, but actually has a heart of gold. Watership Down, the book that is even too good for the kiddies to read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book beckons to me back to the England of Fiver and Hazel again and again.

I finished this book shortly after. Part fantasy, part fiction.... A very dense, complicated storyline that is fun to read. Memorable characters, memorable stories..., memorable book. I don't think that there's enough words to compliment this book, but it is certainly one of the best I've read.

Read it, because trust me, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When first being introduced to Watership Down I was nothing but skeptical. Talking rabbits seemed like a great thing to read if you had nothing better to do. I was dead wrong. I thought (at first) that I was wasting my time reading about talking rabbits. When I got into probally about the 3rd or 4th chapter I began to really get into the book. The bond between the rabbits is extraordinary. Their bond of friendship is unbreakable. Being a lover of many novels I highly recamend this classic. This story is unforgetable and is by far the best book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is entirely about and told from the point of view of rabbits. Don't laugh, it's definitely more than I bargained for when I first picked it up. A group of rabbits is evicted from their warren and must find a new home. Traveling is not easy for rabbits because they are so skittish and nervous. In their travels, this troupe of rabbits discover many different types of warrens, all which resemble familiar types of governments (democratic, communist, and dictatorship). They have to traverse all of them, avoid their pitfalls and even fight for their lives. The groups of rabbits have their own legends and moral tales that they pass on from generation to generation by word of mouth. This novel was also made into an animated feature of the same name, though it's definitely not for children. The cute 'lil bunnies can be vicious and brutal to each other (many parents may have made the mistake of bringing their kids to the animated feature when it was first released) and some bloody scenes are included. It may sound weird, but this classic novel is one everyone should read."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"As a lover of bunnies and a despiser of politics, I delayed this read as long as I could. However, the character development and plot keep you reading long after you are fed up with vernacular and cumbersome lupine folk stories.

Be prepared for a trip down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read it when it was first published, and I've read it twice since then.

This was a copy without a doubt older than me. I was intrigued by it only because I had heard it labeled a literary classic. If it hadn't been for that I likely would've passed on the story about \\"talking rabbits\\".I think the most amazing part about this book, and also one of the things that made it so enjoyable, was that it transcends what you would expect a book with this plot line to be about. Seemingly without much trouble, author makes you care deeply for the wide array of characters in this book.My advice is to read no further reviews or descriptions about this book. Simply pick it up and see for yourself. Start from scratch with this wonderful story and you'll enjoy it that much more. The names take a little getting used to, but you'll know them by heart in no time.You will never look at a rabbit the same way again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"A group of rabbits searches for a new home after Fiver, a rabbit with \\"The Sight\\" has a vision of their current home being destroyed by a land developer.After the rabbits find a new warren on Watership Down, they realize that they have no females. They look for some females to join their group, but meet only a terrible warren called Efrafa run by the controlling General Woundwort.Though the characters are all rabbits, the story is all about human nature. I especially loved the rabbit culture and mythology that is so simply yet beautifully expressed in the stories they tell.An amazing read for all ages!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I love this classic adventure of good versus evil. Which will triumph? Totalitarianism? or liberty? Excellent ending. I like it more each time I read it (roughly annually for 25 years). If I were a custom license plate girl, mine would read \\"hrududu.\\" Heh heh heh."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"it didn't hurt that the edition i bought was the one by Puffin Books--the one with the cute brown rabbit sitting by the corner of the cover. i just couldn't resist smiling like a loon at the picture at times in between reading chapters, there were times i expected it to wriggle its nose at me. and more often than not, i wanted to have a live one on my lap to cuddle whilst i was reading.i was tickled with the way Adams vividly portrayed the mannerisms of the rabbits especially in the company of their friends--when they touch with each other's noses, when they nuzzle and bump with one another usually for comfort and assurance, when they stop to nibble in a huddle, and even the way they heal another's wounds by licking it's fur. it's an endearing and refreshing look at the way these little critters presumably live their lives. there are no childish conversations with humans, no dressing up as humans, and certainly no aspirations to be human. they just are. and that's what made their adventures exciting and believable, you'd hardly notice that it's a pretty thick book.this novel explores so many aspects: deep friendship, unswerving selflessness, fierce bravery, and so on; not to mention the underlying currents of the often destructive human intervention in wildlife. i'm gratified to have met Hazel and his wily group. definitely one of the best i've read in a long while, in any genre."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"\\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams is that greatest of rarities, an adult fairy tale that works. It is about a group of young rabbits searching for a new home.Hazel is convinced his brother Fivers visions of doom are true. Fiver was the smallest of heir litter but he is blessed with god sense and clairvoyance. They convince Bigwig, a member of their warrens Owsla (security patrol), of their concerns. They are brought to the chief rabbit who calmly dismisses their concerns and privately chews Bigwig out.Hazel is not to be dismissed lightly. He is utterly convinced of Fivers prediction. Being intrepid and resourceful he has faith in his judgment. He recruits others (including Bigwig) to their cause and arranges an escape. Fiver has a vision of where they should go. It is for this haven, they leave all that they know.This is a rabbit's world with rabbits view. Frith is their god. El-ahairah is the hero of their mythology. He is the Prince of a Thousand Enemies. The tales of his adventures give demonstrate to other rabbits the skills necessary for their survival. Dogs are idiots and cats are sadistic. Man is shown as being indifferent, sometimes cruel and always impersonal to the affairs of rabbitkind.This is a classic journey story. Of course they encounter dangers and setbacks. As they use their courage, resourcefulness and luck, they grow in ways they never imagined. Even as they reach their destination and establish their new warren, they still must defend their home. Of all their enemies the greatest threat is from General Woundwort, a psychotic rabbit that runs his police-state warren with efficiency and a ruthlessness that would make Joe Stalin cringe.Like El-ahairah, Hazel \\"must be cunning and full of tricks\\" or his people will be destroyed.Of course they're not destroyed but the story is in the details not the ending. And it is a truly wonderful story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down, by Richard Adams, is a great tale of survival and leadership that anyone can enjoy.The story begins on a calm evening at the Saddleford Warren. Young Fiver, the small, nervous rabbit whose only friend is his elder brother, Hazel, comes upon a sign covered in man writing. He doesn't know where the sign came from or what it says, but he knows it means trouble.Fiver's odd premonitions are almost always true, but no one other than Hazel will believe him when he says danger is coming to the warren.The story jumps right into action as Hazel and Fiver gather a band of rabbits who are willing to leave the warren and venture into the unknown in search of a new home. They encounter danger after danger after danger, including two warrens, one of which holds a deathly secret and the other over which rules the terrible Woundwort, whose brutal discipline and battle skills have earned him the title of General.Through it all the rabbits stick together, facing hardships and terrors they never dreamed possible, all in pursuit of a place they can live safely; a place called home."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Why would ANYONE like this distasteful piece of dreck?

I read mine so many times that it fell completely apart, so I'm glad I finally will be able to replace it. I wish it had the same cover, since I tend to get sentimental about things like that, but still, I am happy.

I completely recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a treat on so many levels. Obviously, the plot and story are engaging and well talked about. The book also explores what different societies look like and the effect of political structure on individual psyches (in this case, rabbits). The rabbits at the warren where they are being farmed offer a critique of our own selves and the art and stories we tell and share with each other. Watership Down is intellectually engaging and enjoyable for any age. I believe that is a remarkable achievement.

Never I see such-a people!It is absorbing, but you can read it in small sips over the course of a summer; it has substance and a reader can return to it after a hiatus.AND: (get this)I forgot it was about rabbits. It was as heroic, heartbreaking and enthralling as anything I've read and loved. It's on my permanent shelf."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book held my attention through out the whole thing. It also sparked my emotions. Very interesting to go in to the life of a rabbit."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What a perfectly wonderful surprise to become privy to the secret world of rabbits; the struggles and triumphs they endure, as well as the creatures and circumstances they encounter as part of their everyday life, be they friend or threat.Life as a rabbit, as the author points out, is a very social existance, and the success of the rabbits who live together depends directly on their ability to form and sustain a solid social order, complete with rules, boundaries, a social order within the warren, a safe and orderly warren in a strtegic location, and many other factors that those of us who have not read this book, probably do not know. The author takes great pains to ensure that what he is writing is not just a great story -- which it most assuredly is -- but that it accurately depicts and represents the circumstances and known habits, tendencies, fears, sounds, everything pertaining to what you read about the rabbits and their actions and reactions -- all of this has been researched by the author to bring you a very real experience, while leaving you simply thinking what a good book you are reading, and unaware that the reason is the amount of work that went into the book to make it seem so seemless and flowing. It is a fine example of how a great author can take a tough topic and make it seem like child's play. Here, Richard Adams has taken the concept of talking rabbits, with their own language, had them exercise the audacity to leave their home warren --based on a vision of a runt rabbit -- which was the only place they had ever lived --then traipsed them across miles of the English countryside, through dangers aplenty, finally to arrive at a settling place, where a new life and more dangers awaited them.Watership Down is a brilliantly written book by a wonderfully talented storyteller. I first read it back when it came out around 1980...reading it again, it speaks to me in a whole new way, on levels I had not appreciated before. So, may I suggest that you read it more than once? And perhaps you should consider not waiting 30+ years before doing so? hehehe!Great book! I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"While the characters are talking rabbits, it deals with a lot more than your typical animal book.

I tried to explain to some of my bookish friends how taken I was by this story and they studied me with raised eyebrows, \\"It's about rabbits? You want us to stop everything and read a story about rabbits?\\" Well, yeah... It's not just about rabbits. It's about survival and love and taking a leap of faith. It's about friendship and sacrifice and believing that you deserve the best. It's about bravery, ingenuity, innovation, and testing your own limits. And, yeah, okay, it's also about rabbits.

This story started out as a bedtime tale for Richard Adam's children and should have stayed that way. The book is too drawn out. There are more details about the countryside than the heroic rabbits. Some parts are good, like when the rabbits go get does from the neighboring warren, but most of the book was just boring landscape details."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I tried reading this book. I got to page 3. I very much dislike this book. Later on in life, I read the whole thing, and still, it is absolutely pathetic. I HATE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read this book in a high school literature class many years ago. I really enjoyed it back then but didn't completely understand what it was about. I just liked the idea of rabbits going on an adventure. Now that I'm a little older and wiser, I read it again and discovered it's much more than that. Although the main characters were rabbits, I found myself forgetting that and thinking of them as human. This is a story about some of the darker sides of human behavior dressed in a bunny costume. Sometimes it's easier to examine human behavior if you abstract it using non-human characters.It seems to me that the underlying theme of this book is about Totalitarianism vs. Democracy. There is a militaristic warren that controls every aspect of its rabbits' lives and is ruled by a strong, hard-nosed leader who rules by fear. Then there is the other warren where the rabbits are free to do as they wish and are led by a smart, compassionate rabbit that is not the strongest but uses brains to rule. The conflict arises when the &quot;good&quot; warren asks the overcrowded &quot;bad&quot; warren if they will let some females leave. When they refuse the good warren tries help some females escape.The analysis aside, this book is also entertaining no matter what age may be reading it. The book is interspersed with rabbit mythology which the author did a great job creating. The rabbit language scattered throughout the book can be a bit confusing at times, but most people will pick it up pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Wow, what a great read!! I heard about this book many years ago but never got around to read it, not really interested in a story about rabbits. Was I wrong!!! I finally bought it and have enjoyed it inmensely, it is definitely one of the best I've read this year. It starts off a bit slowly, but the story soon picks up pace as the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig and the rest start to unfold. This is more than an adventure story, not only it is exciting, but the author manages to convey a certain depth to the story and to the characters. He pulls this off nicely by sprinkling the book here and there with stories and legends about mythological rabbits. I particularly liked the part when one of the rabbits is telling a story and sudddenly he stops, because a fox was coming. I found it very realistic.In our current world dominated by computers, traffic and money, it was really refreshing to read this story about a bunch of rabbits who simply want to find a place to live. This book should certainly appeal to everyone. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At first when you learn that this story is about a group of rabbits escaping from their warren, it seems more like a little kid book, than a book that more teenagers and adults would read. But once you get into it, you discover a whole new world, where each rabbit has it's own unique personality and they go through things in life that we as human would never have given a rabbit credit for. It's one of the most creative and imaginative books that I've ever read. It's filled with suspense, intigue, and excitement, and you'll be so hocked on it afterward that you'll want to go and read it again and again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I thought this book was awesome!! Towards the end Richard Adams actually succeeded in turning me into a rabbit. My heart was racing just like a bunny. I recommend this book to any age group.

It is a powerful story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Alright, I'll admit, that I was not so enthusiastic aboutW.D. when I first learned I would be reading it. In fifth grade, myteacher, Mr. Beaty, was 'in-love' with this book. He would set some time from the day for reading us the story. We were allowed to draw pictures of the rabbits. I was only 10 at the time, so, I, of course wasn't happy when we were supposed to read a 400-page book. By and by, my whole class started to love it. I loved their words for cars (at which, as of this point I don't remember), and all the other man-made objects. In 7th grade, I was blessed when my teacher handed out the sumemr-reading list, with W.D. on it! (I was currently in a different school than I was in 5th grade) I just LOVE the book, and am happy about having to read that, I mean, it's better than reading A tree grows in Brooklyn alone, isn't it? :)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first saw the film &quot;Watership Down&quot; as a young child, and when some years later I came across, the book, I fell in love with it immediately. The story of a group of young rabbits fleeing their home because of man's need &quot;to destroy the earth&quot; and finding a new settlement is perhaps the most beautiful story I have ever read. It is realistic, never silly nor sentimental but conveys the world of nature clearly - wonderful but cruel, and too be handled carefully. The characters of the rabbits are individual and can indeed be likened to people - Fiver the quiet dreamer, filled with insights, Hazel the cool authoritarian figure, Bigwig the bluff fighter, Hawthorne the somewhat tiresome, grating irritant - all are unforgettable in this timeless classic which will last generations. It is one of the few books which I can honestly say everyone should rad, and those who have not are truly missing out."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This could possibly be my favorite book of all time. The characters in this were amazing and were portrayed as smart creatures, it being no fault of their own that they do not know certain things.

There are many deeper meanings to this book, sure, but the up the front plot is the best."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is a book appreciated by sociologists, naturalists, and children (or the young at heart). The book began as a story Adams would tell his children on long car trips. Adams expanded his knowledge of rabbits by reading &quot;The Private Life of the Rabbit&quot; by R.M. Lockley before writing the book. Lockley discribes the rabbit as being slightly less intellegent than a cat. Although this does not even approach Mr. Stuart's impressive I.Q. of 141 (April 15th reviewer), it is on par with dogs. I found Adams discription of the natural mating and bathroom habits of rabbits informative and not at all &quot;really bad&quot; or unpleasant. Being at the bottom of the food chain, rabbits do no harm except to other rabbits, unlike humans, at the top of the food chain, who harm everthing including other humans. During their journey to find a new home the rabbits encounter other rabbit societies and learn what to and what not to incorporate into their own new society. Watership Down is a wonderful book that can be enjoyed by children and even intellegent adults with a moderated amount of imagination."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book as a challenge to an overbearing teacher who didn't think sixth graders could read big books. At first it was almost a chore to read, but before I realized it I not only finished it, but read two more times that year. The fact that the book is mainly about rabbits is very misleading. They are real people. They have a unique culture and customs. When a book about small fury creators can make you want to cry (the chapter with the wire), you either found a good book, or lost your mind. I still have a brain so I think it was the book. I have managed to go through at least 5 copies of the paperback, they keep falling apart.... maybe I should buy the hardcover?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Why did I award, for the first that ever I can recall, 5 stars to this review of Watership Down? Because, with the possible exception of The Lord of The Rings (my personal favorite and in a class of its own), this may be the best modern novel I've ever read. Richard Adams proves every point that Joseph Campbell ever made about the power of myth, or story. In Watership Down, Adams combines a great story - the English writers' strong suit - with characterization, long thought the preserve of the American writer, while seamlessly blending in his own great love for the English countryside.A short summary: a group of rabbits, led by Hazel, depart their warren, on the advice of Hazel's seer-like brother Fiver. They endure hardship and adventure and learn a lot of themselves until they make a new home atop Watership Down. New adventures ensue when then they determine that a need for does - for females, as they are all male - exists and they set out to 'steal' does from the forbidding warren to the south, Efrafa. A battle of wits develops between our hardy adventurers and the Efrafans' chief rabbit, the terrifying General Woundwort.That summary does no justice to the rich characters Adams has created in Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry, and, of course,Bigwig, nor in Woundwort himself (he gets a whole chapter) or even such rabbits as Silverweed (a cautionary character if ever there was one) or the redoubtable Captain Campion (the noble enemy). While inventive in finding ways to overcome the clear physical, and real, limitations that Adams imposes on his rabbits, by the use of the gull Kehaar and 'Dr. Adams', Adams never fails to point up the very real hardships that animals, and especially rabbits, must endure. The epigrams which he uses to open each chapter are themselves thought-provoking and have led me to the larger works from which they are taken, to my benefit. While Adams firmly asserts, like Tolkien, that none of Watership Down should be read as allegory, I think any reader can read it as he wishes - as Hazel and his rabbits (the English people) fighting against Nazism, or, perhaps, the Soviet Union, or some other tyranny.This is a book that makes you want to enter the action, to be part of the story. At best, you can visit Hampshire and see the Downs themselves. But Richard Adams has done the next best thing and in doing so, he has made a story that will last the ages."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this in middle school, and no, it was not required. I am a tad biased, as I love stories about animals, but have also converted quite a few people who do not. To say this book is captivating and exciting would be an understatement. No matter how many times I read it, I still cannot put it down when Thlayli gets stopped by Woundwort just before he was to give the signal for their daring escape out of Efrafa. My heart still pounds in anxiety for him.I love how Adams keeps the reader guessing. There is nothing repetitive about the story line and he charges on from one adventure to the next, the climactic Efrafa being the most intense.Each rabbit has his own personality and gifts. It is very difficult to choose who is my favorite. Their clashes with one another are followed by the trials they must undergo which finally transforms them from a disorganized band of stragglers to a real team. They will need this cooperation for the biggest trial of all; Efrafa.I could not put it down, and even after committing so much of it to heart, I still have a tough time closing it when Bigwig finds himself dashing for the iron road, Woundowrt in hot pursuit. There is depth to it, which I discovered after reading it as an adult, but the adventure and thrills still draw me the most. The depth lies in the human nature that is pointed out through these rabbits when they encounter the warren that is willing to \\"Accept their fate\\" in exchange for good food and nothing to fear, expect for one thing... The tyranny of Woundwort and not making him a completely evil being helps bring depth to it as well. Woundwort is ambitious, to be sure, but he genuinely thinks he is doing right by his warren. His back story also makes it difficult to completely hate him, giving the story even more depth. He is a worthy opponent.The bittersweet epilogue is the perfect ending to my favorite novel. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"i am embarrassed to say this, but watership down is the only book i have read in its entirety. my wife and i read it together.

So, when I say a book is among the best I've ever read, it means something. And this book isn't just among the best I've ever read, it's also my among my all time favourites. Now, I fully understand that \`Watership Down' is a hard sell. It's it's about RABBITS for crying out load! What self-respecting adult wants to read a book about rabbits? But don't be so quick to judge.Life is quiet and predictable Sandleford Warren. But one young rabbit, Fiver, senses a deadly danger looming ahead. Within days eleven rabbits choose to abandon their home. Few of the small group believe in Fiver's sixth sense but each one has his reasons for believing that there may be a better life for them beyond the warren of their birth. Lead by Hazel - Fiver's brother and one of the few who believe in his brother's strange gift - the assorted rabbits set out with no idea of the distance they would have to traverse, the dangers they would have to overcome, or the plots that threaten their dream of a new home - a place called Watership Down.The unforgettable nature of the story is it's sense of realism. Richard Adam extensively researched rabbits before beginning this story. He knows rabbit behaviour and life styles in great detail. And to this rich understanding he adds a culture, a mythology, and a language all of which are based in how rabbits actually live and behave. You'll never look at a the random rabbit spotted at morning or evening silflay (Lapine for eating above ground, or grazing) the same way again.The realism spreads to the characters of the rabbits themselves. Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Dandelion, Blackberry, Hawkbit, Pipkin, Speedwell, Buckthorn, Silver, Acorn, and the others encountered along the way are unforgettable. They are completely believable both as rabbits but also as individuals with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears, and hopes.Between the adventures are the stories of El-ahrairah, Prince of Rabbits and the surprising and often amusing view rabbits have of humans - this book is one you'll treasure.So, don't be put off on the rabbit on the front cover. Give this work of genius a chance."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is the story of a small group of rabbits traveling across the English countryside in search of a new home. Their tale begins when Fiver, a small, nervous rabbit, senses an unnamed future danger for the warren in which they live. Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he speaks, his older brother Hazel listens. After taking their concerns to the Chief Rabbit and trying in vain to make him believe and understand that they are in great danger, Hazel and Fiver plan an escape from their warren. The brothers, along with a group of like-minded individuals, leave the warren and go through several adventures in search of a safe place to live.To give anymore of the plot details away would remove some of the enchantment from this incredible book, and I refuse to do that to you. Watership Down is a story of great beauty. As I have stated before, it is my all-time favorite book. I first read it when I was just 12 years old, almost 20 years ago. I have read many other wonderful books over the years, but there is something special about Watership Down, a certain magic that not even time can erase. I have read it many times, and have vowed beginning this year to re-read as my first book of each new year from now on. You may say that life is too short to re-read books, but I say that life is to short not to enjoy your favorite things.Richard Adams began Watership Down as a story told aloud to his two daughters on a long car trip. In creating his fantastic world of wild rabbits, Adams constructed a new language, a complete culture, and an imaginative folk history for his characters, all of which add incredible depth to the story and to the characters themselves. The rabbits of Watership Down act with human characteristics such as bravery, loyalty and ingenuity. However Adams has written them with a naturalist's eye for real rabbits - the reader is left with the impression that this is simply how rabbits behave.Watership Down is a marvelous tale of adventure, the breathtaking story of a journey which leads eventually to the safety of a new home, as well as a keen understanding of the outside world and all its perils. If you'll allow yourself to get lost in the story, you will not regret it. Rich in detail and with a compelling and entertaining plot, Watership Down is truly a timeless masterpiece, a modern day classic that is beloved by many (including myself - in case I have not made that clear.)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remember reading this first as a child (around 12 years old) when it was, indeed, a story about rabbits and their struggle for survival. It was such a favorite that I reread it many times since then. I still see it the same way - an adventurous tale of survival against many obstacles and against all odds. A great addition to any child's (and adult's) reading list."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a classic novel by Richard Adams. The story involves a warren of rabbits, such as rabbits named Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Blackberry and Dandelion. Hazel is the protagonist. The story opens as Hazel and his brother, Fiver are taking a walk. Suddenly Fiver bumps into a sign that indicates that someone will be building houses in their warren. Now, Fiver is a rabbit so he can't read but the sign gives him an ominous feeling. He tells Hazel and Hazel takes Fiver to the the Chief Rabbit to tell him about Fiver's foreboding. The Chief Rabbit does not believe them and kicks them out. Hazel and Fiver decide to leave the warren. The only reason Hazel is doing this is because he has complete trust and faith in his brother based on past experiences. Other rabbits such as Bigwig, Blackberry and Dandelion go on this journey and they reach a little field called Watership Down. They encounter many adventures on their way to Watership Down. When they finally arrive at Watership Down they face many challenges.One might think that this is a children's book because on the surface it appears to be about cute, fuzzy bunnies. However, it is much more. It is a story about survival, fear, trust, and finding a new home. This is a great piece of art and literature. It is so exciting and interesting to hear what happens next that you will be on the edge of your seat. You will increase your vocabulary and your ability to understand complicated plots. I strongly believe this book should be a part of everyone's library. I recommend this book for ages 9 and up.by William"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I came across Watership Down about a decade ago, at a flea market, operated on the parking lot of Dongcheng Public Library of Beijing, China.Upon turning over the first page, I never let it out of my hands until I finished reading the last line. I still clearly remember reading this book in a mini-bus with my colleagues on a business trip. The bus bumped and turned on a rough road, my eyes fixed on the book. One of my colleague asked, \\"Don't you feel dizzy reading in the bus?\\" \\"Not at all,\\" said I, \\"So long as my eyes are on the book.\\"The copy I bought at the flea market was a Penguin edition published in the seventies, if I remember correctly. Its ridge was so worn out that the pages fell out. So several years later, I asked a friend to bring me a new Puffin edition, when he asked what souvenir I'd like to have after his visit to the U.K.Richard wrote Watership Down for his little daughter, but his brain-child did and does fascinate many adults till today as well."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I purchased a copy of Watership Down at a used book store. This was a copy without a doubt older than me. I was intrigued by it only because I had heard it labeled a literary classic. If it hadn't been for that I likely would've passed on the story about \\"talking rabbits\\".I think the most amazing part about this book, and also one of the things that made it so enjoyable, was that it transcends what you would expect a book with this plot line to be about. Seemingly without much trouble, author makes you care deeply for the wide array of characters in this book.My advice is to read no further reviews or descriptions about this book. Simply pick it up and see for yourself. Start from scratch with this wonderful story and you'll enjoy it that much more. The names take a little getting used to, but you'll know them by heart in no time.You will never look at a rabbit the same way again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a very good book about a party of rabbits who run away from their warren to eascape danger. I enjoyed the literature exerpts at the beggining of each chapter. Watership Down has its own &quot;Lapine&quot; vocabulary. It was a bother to look in the Lapine glossary every time I came to a strange word but the story itself is great. Also, one or two of the chapters are long, boring, and don't make sense. The story is fairly long but fun to read and suspensful at some points. This story, however is ideal for classrooms to read. I'd reccomend this book to the sixth grade or seventh grade reader. Even with its small flaws, I loved the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Libby Springmeyer W131The novel Watership Down is an excellent tale about a group of rabbits' adventures in finding a new homeland for themselves. It sets examples of courage, strength, trust, and hope. It is intriguing how the rabbits go against all odds as they set forth on their journey to find a safe place for them to live. The most interesting thing about this story is the way the rabbits look at death. They believe in the Black Rabbit of Inle, which is \\"fear and everlasting darkness.\\" The black rabbit will come and get you when it is your time to go with him, when it is your time to die. It is said that \\"he will come in the night and call a rabbit by name.\\" When one goes with him, they will have no more pain, be rid of all their weaknesses, they will be free. This black rabbit is thought to be working with the Lord Frith, which is their lord. They work together to bring about what was meant to be. Both the Black Rabbit and their Lord Frith were spoken of continuously in the story, which shows concern for death, and their belief in the heavens. The rabbits in the story have souls just like human's do, which is why I enjoyed this book so much. I believe everyone with an imagination should read this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Oh, man, at first, I didn't think I'd like the book, but I read it anyway.

Also, the metaphores were rather too simple don't you think?"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The book Watership Down by Richard Adams has great description. Although it may not sound that exciting, a bunch of rabbits crossing the countryside, it's an amazing adventure. Think of the Redwall series, now subtract weapons, a castle, medieval time, and just one problem to face. It's Redwall with a twist of reality and nature. For instance, the rabbits can only kick in defense instead of wielding swords and shields. Richard Adams presents lovable/lovable and hateable characters that you're sure to get attached to. The use of difficult plant names will have you stumbling threw the beginning and flipping back to the Lapine Glossary can get strenous, but the strengths far outweigh these weaknesses. The strengths, as you may have guessed, are the description and characters. You may not want to start this book unless you plan to read for a while.I loved the book, through the slow beginning, you'll find a great novel, and an instant classic. If you believe this as well, you'll love the sequel-Tales From Watership Down.The rabbits have to get through a forest, swim a river, and get through a warren full of man-set traps and snares. Sure it is tough going, but they'll get through it, now for the rest of the book,you'll have to find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read. There are loads of interesting and varied characters that make each page a fresh experience. The story is both complex and adventurous, detailed and compelling. I recommended this book to a friend of mine and he told me he couldn't get into a story about rabbits. I thought, &quot;That's simplifying the novel.&quot; This story has so many themes and countless expressions of emotions involving friendship, death, tyranny, and hope that I was forced to re-evaluate my friend's depth of character. This is a grand adventure filled with memorable moments and thought-provoking analogies about mankind. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"No doubt, Richard Adams planned to write this book as a story to his little children, but what came out is one of the most astonishing and imaginative tales I've ever read. In my opinion, what Tolkien did with hobbits, dwarves, men and elves, Richard Adams has done with rabbits.At first glance, the reader may think: but what's there about rabbits that's so interesting? Of course, \\"Watership down\\" is not just about rabbits at all. Adams only used them as an allegory. But it's been really interesting reading about semi-sentient beings that are not distinguished by their intelligence, but by their tenacious will to survive against stronger enemies and sometimes even against themselves. More than that, Adams was able to create (like Tolkien) a spiritual, holy background for rabbits, permeating his story with nice tales about a smarter-than-most rabbit that lived in ancient times.Richard Adams tells his tale like an old-fashioned myth, like a folded piece of clothing that the reader has to unfold and never stop being amazed by its size and complexity.Grade 9.5/10"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Without being long winded, Watership Down is hands down my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams has done it! Watership Down is simply astounding. Mr. Adams keeps hid readers captivated through various plots and dangers. Some of these dangers include Efrafa, watching out for elil, and leaving their own warren in the beginning of the book. This fellowship of rabbits has to dodge danger at every turn. This book's excellency is due to its most astonishing plots, and its precise descriptions of not only the band of wandering rabbits, but their surroundings as well. This novel is very enjoyable because of its description, and the adventures it takes the reader on. I liked this novel because of all of these things, and I would very much recommend this book to anyone because of the things it teaches and because of its heart-warming experience.When compared to other novels I have read, Watership Down would have to come out on top. I have never read anything like it. It made me feel as if I were a rabbit myself, enduring the hardships these rabbits faced. Having to dodge badgers, dogs, cats, and foxes at every turn. Most other novels, like Fifth Chinese Daughter, will take you into the city life that everyone is accustomed to. However, Watership Down takes you into the wild, and teaches us how poorly we can sometimes treat animals.In all, I would give this book five stars, being the best rating, because of its extraordinary plots and descriptions. I hope all who have a chance to read this book can."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams' Watership Down is a tale about a small group of rabbits who decide to leave their home, when danger is said to be coming, by a young rabbit. After some time they encounter several other warrens, or homes, of other rabbits. They finally find a place to stay safe and encounter bigger difficulties and troubles. The rabbits need to deal with all these problems and find a solution so they can thrive in a strange inviroment.Watership Down is a great novel that really brings out the how hard it is, for creatures of any kind, to move out of their home and into unfamiliar surroundings where they must find a way to survive and prosper. While reading the book you begin to like many things about the rabbits and their tale. Many great things about the book are when then the rabbits move from their home and first encounter things they have never seen and reading about how they deal with their problems personally and the problems of the group. Certain parts of the story are sudden and unexpected but in many cases these only add to the excitement and thrill of the adventure, however, in other cases these sudden happenings are unexpected and can make the story harder to understand. Another small downside is the book starts out a little slow.Reading novels has always been a fun experience. Some of the other novels I have read are also about animals, but rarely are they about rabbits and other novels usually do not deal wit real time problems that occasionally happen to animals of all kinds. Also other novels are not as long or as fun to read. Once you get into Watership its hard to stop reading it.Watership Down is a book that I enjoyed quite a lot, and that many others could enjoy as well. I would say that if you enjoy reading books that are a little bit longer, Watership Down is a book that many people would enjoy, though it starts out a little slow, it quickly gets very exciting and addictive.In the long run Watership Down was a book I will always remember and enjoy."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I think that Watership Down was a good book because of how it is so specific on describing what happened. Like when Holly got back from Efrafa, he told the story on what happened and what it was really like there. I also like how they tell story's about The Black Rabbit and El-ahrairah and how that comes to blend in with what is really happening. My favorite character is Kehaar. I like him because of how he saved the rabbits every time they were in trouble from other rabbits. I also liked the way Kehaar talked. He was a good friend to their warren ever scence they saved him. He is very protective of his friends. He also comes just when you least expect it. This novle is similar to others I have read because it is about animals. I don't really like to read books that are about animals, but this book I really enjoyed. When I first got the school assignment to read Watership Down (a 490 page book) and right a review on it I was scared, but now that I read it, it turned out to be a really good book. You don't have to know a lot about animals to read it. That is what else is enjoyable, It explains everything that happens in a very simple way. I would recomend this story to others because as you read it you feel like your there with the characters and you care what happens to them. You also start to trust them. It is really fun to guess what happens next. I liked the suspence when the characters were in danger. I think that this novel was well written and the characters were well made up."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"When I first picked up this book, saw the cover, and read the beginning, I thought to myself... \\"This is this going to be a long, dull book about rabbits!\\" As I got more into reading it,when the adventurous part of the book started and a rabbit named Fiver ( who has a special gift where he can predict bad things that will most likely happen) told her brother Hazel that something terrible was going to occur at their warren, I realized I might be wrong. Fiver, Hazel, and 9 other rabbits, took off into the night, not sure where they were going, but knowing they needed to go find another home.Along the way, they had to deal with crisis and hardships, but they stuck together and gotthrough them. The rabbits met many new animals that they received help from and gave assistance to. I liked how even though many of the other rabbits in their group were larger and stronger than Hazel, every rabbit agreed that Hazel would be a better leader because he knew how to think for the group and knew how to please the entire group not only with his ideas but with others' too.I valued how this is a different kind of book to read because it is away frompeople and cities. Who would have thought a book about rabbits could be so intriguing! It is fascinating to learn, read and compare how rabbits react to things differently than people do. I also really liked how the rabbits always fixed problems and never left anyone behind even if they were hurt. For example, when Hazel goes and saves 3 other rabbits from a farm, but is badly injured and his friends think he is dead. Luckily, Fiver goes back, just in case, and finds Hazel okay and still alive. What I disliked about this book is how the author uses female names like Hazel, Holly, and Dandelion for male rabbits. Some of the names were very unique like Bigwig, Hawkbit and Fiver. I thought it was sad and weird reading about rabbits fighting, but it was necessary for the plot, or else there wouldn't be any action. I especially didn't like when General Woundwort was fighting Bigwig. Fortunately Bigwig won, but it sounded gory!I don't think I have ever read a book this long that I can remember. I know it is one of the most touching and powerful novels I have ever read. Overall it was a good challenge forme. It was interesting, well-written and I learned a lot. I think if you're looking for an adventurous book, that is exciting, then this is the book for you. I would recommend it for any age. I really had fun reading this and I hope you will so you can find out even more about the different rabbits and animals like dogs, cats, birds and others Hazel and his group met. Also what finally happened to them.....I'll give you a hint, it has a very happy ending."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Austin JohnsWatership DownWatership Down is an extraordinary book about a group of rabbits and their struggles to find a new warren. The group is forced to set out and establish a new warren when one of the most sensitive of the rabbits, Fiver, had a premonition of impending doom on their old warren. When this group of rabbits set out to establish or join a new warren they had no idea the hardships, or elil, that were in their future.The leader of this group was a buck named Hazel who was advised by a runt named Fiver. It was Fiver's idea for the group to leave the warren because he felt something terrible was going to happen to it. A rabbit named Bigwig was one of the first rabbits to join this group. He was part of the owsla (rabbit police), he was tough, and he was anxious and ready for anything that came his way. Bigwig did not like it when there was not action. One example in the story happened while the group was waiting for a fox to leave a field so that they could continue their journey. Bigwig, however, felt he had to do something besides sit and watch, so he burst off running past the fox to lead it away from the group. Bigwig accidentally ran into a wide patrol from Efrafa. When the fox followed Bigwig to the wide patrol the fox killed some of the patrol. In this group all the rabbits had very different personalitties, and they were all so valuable in their own special ways. It was the appreciation of this that made the group successful in their journey.This book inspired me because this group of rabbits kept working together despite all their differences. \\"Risk is Risk,\\" said Bigwig once, and he never let fear overtake him. Each rabbit was valued for its own personal contribution. None was mocked or scorned because they were different. Each rabbit was encouraged to be the best that was in them. They met danger everywhere but they never stopped chasing their dream."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Blake Thomson August 10, 2003Watership DownThe classic novel Watership Down was one of the best adventure stories I have ever read. I couldn&#65533;t help but read this novel for hours at time. I really like how the characters never gave up hope, for instance when Woundwort came to take over their warren. They didn&#65533;t choose to run or just give up and die. They fought to the very end. I also really enjoyed how the author gave a lot of detail, and how he said certain things. One example is the very end, when Hazel died. He made it seem as though he were going on to better things, not really dying, but continuing his adventures. This novel is like no book I have ever read. Most books didn&#65533;t include so much detail and I really wasn&#65533;t as sucked into the other books I&#65533;ve read. This book is just what I would hope for in an adventure book. This is without a doubt the best adventure book I have read. This is definitely a story I would tell my friends to read. I really think kids my age would like it because there&#65533;s a likeable main character, a bad guy, and the books based on an animal. The fighting is also a very positive aspect of the book, but if it were more serious I think it would become excessive. These are all things kids my age would enjoy in a book, especially one with a plot so interesting. I think this is a great story of hope, adventure, and plenty of action. I thought this was an excellent book and I wouldn&#65533;t be surprised if I read it three more times!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It thought that Watership Down was a wonderful book. It gives you an idea of what it was like to be in a rabbits world and all of the fears and challenges that rabbits have to go through every day. All though I thought that Watership Down got off to a slow start, it really picked up at the end. I also liked the stories that were told about El-ahrairah in some of the chapters of the book. I thought that it was interesting how Fiver could always tell what to do and had foresights about things that were going to happen later in the story. For instance, Fiver knew that something was going to happen to their home warren and got as many rabbits as he could to leave the warren. Also when their group of rabbits came upon a warren of rabbits that seemed perfectly fine, Fiver somehow knew that their was something different about their warren. I also liked that even though their were so many problems, they were finally able to overcome them, the main one was getting does to their warren from Efrafa.This Novel is different from the others that I have read because it gives people of an idea of another animals life and how what we do really affects other animals around us. This is a different kind of fantisy then other books. In this book, instead of having whichs and wizards or wrinkles of time, it is about rabbits on an adventure to do the impossible, but finally come through and complete what they had sent out to do.I think that people should read this book, because it gives you an idea of what it is like to be a rabbit, and all of the many fears and challenges that happen in their everyday life. If you are a person who doesn't like to read long books, I would not recommend this book for you. But if you don't mind long books, I think that this is an amazing book and I think that you should read it. It has adventure, challenges, comedy, and many other things that make books so great. I would highly recommend this book and hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Superb! What more can I say? Adams has proved again and again to be a master of storytelling and myth weaving. This book remains my all time favorite. Watership Down's rabbit society alows us to see the world through a lense tinted in far different shade than we see in our ordinary lives. The characters face and overcome obstacles that face us every day. Strength to defy convention, out-doing brawn with brains, and many others. And it is all depicted on the intruiging background of the rabbits who, in this book at least, have their own government, own language, own religion. I beseech everyone to treat themselves to this masterful creation, which still remains my Champion Book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This novel is not only a fable, but it's an entertaining and unususal read as well. It took me a bit to get used to the fact that rabbits aren't being personified as people but are actually treated as rabbits. Although I was able to enjoy the book more as I got to know the characters.The interweaving of history and mystics with an exciting story made the last 200 pages go quickly. The fact that these are rabbits gives leeway to make a story that would not be a typical tale of human struggle, but also goes to show the differences in the way people have progressed and nature has remained true to its own way of being.Another remarkable thing is that even though there are hardships in the story, it left me feeling uplifted at the end. It just seems so rare in contemporary literature to be left with such a clean feeling. I appreciate that.The details which may seem tedious at points are also startling. Things which may be taken for granted are highlighted and used well. For example, the height of a rabbit as opposed to that of a person comes into play. When the group comes upon a new area they can't simply take a few steps and look around and decide it's okay. There are pages of exploration over just a few hundred feet.I think this would be a good first book for any adolescent to read. It tends to leave a good mark on the brain."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I liked this book because of the way the Richard Adams brought the story in the beginning.I didn't like the part when the Richard Adams chose words that didn't make sense,but over all I give this 5stars.The story begins when the rabbits see the sign, but can't read it.They leave the place, but hardships soon pass like other rabbits,dogs, and any that are enemys to rabbits.I like this also of good word choice, good meaning, and a overall good story.I feel this is top quality for all readers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My favorite book of all time, I've read it 9 or 10 times since I was about 12. Each character has its own personality and the suspense towards the end is *really* great. It's not just a book about rabbits, I wish people would look past that more. To be able to write a book starring rabbits and to do such a good job and become a best-seller, it must be well-written. I was so in love with it that I bought the movie."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I have started reading this book about two weeks ago. I am not done, but for the first time have I ever laid eyes on a book so full of adventure and character. This book is very intresting and has alot of my vocabulary words which really gets me thinking . Watership Down is the first book that really gets me focused. I love it and wish to read more of Richard Adam's books."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Don't be put off by bad reviews, it only shows that some people have no culture. It is perfectly alright to like this book, because even if it is about rabbits, it has a dark side to the story. The idea of talking rabbits is fictuous, but the rest is fact. I have read THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE RABBITS and it actually states that rabbits do have their own 'language' which they speak through breathing patterns and stamping. DON'T BE PUT OFF BY CULTURELESS PEOPLE!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"At a glance, it seems just another talking animal-fantasy book. In actuality, the book combines animal science with imaginary culture to give you a blend of emotion and adventure you will never forget. I thought it was so good, I wrote a song about it."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the greatest book I have ever read. I don't make statements like that lightly. A book about talking rabbits is going to be a tough sell to just about anyone but I'll try. I have read hundreds of books and my tastes generally lead me to fantasy novels (Moorcock, Weis &amp; Hickman, R. A. Salvatore, etc...) most of these books really aren't five star material (I tend to be an incredibly tough rater) but they're fun and exiting to read. SO IS THIS BOOK! I can't emphisize that enough. But please don't get the idea that this book is just for people who read fantasy. I don't know of another book that will appeal to every type of reader as well as this one does. There was a review for this book from the St. Louis Post that states &quot;anyone who can read english should read this book&quot;. This is not just flattery. It has wonderful character development and the adventures that they go through is so well written that you will find yourself turning to the next page or so to see how things turn out, that is if you remember that you are just reading and not living the story. I don't know of a better compliment for a book. So give it 3 chapters. I'm sure that it will turn into 4, then 5, and so on. At first the book may seem like a marathon given its size, but everyone I know who has read the book thinks that it was too small. So will you. I promise."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is a wonderful classic masterpiece. Not only is it a great book because of all the exciting happenings, but also because of the way Mr. Adams describes everything. Also, people do say that this book is considered a high school book (which it is), but some children have a talant for reading and do feel that they need to read more challenging books. This is a great book, and I know that the book will still be a sucsess in the next millenium."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I see that there are already a great number of reviews on this book. I just figured I would throw my two cents in anyway. I promise to make this brief -- This is the greatest book ever written (with the exception of the bible of course). I don't care if you don't like reading at all, buy this, and you'll be on page 100 before the night's up!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I read this book after some tremendous hype from a good friend. And I understand the hype - the story takes itself in a direction that makes it very clever toward the end. However, it took some effort to remain focused on completing it.Some points in the middle go really slow - typical of many classics, where people of the past sort of needed something to do. However, as a young 20-something, maybe the issue is that I need things to happen. Reading about the description of open pastures and blue skies can get a little old. However, if you choose to skip such slow parts, your time will be much better spent. Once the rabbits get to Efrafra things really get good."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Few works of fiction revolving around animals ever become literature classics. Animal Farm and the Secret of Nimh are two examples, this is another. This daunting piece of \\"children's\\" literature tells the story of a warren of rabbits that leave their home after one of their kind has visions of doom. Leave they do, and travel they must, eventually settling in another place. But after settling, they must then find females to mate with in order to populate a new warren. This of course they do.Though written for children, the themes covered in this book are more appropriate for adults. These include sex, reproduction, courtship, fighting over mates, death, visions of doom, life as a refugee, territorial conflicts, and inter-generational conflict. Some of the dialogue and descriptions are quite graphic. After reading this book, one discovers that many of the themes covered are quite similar to those found in human societies and covered in other classics of literature; though with one exception; humans don't get eaten like some of the rabbits do in this book. This reviewer found the book boring and requiring great effort to get through. I would not recommend it to anyone under 10 as the book quickly gets boring."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was reading the reviews for Watership Down, I stumbled across a reveiw entitling the book: 'A GREAT Children's Novel!\\"!!!!!!!!!!! Surely Not! This book does not suit younger readers. Some parts I found were quite boring, and I had to skip to actually get through the book. It was a good story though, But I wouldm't recomend it to anyone who is a \\"KID\\" becuase it can get quite boring. All in all, a great story, but not at all for younger readers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Story wise this book deserves five stars but overall I gave it four because the author is not very good at explaining things. Over and over again I was lost when he was describing landscapes and the fauna found in them. Perhaps people native to his country (England) would understand what he was talking about in a heartbeat but I'm American and so many of the things he talked about (downs, hedgerows, cattle wades, etc.) I've never even heard of before. At times, I had to look up dozens of things on Google (and sometimes, even then, I was lost). I think he should have used less terminology and just explained things in general terms everybody knows.It helped me when reading this book to just kind of disregard anything I couldn't figure out, make up my own scene in my head, and go on.The landscape descriptions are the only hard thing to understand. Everything else is crystal clear. So by doing this I stopped myself from getting frustrated and was able to enjoy the good story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I personaly didnt like Watership Down but that doesnt mean it isnt a good book.

He uses the text-to-speech function to listen on his Kindle. Watership Down had that option greyed out, so he was not able to listen. I have read the book multiple times and know it as a classic.

Strange to say, because the characters in the book, virtually one and all, are rabbits. But for clarification to those who don't understand, the Little Prince is not about miniature royalty, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is not about maritime fowl, and the Perfect Storm is not about the weather. Having said that, you ought to read it. It's about life, and good, and evil, and struggle, and triumph, and bravery, and sacrifice, and those things that make us human (or rabbit, if you prefer the literal version). It is one of the best books I have ever read about humanity, and you will think about it for a long time after you read it, maybe for the rest of your life...."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"One measure of the decline of American education is that while people once read the Greek and Latin classics in their teens, I was assigned _Watership Down_ in my sophomore year of high school.

When I first started reading it, I hated it. I thought it was slow and too detailed.

I encourage everyone not to read this book. The author had to have a glossary in the back just because there were too many dumb terms that he made up. This was the stupidest book in the world. No wonder the author couldn't find someone to publish it. It was the dumbest book in the world. Did I mention that it was about talking bunnies? How totally dumb can that be?

The author has lost the respect I had given him for such a great sequel, but this has just backed down my praises of him."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Wonderful reading - sad to say that many of the reviews that pan the book are from students in high school. This seems to back the theory that students are graduating while still illiterate. If you want to be moved to tears, thrilled to your toes, and taken into the historical world of the rabbit, you must read this book! (I'm on my 4th copy). El-ahrairah is nothing short of the rabbits Moses, leading them through life by the wisdom of the surviving tales...Having studied rabbits, wild and domestic for several years (over 20), I found that they are very aware of how precious and tenuous their lives really are. This adventure is a non-stop rollercoaster ride, with more nail biting thrills than any Stephen King novel - and King would probably agree. He did after all, mention the book in The Stand, and that in itself is high praise. Now if I could just find a copy of The Private Life of the Rabbit by R.M. Lockley.Also, More Tales From Watership Down rated 5 stars from me - it answered alot of questions, and gave us Hazel back, if only for a little while. May the rabbits never stop running....."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Richard Adams is the best novelest in the history of the genre.I was given this book as an asighnment to read, in all it took me 5 days to finish.

Tales from watership down did not quench my thirst for his wonderful and exiting world. After I read the last chapter on a characters death I was in a deep depresion for days thinking about it.

I've had to repurchase it three times - my copies kept getting worn out from my rereading it so much.

Just two days ago I saw WaterShip down in the books store and remembered my childhood favorite movie, so I picked it off the bookshelf, bought it, and now carry it wherever I go! its is in a word, INCREDIBLE. the characters are moving, well developed, and never lack intrest at all! For me, page after page was like some sort of sci-fi warp drive, sucking me clear into it's depths and never letting go! Now what am I doing? Re-reading the book, drawing all the characters, and using frequent &quot;rabbit talk&quot; to everyone I meet unconsiously! The book deserves so much praise and I don't know all the words I can use to give it! Temptation, love for the unknown, adventure, skills, fighting,... just so absolutly incredible!It had everything i wanted! including the one hero I always looks for in a book that is daring, brave, and ready for anything!

At 24 years-old, I figured I could probably grasp the plot by now, and I was curious what it was all about.I was not disappointed. This is one of the best books I've read in a while. As far as I'm concerned, the fact that the characters are all animals makes it more interesting, not less (was Animal Farm boring for lack of humans?). Animals are often used in literature to represent human archetypes and it can be quite a useful tool. Here it's no different: you have Hazel, the leader coming into his own, Fiver, the seer, Bigwig, the warrior, etc. The rabbits experience adventures worthy of the Odyssey throughout the story, and I found there was never a dull moment.The basic plotline is that a small band of rabbits escapes from their warren (rabbit community) after a rabbit with some sort of sixth sense (Fiver) predicts its destruction. The rest of the story chronicles the rabbits' journey through the English countryside to try to establish a new warren elsewhere and acquire does so that the warren will flourish. There's lots of dangers for wild rabbits from all sorts of expected and unexpected sources, and their adventures are the meat of the story.I decided the story still is scary; at times it was all I could do to force myself to actually read the words rather than skip ahead to discover if one of the characters survives the close fight, or epic (for rabbits) three-mile journey, or hopeless mission. But it's not sad. It's an inspiring story of courage, ambition, loyalty, and friendship, with plenty of adventure along the way - all the ingredients for a great story.Regarding the disappointed reviewer who read this in an English class - a poorly taught English class can ruin any great book. This book has important, if not altogether original, insights into human relationships, government, society, oppression, liberation, fear, death, etc. I think this is a very valuable book and one of the best I've ever read. I'm glad I gave it another chance."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I personally loved this book because I like animals, and they are the main characters. I also liked the book because the author really went into detail describing the characters and the setting. I liked Hazel the best,not only because he was one of the main characters,but because he was such an outstanding leader. His compassion,bravery,and self-control was really amazing. The best part of the book was the intense chase scene where Hazel,with his companions and the newly captured rabbits are running for their lives from the evil Woundwart and his terrible rabbits. This part of the book kept me on the edge of my seat,and I could not put it down.I liked the ending because it was bitter-sweet and really tied the book together. This really was a great book!:)"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"It took some coaxing, but I finally convinced my 13 year old, a huge Harry Potter fan, that there was greater literature out there for her to explore. We listened to a fine reading of Watership Down over the past month in the car -- and she was transfixed. Indeed, she went from reluctance, to enthusiasm, to downright hostility if I listened to any part of it while she was not in the car. The book is simply beautiful -- filled with religious and political allegory, but also filled with characters you admire and whose company you actually enjoy: Hazel, the courageous leader, Bigwig, the warrior, Fiver, the prophet, Blackberry, the intellectual, Bluebell, the jokester, and Dandelion, the story-teller, to name a few. The adventures detailed are gripping, from escaping from a doomed warren, to fighting for their lives against the totalitarian regime from Efrafa. In between, our rabbit friends encounter cats, dogs, foxes, and man himself, the most destructive creature of all. As all the accolades here attest, this is a book rich not only in excitement and entertainment but also in wisdom and insight. No knock against J.K. Rowling, but Richard Adams fable of courage and survival far surpasses the much touted Harry Potter. Even my 13 year old seems on the verge of conceding this."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is the best book I've ever read. I am 13 year old male and I loved it. It is about a group of rabbits led by Hazel, Bigwig, Holly, and Bluebell that flee their doomed community and strive to build a new, perfect warren, envisioned by the prophetic Fiver- and the book is less than 1/2 over! The book is over 400 pages but personally, it was so exciting that it seemed too short when I read it. The first 100 pages aren't very exciting at all- but don't let that throw you, because the plot thickens. In fact, I found it so intoxicating that now that I'm finished, I feel upset because I still want to hear more about their adventures.

That's right, get it all out of your system so I can start with the meat. Now, at least there should be no dispersions cast against my honesty.I began this book in a doctor's office and ended it in my easy chair. I read it everywhere in between. That's what a good book does to you. It takes you by the throat and demands to be read. It whispers in your ear from your nightstand and soon you've lost another hour, then two of sleep. It's like a chemically addictive habit that you don't want to quit. Except there's no guilt. Nothing but clean pleasure.For those who don't know and would like to be saved the feeling of appearing stupid, this book is about a rabbit pilgrimage from a safe warren, aristocratically ruled, to a new warren, free and self ruled for the most part. To call it allegorical is nothing new or brilliant. To enjoy the story for its sleek elements and vigorous imaginative style is necessary. This is a book of the purest raw creativity I've read in years. Yet, I feel I learned a little about the ways of the rabbit in the process. We have a few of the little fellars in out backyard from time to time, a nest of cottontails under out workshop. I look at them differently now. Crazy as it sounds, I look at them with respect.This is an epic Tokienian tale that surprises and warms. You feel everything the rabbits go through and you find yourself rooting for them at every foul turn. They are the underdogs and you cannot help but feel a kinship with them. Not only because they are loveable and persevering, but because, by and large, they are right in their ideals and pursuits. They are led from intelligence rather than might or popularity or class. They are the quintessential idealistic Americans of colonial times. You can almost hear Patrick Henry screaming his decisive aphorism from the pages.Adams weaves a delightful, yet decidedly adult story and in the end you learn as much about humans as you do about rabbits. Perhaps more. There is a short glossary of Lapine terms that Adams refers to often. While this went a long way to irritate me at first, it's worth it. A single line in the last few pages more than justifies its existence. You'll have to trust me on this.If you haven't given yourself a present lately, buy this book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"&quot;There isn't any danger here, at this moment.

Fiver is a seer, or one that can tell the future so when he predicts the destruction of the warren many outskirters that know him believe it. Both of them wish to leave the warren because of the way they are treated by the Owsla or band of young strong rabbits that steal food from the weak.Watership Down is an exciting read, full of surprises, twists, turns, and terror. It is one of the best animal books ever written and may have, I believe, inspired some animal novelists like Brian Jacques to start their writing career.Alex Hutter is the writer of Rabbits \`r' Us and is currently working on project P.T.R.O.N.A, Protect the Rabbits of North America."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book is a work of art! I just loved every single word of it! Richard Adams does a beautiful job of developing the rabbits as characters, giving them qualities that are real and believable. After a while, I found myself feeling as if I knew the rabbits personally. I think that fiction in which animals are given human qualities is challenging to write and sometimes to read. Watership Down is a wonderful balance -- just when you feel the rabbits are becoming to &quot;human-like&quot;, Adams reminds us they are rabbits by interweaving their traits as a species into the plot. By the end of the book, I was so engrossed, I couldn't read the words fast enough. I found myself wanting to believe that the rabbit world is really the way Richard Adams portrays it to be. In short, I will never look at a rabbit the same again. I will always wonder where his warren is and if he is running from &quot;a thousand enemies.&quot; Children and adults will both enjoy this book -- the difference is the way in which Watership Down sits in the minds of its varied age of readers. It will effect everyone differently. A WORK OF ART!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book spoke to me from the first few pages, and after that I couldn't put it down. I had never seen such totally believable and magnificently done characters in my life. Of course, when I first started to read it, I was greedy for any stories about fantasy, animals, the usual drivel that we (teenagers) sometimes read. I think I read about ten Brian Jacques books before I ever picked up this book. I haven't picked one up since. WATERSHIP DOWN brought me out of a very deep rut in creativity and imagination. I believe that I become a better person for reading this book.I envy the reviewer who knows Mr. Adams; he appears to be in touch with a person whose ideas and stories are positively works of art. The story of Elhrairrah (sorry about the spelling) and the Black Rabbit was something incredibly sad and beautiful, as was the entire novel. Where did Mr. Adams come up with such beautiful ideas?I greatly wonder how Mr. Adams managed to create such a complex novel, that reveals ties and patterns within itself the more you think about it. It isn't often that you get a book that stands up to thorough examination. I especially admired Bigwig's change in character throughout the book: &quot;That'll be the day, it will, when I call you Hazel-rah! I'll stop fighting that day.&quot; Ahhhh. The Steven King fan who reviewed this book, and all others like him, didn't give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"The first time I read this book I was in the seventh grade. I am now almost thirty years old and it still remains the most enjoyable novel I have ever experienced. This novel has everything a reader could possible want; adventure, suspense, romance, betrayel, and never-ending mythology. Yes, the characters are rabbits, which may not seem credible at the start of the story, but soon you begin to realize that this is not just a tale about bunny rabbits. It is a tale of a group of wanderers who are forced to flee the only home they have ever known. Once out in strange and unfamiliar surroundings they must learn to rely on each others strengths and capabilities in order to survive. While searching for a new home they encounter many dangers along the way, from foxes and dogs, to man and his many unnatural creations, to the most dangerous enemy of all, that of their own kind. You will be forever moved and touched as you follow the many adventures of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and their friends. I can't imangine anyone coming away unchanged after reading about the rabbits of Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I had the opportunity to read Watership Down as part of my AP English class not too long ago. This book was mentioned in one of my all-time favorite books, The Stand, and I was intrigued by one of the character's description of the story. After reading Watership Down, I would have to say that this novel is now joins The Stand, among others, as one of my all-time favorites.Watership Down is about rabbits. No, you're not hallucinating, I said rabbits. Yet, as you read, you will find it hard to imagine them as rabbits. Adams describes them as a race rich in heritage and culture, as is shown with the stories of the mystical rabbit prince El-ahrairah that are intertwined in the main story itself. The story is about a small group of rabbits escaping certain death from an excavation project, and seeking a place to call home. They face many challenges, and struggle through many hardships, such as their fight against the oppressed warren of Efrafa, and it's dictatorial leader, General Woundwort. As the story unfolds, one can't help but be captivated by the plight of the rabbits, and intrigued by their decidedly humanistic personalities.Watership Down is a journey through a fantasy world, where rabbits talk, fight, brag, and have many of the same qualities and faults as humans. One may scoff at the subject matter, thinking that a book about rabbits won't hold their attention. To these people I say give this book a chance! After reading it, you will never look at rabbits the same way again, and it's very possible that this novel will become one of your all-time favorites. It certainly is one of mine."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first became familiar with the world of \\"Watership Down\\" when I saw the movie as a child - it was one of my favourite movies when I was about 5 years old. So, you can imagine my delight when I came across the book in a bookstore many years later! Ah, to re-connect with the \\"bright-eyed\\" (the movie features the Art Garfunkel song, \\"Bright Eyes\\") innocence of my inner child! I read this book in a matter of days, so engrossed was I in this magical tale!I won't bother with a synopsis of the book, as many previous readers have posted eloquent reviews detailing the characters, plot, etc. I will, however, emphasize that this fabulous book may be read on many levels: to some, it is simply a tale about the adventures of a group of rabbits trying to find a new home; to others, it is an allegorical tale depicting a very human society and its conflicts.(As an aside, I would also like to add that I was pleasantly surprised by the realistic behaviour of the characters in this book: anyone who has ever owned a rabbit knows that they are not always the sweet little balls of fluff everyone makes them out to be!)Sadly, I think there are many adults out there that will pass over this book because they see it as a children's story about talking rabbits. And, on the superficial level, that is exactly what it is. But, to truly grasp the brilliance of this book, you must delve deeper than just the words printed on the page - this is a story that you actually --GASP!-- have to use your brain to truly understand! Unfortunately, many of the readers who gave this book a low rating were forced to read it at school - a tragedy, since not all youths will be mature enough in the literary-sense to understand that the book is an allegory.This book is not for everyone. If you can't get past the idea of \\"talking rabbits\\", you probably won't enjoy this book; if you cannot stand verbose descriptions (a la J.R.R. Tolkien), you probably won't enjoy this book; if you don't enjoy having to read between the lines to \\"get\\" what a book is truly trying to say, you probably won't enjoy this book... But to everyone else: EXPAND YOUR MIND & READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first picked up this bulky book in the fourth grade when encouraged by my librarian to read bigger books. I cannot thank her enough.Watership Down is the best book I have ever read. Although the characters of the book are rabbits, you only faintly realize it as you read. Richard Adams connects our world to that of the rabbits so skillfully the bond is almost seamless. Adams has a true gift for writing: you feel like you are right there beside Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest. You can feel the tension, live the suspense. There is not a single word in this novel that does not belong. And when all of those words are strung together, they make for a powerful, soulful punch.Perhaps the best part of Watership Down is the feeling of contentment it leaves you with at the bittersweet end. You can just sit there for a moment, and think back over the journey the characters went through. You come away from the experience satisfied.I highly recommend this stirring book, Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I was first introduced to this book in seventh grade. We referred to it as the dreaded, hated, despised bunny book. I was much too young to even begin to understand the deaper meanings of this book or to appreciate it in the least bit. I have now revisited it as an adult. It's as if the light bulb came on. It all makes sense to me now.Richard Adams does an amazing job of explaining the inner workings of the rabbit world. You learn new vocabulary and begin to appreciate the complexity of nature (Yes I know it's ficiton, but for a second you can almost imagine this is all real, and that's the beauty of the book.) This is another one of those books that just because you are capable of reading the words does not mean you are capable of understanding the book. This should not be read to seventh graders or junior high for that matter unless you are an excpetional teacher and/or have exceptional students."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book, pages torn and cover long gone, has been the staple of my library for 15 years. I read it for pleasure long before I was given it to read in school. The story of these simple rabbits tells so much about human society - from our inability to accept what we cannot change, to the basic need of a warm, safe place to call our own. I cannot recommend this book enough; it does not matter if you are 12 or 32 or 102, this book shows us all how simple life can be, how even our greatest adversaries are not invincible, and how the the faintest of inklings can lead to the greatest wonders of all. Their friendship, love and loyalty endears these rabbits to every reader who follows their adventures, marvels at their simplicity, and falls in love with their story."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down was a very interesting book to read. Lots of points in the novel I liked and/or disliked. I liked the second and the third part of the more than the first, because the first part of Watership Down was not very exciting to me.During the first part I could not get \\"into\\" the book. After I had read into the second part I found myself spending long periods of time reading the novel, finding it hard to set down. I really didn't like reading about when they where about to leave the warren and their trip to the new warren. I disliked the stories of El-ahrairah, mostly because they made me read an extra twenty to thirty pages, but also that they weren't very exciting in my opinon. The Lapine language was not necessary to me, on some occasions it confused me. Overall I liked most of the novel.Watership Down was in some ways different and the same in other ways in comparison with other novels I have read. It was well written just like most of the novels I have read, and also it had hardships and good-fortune.The novel was different because it had parts written in Lapine and it was in a rabbits point of view. Watership Down was a very different book.My overall expression of Watership Down was that I loved it! Once you get into it, there is never a dull moment. I would reccommend this novel to others, if they are looking for a exciting adventure. I would reccommend it because you learn a lot during the story, and whenever you see another rabbit you will think of this book. I hope many other people will have the opportunity to experience Watership Down."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"To be strictly honest, I must say that when I first started reading Watership Down, I braced myself for a boring, dragging story about some rabbits. However, 2 chapters into the book and I was hooked. For the two and a half hours it took to read straight through it, I forgot food, sleep, and my own humanity. I became engrossed with the lives Richard Adams created for these rabbits: their culture, their deities, and most of all, their struggle for life and survival. This book contains all a fantasy could ask for: a mystic that sees the future, a strong capable leader with the brains, and a strong capable leader with the brawn. It also has a fast-paced, action filled plot; keeping the reader constantly wondering what will happen next. The book opens in a large thriving community of rabbits, called the Sandleford warren. Fiver, the mystic, has a terrible vision of destruction heading for their home. Being undersized and thought insignificant, his brother, Hazel goes to speak for him. Naturally, they are not believed and are almost arrested. To escape the impending doom, a small group of rabbits leave the warren and embark on a journey to find a new home. On the way they meet friends, enemies, havens and hell. Who knew the lives of animals could be so interesting? Meet the strange rabbits whose nature has been twisted and deformed, a sadistic dictator who knows no reason, and hold your breath as the rabbits brush with death several times. See the human world through the eyes of animals; discover what our cars, actions, and even our cigarettes mean to them! I admit you might feel at first, disinclined to pick this book up, but once you're done, you will reap its rewards."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"How do you review a book this excellent? Of course, no one needs another review on Hazel and Fiver and the bunch, but ... how can I resist?When you're thinking of reading this book, please don't think it is some thick, depressing and/or literary take on children's rabbit stories. That's what I was afraid it was going to be, but I started reading it anyway...Then, the first page was full of plant descriptions and stuff... and I was ready to close the book, thinking ::I bet this is going to be boring AND depressing!::. Thoroughly, not-quite-fairly fed up (I hadn't even given it a decent chance), I flipped to the back page before I gave up and closed the book.You're not supposed to do that. But it saved the book for me.I was immediately struck by the parallel between the first and last lines of the book. The first line is: &quot;The primroses were over.&quot;The last line of the book ended with &quot;... where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.&quot;Silly thing to be impressed by, huh? But it did -- impress me, that is. It meant: this author is going to play fair. He wants to come full circle.He means to give me a feel-good ending that is both literarily and emotionally impressive.And he did. He did.Five stars is far too few."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was assigned to me in December, and I couldn't tell you how much I was dreading this book about rabbits. And I hae to truthfully tell you that the first two chapters tend to drag on andyou will count the mintues that pass. But Parts 3 and 4 make up for it and more. It is a fantastic book with many new and exciting adventures. A group of 14 rabbits trying to find a new home overcomming hardships. If you like Lord of the Rings, try reading the book that started it all."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This book was one of the best reads I have ever experienced. The world created by the author, and the characters that are placed in that world are timeless. It reads the same today as it did in the early 70's. Time does not destroy this story in any way. The lavish world created and the expereinces of the rabbits is excellent. Before I read this book, I thought the book was geared towards being more of a childrens book, but found that it really wasn't. Any person of any age should enjoy the struggles of life as a rabbit. The story is so well told, and the details were elaborate so that i could visualize the world in my head so easily. If you are thinking of buying this book, then I suggest you do because you will not be disappointed. It is a fabulous work of art in my opinion."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"After reading Watership Down, I can truly say that it was one of the best books that I have ever read. Reading this book was an incredible experience-going on adventures with Hazel and his friends, listening to the stories of El-ahrairah, and learning from them, was a time that I will never forget.One of the most enjoyable aspects of the novel were the characters. Richard Adams brilliantly describes them in rich detail so you feel like you have known them all of your life. They are in such detail that they are like people, with feelings, hopes and ambitions. After finishing the novel, I felt like calling up Hazel on the phone to see how the warren was, or maybe call up Dandelion for a story about El- ahrairah and his many adventures. After reading the novel, I have such vivid pictures of these characters in my mind. Although I loved all the characters in the novel, there was one who really stood out in my mind. That character was Hazel, the leader of the rabbits in the story. Hazel led the group of then hlessil (wandering rabbits) through the wilderness, and got them a home. Then after finding a home Hazel defended and preserved it. Without Hazel, these rabbits would probably have died. I admire Hazel because of his great qualities: kindness, leadership, and forgivingness, for when he let Strawberry come along with them after leaving Cowslip's warren. To me, Hazel is now like an old friend who will be imprinted in my mind forever. Richard Adams does an outstanding job of creating characters. Watership Down is a long book-over 400 pages, so an important step in writing the book would be how to keep the reader interested.I admit, when I went to the library to get Watership Down, after it was recommended to me, I was intimidated by its size. I've read long books before, but this one was one of the longest. While reading the book, I was very surprised at how fast it went. With its wonderful characters, meaningful events, and a whole culture of the rabbit way of life the pages seem to turn themselves. When reading the book, Adams makes it so that you want to know what happens next. There are some scenes where someone is close to death and you feel compelled to read very quickly in search of what will happen to that person. There were more than a few close calls in Watership Down. Richard Adams has a remarkable gift for writing an exciting and interesting novel.Above all, reading Watership Down was a learning experience. I learned that with perseverance and determination you can achieve anything. Hazel and his friends left their warren with nothing, and they went on to succeed at anything that came in their way. Also, on the smaller scale, I leaned that just because a book is over 400 pages doesn't mean that it is unreadable. Watership Down is now one of my most favorite books. In terms of recommending it, I would recommend it to everyone above ages 8 or 9 because it is a very complex story that you have to focus all your attention on. Watership Down is an extraordinary novel about friendship, determination, and adventure that everyone should experience."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"You can read the other reviews to learn what the story line is...I just wanted to say I love this book every time I read it. It keeps me enthralled, it is adorable, sensitive and just charming. One of the books in my permanent library."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I first read &quot;Watership Down&quot; a long time ago- I believe I was in 3rd grade when I first tackled it. As people who've read this book know, that is a pretty young age to read something like this- but, luckily, even at the age I had an aptitude for great literature, and this book is definitely great literature. Even now, much later, I still think of Watership Down as one of the best books I've ever read.Of course, this book may not be for everyone. The first factor that probably makes the biggest difference is that this book is pretty much about talking animals. I know that many people simply imagine this concept and decide that this book is not for them. And, in fact, that may be true; I know many people who probably would not come away from this book enlightened, or happier for the effort. However, if you give it a chance, there's a very good probability that you will be glad you did.You see, unlike the classic idea of talking animals, which dominates most Disney movies, this book approaches the entire concept differently; instead of simply imposing human thoughts and personalities superficially onto the animals, mainly rabbits, Richard Adams (the author) develops his characters as any characters should be developed; slowly, carefully, but deliberately. Despite the fact that the characters aren't human, they hold almost all aspects of human characters, and in the end they become quite realistic.In its simplicity, this story is a classic story of adventure, discovery, and the pursuit of righteousness and freedom. It begins surprisingly dramatically, with a desperate escape by a band of rabbits from their warren (community). The rabbits are driven from this warren, and narrowly escape a terrible destruction from man. For the rest of the book the story follows this band of rabbits and their adventures searching for a new home. While this seems like a classic formula story, the plot becomes very complex and enjoyable, and by the time you read to the end, in which a final battle must take place, you most likely won't be able to put the book down.As I said, this story in its simplest form is a classic story of adventure. However, upon closer examination you notice many things that make it much deeper; things like philosiphical questions of ethics and freedom, subtle but complex ideas that give this story its true power. All of this is encompassed in this book, and it is wonderfully told. Richard Adams' work is full of suspense and drama- the mood and tone of it make it come across beautifully. And, as the reader finds out, there is underlying meaning- often the rabbits' societies mirror our own in an eerie, subtle way.Overall, this book is extremely worthwhile, and succeeds on all levels. If you are willing to give this book a chance, you will surely be rewarded with a great experience and a broader view on life itself."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"What more can be said about Watership Down?? Its everything that a piece of literature should be: thought-provoking, creative, and supremely entertaining. Whether you wish to disect the allegory in the book, or simply follow it as a charming and fun story about a group of rabbits, the bottom line is you will enjoy this book.One of the wonderful things that Adams accomplishes with Watership Down is to humanize the rabbits: their characters and traits are recognizable and relatable, so you actually care about them. In addition to fine characterization, Adams throws in action, suspense, and a noble quest to weave a near-perfect tale. As a side note, Adams' followup Tales Of Watership Down is vastly inferior to the original, but is still a decent read.If you have not read this book, please do yourself the favor. Watership Down also makes a great gift for any avid readers you might know (just be sure to first find out whether they already own it!)."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Watership Down is seriously one of the most enthralling children's books that I have ever read. It has become almost a bible for other books on the same subject. Like Tolkein's Lord of the Rings was for fantasy, Watership Down will inspire animal story writers for ages to come.This is a story of rabbits. Yes, I know that may sound stupid, but never have the characters of a novel had so much personality, been so brave, touching and winning. It is about Hazel, a calm, sensitive, level-headed rabbit, born to be a leader, Bigwig, a rabbit with a flaming temper and a strong will, and Fiver who can tell when bad things are coming.The story begins when Fiver senses one such bad thing and convinces Hazel, his brother, to gather a small group of rabbits and leave their warren in Sandford, England. So begins their journey.The rabbits travel until they find a perfect place to begin a new warrren-watership down. Unfortunately, every time you think the rabbits will settle down and everything will be alright again, things get shaken up and once more the reader gets pages of breath taking action.Also, this book is encredibly well written. every page must have taken great care. For instance, the first and last sentence are both about primroses. Then there are the wonderful El- ahrairah stories. I loved them all. One of them even made me cry. They are beautiful stories about the legendary rabbit hero, El- ahrairah, and the rabbit God, Frith. Sometimes, amusing, sometimes tragic, sometimes refreshing, they added an extra layer to the story.In conclusion, do not be put off by the fact that this book is about rabbits. It is brilliant. It deserves a place of honour on every bookshelf."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is the only book that I have read more than once. I will be reading it again.

(New York)Watership Down by Richard Adams is a wonderful fiction story that I loved. It started off a bit slowly, but very soon after, it became very fast paced. I would recomend this book to animal lovers, and those who just love a good read.Watership Down is about a bunch of rabbits who leave their warren. Fiver, one of the smaller rabbits, had a vision that danger was coming. So he and his friend Hazel head off with a few others to find a new place to live. They face many dangers, but eventually find a place. Yet even then, they have hardships to face. Many times I was driven to tears.In many stories where the animals talk and are the main characters, humans don't exist. What I loved about this book is that humans do exist, and play a major role in the story. I also loved how you could easily relate to some of the characters. Myself, I'm a lot like Fiver. Fiver is very small and quiet. However, there was something that I didn't like about the book.Richard Adams sprinkles the rabbit speech, Lapine, in with what they say. Some words you can remember the meanings of, like 'elil' (enemy). But there are some words that aren't used as often, so you have to look them up in the glossary. It tends to slow down the reading a bit.All in all, I loved this book. The one or two minor flaws that it possesses can easily be overlooked. The book is wonderful, and I would gladly read it again."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"My sixth-grade teacher was a jerk. Plain and simple. The man was an absolute terror--he'd make Professor Snape look like Captain Kangaroo.But he did have one redeeming characteristic: He introduced me to the amazing \\"Watership Down\\". He read several chapters of it aloud in class, and this was the first Hardcover I ever purchased. I absorbed this book, fascinated by the characters, enthralled by the setting, thrilled by the amazing writing of Richard Adams who, in my opinion, never equalled this amazing novel.I learned a valuable lesson from that teacher: Even the worst among us have something to contribute. I had a miserable year in Mr. Lin****'s class (name changed to protect the guilty, donthca know), but reading \\"Watership Down\\" made it almost bearable. You should buy this book. NOW."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"I remembered this book from 5th grade reading. Someone mentioned it to me recently, so I went back and revisited it after over 20 years. I read it over a 24 hour period.The story reads like a very long bed time story, very exciting and thrilling. The most exciting part of the book is the last third in my opinion, but most of the book is fascinating. In today's age of short attention span, it's hard to feel the tension of rabbit squaring up against a rat, so things need to be put in perspective. But, the author definitely gets points for the metaphors and symbolism of the various rabbit warrens and what they mean to a human society. Also, a wonderful good vs. evil showdown in the end.As a pure story, it is very exciting and worth a read. From the point of view of a literary masterpiece, I do not think I could go that far. Other than a handful of characters (which are developed nicely), there isn't much development on the sub characters. Many of the transitions are abrupt, the dialogue is sometimes redundant, The narrators POV constantly changes from 3rd person Hazel, to Omniscient, to third person Bigwig.Adam's is a wonderful story teller. His strengths are concept, orginality, and adventure. The book is perfect for a 9-16 year old and maybe for some old timers looking to be nostalgic. Also recommend the movie if you liked the book."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"Published in the early 1970s, Watership is one of those great, rare novels that you first discover as a child and then rediscover years later as an adult. Think of Tolkien's The Hobbit or Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. It is the story of exile and myth and the clever touch was to use rabbits-yes, rabbits, the little furry creatures in the fields-as the protagonists and antagonists. When you read this as a child, you enjoy the grand adventure of it all. When you read this later as an adult, you suddenly see grand, serious adult themes that Adams takes very seriously. Consequently, Watership tends to inspire real devotion among its readers."},{"Title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of my most favorite books!! See?
