There is only one word out of place (one pronoun with an ambiguous antecedent). The story is told from multiple points of view and includes a variety of sad and sordid relationships but ends with a vision of love nearly unequaled in literature.One overarching theme is the relationship between love and control. As we know today, control is often manfested in anger but also in eating disorders. Yes, two of the main characters would be called anorexic today. Emily Bronte herself probably died of anorexia--her coffin was less than 20 inches wide.This is romantic in the traditional sense: Wuthering Heights emphasizes emotion. And when emotional people are thwarted, they turn angry. Add love, jealousy, class conflict, sibling rivalry, supernatural dreams, and the wild moors of Yorkshire, you've got a gothic novel that has been often imitated but seldom duplicated.Because of the multiple narrators, there is one warning. Many of the episodes are told more than once from different points of view. In each case, though, the perspectives are so different that you might not even realize at first that you are reading about the same event.If you want to read a fascinating story and want a sense of how a great story should be told, read Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A TRULY EXCELLENT EDITION of this strangest and strongest of English novels,hauntingly beautiful in its impassionate poetry,a novel that reads us instead of the other way round,more about important questions than about too trivial answers.The text is roughly the same than Clarendon's reference one, without correcting the error at the beginning of Chapter 16 (we get \\"inhabitants\\" for \\"inhabitant\\", and the reason for NOT emending both 1847 and 1850 readings, although duly explained in a note, is most incredible). The punctuation is even a bit heavier than Clarendon's(I fear a bit too heavy for American habits) and the implied two-volume division with independent chapter numbering looks as funny and cumbersome as in Oxford's.The Introduction, although shorter than Stoneman's for Oxford, is excellent nonetheless. So are the notes, that more often than not give full quotation of the references involved, while Oxford gives only the references. Material production is as bad as you fear and then some, as regards paper quality and binding: pages will get brown in only five years (and Oxford's don't fare much better). Printing quality, on the other hand, is fair-to-good.Don't miss the very first page (the one about Emily Bront life),then read Lucasta Miller's preface,skip both the excellent Pauline Nestor Introduction and the controversial\\"Charlotte's materials\\" (the Biographical Notice and the Preface to the New),and -giving an attentive glance to the Genealogical Tree- go to the TEXT (perusing the notes).Afterwards you will do well to read the previously skipped material, and, perhaps some months later, to peruse the excellent Bibliography.IN SUMMARY: as far as text, Introduction and notes are concerned, no other edition is better. Material production and durability, on the other side, are even a little worse than Oxford World's Classics.Have a haunting, unforgettable read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is one book I've read over and over again, to understand how it appears to other people. Whomsoever have I met consider it to be rude and strange at first. What this book means to me is unsurpassed literature. It depicts rough love- a love that is as wild as the moors of England. Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte. Wish there were more novels like this one!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a novel that creates a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine. This is not however a regular love story. Bronte's ability to create real emotions puts Wuthering Heights in a category far from a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story. Bronte's remarkable ability to conceive almost twisted stories can be seen not to far into the story. It can be seen once Mr. Earnshaw brings home Heathcliff, basically treats Heathcliff as his son and neglects his birth son, and Catherine begins to love Heathcliff that the story will be far from regular. Bronte uses these unique ironies to create detailed stories.In this book Bronte uses her ability to mimic real human reactions in her characters come about. Such as when Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw die Hindley, their birth son, forces Heathcliff to leave because of his hatred towards him. Hindley knew his father loved Heathcliff more than him and he couldn't stand it. Heathcliff leaving causes problems between. It's Ironic that when Heathciff comes home after three years because of his love for Catherine, she has already married another, Edgar Linton.Emily Bronte's story obviously wasn't that of a regular love story. Not too long after Heathcliff comes home Catherine dies. Heathcliff becomes filled with anger and seeks revenge. He causes pain to all that have hurt him or are related to those that hurt them. Although Bronte didn't create a storybook love story she does end it, in a way, like a love story should end. The lovers are of course united in death. I liked this story by Emily Bronte because it wasn't just a regular love story with a happy ending. Although it did end with the lovers together, it is hardly a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story and the plat twist and intricacies make it a memorable story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading Wuthering Heights is like a journey into a dream abound with entangled relationships, bitter vengeance, and how the innocent heirs from feuded families struggle to escape the macabre legacy of the past. The person who unraveled the history behind Wuthering Heights was Lockwood, a new tenant of the Thrushcross Grange who was forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord Heathcliff.Heathcliff was kidnapped and shipped to England, grew up under the roof of the Earnshaws. Old Earnshaw took a liking of the young Heathcliff while his son Hindley persistently and insidiously grumbled long string of tales against him and treated him like a house servant after the old Earnshaw passed away. At Wuthering Heights the young Heathcliff cultivated a consummate bonding with Catherine Earnshaw who later on betrayed him and married Edgar Linton.LoveThe novel's pivot tends to focus on the power of the central relationship between Catherine Earnshaw-Linton and Heathcliff. However dark and vindictive the novel might have turned out, the work's attraction, as a love story is not difficult to extract. Catherine loved Heathcliff because he was more herself than she was. Their souls were made of the same materials. Her soul, her heart, and her conscience reproved and convinced her that it was wrong to marry Linton, though Heathcliff might appear to be an unreclaimed, uncultivated creature, which would degrade her. In her final words to Heathcliff, the embittered Catherine Earnshaw writhed in torment. Here the novel has attained to the fullness the celebration of such transcendent love, which has surpassed the bounds of mundanity and death, despite the fact that their reunion was marked by dejection, regret, and bitterness. To Heathcliff the entire world was such a dreadful conviction of memoranda that he had lost his beloved Catherine Earnshaw, even though her daughter Cathy asserted that nobody would love him nor cry for him when he died.VengeanceHeathcliff's eye-for-an-eye vengeance visited upon the next generation. To revenge on Hindley Earnshaw's being acrimonious to him, Heathcliff determined to make Hindley's son Hareton a brute. He never taught him how to read or write, never rebuked him for any bad habit and never led him a single step toward virtue. When Heathcliff later became master of Wuthering Heights, he reduced Hareton to a mere house servant and deprived him of any wages. Edgar's daughter Cathy was forced to marry Heathcliff's sickly son Linton who braced the brawl of the previous generation by reviving how Cathy's mother had betrayed the man she loved for her father Edgar Linton. Through his son Heathcliff meant to usurp Edgar Linton's property at Thrushcross Grange and confiscated Cathy's fortune. The heirs (Cathy Linton, Hareton Earnshaw, and Linton) strived to escape from the bitter rift of the previous generation. The second half of the novel (volume ii) somewhat signifies such restoration of order and balance in this second generation.Dream/Stream-of-ConsciousnessThe appearance of Catherine Earnshaw's ghost in the early part of the novel proves to be such an appropriate notion to set the tone of Wuthering Height. The house servant only proved the house was haunted at the expense of the new tenant Lockhood, the ghost also challenged the limits of life. Wuthering Heights as a whole conveys a sense of vagueness and ambiguous plausibility. The notion of dream proved to be a significant source of understanding as both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff envisaged their happiness in dreams, and Catherine articulated the dreams' informing power to Ellen Dean, who narrated the story to Lockwood over the span of a night at Heathcliff's abode. The warped sense of time, the geographical remoteness, and social aloofness contribute to a dreamlike, stream-of-conscious setting. Such dreamlike setting offers an uncensored realm, free of logic and boundaries, to the transgression of identity, sexuality, violence, and vengeance.\\"May you not rest, as long as I am living. You said I killed you - haunt me, then.\\" The book obviates a transcendent love that surpasses grief and death. It is meant to be haunting. 4.5 stars.2004 (1)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Several years ago, tired of reading the latest novels, I decided after a few forays into classic literature that maybe I should devote more time to them. After all, anything hailed as a \\"great literary work\\" by millions of people has to be good, right?I'm glad this wasn't the first classic I picked up, because I never would have continued reading them. The book itself isn't all that thick, which while I prefer thick, I was grateful it wasn't in this case. It is a book about torment. Everyone in it is in a perpetual state of plain, downright torment. And the kicker is they bring it on themselves. Reading it I felt bad for Heathcliff as a child and sympathised with his plight. The fireworks begin after Heathcliff returns from some unnamed place or places with millions in the bank. The apple of his eye is the wishy-washy (I just can't come up with a more fitting term for so wretched a woman) Catherine, who can't make up her mind what to do throughout the book until her dying breath. Thank God that happened.When I read a book I generally try to find a connection with one of the characters, someone who might share the same views as I would or who might take the same action as I would in certain circumstances, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a single one. I found myself more or less taking the side of Edgar, although he wasn't very enjoyable either. As for Heathcliff I felt like reaching into the book, smacking him around a few good hours while screaming \\"Get over it!\\" Wuthering Heights is filled to bursting with detestable people doing deplorable things for no other reason than greed, selfishness, and what must be some kind of masochistic desire for misery. And Heathcliff is the King of Pain in this one. I felt actual relief at his passing as I would that of a rabid dog.This would be a one star review, but for the last 40 pages where at least some semblence of hope and happiness comes to this stupid book, something it was completely devoid of throughout the rest of it. It's a wonder half of England didn't commit suicide out of severe depression after reading it when it was first released. Even more troubling is that the up and coming youth who read this tend to really believe it's a classic \\"love story\\". Heaven help us.Want torturous love but with actual hope and happiness sprinkled through it? Try \\"War and Peace\\" by Tolstoy.

I very much enjoyed it once I got going although it took a couple of chapters to do so."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After a years of putting up with Amazon's breathtaking contempt for books, I have to say something here. The reason there are \\"1,000\\" reviews of the Norton Critical Fourth Edition of Wuthering Heights is that Amazon is dumping all the reviews of any edition of Wuthering Heights into one worthless jumble. Note that the initial description of \\"the book\\" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement. If you click on the book image in hopes of at least looking at the table of contents, you are taken to \\"another edition,\\" which turns out to be some high school class knockoff lacking even an introduction. Want to know what's inside the NCE Fourth? Too bad.It is routine at Amazon to not bother with copyright dates, so if you sort an author's work \\"by publication\\" you get the most recent printing, not the order of publication. Try finding a chronologically ordered list of a mystery series here. Would it be hard to create one? Of course not. But who cares? Not Amazon.Where this database slovenliness get criminal is when Amazon piles together British and U.S. editions of an author's work with no indication that a \\"new title\\" is actually the U.K. title of a book already available in the U.S. (Carol O'Connell's Magic Men is Shell Game, Find Me is Shark Music, etc.). The luckless shopper ends up with a duplicate title and shipping charges up the wazoo. Even worse is the conflation of prints of classic films, where a review of a blurry knockoff edition of Seven Samurai gets a top listed review that praises the sharp quality of the DVD and fails to mention that the review refers to the pricey Criterion edition.

The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world. I can imagine that it would be shocking in its day, but in the era of slasher movies, it's merely a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A little slow starting but the mystery of it holds you.

I'll agree with other readers, it's hard to tell who's leading the narrative. It's also hard to tell the relations of the characters until quite a ways into the book.

I chose this novel for my 12th grade students to read and I decided that I would never again read it. It takes too long for everyone to realize Heathcliff is a jerk. I think that if anyone is interested in reading the Brontes to read Charlotte. If anyone is interested in reading literature from that era, read Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, one of the Bronte sisters, (the most famous being Charlotte, who wrote Jane Eyre) wrote a classic Gothic romance, chalk-full of the emotions and pathos that a tragic romance encompasses. As a literary work, it is well written and at paar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. This audio book, narrated finely, with a delightful box cover, makes a striking Valentines day gift for women. The story is set in the lush, dark moors of northern England, and centers around a wealthy family and the doomed romance of Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine comes from a well-to-do family, set in their ways, and all of her societal expectations are heavy on her shoulders. She falls in love with Heathcliff, a deep, spiritual, soulful love, but unfortunately one that could not be consummated. Heathcliff was taken into Catherine's family as an orphan. Heathcliff and Catherine's love, described in the most romantic of terms, is so strong that there is one scene in which Catherine calls out to him in despair, when she is married to another man for his status and convenient position as a powerful family friend, and Heathcliff is able to hear her from his distant stance.The novel is Gothic, although there is no supernatural going-ons and the usual horror that can be associated with Gothic novels. It is a novel full of the dark despair and tragedy of two lovers who can not be together. The character of Heathcliff, in particular, cannot be considered heroic. He is brooding, he is dark, he vows revenge against those who have taken Catherine from him. Likewise, Catherine cannot fulfill the profile of an innocent, hopelessly romantic girl. She is instead, a vain, egotistical and bourgeois materialist, marrying a man for his money and not for his love. But although the immediate situation that occurs with Heathcliff and Catherine, Heathcliff's subsequent vendetta and extraction of revenge are the darkest aspects, the promising and more idealistic love transpires between their children (eventhough they are children of other parents). With stunning narration and a classic feel to the whole thing, this makes a perfect gift on the day that celebrates romance and true love- Valentine's Day."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't read it yet -- downloaded for future reading. . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Downboaded to read on a trip.

Throughout the book, which basically, once started, takes three addictive days, themes of love and hate protrude from the pages. Though a first-person narrative, the novel becomes for the majority, a recollection of events in the past as dictated to the narrator. I assure you, once you read this book, you will relate to these words: pity Heathcliffe!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is an excellent story of love and hate. Both love and hate are powerful forces, but Bronte shows that loves conquers all in her book. I enjoyed this book and gave it a ten because Bronte shows that two people can be brought together in life and death. This book never has a dull moment once you really understand it, and from that point on, you fall in love with all of the outgoing characters. One woman is torn between love of a man and his money and love of a soulmate. Just because the soulmate is not rich, she will not marry him, and then starts the hate and jealousy. Even though the girl could not be with her soulmate in life, they are together after death. Bronte overall shows how revenge can drive a person to their graves, and how love always overcomes hate. -G.

Even though I didn't fall head over heals for the book, there are some aspects of it that I happened to like. As on page 230, where Heathcliif put Liton and Cathy out of the room and Linton feels the full affect of his rage and illness as &quot;his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushing from his mouth, and he fell on the ground&quot;. The fact there was blood in the excert didn't make it an eye catcher, but the fact that it was so well described. The way she wrote it made me close my eyes and visualize Liton at a door have an attack. I said the book was interesting as well as dull. The dullness happened to come at the very begining when Mr.Lockwood was the narrarator. The issue I had at the start of the book was the fact that the long and drawn out details of the kitchen. On page three, Emily Bronte took all my energy out of finishing the book. It seems as if she spent years reasearching design, and decided to put it in the book. She describes the floor &quot;of smooth, white stone&quot; the chairs as being &quot;high backed, primitive structures, painted green&quot;. Just to give you a taste, I only chose to write a few descriptions. but the book is filled with what seemed to me endless dribble of description."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Dear Readers, I found Wuthering Heights to be both depressing and uplifting in different ways. This book took very sharp turns in the charactor's lives. I found that this was what made this book so interesting. It is hard to explain my feelings on this book without giving away the ending, but I would recomend this book to every young adult. This book is about personal choices and in a way about moral values. The way that one person can learn from their elders. I feel that every young adult should read this book before going on their own."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_ is a decent book about a man named Heathcliff who did not get to marry the girl he loved, therefore he dedicated his life to making everyone else as miserable as he was. This book had a few unrealistic parts and was not always practical, but it did have a pretty good plot line. I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other.

Like the idea of marrying your own cousin was something i thought of as nasty, and would never happen. But after reading this book my views chang, but I still find it wrong. The book starts off slow and boring, but the middle of the book gets alot better. The love that Catherine and Heathcliff have for each other is something almost magical. But then the book has a cruel plot in which they never get a chance to get married, or really a chance at love. Like when Catherine quotes &quot;I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again:&quot; (Bronte 74-75). This love story ends in a cruel twist of fate for them, but Heathcliff plans revenge after he can't get his love. So for the rest of the book you get a chance to witness Heathcliff's evil heart at work, and his revenge on the Earnshaw's and Linton's."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contains a complex, confusing and unreal story. Bronte begins with the end of the book, thus making readers think backwards in sequence. Also, Catherine and young Catherine become harder to tell apart as the story progresses. Bronte refers to both girls as &quot;Catherine&quot; and &quot;Cathy.&quot; Another baffling subject, the coincidence that the second generation coincides with the first. Catherine, Heathcliff and Edgar's relationship corresponds to Cathy, Hareton and Linton's relationship. Also, was it per chance that young Cathy's birth and Catherine's death lie on the same day? Bronte utilizes the first generation to model the second, making the story predictable and not interesting. Carrie Chandler"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, to me, portrays a sorrowful story that shows the thin line between love and hate. Throughout the book the characters would reveal their love for one another; then all of a sudden, they would betray their loved ones. Like when Linton would express his love and gratitude for Cathy, and then quickly despise her when Heathcliff tells him she only wants him for his money. Heathcliff's attitude also changes. His impressions and appearance seemed very nice to young Cathy at first when they met at Wurthering Heights (199). Heathcliff also kidnaps her and Nelly, and strikes her (247). I also believe that Heathcliff did not start all of the problems. Cathy brought her woeful death upon own herself. She did not follow her heart; she should have married Heathcliff instead of Edgar. Isabella shouldn't have been so dumbfounded about marrying Heathcliff so quickly without really getting to know his true personality. For a while the book seemed kind of dull, and did not make any sense at first, but once I reached the apex of the story it seemed to get pretty interesting. JR.WBHS"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really don't see what has made Wuthering Heights a &quot;classic.&quot; I'll admit Cathy and Heathcliff's love was probably the strongest love I've ever read about. However the hate and darkness in the book pretty much drowns out the love story. Most of Heathcliff's hate is derived from Catherine's love but most of his actions are very severe. I believe the reason he acts like he does after Catherine's death is because he is without his &quot;soul.&quot; Death pretty much occupied the whole book. Almost everyone died and it caused people to act in strange ways. As strong as Cathy and Heathcliff's love was, I believe that Bronte's obsession with death and revenge drowned out this love. Again I pose the question, Why on earth is this book a &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon reading Wuthering Heights, I rate the book a 3 from 1 to 10. Such a low score relates to the long, drawn out wordiness on insignificant parts to the story. Over exaggeration of minor details really confused me in this book. The book made me think that a long, drawn out explanation of a minor detail such as Mr. Lockwood's description of Catherine's library as &quot;... select book choices,..&quot; delapidated &quot; (16) was important but as I completed the book, I realized it was just another attempt to go on and on. I feel if this book became a play people would say it is melodramatic and boring. The plot did grab my attention ( I must admit), and for that reason I gave the book a 3 instead of a 1. However, I think Bronte really &quot;messed up&quot; a developed, intringuing story line with insignificant details that gave readers the idea that the point contained a hidden point that one might find later in the book or one people needed to know. I mean, Who cares how Catherine kept her book collection. The story contains a completely different plot!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte, Emily Bront's elder sister, wrote that \\"Wuthering Heights was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials\\". This makes sense when we learn that Emily Bront did not care for social life (perhaps due to her extreme shyness) and seemed to scorn the outer world, living contentedly in the bleak scenario of the Yorkshire moors where her clergyman father's parsonage was located. Thus, it was with these \\"homely materials\\" - the wild Yorkshire landscape and its dour inhabitants - that she fashioned her only novel, which is, however, anything but homely.... The book is at the same time beautifully passionate and completely spare in its imagery and the depiction of its characters. The narrative is multifaceted and skilfully employs the technique of using several narrators: Lockwood, the naive Londoner who rents a Yorkshire farm in his search for picturesque landscapes; the commonplace and down-to-earth witness to the novel's amazing events, Nelly Dean; Isabella, the scorned and unloved wife; and so on. Each of these characters lends his or her particular voice to the story, thus making it a sort of patchwork where there seems to be no \\"official\\" version - but which is at the same time seamlessly cohesive.One reviewer, surprisingly, goes so far as to say that Cathy married Edgar for the money (she belongs to the same social class as he does - it is Heathcliff, the slum waif, who is the outsider) and that Heathcliff takes the kid Hindley and teaches him to hate his father (incidentally, the boy that Heathcliff takes under his \\"care\\" is not Hindley but Hindley's son, Hareton). In order to be qualified for writing a review, readers should make at least a honest effort at reading and understanding the book.I believe that the biggest mistake that readers tend to make on approaching \\"Wuthering Heights\\", a mistake perhaps fueled by Hollywood, is to think of it as a romance or love story - which it only secondarily is. This is, above all, a family saga, spanning some three decades and concerned with one individual's revenge on the families he considers to have wronged him. It is also a portrait of human passions - love, hatred, anguish and grief - in a wild, desolate setting where the forces of nature cannot be kept at bay.All in all, a work of great strength and beauty. It would have done Emily Bront a lot of good to know that her masterpiece has at last received the recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book has haunted me from the day i've read it. however i'd read it again because it is written so well. Heathcliff and cathy show a love so intense and deep that hatred creeps into those very soulls who once loved more. a story which unfolds gradually, emily bronte has shown immense skill and talent and in the end produced a masterpiece which will never be forgotten.be patient though, it gets too dark and slow at times. but do read it ........its definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although Wuthering Heights is written in very old english and is not easy to read, the story itself is very touching, romantic and parts of it is tragic.Heathcliff, an orphan, is raised by Mr Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrivle vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.This is a book which gets quite intense and the relationships between the characters get quite complicated but it is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was required reading for my Senior English Literature (I was 17) and it was one of the many books that I enjoyed that year. It probably helped that I had read &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i> when I was 12 or so and again in the same English Lit class in high school. It helped me get used to the style and time period. However, as much as I enjoyed &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i>, I liked Emily's writing and story telling much better.It is tragic story about passion, hatred, romance and a love that reaches beyond the grave. If you haven't already, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read many classics, I am an avid reader of them. I collect them all, and analyze which ones are truly classic. I got this book when I was younger than 10, which is pretty heavy stuff for a child. Yet I focused mainly on the actual misery of Heathcliff and Catherine, I think it is the most engrossing and provocative story ever. I also got nauseous from the constant &quot;happy&quot; storie that other kids were reading. I thought this book suits my deep, &quot;tortured soul&quot; kind of reader. I will always have this book on my top list, it actually is timeless. This book will make you yearn for the open moors and the old manor where Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine. It is the best love story I have ever read. If someone is overwhelmed by it, then I suggest to move to something a little bit more shallow. I know I follow this great example of literature in my own writings, which I hope to have published soon. Not for the impatient reader, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights met my expectations as well as exceeded them. I will admit i was tempted to give the novel four stars because of the difficulty in grasping the intricate intertwining of the characters. BUT I came to realize that the genius in the novel lies within the geniusly thought out symmetrical family plots. Many describe the novel as being very dark, but i , on the other hand, describe Wuthering Heights as being raw and original. Emily Bronte can only be marveled apon. How could someone with a secluded life, much as her characters lived, have such a great insight into these wild, but true characters? Its almost unbelievable, but I now give her respect, just as much as I have for her other remarkable sister Charlotte. Although Jane Eyre is still my favorite novel, Wuthering Heights is not far behind that coveted spot. READ WUTHERING HEIGHTS!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm fond of that novel because it tells you something about the dark side of man and besides that it's also a very profound love story. To be sure it is a really unusual love story because the two main characters never have a relationship like normal lovers have, they only become united after death. I very much liked that Catherine is close to us as readers. She is always present even though she is already dead at the beginning of the novel. But Nelly tells the story of her life and so it seems to the most natural thing in the world to talk about supernatural events and experiences. While reading the novel my feelings changed a lot, once I was very angry at Heathcliff, then I only felt contempt for Linton and his weakness. The novel is written in very thrilling way, you never know how Heathcliff will react next, he is so erratic. Even though Catherine is not an innocent person at all, you can feel with her and you can sympathise with her throughout the story. And although the character of Heathcliff is so mysterious and dark he attracts our attention in a special manner: He descends from a gypsy family and thus he represents the hidden and often violently suppressed sides of man."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the tale of the passionate and jealousy ridden love of Cathy and Heathclif. Fate, social class, and family separates them. The tale has amazing descriptions, themes, and characters. Violence, passion, and envy are all themes in the book. It is inspiring and wonderful, truly intriuging."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel, Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte was a good story about the love two people have for each other, and how that love is never lost. From the time that they were young children, Catherine and Heathcliff always had a certain liking for each other, that turned into a deep love. When Heathcliff found out that Catherine may have changed her mind, he was crushed and he vowed to get her back. He used other characters to avenge his love for Catherine and to make her jealous enough to come back to him, one example of that is Isabella. The character of Heathcliff is a somewhat of a selfish and savage character, because he does anything to get back to Catherine and to avenge the hate that is shown to him by Edgar and Hindley. The character of Catherine seems somewhat of an innocent character, who is caught up in what to do, and whether money and status is more important or true love is more important to her. Heathcliff's return to his true love causes problems with her and shows that love can be painful and cause agony sometimes. The characters in this novel were well developed and characterized, which is important to me when I read a novel. I think that the novel Wuthering Heights shows the ideas and opionins that Emily Bronte had about love and how it can effect the lives of people. I found this to be a pretty good novel, a little confusing at the beginning though. I, however, in comparison liked the novel, Jane Eyre, by her sister Charlotte, better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I confess that most of this book was completely over my head. There is a lot of passion in it, but it was a little to deep for me. I guess I'm more of the Jane Austen type. I'd recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by hate and dark passions."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My friend lent me this book, and at first I didn't want to read it, but I am SO glad that I did! One of my favorite parts is where Cathy is explaining her love for Heathcliff--&quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff!&quot; and the part where Heathcliff and Cathy are reunited. This book is one of the best i've ever read. Sorry I can't quote more extensively, but I don't have a copy handy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book. I love this book. I love this book. It is a story of human nature. I think we all know people like the characters herein in real life. Wuthering Heights is the apotheosis of the classic. I know two people, very close to home like Catherine and Heathcliff who never reached union in this life. There are so many undercurrents to be picked apart in Wuthering Heights. I chose the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine for my research paper. But there was the weather, and how it mirrored all the actions of all the characters in the novel. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was loathing this book, hating the heroine. Catherine Earnshaw is the most hateful and irritating woman in English Literature. Then, thankfully, around mid-point, Catherine Earnshaw does the reader a favor and dies, leaving the book to Heathcliff. The second half of the book, in which Heathcliff returns to exact his revenge, is one of the most gripping tales I have read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Since the age of 17 I have read this novel 6 times and I must say from the first time I opened its pages I was hooked. It is a story of the true love and true hate that is inherent in all human nature that engages its readers deeper and deeper with every word. Almost every character in the novel is both loved and hated by the reader at different times, and I always find myself longing for the reunion of Catherine and Heathcliff no matter how many times I read the story. Emily Bronte was an author well before her time, and I have read nothing so far that even compares to the beauty of this novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is by far the best book I've ever read. The important thing is that you read it slowly so you don't miss any important information. I cried several times throughout the story. My feelings towards the older Catherine and Heathcliff went back and forth throughout the book, but for the most part I liked Catherine and disliked Heathcliff. I like the way history repeated itself with Catherine's daughter and Hindley's son. It was a good way to conclude the story; it gave a feeling of things coming full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A delicious book to read. Full of meaning and symbolism, I do wonder why no one else had understood this book at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At times the reader despises a character in this book, the next minute he/she loves him/her (and vice versa)! All characters have flaws: Cathy's haughtiness, Edgar's wimpiness, Linton's peevishness, Heathcliff's evilness, but these flaws only make the characters more interesting.Take Hareton and Heathcliff for instance; both posses a strong and profound character instilled with a certain degree of pride, and both posses the potential for becoming good or evil. Heathcliff becomes revenge-driven because he once had been loved and his love is taken away by Edgar, who is not even, according to Heathcliff, capable of being loved: &quot;I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved her with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day...It is not in him to be loved like me; how can she love in him what he has not?&quot; Heathcliff is angered because he knows Cathy still loves him but is wasting her love on Edgar, who doesn't even deserve her love and is making her worse by trying to care for her: &quot;He might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares.&quot; When Heathcliff was loved by Cathy, he had the potential to become good, but when he is deprived of her love, he becomes evil.Very engrossing book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is perfect in every way.

I was amazed by the depth of feeling, and horrorfic passion of the characters. It is now one of my favorites. Some parts horrorify you, and some exist to make you belive in the power of true love. All in all, an incredible experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" elicited strong criticism. Although Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" also received its share of negative criticism, it was not as markedly disliked as her sister's book. As time went by, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and it was Emily's book that eventually came to be hailed as superior to Charlotte's, particularly as the 20th century got under way.I have read the book three times. It was part of a high school English Lit assignment. To be quite honest, I could barely stomach the book back then. It was too strange, wild, and terrifying to me. The second time I read it, several years ago, I was much older. Thus, I was able to appreciate its masterful prose style and brilliant characterizations. In fact, it was these two factors that kept me reading until the very end. The same thing happened a few months ago. Once more I was hypnotized by this horrible tale of people whose lives went so very wrong. It was one character in particular who exerted a rather puzzling pull on me - Heathcliff. I read almost against my will, hoping against hope that I would be able to find some good quality in him. Of course, I vaguely remembered the plot from the second reading, so I knew that I would not find any such thing.This book, in its entirety, is about Heathclif. It's about how the abuse he suffered at the hands of his benefactor's son, Hindley Earnshaw, twisted him into a demonic caricature of a human being. As such , it is definitely not a pleasant read. However, it does serve as a testament to Emily Bronte's genius. That such a hideous creature sprang from this young woman's imagination is nearly unbelievable, considering her background. Something dark and cruel stirred in the nether recesses of her mind. M. L. Von Franz, a Jungian analyst writing in \\"Man and His Symbols\\", edited by Carl Jung, mentions Heathcliff, describing him as Emily Bronte's animus, the masculine part of a woman's psyche. The animus can be evil or good. Heathcliff is demonic indeed. Bronte brings him to life with great vividness, and this undeniably displays her great talent for making a character truly live in a reader's mind.Therein lies the rub. Heathcliff is so repulsive, so utterly demonic, and so overpowering, that he makes the book sheer torture to read. His influence is seen on every page. The one redeeming quality he might have possessed, his love for Cathy, turns into a monstrous, sick obsession toward the end of the book.While I can admire the powerful way the author delineates character, as well as her obvious command of writing style, I simply cannot say that this book is one of my favorites. I find it especially strange to see it referred to as a love story, and tagged as \\"romance\\" on Amazon. There is little to none of that in this novel. The supposed love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is sketchy at best. They are separated for three years, due to her stubbornness, as well as his pride. When he suddenly reappears, determined to see her, she is already married to another man, one whom Heathcliff despises as a weakling, due to his passionless nature. Yet it is that very man who treats Catherine with kindness, catering to her every whim. Had she, instead, chosen Heathcliff, things might have been very different. Such a tumultuous relationship could very well have ended in tragedy. Had Bronte taken the story in this direction, the book could, indeed, be classified as \\"a dark romance\\". As it stands, however, it certainly cannot, nor should it be.Catherine Earnshaw herself is not a wholly pleasant character, either, although she never descends to the depths of depravity Heathcliff does. She is, however, a very self-centered creature; her sole reason for marrying Linton is so that she won't be brought below her station by marrying Heathcliff. She attempts to rationalize her decision by claiming that she can use Linton's money to \\"help\\" Heathcliff, but this is a rather flimsy excuse.Through Heathcliff, this also becomes a tale of family dysfunction, and of how that dysfunction poisons anyone who comes into contact with that family, whose most disturbed representative, Heathcliff, engages in a very elaborate plan of revenge throughout the latter part of the book.Allthough, again, the writing is brilliant, the book does have one major flaw, and that is the plotting. Characters are killed off when they are no longer necessary. Now, I do agree that a writer has to include sad and unhappy events in a novel, even if he or she is writing within the parameters of the modern romance genre. However, having characters die every few pages or so is just too contrived. Even Cathy's death is contrived. It's designed to make Heathcliff even more of a monster than he already is. Besides, there is no clear explanation for her death. True, she had gotten herself into a state of near hysteria due to auto-suggestion, but this is hardly enough to cause anyone's death; at least, not as suddenly as hers comes about. It's just not believable. Furthermore, the reader finds out, after her demise, that she was pregnant! She very conveniently gives birth, too, before she inexplicably departs from this world. This seems to be a rather forced way of increasing the pathos.Other reviewers have objected to the narration-within-a-narration technique Bronte uses. Actually, I found this quite intriguing. This is one of the elements about the book that actually maintained my interest. Nelly Dean turns out to be a very shrewd, highly perceptive observer, with an especially keen eye for nuanced detail.I was glad that poor Hareton got a chance at love with Catherine Linton. That was another element about the book that I liked. Still, their union is also a bit too contrived, since they happen to be cousins.All in all, although I do recognize the greatness of Emily Bronte as a writer, I have to say that I consider her sister's novel, \\"Jane Eyre\\", far superior, with a more polished plot structure"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were to go back and read a Bronte book, I would readJane Eyre.

It has a lovely ending.2. It has an interesting narrative structure: The whole story is narrated by Mr Lockwood, who observes very little of the action firsthand, instead hearing most of it from Nelly (the story within a story) who hears key parts of it from other minor characters (the story within a story within a story!).3.

I for one think it's a great character study, and Bronte's prose are singular. At its heart this is of course a love story, but a brutal one. Heathcliff, is one of the most famous or infamous characters in English Literature, he is truly an enigma. His relationship with Catherine, and its consequences are of course the crux of the novel. Heathcliffs love for her is all consuming, you keep waiting for him to say, I wish I could quit you. Their love is at once beautiful and at second glance toxic.

Would you like to hear a live performance of a really FUNNY novel, with slyly ironic or blackly comical vignettes every few pages? Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more. (For instance, one of its most remarkable features, instantly lost in any so-called \\"film version,\\" is its wonderfully intricate narrative structure, quite on a par with that of a Joseph Conrad novel such as Lord Jim or Victory.)Now, who on earth could read WH properly so that all those nuances and overtones might be brought together in a single performance?

Emily lived for just 30 years: 1818 to 1848.I bought and read this Penguin Classic version of Wuthering Heights. It has a good preface by Lucasta Miller, author of \\"The Bronte Myth,\\" and it has an introduction by Pauline Nestor, who has written two books on the Bronte sisters including \\"Charlotte Bronte' in 1987, and a related book \\"George Eliot\\" in 2002. I read the analysis after reading the book and I recommend that you not read too much about the details of the story until you have read the book. I read the book after reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Shirley.\\" I read the three books one after the other.\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte has touches of Dickens and Jane Austen in a fictional biopgraphy of a young English woman. That novel is more conventional in plot and structure and it is a compelling read. It was a big hit in 1847 and was a much bigger and more popular novel than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - published the same year in 1847. Both sisters used male pseudonyms. The present novel has become more popular and better accepted with the passage of time. Even today, \\"Jane Eyre\\" remains as the more popular novel, but now there is a strong appreciation of what Emily Bronte has created: it is an unusual piece of literature. Some think that it shows much more originality than the popular work of Charlotte.In short, Emily Bronte has created a horror book which is mostly grounded in reality. The characters have the problems within themselves. There is nothing unusual or super-natural in the book. The novel is short and concise. It is a well written and entertaining novel. But unlike most novels, it is hard to have sympathy with any characters. One likes certain people in the book because they are not as bad or as outrageous as some of the others. I guess we could say the protagonists are Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. The latter is somewhat sympathetic while Heathcliff is a man with serious problems. All in all it is very convincing.Also, Emily Bronte uses the story within a story technique: it is a narrative told by a housekeeper with the beginning and closing chapters used to form the story and bring closure.The novel is slow to start but most who can get through the first 100 pages will be well rewarded.I highly recommend this Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights, two families are caught in a destructive cycle of love, hate, and retribution. At the center of it is Catherine, a proud, headstrong girl, and Heathcliff, an orphan adopted into Catherine's family. Catherine and Heathcliff are both romantic iconoclasts who defy convention. They prefer roaming the wild moors over the life of high society. They enjoy mischief and detest christian morality. Their love is one of passion and rebellion. Even though they are very immature, they are admirable in that they are true to their own natures and want to live lives of joy and ecstasy. In one insightful passage that illuminates the theme of the whole book, Catherine says that she dreamed that she was in Heaven, and she was so unhappy there that she begged to come back to earth. The angels kicked her out and she wept with joy to come back to Wuthering Heights, her home on the wild Yorshire moor. Even though these characters behave despicably, we can't help sympathize with their humanity.Wuthering Heights is a criticism of Christian ideology. Catherine and Heathcliff are full bodied, complex, emotional characters. They are both repeatedly referred to as wicked, devilish, heathen, selfish, coldhearted. But they are also genuine people with the courage to live in accordance with their convictions. It is this quality that makes the two \\"good\\" characters, Edgar and Isabella Linton, fall in love with them. Edgar and Isabella, raised as gentry, live as they have been dictated to. They are irrisistably attracted to these two individuals who don't care what society thinks of them. Heathcliff and Catherine glow with pride, passion, strength and health. While Edgar and Isabella are hollow and anemic. The other Christian character, Joseph, is hypocritical and debased.The landscape of Yorkshire is a character in itself described with immense appeal. In the winter, it is bleak and wild and hauntingly beautiful; with wind that moans with the voices of the past and moonlight that sparkles on the snow. In the spring and summer it is halcyon and exuberant, bursting with flowers, birds, breezes and green growth. We understand why Catherine and Heathcliff love it so much. The name Heathcliff itself references the heath of the moor and the cliffs that the two children were so attracted to. Heathcliff is the embodiment of the moor, the earth, and all that is real and sensible, all that Catherine loves and dies to be separated from. Wuthering Heights exalts the earthly realm over the heavenly realm that conventional ideology would have everyone aspire to.As sensitive as Wuthering Heights is towards these flawed characters, it is also a cautionary tale. The love that sustained so much joy and passion in Catherine and Heathcliff is also a love that destroys them. Catherine marries a wealthy, kind man who loves her, but she cannot look past his dull exterior to love him. She is consumed with her obsession with Heathcliff, wastes away pining, and breaks the heart of those who love her. Heathcliff, embittered by Catherine's choice, wrecks havoc by plotting an elaborate revenge on the second generation. His love for her fuels his hatred of everyone else who has a claim to her. While the story could be interpreted as the tragedy of thwarted love, it could also be said that had that love been consummated, it would have been just as destructive, just as dysfunctional. While Catherine and Heathcliff believe themselves to be deeply in love, it can hardly be called love when all they do is hurt each other and make everyone around them miserable and wretched.Wuthering Heights is an incredible novel. The language is resonant and fluid, the characters are complex and vividly brought to life, the atmosphere is masterfully invoked. It is discomfiting, moving, and challenging. It is really an ingenious piece of social commentary revealed through a love story. It is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The old classic that I had never read but have seen the movie many times.

Loved it ."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I like the Kate Bush song and wanted to learn the story. It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.[END OF SPOILERS]It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic and introduces so many themes that are prevalent in literature today but I find myself disliking the novel itself. Bronte tells the story of a man who is renting a room and learns the story of the man who owns the house and the neighboring property, Mr. Heathcliff. This may be the only novel that I've ever read in which every single main character is utterly unlikable: from Heathcliff who is cruel and sadistic to everyone except Catherine, who is shallow to her husband Edgar, who is proud and weak, to his sister Isabella, who is naive and immature, to Hindley, who is nothing more than a vengeful little boy who grows into a vengeful man. His son, Hareton is tolerable though he is depicted as stupid. Then we come to Cathy who is a spoiled little brat. Even the man original narrator, Lockwood, comes across as pretentious. The only redeeming character in my eyes was Nelly, who is flawed but loving. That being said, the novel is so well written and presents it's characters in such a light that you feel like you know them. The prevailing message seems to be that no matter how fall someone has fallen, they can redeem themselves with love. Not sure that I believe this but I can't deny that Bronte work prevails as a masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book as a teenager and felt so accomplished for making it through, what I considered to be, a very archaic book.After having just finished reading the book again, I was very torn about how \\"good\\" I thought this books was. It is indeed a very dark and brooding tale with mostly unredeemable characters leaving one to question why a person could be so vindictive.However I realized that while I didn't care for the dark and abusive topic, I absolutely loved the writing style, the grammar and the point of view that the story was told from. I also realized that as a teenager I saw this as a fictional tale and probably thought, naively, that people as cruel as Heathcliff just don't exist in this world... Why ever would a person spend all their energy and machinations on making everyone around them miserable? Indeed, why.I gave this book a four star rating, not because the tale was enjoyable, but because it offered so many epiphanies on how I regarding the experience of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a fabulous book for a fabulous price. cant go wrong!

The book grabbed my attention immediately and was an easy read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in high school (16 years ago), and I remember it being a much easier read at the time than it is now (for me). Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to. I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read. With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away. For that, you need to acquire this classic for yourself!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Violent, gory, sexy, passionate, wild, untamed, exhausting, tragic, sick, but ultimately forgiving. And written by a parson's daughter living in the barren Yorkshire moors.How much of this novel is sexual fantasy and how much is experience? It's impossible to tell. There's no explicit sex in the novel, but we can say it's nothing but implicit sex. It's not about love or hate, it's about two people who've made themselves into a single being. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights can neither love or hate her adopted brother Heathcliff: he and she have become part of each other, in their soul and in their flesh.If Wuthering Heights has a tragic element, it's not a conventional one: the moral of the tale isn't that one should resist one's animal impulses. Quite the reverse: Catherine and Heathcliff are one and the tragedy unfolds because of Catherine's decision to disregard her irrational but unbreakable bond with Heathcliff. Just as Catherine should have embraced a life with Heathcliff, maybe we should embrace our animal nature.Emily Bront is a woman of her time and her prose reflects this, yet there are scenes of intense physical violence. Where could a sheltered young Victorian woman have gotten the experience to write of these feelings and actions with such authencity?One of my very favourite novels. I first read it over 25 years ago, in Yorkshire as it happens, and I just read it for the fourth time, again in Yorkshire. A true work of art.Vincent Poirier, Montreal"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The authors of the afore time---afore the era of simplicity and profanity--- were so epic in there prose. Indeed to be over-the- top in detailing characters and choosing their destiny was par-for-the-course. This is the Harlequin romance novel of them all. For years this has been my favorite movie, and every now and then I whip out the hard copy I've had since High School and enrich myself in the loving passages. If only contemporary authors brought a poetic bent to their prose there would be so much more to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the immensly passionate tale of betrayal, sorrow and unrequited love. It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody. But you might want to have a dictionary handy. Be prepared to read things more than once because not all things make sense at first. if you see the movie it might enable you to understand the book better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read quite a big number of classics and this one is certainly one of the best. The tragedy in the book concerning Catherine and Heathcliff is comparable to some plots we come accross in Thomas Hardy's work. Well, there is not exactly the search for perfectness like Hardy in this book but the tragedy of human existence and passion are right there. This is a moving book. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I remember reading this novel as a teen and I have treasured it ever since. It is one of the greatest tragic romance in history. Emily Bronte has written a novel of great drama and beauty. I find the romantic tension between Heathcliff and Catherine very intriguing. The characters were very realistic. Even the description of certain scenes were so detailed that I really felt the mood of that period. I just love this book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am 15-years old, so Wuthering Heights was difficult to understand at first. The main difficulty was understanding the slang words and some of the phrases that were used in the &quot;English&quot; language. Once I got more into the story, I could understand what was going on. I found myself wanting to read on about the relationships between Heathcliff and Catherine, Catherine and Edgar, and Heathcliff and Edgar. These relationships were exciting to read about to see how everything would turn out in the end. I would put myself in the characters' shoes and think about how I would react to the various situations. For example, if I were Catherine, I would get rid of my need for wealth and marry for love. In Heathcliff's position, I would have accepted the fact that I would never be with Catherine and try to find happiness in my own life. This novel will entice you to keep reading to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This 1847 novel initially shocked many in its Victorian readership, but gradually made its way to solid critical favour. The action of this extraordinarily intense novel was conceived at a very high imaginative level. It centers around the fiercely passionate relationship between Catherine &amp; Heathcliff -- fictional characters of elemental force and towering strength.&lt;&lt;The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English&gt;&gt; notes that &quot;the torturous and violent plot, instead of seeming merely melodramatic, is given solidity by the precisely realized Yorkshire locations and subtlety by the shifting narrative viewpoints.&quot; A perfectly descriptive one-liner of the novel's unbreakable backbone.*Wuthering Heights* is unique: There was nothing like it before, there has been nothing like it since, there will be nothing like it again.

The plot is interesting in and of itself, and the characters are all easily imagined if not terribly well-rounded (with the exception of Heathcliff, who can be appreciated fully when you consider both his cruelty and his motivation and origins). All in all, the material is promising.Unfortunately, the writing is so convoluted and verbose that you'd need a machete to ... your way through it. And \\"...\\" is an accurate verb; typically whole paragraphs and pages are filled with needless complications so that it's more like deciphering a code than reading a story. The sheer amount of effort that it takes to get very little payoff quickly breeds apathy. After a while, I didn't care who Catherine married or who was narrating or anything else.The book has some other flaws (most noticeably the use of death as a cheap plot device) but the writing's really what sinks the book. If you like slaving away for minimal payoff, this book's for you. Otherwise..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hands down, the worst novel that I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to settle an oddly masochistic wager with a family member. The characters are all contemptible, the writing dull, and the story inane. When it was over I had mixed feelings of relief (thank God it was over) and regret for wasting that much of my life on it. What a horrible, horrible novel. If there is such a thing as hell, for me, it would be an empty room with nothing but a copy of Wuthering Heights in it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must confess that I got kind of bored at the beginning of the book, I found it a little confusing but after reading some more pages I got the gist, maybe I'm wrong but it reminds me a little bit Lady Chatterley's Lover.I read the first chaptersin almost two weeks since I found it kind of hard to read, but there was a point when I just couldn't stop from reading it, I was so touched by the way Austen gave life to every single character.I'm looking forward to read more of this writer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The great tragedy of this book is that the author didn't kill off Catherine and Heathcliff MUCH SOONER. Then she might have been able to introduce alternate main characters who were actually interesting.Although given Emily Bronte's track record with the aforementioned losers, maybe populating her novels with characters that the reader would find interesting just wasn't her strong suit...."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've never before written a negative Amazon reader review. As an author, I know how much they can sting, and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I've really enjoyed. However, since the author is long dead, I doubt I can hurt her feelings. And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I've endured, I'll feel that my job here is done.I decided that at the age of 52, it was time I started reading some of the classics that I'd missed along the way. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first, and though I found Ms. Austen's writing to be tedious, the book was mildly entertaining. I thought I'd try Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS next. I'd always heard how romantic the story was, and no less than three people, upon seeing me with the book, told me, \\"You'll love it! You'll absolutely love it!\\"Please tell me you're kidding.This book is wretched. Painful to a degree I've never before experienced. I've read books that put me to sleep, books I found impossibly dull, books I found too stupid for words. But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life. The characters in their entirety don't possess a single redeeming value. They are miserable, obnoxious, hateful excuses for human beings. Even the DOGS are hateful. Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people? Why should I care if they've made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are?I hadn't realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book, when a major character died, and all I could think was, \\"THANK GOD! THANK GOD!\\"And then, there's the dialect. Ah, the dialect! I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly. But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print, in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English (yes, I know it's supposed to be Scottish), the result is unbearable pain. Every time this character speaks (which is, thankfully, not often), I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent. Sometimes, it's possible to do this just by context. At other times, I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page. Considering how slowly the story moves (is there a storyline? a point to all this suffering?), I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything.I'd also like to know where the romance is. Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else, with the notable exception of the uncouth monster, Heathcliff, and the spoiled-rotten, obnoxious Catherine, I can't fathom where that might lie. Am I too dense to understand? Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years, convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this \\"romantic\\" classic?I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully, one at a time, than finish reading this book. I'm halfway through, and life is short. Am I really willing to spend that much more of my short time here on earth torturing myself just for the satisfaction of knowing I actually read the dreadful thing? I think not.I also think my foray into the classics has ended right here. I'm off to read some Robert Parker or Janet Evanovich. Maybe even some Jackie Collins. Anything to cleanse my palate of the terrible aftertaste of Heathcliff and Catherine.To each his own. I know there are people who rave about this book, people who love it. I'm glad somebody does. Every book deserves to be loved by somebody. But in this case, with this particular book, that somebody will have to be Somebody Else.

I don't mean to sound sexist, it's just true. I've never met a woman who didn't love this book, And I've never met a man who liked it. I hated it. I won't say it was a bad book, because it's a classic, and the most you're allowed to say about a classic is that you didn't enjoy it, which I didn't.

If you have the patience to sit through this book, by all means read this. However, if you feel you need an interesting tale that progresses at a faster pace, you'd best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't really like this book, because it was just boring, and I couldn't understand what they were really talking about. It just didn't interest me, and it was confusing. I didn't like the characters too much and didn't get them. I think this book could've been better, and I personally wouldn't want to read it again. I had a hard time getting into it, the whole time I was reading it. It was pretty boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just recently finished reading Wuthering Heights, and to be perfectly honest I have to say that it's a terrible story.The basic plot is centered around Mr. Lockwood and his visit to rural England and the house called Wuthering Heights where he is told the life story of a man named Heathcliff along with his love for Catherine, his hate for his bother (and his brother's son (Heraton) and his neighbors at Thruscross Grange and their son (Edgar) and their daughter (Isabella) [who he marries] and the son that he has with Isabella (Linton) and the extra hate that he gains when Edgar marries Catherine), and his story of revenge against the afore mentioned individuals who he hates.That brings us to the novel's problems. The true highlight of a novel is not its story, but rather its hidden significance, and while Wuthering Heights does bring out the extreme emotions that can be associated with love (i.e. passion, jealousy, spite), it does so in such a way that kills any male reader. It's true -for some reason, the ladies who read this book tend to like it much more than the guys.Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the novel, with all deep and meaningful thoughts written in, reads like a victorian era after school special. Catherine totally had a crush on Heathcliff, and Heatcliff liked him back, but Catherine started hanging out with the wrong crowd -Isabella and Edgar. After a while Catherine just didn't want to hang out with Heathcliff, and one night she got so out of hand that she totally made out with Edgar! Heathcliff finds out and totally gets made, but he moved to another school for a year so it was okay then. Besides, his brother was mean to him. The next year he totally surprised everyone when he came back! Catherine was soooo regretful that she made out with Edgar, and she wanted Heathcliff back -but Isabella had a crush on him too! They totally got in a cat fight that day, saying how much they both hate Heathcliff. The problem was that Heathcliff was soooo made at Catherine (still) but had a crush on her (still) so he totally made out with Isabella! Then Isabella dies, then Edgar dies, then Heathcliff brother dies, then a few people get married until Heathcliff finally bites the dust.You're probably thinking that I have blown the story out of proportion, but the sad truth is that I haven't. In actuality, Heathcliff and Catherine do fall in love, but they never admit it to each other -they always bicker and argue and yell about how much they hate each other until Catherine dies. Just like how middle school kids will talk about how much they like so-and-so, but not to that individul. In actuality, Catherine does marry Edgar, Heathcliff does run away, and on his return Isabella does admit that she has fallen in love with him, Heathcliff does marry Isabella for revenge, and the rest of the story is then about people dying and Catherine's daughter Catherine and how she was forced to marry Heathcliff's son so that Heathcliff would get extra land when his kid died.Touching love story, isn't it?While some might call it a wild romance and a true testament to our inability to control the strongest of human emotion, I find that the love story is very elementary (on the account that it really does read like an afterschool special) and at the same time blown up -almost like Emily Bronte was a love-starved victorian era woman longing for a romance in her life (which she was) and the rest of the story was just a simple story where people are mean to each other and then die.Sorry Emily Bronte!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am aware that this is not a novel meant to put a smile on your face or make you think of flowers and rainbows etc. But I was unable to get any enjoyment out of this book because the characters are so completely ridiculous in their courses of actions. Granted, the theme of the book is how hatred, jealousy, envy, and the like can overcome a person's soul, but she took it too far. The overblown &quot;love&quot; between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights.

Funnily enough, it's not as bad as it sounds."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because it was a 'classic' and I can't quite see what the big deal is. Number one, isn't it supposed to be a 'tragic love story' between Cathy and Heathcliff? Well, Cathy is his daughter in law and CATHERINE is the one he loves.How can it be a love story when they are practically brother and sister and never showed each other much affection anyway?? And why does everyone die from catching a cold? Living in England ain't that bad and also I could not understand ONE WORD of what Joseph was saying! The narrative in this book also confused me a bit.I'd start a chapter believing Nelly to be narrating only to find out half way through that it was actually Mr Lockwood. Also what really confused me was Who was Ellen? Was it another name for Nelly Dean?? This book was quite clumsy,and how did Emily Bronte turn a useless story into a 400 page novel? The only decent part of the book was when Catherine is dying and Heathcliff holds her and actually kisses her.That is the only part which shows their true feelings. Also Nelly was a back stabber - Every secret she was told by Catherine and Cathy and even Isabella, she tells someone else!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did not like this at all. The fact that it was short was the only reason I finished it. I am not too sure what the appeal of this book is to others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am not entirely satisfied with the title I give for this review. What would one say of a book that disturbs and grips you and at the same time moves you as no other romance story has.It is a dark story. Twisted characters.Despicable and inhuman characters even. The narrative infuses in us a feeling of dark stormy nights. There isn't much depiction of romance in here. But I remember it as the most passionate romance I've ever read. The romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The power of their feelings for each other is so real and forceful, I feel they might still be roaming the moors in Yorkshire together as spirits.And Emily Bronte's narrative is gripping.The only shortcoming I felt was the ending which was rather convenient and this convenience leads to a predictable happy ending."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If Emily Bronte's intention was for us to have some feeling for her characters, because I think that is one of the marks of a good writer, then she hit the mark beautifully. Catherine and Heathcliff must be the most infuriating characters I have ever had the displeasure to read about. They are two selfish beasts continually arguing over which one is selfish! Instead of finding their relationship to be some intoxicating gothic romance, it is instead a bizarre, love/hate infatuation that brings misery to everyone around them.The gruesomness of the characters takes away nothing from the value of the work. As a matter of fact, I think it adds a vivid flavor that is hard to get from many novels. Afterall, everyone gringes at movies, but how many people gringe at books?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My Review:Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights is a classic that all should read. It uniquely portrays the undoubtedly present fight between earnest and passionate love and vigorous hate. This novel is the epidemy of a tale that twists the reader's previous opinion on innocent love.Wuthering Heights is the home to the Earnshaw family. It lies desolate from the world upon the moors and wetlands of vast fields. This home is quiet large in size, however it is musty and gray in color and rather lonely in its outward appearance. The master is the father, Mr. Earnshaw, then there is Mrs. Earnshaw and the children, whom are Hindley and Catherine. Further into the novel a child is added into the Earnshaw family, but it is not their own. This child is later known as Heathcliff, an Irish gypsy waif found and pitied by the master during his stay at Liverpool. The master took such pain in seeing the boy on his own that he brought him home to his children to accompany. But Earnshaw's son, Hindley, from the very beginning detested Heathcliff for the reason that the master, much too obviously, favored \\"poor Heathcliff\\" than that of his own son!AS the years past, turmoil, jealousy and overall hatred consumed Hindley, leaving Heathcliff and him to be forever enemies. On the contrary, Catherine and Heathcliff were the best of friends and they grew to love each other dearly. In fact the were inseparable to the point that the greatest punishment that either could have been given was that of being away from each other.The two were quite rambunctious and always up for adventure. One day Catherine and Heathcliff met other children at the residence of Thrushcross Grange ( the Lintons, the rich and spoiled kids!!!). Catherine instantly fell in love with their classy way of life and left Heathcliff to eat her dust!! haha..Catherine still loved Heathcliff but grew to understand that she was just too high class of a women for him , resulting in her decision to love and marry her material possessor Edgar Linton ( one of the rich kids, his sister was Isabella Linton.)Stricken by grief, Heathcliff pursued till his very death his soul and body...his dear Catherine. Without her he was not complete, and each day he yearned her presence.In volume two of this novel the reader comes to know of whom marries who and who are their children. Heathcliff in this volume becomes an aggressive hateful man and his once joyful heart is turned black and cold; full of hate. Cathy, the descendant of Catherine, is portrayed by Bronte as the fulfillment of her mother's dream that was never reached ( marrying her true love). And whom Cathy marries is her cousin ( I know gross right?...well she marries 2 of her cousins!!! nastier!) who is known as Hareton. They, in a way, are the parallel of their elders, but they are more so in the sense that they are the \\"happy ending\\" to the love fest of Catherine and Heathcliff.Overall, I would have to say that this book is not only credited for its educational material, rather to me it is credited by its insightfully constructed plot. Bronte is an amazingly talented author who places her own viewpoints and morals skillfully throughout this classic. This novel is great because of its symmetrical structure of love and hate, nature and culture, and lastly the ongoing fight between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. At the story's finale it is truly left up to the reader to decide whom they believe won the battle. At first one believes it is Wuthering Heights due to Catherine giving in to marrying her love, yet it could be the Grange for both Catherine and Hareton beating Heathcliff's evilness in the end. What readers should come to appreciate from this novel is that Bronte really applied her inner emotions to this novel and the whole story is told from her beliefs and her viewpoint on the matter of Catherine and Heathcliff's immortal love which is too sacred to control, therefore Bronte ends this love triangle by their death for the reason that in some cases love cannot be joined for it is so strong that peace could not be kept with its overpowering presence on human kind.--ChiChi----"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published under a pseudonym in 1847, Wuthering Heights caused a scandal. The staid and drab era of the 1840's was simply not used to such an intense and disturbing story of such raw passion and cruelty. In this tale of love and tragedy, an orphan named Heathcliff is adopted and comes to live at Wuthering Heights. He falls in love with the man's daughter, Catherine. But his life is hell because of her brother. Catherine's brother hates and humiliates him. Heathcliff can take it no more and eventually he runs away. He's gone a long time and in the meantime, Catherine marries, even though it's Heathcliff she's really in love with. Heathcliff returns dandified and rich... to take his revenge. But I won't give away the climax and ending. Heart-stopping and intense! Not for everyone, certainly not for the light 'n' fluffy inspirational romance reader, but for fans of Charlotte Bronte and Thomas Hardy.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Some readers may be put off by the &quot;classic&quot; genre of this book. The only reason I read it was because I had to for English. Well, I was glad I did. It is extremely difficult to understand at times, especially with the constant switching of narrators. I had previously seen a movie production with Lawrence Olivier, which I loved, and although it was quite different from the novel, it helped me to understand much of what was happening. The romance between Cathy and Heathcliff is absolutely heartrending. To all of those who love passionate romance (though not passionate by today's sense), I recommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't like romance novels, or movies or television shows. Such is the curse of the lion share of my sex, despite our gradual feminization in the modern era.I'm glad I overcame my aversion to read this excellent portrayal of eros defiled. Heathcliff is the focus, fulcrum and prime mover in this story. He is dragged of the streets and taken in by a wealthy gentleman from the provinces. This man showers great affection on the young street urchin and demands equal treatment from his two natural born children.The eldest, a son, resents this upstart, so when the father dies, he relegates poor Heathcliff to the status of neglected servant. Catherine, the younger, has become a close friend of Heathcliff and follows him into the relatively untethered but savage life of the servants' children. Growing up unsupervised they develop the manners of the low born, and but develop a strong bond of love that transcends the facile distinctions of filial versus romantic.Alas, when Catherine comes of age, the duties of her birth beckon and she is taken from Heathcliff and marries someone of higher station.It is this love, never fulfilled, that sours in Heathcliff makes him a despicable tyrant.This is the dark side of romance, and Romance as viewed from the man's vantage point.Worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a great work of literature and a novel of passion, this work is excellent. A dark novel, it is quite intreging, drawing one into the complex and whimsically dark dream world of the characters. The novel is truly able to contrast the wild depths of one's soul with the civilized, although repressed areas through the contrast of the two houses and the people who reside there. Heathcliff, although dispicable, is someone we can sympathize with...savage and unrefined, he extends beyond humanity, becoming a character of pure passion. Cathy also exists as a refined and civilized form of that same passion, which is why she can love both the dainty Edgar and the wild Heathcliff. The children carry on the parents lives, and, eventually setting their mistakes right and bringing order through their marriage. Heathcliff too has a poignant changing scene, in which we realize that he is not evil, but has just succumbed to this because of his pain and sorrow. My favorite scene is the last between Cathy and Hareton, ending with Heathcliff's death....it was simply beautiful and contrasted with the novel's darkness. The style too was mesmerizing....Bronte's poetic language is beautiful and full of meaning...fiting perfectly with the characters. All and all, it is an excellent novel, but complex, and anything but light and simple. Jane Eyre may be better, but if you like it, read this too, it's worth your while."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hello,and welcome to my breif reveiw on Wuthering Heights.If you want to read this book you've made the right choice. Wuthering Heights is a beautiful book of passion,pain,tragedy and love. Although I am only a chid I think that this book is the most touching one I have ever read. Wuthering Heights is about the young love of Catherine and Heathcliff and their struggle to be together. I read this book and had this much admiration for it, so why shouldn't you?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS has always been portrayed to me as a magnificiently tragic romance between an unconventional pair of lovers. I'm glad I can finally judge it for myself. Heathcliff, rather than coming across as the quintessential brooding (yet sympathetic) hero, is a character of textbook psychopathic tendencies, right down to the needless torturing and killing of animals. Catherine is never described or portrayed sympathetically either; she is ill natured, petulant, conniving and as vengeful as Heathcliff, whom she regards as her soul mate. (But, of course, since they are both physically attractive, people must feel free to ignore these aspects of the text.)So what triggers the tragedy in their romance? Unconventional Catherine decides to take the conventional route of the times and marry for money. Heathcliff, a foundling who has been raised as Catherine's brother, slinks off with his tail between his legs, only to return in three years time with enough money to gamble with,enabling him to win the mortage to Wuthering Heights from Catherine's nasty actual brother. Meanwhile, Catherine and Heathcliff are quite dismayed when Catherine's husband finally puts his foot down and says they cannot continue their relationship. Catherine proceeds to her bedroom where she eventually bites a hole in her feather pillow and (in my favorite scene) amuses herself by naming the bird from which every feather came. Heathcliff elopes out of spite with Catherine's sister-in-law, a conventional sort who still manages to do what the wild and reckless Catherine should have done in the first place, or even later, instead of hiding out in her room for months on end. But no, that would have spoiled the plot, wouldn't it? WUTHERING HEIGHTS is definitely driven by plot, with the characters' personalities shifting to suit Miss Bronte's narrative needs.Am I glad I read this? Yes. Bronte's descriptive strengths made mucking through the characters's histrionics worthwhile. Should I have felt guilty for having put it off for so many years? Certainly not. I think even as a teenager I'd have found the characters absurd and unlikable. Do I have concern for those who think Heathcliff's continued obsession with Catherine after her death, and his compulsion to punish all those who'd thwarted his relationship with her (as well as the offspring of these people, even his own)is a shining example of a true love that transcends death? Most definitely. It saddens me to think that some girls may remain in abusive relationships because their boyfriends are the Heathcliff-type, and therefore, supposedly desirable. Heathcliff is psychopathological. Love for one person, thwarted or not, is not supposed to be used as grounds for destroying the lives of everyone else you come in contact with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a difficult read for me. For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again. I'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it. I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend. Let's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together. Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them. At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery. Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't think there is any other novel out there like this. It's definitely a classic, but it's not pleasant and lovely like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or mysterious but positive like Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. As other reviers said, it's dark. It's unpleasant. It's full of anger and fighting and cruelty.And yet it is well written. It portrays well what it is meant to portray. I wish I understood it better (reading reviews and plot outlines on this page helped me immensely in this area). I definitely want to read it again sometime. I find it interesting that such a repulsive (but again, fascinating) book is such a well-known classic that almost everyone has at least heard of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone with a B.A. in English Literature, I can appreciate that this book has some fine writing and is a worthy classic. On the other, more personal side, I found it extremely disturbing. It is not a tale of love--in fact, I didn't witness any love between Cathy and Heathcliff. Instead, they engage in a sick, jealous, violent, obsessive relationship which ends in heartbreak and tragedy for all concerned. Heathcliff, though the &quot;hero&quot; of the story, is a dangerous, cruel, selfish, and mentally disturbed man and I was not able to feel anything for him but repulsion. Cathy is a spoiled, selfish brat.Nonetheless, it is interesting and sometimes intriguing to read, so I would recommend it if you like 19th century fiction and don't mind lots of violence and cruelty."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"From what I can gather, it is commonly considered that the primary theme of Wuthering Heights is a type of love that transcends all else. Great passion, transcending mortal life, consuming one's soul. Something noble in and of itself, more powerful than reason. Supposedly, this somehow partially excuses any evil stemming from it. Heathcliff is seen as having a wild, passionate, \\"bad boy\\" attraction.If one reads quickly, without really absorbing it all, some scenes do give Heathcliff this allure. But integrating all that he does, he is too evil. And in the end, nothing but deranged evil. His deranged, so-called love excuses nothing. Nor does the mistreatment he received excuse mistreating innocent bystanders. Though it does show insight that abuse tends to engender hatred of life and abuse of others.In his resentment, Heathcliff destroys all rational values in search of some personal satisfaction which is too mean and limited to ever make him happy. Such a man cannot love himself or anyone else. He may have an obsession for something of his imagination, but not appreciation for real people and the give and take of real relationships. Bad treatment may have led to him becoming a monster, but once a monster, he must be recognized as a monster.At that time Bronte was writing, in the 1840's, mystical notions of other worldly love and passions and existence were fairly common. But they are irrational nonetheless.I reject the popular view of the book's theme, whether Emily Bronte intended that theme or not. I think the story illustrates the theme of people being responsible for their own choices and suffering the unexpected consequences of their actions. In other words, the story does not glorify some superior love, but actually ridicules the delusion of it.The idea that souls of loved ones will be reunited after death is common. However, this is a spiritual thing; so, Heathcliff's desire to have the coffins opened on the side makes no sense in this light. He was simply deranged. How Bronte thought up such a thing is strange. Perhaps the idea is that Heathcliff is not spiritual enough, not properly religious, to imagine the mystic reuniting of souls? So he imagines a more physical reuniting?Bronte, as shown by her poetry, seems enamored with notions of life after death; so, it is difficult to know what she felt about life. There is evidence both that she enjoyed it and that she hated it. I wonder if she didn't simply have different moods? Anyway, she was often intelligent and insightful about the natures of different types of people, and Wuthering Heights is cleverly and inventively presented. The ending, which implies that the new generation will find lasting love and happiness, saves the book. I also liked the way religion was shown to be of no positive use for anything, which I doubt was Bronte's intention, but engenders meaness and abuse."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I agree. This book is compelling and atmospheric. I love the hints of the supernatural. Heathcliffe's lycanthropic qualities. Almost a werewolf on the moonlit moors. The ghostly hauntings and the attentions to and realisations of character's dreams are all very effective. I also like the dichotomy between the two houses. Wuthering Heights is a veritable Hell and Thrushdown Grange is Heaven. BUT... I have never encountered such an utterly repellant motley crew of characters in my life! Who on Earth could have ANY feelings for these people? Heathcliffe is a mad-dog that needs putting to sleep. Hindley is an abusive, maniacal drunkard. Joseph is an hysterical religious bigot. Catherine is a pain... But, worst of all none of the characters show any inclination to extricate themselves from their mess. Rather, they actively encourage each other's dissolution and disarray. There is no-one in the book strong enough or intelligent enough to check these processes of atrophy and attrition. How pointless, don't you think? And for all the reviewers who defend this book with the charge that real-life is similarly evil... Well, yeah, maybe real life according to Jerry Springer and his idiot dysfunctional redneck guests. I found these characters so repellant and downright sinister I couldn't stop thinking of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this many years ago.

The detail of being able to enlarge font is appreciated by those of us Seniors with failing vision."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has an unusual quality you can read it over and over. It has wonderful characters to love and to hate and a story line that will keep you guessing, it really is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been one of my top 5 favorite books all my life, her sister Emily's classic Wuthering Heights has never been a favorite. However, having now read it once in print and listened to it twice in audio, I will admit that it is growing on me. Wuthering Heights will never be a favorite -- its characters are too universally tormented (demented, even), the emotions are too overwrought and the feel of the book is too claustrophobic to ever suit my tastes. However, I am learning to appreciate the wild elegance of Emily Bronte's work.A note on the particular audio version I listened to, which was produced by Recorded Books: it has been my experience that Recorded Books employs the best narrators in the audio book industry. And while Flo Gibson, who narrates this one, is a highly-regarded narrator, nevertheless she is one of my least favorites. I have listened to her narrate two or three books and in each of them my opinion was the same; when she is narrating in her natural voice it is pleasing enough, but when she is doing character voices she manages to make them all sound like 80-year-old women who have been lifelong smokers. Her voice is particularly ill-suited for young female characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a great experience to finally reread this classic as an adult. Emily Bronte depicts a very gothic and depressing story of two star-crossed (but not terribly likeable) lovers, Cathy & Heathcliff, and the love between them that transcended the grave. Added to that a wonderful depiction of the dark English moors and the local characters with their strange dialects. This was also told in a very unusual style, like a tale within a tale within a tale, adding more layers and perspectives to the story.How unfortunate that one's upbringing can so affect a person that their grief and bitterness turn what could have been a fine young man into such a hateful and vengeful person as Heathcliff became. And fortunate that Cathy's daughter and Hareton could overcome their dark upbringing to bring a happier light onto the dark moors of England.I did not read this version of the book, but theSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), which did not have all the footnotes. I think I enjoyed that better as I wasn't constantly distracted by looking to the back for the notes and just allowed myself to become engrossed with the story. It's one book you have to read at least twice in your life -- of course in school as required reading and then again as an adult to add that perspective of age and experience in life so that one can more fully appreciate a such a classic tale."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read WUTHERING HEIGHTS only because their 10th grade English teacher mandated it, often return to Emily Bronte's classic years later for a return visit to the howling moor without quite knowing why. There is a sense of place to the novel that resists ready explanation, and it is perhaps that lingering memory of the triangle that connects Heathcliff, Catherine, and the moor that demands a closer examination with a more mature perspective.Heathcliff and Catherine have a stormy love affair, but the book is not simply a reworking of the romantic potboilers so current then. Nor is it just a cataloguing of nature, though nature is present even from the opening pages. What elevates WUTHERING HEIGHTS to a level not reached before and only a very few times since is Bronte's unique ability to take a nature that is merely descriptive in the hands of a lesser and infuse its wildness and unbridled power into a man who is the walking symbol of that power.Bronte divides nature in the macrocosmic sense--birds, trees, wind, rocks--into two distinct elements. There is the low key, quiet, and peaceful image of nature so beloved by Wordsworth and locates it in the peaceful Thrushcross Grange. It is here where the cultured Linton family live. Every image that Bronte uses is pacific in scope. One wonders whether the Lintons even hear the same whoosh of wind that resounds in Heathcliff's ears. Less obvious to the careless reader is the enervating subtext that infuses the Grange. Bronte drops several hints that the Grange, for all its peaceful charm, has a charm that is incapable of propagating itself in the emerging harshness of the deterministic ruthless way of life that just then was gathering steam. Catherine is a woman with one foot in that world of culture, manners, and -lingering slow death. Even after she leaves Heathcliff for Edgar Linton, Catherine tells Nelly that she is quite aware of the differences between the worlds of the Grange and of Wuthering Heights: \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it...My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.\\" Here, Bronte takes the homely images of nature and personalizes them as the metaphorical difference between that which Catherine merely finds pleasant (The Grange) and that which she finds necessary (Wuthering Heights). Then there is the twisted, stormy, and unpredictable nature of Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff grew and it is there that he suffered untold horrors that taught him that for him to survive, he had to be as violent as the winds which surrounded him.It is less certain whether Bronte wishes the reader to excuse Heathcliff's unspeakable cruelty once he reverses economic position with the effete Edgar Linton. But perhaps it is less to the point to seek to place blame for Heathcliff's revenge than to acknowledge that it is definitely useless to blame a bolt of lighting for striking its unwary victim. Heathcliff, as the walking symbol of Wuthering Heights, is that bolt which strikes out in a manner not unlike the way that he himself had been struck many times as a boy. Once Heathcliff has his revenge in the humbling of the Lintons, a revenge which costs him his beloved Catherine, it remains for the next generation--the young Cathy and Hareton--to remind Heathcliff that revenge must not be permitted to outlive its proper time, and for the new residents of both Grange and the Heights, that time has long passed. What emerges, then, from a second reading of WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Bronte's firm commitment to recreate a clash of conflicting and very nearly mutually exclusive emotions--revenge and forgiveness--that cause each new generation to learn to temper the former with the latter and thus retain their basic humanity."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic like this comes with a hell of a lot of baggage. More people know of Wuthering Heights, know the cliche of clambering about desolate moorlands shouting \\"Heathcliff!\\" and rolling about passionately in the heather, than have actually read the book.But those who do read it are often surprised to find a violent, complex tale that tells as much of hate as of love. This is no frilly romance. This is a book peopled by unapologetically nasty, even hateful characters, many of whom are totally irredeemable. This is a book of hardship, of cruel passion, of all-consuming vendettas.It is also a fantastic book that everyone should read at some point in their lives. Emily Bronte tapped into some deep, dark well of the human psyche when she penned this singular collosus of a novel. From its amazingly complex yet deftly accomplished narrative structure (consisting of narratives within narratives within narratives) through to its two-tiered plot concerning the sins and misdeeds of one generation being visited upon the second, Wuthering Heights can take your breath away. It doesn't hurt that the plot itself is of great interest, and that the characters, horrid as some of them are, are so vividly drawn that many (like Heathcliff and Cathy) have transcended the bounds of the book to enter our popular consciousness.Wuthering Heights is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is amazing and among my favorites. From the loyal and selfless Mrs. Dean, to the narcissistic and vain Catherine (and everyone imaginable in between), the characters are portrayed with a very unique talent. They truly are unforgettable, and the story is well-packed. The literal undying love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff will clutch the very soul of the reader. The insanity that grips and devastates throughout the novel gives Wuthering Heights an almost sick tone. The more dominate plot of Heathcliff bringing a heavy revenge upon his foes which in turn terrorizes the next generation, is told in a brilliant, intriguing, and clever way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended. I've read this book about million times and each time it gets better and better. I wish i had written this book, it touches every part of you when you read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is now a famouse work of literature that once recieved very negative reviews Emily Bronte has this only novel besides her peoms. Taking place in a small town \\"Gimmerton\\" in England, it offers a lot of emotions and thoughts to the reader. This novel begins with a narrator who is mentioned only three to four times. The narrator Mr. Lockwood is lodging in at Thrushcross Grange, and is tolf the story of a very conflicting family, by Ellen Dean. Mr.Lockwood only has the oppertunity to meet fine of the characters. It seems to be that anyone that visits Wuthering Heights is faced with horiffic mightmares and will not stay in for long. Ms. Deans story begins when the main characters were very young.The novel has a lot of twist and turns and it is filled with hatred, love, envy and unhappiness. Emily ends her novel very calmly as everything falls in its place. I believe that even today, we are faced with people or families that dislike one another. Yet it is harder for revenge to be accomplished, since now we have justice from law? Emily's novel takes place before the 1800's and the rich were the ones who rules, especially in a small town . \\"wuthering Heights\\" is a must need book. The detailed events and feelings, makes you know each character deeply. You will feel attached to the characters and feel what they feel. I really enjoyed this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wurthering Heights\\" is among the greatest English novels. It is the only novel by Emily Bronte that was published in 1847, one year before the death of the author. It is a tragic romantic story of the tormented love relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. This is a well written moving story which some readers may find too distressing.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff were deeply in love but were destined to be apart. Catherine is a strong willed lady who was on her way up the social ladder. Heathcliff was an orphan who was a waif and was brought to the house by Cathy's father. Cathy and Heathcliff have a strong attraction for each other. However, due to Catherine's social status, she decides to marry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff feels betrayed. From then on, Emily Bronte weaves an intricate plot in a captivating story full of suspense. The story of revenge by Heathcliff is deeply disturbing, violent and shocking.Heathcliff comes out as a man with a demonic character, who is not capable of forgiving someone, is absolutely evil and seeks total destruction of the objects of his hatred. It is difficult to understand the depth of his cruelty and the extreme irrationality of his actions.The book teaches a number of lessons, one of which is the damage that resentment and pride can do to a person as it did to Heathcliff. The author also shows the negative impact of class differences as Catherine cannot embrace Heathcliff for who he is, despite their deep mutual love.This is a compelling and powerful book that left a deep impression on me. The intensity of the emotions exhibited by the main characters is captivating. This powerful and unforgettable novel is highly recommended for those studying English Literature and anyone else who wants to read an interesting and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"That, along with many other lines, is why so many of us love Wuthering Heights. It is my all-time favorite book. I've loved it since I was about 14 years old (I'm 30 now). I love the atmospheric quality, the isolation, the rawness of human nature that this book portrays. Yes, Heathcliff and Catherine's love now seems a bit crazy, but for people who led such isolated lives, it's not hard to believe. To me, the novel IS Heathcliff. SPOILER ALERT--Once Catherine dies (midway in the novel), you would think the novel would end. But it doesn't, because Heathcliff's story continues. He's still my favorite anti-hero of any novel (sorry but Darcy or Rochester CANNOT compare)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, by far the most talented, arcane, imaginative of the Bronte sisters, wrote the most mentally-provocative love story ever told in the English language. Everything about this book is brilliant! Its setting on the \\"wuthering\\" (wind-swept) hilltops of a Yorkshire moor that seems not just ghost-ridden but somehow physically suspended in time is the most perfect marriage of location to tale I know of. The characters here, needless to say most especially the damned, tormented Heathcliff, rise so far above anything else written in the English language for the next hundred years that I only wish there was a higher rating than five stars to heave praise on this deserving masterpiece. I was given stacks of \\"classic\\" novels to read throughout high school and I grew cynical about them all, these boring, dust-choked standing ruins of books, but Wuthering Heights was a rare exception. This story of love, death, obsession and the indescribable energy of human emotion all but rises off the page with its ferocity. It's widely said Victorian women had fainting spells under the power of Bronte's prose, and I don't doubt that. It is not for me to try to detail this novel's plot, but rather to try to convey to you the force with which Bronte's great book struck me. I was shocked by its brilliance and reveled in all its suggested far down below its cacophonous words. Anyone who claims to appreciate literature and does not read Wuthering Heights is dwelling in a self-imposed exile from an experience few books can deliver. The sheltered Miss Bronte, in literature what the later Emily Dickinson was to poetry, was, in her era, without peer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the most passionate and haunting novels I have ever read. Emily Bronte's incredible understanding of human nature makes this tale of the power of both love and hate more endearing and realistic than the normal Romantic novel. Even after 150 years, it has the ability to shock and horrify a reader, as well as move them to tears of both joy and sorrow. The first half of the novel that illustrates Catherine Earnshaw's and Heathcliff's doomed affair is by far the most popular and famous section of the book. However, our culture has severely watered down their fascinating relationship to an archetypal version of two lovers. Bronte presents us with a much deeper, twisted, and complicated love that destroys their lives as well as the people around them. I personally also loved the second half of the book that deals with the effects of Catherine and Heathcliff on the next generation. It is much less intense than the first half, but is very beautiful and brings the plot to a full circle. I strongly recommend this book, but please do not believe that it will be a simple love story. It is a complex analysis on vindication, jealousy, hatred, and of couse, a love that is even stronger than death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its been a long time since I've fully been engrossed in a novel-for some time, I've worked my way through books, flipping a few pages forward so I could see when the chapter would end and I could find something better to entertain myself with. This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read Wuthering Heights for first time when i was 12 years old.Now I\`m 18 and I\`m still reading this book.And at everytime i read it, I can\`t hold myself from crying.

It was so intense and original that I honestly had to force myself to close the book at night and get some sleep. One should not expect a likeness to Shakespeare's extraordinary skill of language, but it obviously was not written by an idiot. Overall it is easy reading, with a few sophisticated, rarely used words encountered every page or two. The book should be read by anyone who can appreciate true love, and the pain caused through selfishness, cruelty, and all-encompassing sorrow. Just about every feeling of emotion is covered in this great work, actually. Don't put much truth into what some reviews say about the ending. There truly could not have been a better one. Everything comes full-circle, as I see it, and it happens in such a way as to make any sharp reader satisfied. Check this book out from the library; or better yet, buy it so you can read it again, ten years down the line, when you've forgotten what it was even about."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the first time I got to read this absolutely astounding masterpiece, I got thrilled and enchanted by the most beautiful language, descriptions that make you see the set and actions before your eyes, and of course this consuming crazy passion which entwines both main characters. Emily Bronte succeed not only in creating a most touching, and yet horrifying love story, which can only be compared to Phantom by Susan Kay,but also managed to make it a Gothic tale with symbolism and double meaning all around. This is a book to be read many times, and understood deeply. I was 16 when I've read it for the first time, and since then I reread it for countless number of times, and each time I discovered something new. It helped me to grow emotionally. In this story, &quot;physical&quot; true love is lifted above our world, ad turned into something more spiritual. The bond between heathcliff and Cathy was so strong that it conquered death. A greatest love story of all time. A must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The other reviews of the book already summarize the plot and lend a personal response. I only wish to bring to mind, a few points about the book which make it worth reading and worth appreciating .Written in the typical Gothic Novel style, the work is full of horror, violence, love, trauma and death. How many authors can intergrate all that into a single plot and have the novel called a &quot;classic&quot;? The fact that Heathcliff cannot be classified is crucial to the novel, he oscillates between the vicitm of abuse by Hindley, and the villain by Nelly, Cathy and Linton. Throughout the novel, the unreliability of the narrative only adds to the dire and dark tone of the novel - making it even more horrific than it already is. In the time Bronte wrote in, eroticism in literature was absent - the boldness of Bronte in writing about a man walking into a married woman's bedroom inannounced is not only shocking, but also a precursor to the modern, romantic drivel that some read. Its a great book, the theme of nature vs.nurture and of wuthered development have been taken up with severity - and as the story unravels, the plot reveals itself in repetition - highlighting the horror of violence. Read this book, knowing the time it was written in, see the harsh descriptions of the violence committed by a loveless man, whose unknown background makes him a mystery. Tell me, when you've read it, if you think Heathcliff was an illegal child of old Earnshaw...is there another explanation for the way he is brought into the house, and why catherine and him develop the diabolical friendship they have?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text. Rather than spend even 99 cents on this version, get the Project Gutenberg download of Wuthering Heights for the Kindle. It is better formatted and free."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What?! Seriously? They had to put a Twilight cover on this book to get people to read it? Wuthering Heights is a million times better and more important than Twilight. Come on!I doubt any of the characters of Twilight had anything anything close to the depth required to even comprehend this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a cruel,complex, unforgettable look at possessive love. The 1847 novel was the only one witten by Emily Bronte.The story tells of Heathcliff who is an orphan adopted on a Liverpool journey by Mr. Earnshaw. He brings the ragged lad back home to the wild moors of Yorkshire. Heathcliff is mistreated by the oafish Hindley Earnshaw the son of the family. He spends long dreamy hours wandering the moors with Catherine the Earnshaw daughter. After many complications Heathcliff leaves England for mysterious regions. He returns years later to discover Catherine has married the weak milquetoast Edgar Linton who gives Catherine the security and kind love of a well to do landowner.Catherine dies giving birth to daughter Cathy. Heathcliff weds the infatuated sister Isabella sister of Edgar Linton. In the second half of the novel Catherine's daughter will wed the son of Heathcliff and Isabella. Isabella has fled from the cruel Heathcliff dying at an early age.The novel is structured as a flashback to events told by Nelly Dean a nurse to Catherine who relates them to Mr. Lockwood a shallow English dandy who has rented Thrushcross Grange following a failed romantic affair.The novel switches from past to present dealing with many characters with similar names. Heathcliff is often called satanic and is a figure of Dantian and Satanic power. He is very cruel killing small animals; driving Isabella away and insulting everyone. He mistreats his son and his alcoholic nephew. Heathcliff is as rough as a crag of rock on the wild moors. He longs for a complete soul union with Catherine. He even has her dug up from the grave so he can look at her dead face! Necrophilia, sadism, overt cruelty to the weak are everday occurrences at Wuthering Heights which is ruled by the tyrant Heathcliff and his mean toady servant the repulsive Bible thumping Joseph.Catherine is petulant, violent, selfish and cruel. Neither Heathcliff or Catherine are admirable characters. They apparently love and long for one another. At one point Catherine tells Nelly \\"Heathcliff and I are one soul.\\" Following her death she will haunt Heathcliff as she roams the stark moors in neither heaven or hell.Libraries have been built dealing with the complexity of this novel. It demands several rereads. Let it be said that the novel is always fresh, suprising and modern. Wuthering Heights is not your typical love story. It is harsh, stark and cruel. Read it and ponder this tale of ghostly, obsessive, dreamliike love set against the dark brooding moors of Yorkshire. The characters will leave a permanent imprint on your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'll never forget a one-on-one extended conversation I once had with the celebrated, brilliant albeit tortured poet, John Berryman (and his bottle of Jack). What remains with me from that broadly inclusive and allusive ramble about all things literary (and more) was his singling out Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as the one novel capable of exerting a hold on the reader that all but defied his analysis and description. I didn't fully grasp his drift at the time, but after at least two additional readings of this perversely powerful, heaven-denying yet time-defying testimony to indestructible passion that is neither quite \\"of\\" nor \\"out of\\" this world, I now number myself among those who, like Berryman, are in the novel's grip.The uniqueness of the story is not the subject matter (as Charlotte implied in her critical assessment of her sister's novel--though I would grant that scenes of puppy hanging and necrophilia are not common Victorian fare). The novel owes its special place to the discourse--the language as employed by Emily Bronte to express the feelings of Catherine and Heathcliff--that moreover insures familiar emotions strike the reader in unfamiliar ways, altering and destabilizing conventional understandings before taking root in consciousness. Bronte's syntax and diction literally make the reader \\"work,\\" but the difficulty is essential to her dual purpose: 1. to enable us to experience first-hand some of the same reeling and disorientation felt by the characters who ride the whirlwind of their fatal but not deadly passion; 2. to convey the supreme difficulty (impossibility, for most of us) and accomplishment of representing in words a passion that is equal parts natural and unnatural.The key to reading this novel for maximum impact and lasting appreciation is to struggle with, but not give up on, the novel's vital meanings, which are in the passages containing some combination of the following: paradox and irony, sudden reversals, antithesis, oxymoronic juxtaposition, natural images functioning as \\"objective correlatives,\\" mind-blowing similes and metaphors pushed to extravagant literary \\"conceits.\\" Above all, the reader needs to be alert to Bronte's transpositions of references and referents, her displacements of \\"signifiers\\" and the \\"signifieds\\" with which they are normally paired.The foregoing might seem to be insufficient incentive to read this remarkable novel were it not for the surprising degree of \\"precision\\" that characterizes Bronte's eros-fueled discourse about love. Just as the \\"monstrous,\\" elemental, and hate-spewing Heathcliff is at the same time an attentive, responsive observer (catching Hindley and later Catherine in mid-flight, a fractional second before either hits the floor) and a careful, even long-range planner, taking pains to stay within the \\"law,\\" Bronte's language attends to and remains true to its own laws, adhering to a meticulous and consistent logic that rewards the reader who has the patience to stay with its lurching, unpredictable course. Once you've decoded a statement such as Heathcliff's that he can \\"never forgive Catherine's murderer\\"--with Catherine herself being the \\"murderer\\" he has in mind--the logic of Bronte's lexicon along with her unfailing responsibility to the reader become more evident, making possible a relationship between reader and text rivaling that of Cathy and Heathcliff.(Concerning this Penguin edition, I could do without its return to the original published format of two volumes along with two chapter 1's, two chapter 2's, etc. The unified, organic structure of the novel is better served by an edition that avoids such a distracting bifurcation of the narrative. There's only one potential benefit that I can see: if you read the first volume only, the William Wyler-directed Hollywood classic starring Olivier and Oberon works much better.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights contains the charms and vices of a soap opera. Due to the complex family structure one almost needs to keep the family tree handy while reading to keep from getting confused. I enjoy watching soap operas I like to know all the complex family history or just basic background that has been happening for years. When you know all of the history, it makes the story make sense. Wuthering Heights has this charm because of its long time span and complicated family tree. Some of the bad points of soap operas are also present in Wuthering Heights. One such disadvantage is, in my opinion, slow moving plots. Since there is such a long time period covered, the stories can often drag out. Overall, I liked Wuthering Heights for its soap opera-like qualties."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Overall the book had alot to do with a mystery of love. This book left you wondering what will happen next. Out of everything I had read in the book. I like Catherine Earnshaw Lintons part the most. She was wild at times then a lady at another time. Catherine had it bad with the confusion she had between the two men. My favorite part is on page (149) when Edgar return home from Gimmerton and catches Heathcliff with his wife cause she didn't want Heathcliff to go. The part that seem to make me think is what was Edgar thinking when Heathcliff Gave Catherine to him. This book was Good and I would recommend this book to any one. But I would make sure I explain each character to him or her first."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest books I ever read. It was written so fine and with such sensitivity that you feel like living a character in it. Love and hate are used very well together. Hard thing about the books is to learn the characters and how they are related to one and other. Be sure to read the version with the list of difficult words and you'll enjoy the book. Very, very good..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a very powerful book that captures you immediately into its narative. You want to grab these two characters and tell them to STOP hurting each other. My wish for them has always been happiness together but that never happens. They are doomed from the start to live life loving each other from a distance never being truely together. I wish more people would read this classic for this really is one of the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is definately one of the top ten best books I have ever read. The plot is wonderful, and the charceters are extremely well devolped. I have started staying up as late as midnight to finish it. My only complaint is the narritive is hard to follow sometimes, and I keep getting the Cathrines mixed up. Otherwise, it is great."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon the understanding of the Earnshaw and Linton family histories, one can begin to enjoy the twisted and beautiful facets of Emily Bronte's plot. The development of the character of Heathcliff is nothing short of genius. He is a true villain that at times can be greatly sympathized with because of his great loss, the love of his life. The gothic elements in this novel greatly heighten the overall effect of Bronte's plot. A beautiful story that is indeed a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was very much looking forward to a wonderfully written, romantic classic, but I was disappointed to find that the romance and love is not as moving and touching as I had expected. For one reason, the two main characters who fall in love are dislikable characters. I did not like Catherine or Heathcliff, and this made it very hard for me to enjoy the book. However, despite this, I still enjoyed this book. I do recommend it although I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Despite its outward appearance, Wuthering heights is not a romance story. Bronte's purpose in writing this novel was to find out whether or not her criminally-inclined brother could be forgiven. She represented her brother with Heathcliff, a character whose depth of emotion and spirit-- an almost inhuman depth, far surpassing all except Catherine I-- perhaps made possible the extenuation of the absolute evil of his vengeance. I'll say no more, Bronte's purpose was that every reader judge for himself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the story about the obssessive love between Catherine and Heathcliff.An eternal love that destroyed everyone who tried to destroy it, and was stronger than death"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up Wuthering Heights because I was bored, and then I couldn't put it down. It was intriguing from the start, and never once boring. I plan to read this novel again at some point in the future"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights during a time when the people of England were not ready for such an intense and passionate novel. There-for it was not given the recognition it truely diserved until many years later, long after she died of T.B. Wuthering Heights is truely a work of art. The story envelopes the reader into a mysterious world with very heartful characters. The narration is perfect, in that you are seeing and hearing everything that the narrator says and sees. Emily's writting style is perfect in that she always gives just the right amount of details in her accounts. As a matter of fact, the story is so well written that a reader who really takes the time to understand and enjoy the book will soon find himself/herself attatched to it. It is almost impossible to put down. Over all, Wuthering Heights is a book not to be missed, but reader be warned, it is a book that takes a lot of effort to read. A lot of paragraphs require heavy analyzing to make sure that you catch the hidden meanings and important foreshadowing. In think that there really isnt much of an age restriction, but if your reading this book for pleasure, and your under fourteen, you wasting your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Part of the charm of this novel is that it remains very readable 150+ years after its original publication date. The language of the book flows in a wonderful way, carrying the reader fully into another time and place. Emily Bronte was a true artist; telling a story of passion, pride, jealousy and vengeance using ordinary characters we can all relate to. An unforgettable literary masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is clearly the genius of the family. If you liked Jane Eyre, you will love Wuthering Heights. It is *better* than Jane Eyre, it made me like Jane Eyre less in contrast with Wuthering Height's intense passion. This book is extremely unique and insightful. Don't let the first two chapters confuse you, don't put down this novel, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really loved this book. It was a wonderful book, definetly worth your time. The feelings, and the characters were amazing. Each time I read it, a new feeling, a new moral, pops out. Every time is better than the last."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think I know how Emily Bronte developed the character of Heathcliff. I believe that she based it on that of her father. Outrageous? Unfair? After all the Rev. Bronte was a decent sort of chap whereas on one occasion Heathcliff beat a young teenager until he lost consciousness.But consider this. Emily's father, tormented by his intellectual isolation and his lonely widowhood, used to occasionally open the back door of his house and fire a gun several times into the moors for no apparent reason. You can imagine the young Emily tentatively enquiring, &quot;Is everything alright, father?&quot; and her father answering brusquely, &quot;Perfectly satisfactory, thank you, my dear.&quot; and then slamming the door as he disappeared back into his study.On other occasions, he used to stuff furniture or a rug into the living room fire. I forget where I read this. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte? Daphne du Maurier's excellent book &quot;The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte&quot;?I doubt that Emily forgot the images created by her father's behaviour. It must have seemed to her like a hint of a suppressed rage so huge as to demand the creation of a character like Heathcliff to express it.How strange this book - like a dream journey into the subconscious world! People reflected in other people. Time collapsing onto itself. As Emily herself said in a poem, &quot;Once having drunk of such divinist anguish How can I face the empty world again?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Like To Kill A Mockingbird, Wuthering Heigts is a novel on the 'prepare for college' reading list, and is read in many high schools. I found an old copy on my mothers bookshelf, and loved this novel before I knew it was considered a 'classic'. You often hear references made to star-crossed literary couples such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Catherine and Heathcliff'. It is telling that this work is important enough to be referenced alongside ShakespeareThe only novel written by Emily (her sisters Charlotte and Anne were more prolific), the tale takes place on the moors of England. Catherine Earnshaw is surprised when her well-to-do father brings home a mysterious foundling and names him Heathcliff. A dark and brooding child, Heathcliff nonetheless becomes Catherines playmate and confedant.Their relationship changes, however, as Catherine grows into a woman. She begins to think that a lady of her station should not be dallying with a foundling such as Heathcliff, who has no family or wealth. She is wrapped in her own vain self-worth, and beings to spur the bewildered Heathcliff.A moody and potentially violet man, Heathcliff retreats further into himself the worse Catherine treats him. He never stops loving her, his passion endures even her scorn. The end of their love affair is both beautiful and tragic.A great triumph of writing by a woman of her time, Emily died shortly after her novel was published. As a historical note, the three sisters published their work under pen names. This ruse was concocted so publishers wound presume the works were written by men, and would therefore be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights when I was in high school. To this day it is still my favorite book. The characters of Heathcliff and Catherine come alive. I still feel the heartache experienced by these two characters whenever I read the final confrontation scene between these two soulmates. You are actually swept away by their passion and pain.This is one book I would highly recommend to anyone who has an appreciation for great literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I loved this book. You must read it. I have never read any book like this before. It's both happy and sad....read it yourself and you will see what I meen!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"the point of view was different and that was one of the main things that i enjoyed about this book. at the beginning i was like what a boring book because it had nothing to do with what it was sopposed to andi was confused. but further on i started to understand and couldn't put the book down. heathcliff and catherines characters were hard to like but had to admire their love. it ws unique, something that only people dream of and even though theirs didnt work because their likves turned out the wasy it did catherine(2)and hareton experience love. it was well written and one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read this book looking for plots that are simple to follow and modern grammar will be sorely disappointed. It is a classic, beautifully written and descriptive. I chose this novel for my senior thesis, and when delved into more deeply, the complex relationships and manipulations between characters is astounding. Emily Bronte is an artist whom I greatly admire and will always look to as an inspiration. I pity those not exposed to this caliber of writing, and even more so those who cannot find any enjoyable portion of it. It is a work of passion, innovative in a time of repression."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first book I ever read by the Bronte sisters was Jane Eyre, and I loved it, while WH was too gloomy for my 13 years. I still appreciate Jane Eyre a lot, but I think you can compare Emily Bronte only to Dostoyevsky. WH is above all about life, how it crushes a person, how it changes you from a child into an adult, often thereby destroying the best part in you, about making utterly wrong decisions for the society's sake...it is universal and timeless."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book in Bosnia, when I was 8, and in the beginning, I was bored by the insipid narrator...then, as I read further on, I gained a whole new world of insights, and after I put it down, I was not the same. This is-without any doubts-one of the greatest books ever written: about love, probably not the way it really exists, but more about the way it should be-fierce, almost insane, unconditional, holy; about life, the way it often is, merciless, disregarding one's true wishes and needs. But all the words I pile up here fade away in comparison with this book. It is a shame that there are so many worthless &quot;romantic fiction&quot; pulp books being published and read, when there is Wuthering Heights to teach you about love, loss and despair."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is excellent, but to fully appreciate it, you must be able to understand not only love but passion. Immature readers cannot grasp the depth of the passion between Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. While Jane Eyre is an interesting story, it does not reveal the magnitude of human emotion and angst that Wuthering Heights does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading all the comments made me sick to the stomach. Everyone nowadays is just living too fast to enjoy the world's real treasures: books. So stop thinking about the logics of Wuthering Heights and just enjoy it 'cause it's the BEST!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am one of the only men Ive ever met that really likes this book. Its one of the only two books that I had to read for school that I actually liked (the other being 1984). Its an extremely passionate story of, as the above description says &quot;a love stronger than death&quot;. Also, I feel this is a book that almost anyone can relate to, due to the way it gets down to the essence of what love is. My words cannot do this book justice properly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is amazing. It is such a powerful story. everytime I read it I can see, almost feel, it happen. It's such a dark, almost morbid story. there's just so much feeling that went into writing the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN and is probably the greatest book that will ever be written. It not only has a great story line but it has a true depth to it that seems to reach beyond physical life and understanding itself. For a women of that time to have such insight into the psychology of her caracters amazes me. I first read it when I was a senior in highschool and it gave me a true love and respect for reading and great writers such as Emily Bronte. I highly recomend reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Simply the most incredible book I have ever read. The characters become embedded in your mind, and you live through their body and see through their eyes. It is so heart-wrenchingly passionate that at times you will feel helpless under the book's control. For anyone who enjoys romance and passion, this is the book with your name written on it. Everyone should read this book, for it taps into those rare and everyday human emotions that we can recognize and relate to. Indeed, a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rants and raves for Wuthering Heights. A story of the past but applies to today's reality. A story of twisted love, passion, jealousy and loosing a loved one.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. In my eyes it was a master piece written in the past. Unlike today's novels this book holds imagery close. You really feel like you're in the story. Not only are you reading but it's like you become a character, watching from the side lines. Just a master piece written by Emily Bronte, a story that will bring event back into reading a novel.A dark and twisted love story, that isn't what most people want to read, but once you get a few chapters in your stuck; you want to know what's going to happen next. Where this love triangle and twisted story is about to go.I'm afraid to say the some of the chapters didn't make since, the twisted, dark, beginning is alittle hard to follow. But if you get past that and really read what this book is about you will find an adventure you never expected to find.I give 4 out of 5 stars. This book is close to being an all time favorite. Not quiet there yet. But close. I recommend reading this book; it's a book to read on a rainy day. Something i will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was perhaps the first book that i read which made me cry, laugh and allowed me to become more attached to characters than any other book i had read. When i read it, i knew it was going to be one of my favourite books for life.Emily Bronte's tale of incest, death, insantiy and fate never seems to grow old whilst leaving a testement to the past at the same time. Without a doubt, Wuthering Heights also contains one of the most powerful and potent settings of any book. The book's narrative is divided into two stories- the first of Cathy and Heathcliff and the second of Catherine and Hareton. Which did i prefer? Heathcliff as the hero, but i couldn't not love him as the villain too.Perhaps the main reason i adore this book so much is the obscure complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy and the undying list of themes that seem to grow in number everytime one picks up the book. Any author who succeeds in forcing the reader to like the bad and hate the good has done an amiable task and Emily Bronte does that to the fullest degree. Let's not forget the brilliant insults either. A fabulous read for anyone old enough to appreciate greatness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Heathcliff is an orphan, adopted by the Earnshaws, where he falls madly in love with their daughter, Catherine. But Catherine denies her true love for Heathcliff, instead marrying Edgar Linton for his wealth, education and good looks. In denying herself Heathcliff, Catherine falls to madness and death, and Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins not only her, but everyone Heathcliff has ever associated with.The truth is this is a really well crafted novel. Many are put off by the dark and brooding themes. Also the word choice and frequent switch of narrators can be confusing. But you have to give the book time. Emily Bronte's word use is masterful, giving the characters great scope and the setting an eerie vividness. The revelations are shocking, but also very gripping. It's a love story that goes tragically wrong for the characters, and it leaves a real imprint on you when you finish it. If your into tragic love stories, it is a classic, so you should consider it. And don't worry, the ending isn't THAT tragic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not just about love. It is about hatred, delusion, despair. Most of all, it is about vengeance. A spiteful, remorseless and hopeless vengeance exacted for a lost and mourned love. It is indeed a dark, bitter novel which makes you feel angry and woeful. And yet amongst this blind darkness of feelings there's something more than mere despondency: there's faithfulness to a love that is able to survive beyond any parting, even in death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic by Emily Bronte is a must read. The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate. Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature. You either love him or you hate him. Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad. This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize. The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine. It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter. The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants. Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love. Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet. It can also be selfish and twisted."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel was some what ridiculous. The main characters were childish and I actually ended up liking the neighbors better - which I think was the objective. The ending was the only part that I actually enjoyed - don't worry, I won't give it away. I'll just say that it is a relief from the chaos apparent through out the novel. The mood uf the entire novel is dark and despondent...it was just too gloomy for me. I read it first when I was 17 - after reading so many other well written classics by great authors - I have to say that this one does not compare."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a supremely compelling novel displaying the best and the worst of our own human nature. It most certainly is worthy of all the praise it has received, and I can say it was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. After enduring the first one or two chapters- which are incredibly droll- one is immersed into a world of the most elliquent emotions, and the deepest ties between the charecters. Within the first few chapters you begin to spot the eternal, everlasting love between the two main chareters Heathcliff and Catherine. Unfortunatly the family rivalry between Hindley(Catherines brother)and Heathcliff soon make it clear their undying love cannot be fullfilled due to the fact that before Heathcliff was adopted into the family he was a gutter waif,or one may say a vagabond. Then Catherine marries, which forces all the residences of their little world to be flung unto a world of deception, cruelty, spite, and revenge.I would say that after reading this book one really has to view humanity and love in a different light. For me it really exposed the deep emotions that are never in black and white and that one must really be introduced to before they can truly begin to know what feelings are about. Probably the best part of this book, or at least for me, is the way Bronte makes the reader feel what the charecters feel and how gradually she gives one the understanding of the conflicts between the chareters. Bronte also prestents her book in such a way that after a while you really feel you are in the room whatching the events unfold, which gives the reader the oppertunity to care about the novel. Somehow, I cannot beleve I thought I was not going to like this book when I first began reading it, but now I'm sure it will remain a classic for millenia to come."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was our newest assingest reading in my language arts class. I have to be honest I almost quit the course just looking at how difficult it seemed. I had never read classic literature before and it was something new, that looked way too difficult for me. Now that I have finished reading the book, I completely understand where all the stories I love to read came from. They take the basic story line from classics such as this one, and make it simpler. However, I honestly enjoyed the challenge of coming to understand this book. I have also struck a new passion for classic literature.Emily Bronte had a magnificiant way of finding different twists to be put all over. For instance, the book starts off at the ending and does a flashback of the beginning of the novel. Her ways of connecting things make this book so you can't skip a beat or you'll be forced to go reread it. Each chapter is jam packed with details. Even ones you think insignificant have ways of tieing in later on.The true story begins a love/hate good/evil battle. It's a lesson in life and teaches you about what certain peoples values truly were. For Catherine (a main character in the story) as much as she loved Heathcliff (a servant boy who was found on the streets of London and adopted into the Earnshaw family) her decision to marry was not followed by her heart, but by what her social status would become. She ends up marrying Edgar( a wealthy man who lived down the road from Wuthering Heights in a place called Thrushcross Grange) and not knowingly sparks Heathcliff's revenge which is the story line continued through the very end of the story.To love Heathcliff is to hate Heathcliff and visa versa. He plays almost the biggest role since he is one of the only characters who is known throughout the whole book. You first meet him as a grumpy old man whom Linton( one of the narrators) is leasing Wuhtering Heights from. As the new narrator, Nelly Dean( another servant girl who had a long past with the Earnshaw family) tells of what hardships he really had to go trough. Heathcliff was an adopted orphan and he was brought into a father who loved him, a sister who really showed no care at the time ( but who would fall madly in love with him in the end) and a brother who showed nothing but hatred towards him until his dying day. Mr. Earnshaw was very partial to Heathcliff to I think that struck the hatred from Hindley ( the brother). Throughout the late Catherines life, it was a constant battle between love and money. Although Catherine marries Edgar and Heathcliff does end up with Isabella ( Edgars younger sister), their love only grows stronger. And it continues even after Catherine dies and has her daugheter, young Cathy.Both volumes of this book are so much alike. It is almost the same story just with the heirs of the deceased living it. Cathy ( late Catherine's daughter) also is in love with two men.( Hareton- son of Catherine and Edgar, and Linton- son of Isabella and Heathcliff. Although Cathy's first husband( Linton ) does die shortly after their marriage and she gets to marry Hareton too, the similarities between Cathy and her mother are so significant.As the novel comes to an end Cathy and Hareton move back to Wuthering Heights. It is very debateable on wether or not this is truly a happy ending ( becuase so much has happened before it). I think it is because I think it is finally bringing the two different worlds together as one.I loved this book and enjoyed how well Bronte brought everything together. I have found a new love for classics and am finding myself enjoying more from that time period now more than anything else. All because I didn't give up on this one book...I encourage everyone who reads this to continue reading the book. It gets hard (believe me I know) but if I understood it anyone can!--d*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is on of the greatest classics in literature and one I had never read until recently. I found this story of obsessive and destructive relationships very compelling and difficult to put down. It's a romance but by no means is it a happy one. Things don't go well for these people.Wuthering Heights is the story of two families the Earnshaws and Lintons, who really should never had gotten together. It's the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine that underlies the whole book. Heathcliff is defiantly the ultimate anti-hero, he's obsessive, abusive and just plain evil, but still you feel yourself drawn into his dark world and hoping that redemption comes to him. He seems beyond it however and his destructive behaviour forms the basis of this gothic tale.Emily Bronte's skills as a writer are amazing, her language is poetic and deep and the story is truly unique. My only criticism is concerning the way she wrote dialogue for the character Joseph, it's often illegible and I found it most difficult understanding what he was saying. That aside I really enjoyed this book and recommend it wholeheartedly as a study of human nature as it is without the influence of a Divine being.Thanks for reading my review and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At first, I griped and complained about having to read this book. My aunt practically shoved it into my hands and told me that I was to read this book and like it! Well, I read it, and I don't like it at all...I absolutely LOVE it! I'm really into romance and this one hits home.Emily Bronte died one year before its publication in 1847 and is perhaps one of the most powerfully written books in the English language. I was first 13 when I read this book and it took me three more times for me to understand what the heck Joseph was saying! .... learned in this type of speech, it's really an understanding book.Just the undying love between Heathcliff and Catherine alone is enough to put anyone in tears. And how Heathcliff is so masculine, yet so insecure and rude. How did Emily Bronte come up with this passion and this knowlegde, when she seldom left her house? You can't help but fall into sync with one or more of the characters. Tragically, yet beautifully written.This book is truly a classic, you'll never want to put it down! Get it!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To make my review concise:This book is about a dysfunctional family and dysfunctional relationships between people - or more accurately, about relationships that revolve around a twisted man. It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic. Or the fact that the story-inside-a-story concept was novel at the time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Fast and prompt service and was exactly what I was looking for.

It never failed to convery its primary themes; jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. At the same time, it was missing the hook that captures you and makes you care whether the characters succeed or fail. I waited for it chapter after chapter until finally I couldn't seem to feel anything for Heathcliff or Cathy. I have read other works by the Bronte sisters. And while I won't discourage anyone from reading a book they are interested in, I must warn you, if you have any illusions that this will be in some way similar to that of &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...but otherwise, there's a plentiful selection of better books to read before this one.

Remember, old and british doesn't necessarily equal good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No book has changed me as much as Wuthering Heights has. Its appeal for me is in its sense of otherness, something so completely removed from ordinary life. Wuthering Heights is set in a realm where ordinary morals do not apply, where love is transmitted via pain and suffering, a maelstrom of the extraordinary, which lasts for about 40 years, and then is gone. Heathcliff and Cathy must be two of the most unique figures ever created in English literature. Cathy, the spirited and vengeful heroine, who pays for her one fatal mistake with her life. Heathcliff, whose drive for revenge can only be calmed by his love for Cathy. Wuthering Heights is a microcosmos, another universe, so alien and foreign from ours. Its roughness and brutality may confuse us, but beneath the pain is love and tenderness"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte did an excellent job in writing Wuthering Heights. Each character plays an important part in the novel. The way she describes each setting makes you feel like you are really there. Heathcliff, the main character, begins the novel as a young, nice orphan child brought into a family. People treated Heathcliff like a slave when he was younger,but when he gets older he gets revenge on everyone. Catherine, the other main character, is supposed to love Heathcliff according to her, but then marries another man because of money. I think Heathcliff and Catherine should have gotten married. The setting was described beautifully. Emily described the feilds of land that the kinds would play on and the green grass blowing in the breeze. The way she set the mood and the setting the same was great. She descibe how the flowers in front of Wuthering Heights were dead to let you know how bad of man Heathcliff was. Overall it was a very good book, a little hard follow sometimes, but a good book. I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I did not find this to be a book that I would recommend to others. It was not really my type of book to read. There were two parts that I found of intrest. In the first part of the book I found it kind of funny. When Lockwood came to live on Heathcliffs' property. Lockwood expressed his wanting to be isolated, but he kept talking to Heathcliff. Then Heathcliff interupted Lockwood and said, &quot;I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it-walk in!&quot; The other part I found it kind of weird. Cathy clams she does not make fun of Heatcliff,but she keeps making rude comments. Cathy says a one point, &quot;I did not mean to laugh at you.&quot; These were the only parts that I found intresting in the book. I found them intresting because of there ironic effect."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was enraptured with this book.

Even his oldest friend and companion Catherine is not beyond reproach.Lockwood knows nothing of the scandal and unrest that surrounds Wuthering Heights when he leases Thrushcross Grange from Heathcliff for a season. Scandalized by the residents of Wuthering Heights and shocked by the blatant disregard for common courtesy and propriety, he soon endeavors to unearth the whole story from his housekeeper, Nelly Dean.The story Nelly reveals is one of unresolved passion, haunting obsession, and a connection that even death cannot deny in Wuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Bront.Wuthering Heights is Bront's only novel.Groundbreaking for its time, Wuthering Heights is a divisive novel that is more often regarded with love or hate rather than indifference.Some claim Bront's gothic novel is a sweeping romance that spans not just years but death itself. Written in the first person with a framing story around the main drama of Catherine and Heathcliff's doomed relationship, Bront creates an evocative story filled with Yorkshire dialect and harsh lanscapes.At the same time, this book is a study in human cruelty. Catherine and Heathcliff are horrible people and, even while proving their love for one another, they do unspeakable things.If you can get past the basic meanness of almost all of the characters, Wuthering Heights is an atmospheric story filled with chills and menace sure to linger after the last page is finished.Possible Pairings: Frost by Marianna Baer, Plain Kate by Erin Bow, The Wicked and the Just by J.

Not only did her writng have the power to transport you to seemingly another world, but the memorable characters and personalities make Wuthering Heights a book to remember. The charming tale takes place in windswept England on a lovely castle. Told through a narrative of an old housekeeper, the story of love and hate take place first hand. While quite unsuspecting, Mr. Lockwood, a guest of Thrushcross Grange, visits, he hears the tale of the Earnshaw family who used to live in Wuthering Heights. In a tale of backstabbing, lying, cheating, love, and hatred, he hears the tale of Hindley and Heathcliff and their sibling rivalry along with their lover Catherine who marries Hindley but is in love with Heathcliff. At the end of the book, all members of the original family are gone, and Mr. Lockwood takes note of how quiet and peaceful the grange has become. The true charm of this book are the characters. The way in which they speak is charming and brings out personality. Emily Bronte had a wit an charm about her style of writing, something that is very apparent in Wuthering Heights. While filled with quite a bit of drama, Wuthering Heights is a book that will transport you to the old English estate country and leave you with a story in which you will find entertaining as well as charmming."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book came in as I had expected it too be as well as on time!

I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far.\\"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange how often I have the experience of reading an \\"old\\" novel like this one, expecting it to be dry and boring, and find that it's anything but. You'd think I'd learn, but no. There's a reason these are called classics: people have been thinking they're really good for a long time, and they're still really good. This is the kind of book I would have gone out of my way to not read in high school, which is probably just as well. I wouldn't have appreciated it then.One thing I noticed right off the bat is that this isn't Jane Austen, which just goes to show that female British novelists of the early 1800s can be very different. Jane Austen is very funny and satirical. Emily Bronte is very serious. There are flashes of humor now and then, but she's mining the human soul, and it's dark work.This book was written in 1845, but describes fictional events that took place from the 1770s until 1801. I don't know why she placed the events in the novel so far in the past. Maybe people of the 1840s would have thought, \\"Oh, the 1770s! Yeah, that's how people behaved then.\\" The same way we would think of the 1940s, I guess. But I don't have that perspective, so I don't know what she was going for.She does some pretty complicated stuff with the narration, too. She doesn't just tell you what happened, starting at the beginning and moving on to the end. She actually starts at the end of the story, with the main narrator meeting the surviving participants in what happened 30 years before. Then she begins introducing various other narrators who describe what happened from their point of view. This really plunges you into the story, because you're not looking at it from the outside, but from the perspective of someone actually involved with the events at the time. You're in the moment and in the place. I was impressed by such sophisticated storytelling in what I think was her first novel, and in 1845.There are only a handful of characters in the story, and each one is sharply delineated. You can just picture these people. Bronte has a knack for apt description. I was glad this wasn't one of those novels that describes every nail in the floor, but what description there is is always telling and to the point. She's not just filling up pages like some authors ::cough:: Dickens ::cough:: sometimes do.The plot is simple enough. Heathcliff is a boy of unknown origins who is brought up in the same family as the girl Catherine. They're inseparable companions. However, when they grow up, Catherine marries someone else. That's it. But the consequences and the complexity of the interactions of these two characters with each other and with everyone around them are amazing. Bronte wrings every drop out of the situation. At some times, you get the feeling, \\"Wait: you mean, if he had heard the rest of what she'd said, none of this would have happened?\\" But that's what life is like sometimes. It depends on a single word or look or gesture.I think that people of the time would have been pretty scandalized by some of the goings-on. People play pretty loose with \\"the sanctity of marriage\\", for instance. And I think it would have absolutely terrified women about getting pregnant. Everybody dies in childbirth in this book.I also think this has to be one of the first novels that has an actual sociopath as a main character. Dropping someone like Heathcliff into ordinary polite English society is like tossing a hand grenade into a cricket match. The effects are devastating, and all the more so because people don't expect it and have no idea how to deal with it.To modern audiences, there are other parts that are at least as disturbing. The idea of first cousins marrying seems to be perfectly fine with these people - in fact, one character does it twice - but probably gives readers today a Ewww feeling. And the casual way that Heathcliff can beat people, or kidnap them, or lock them in their rooms for weeks, all without even the mention of the possibility of some kind of police or legal reckoning is chilling.Bronte shows a perfection of wording that is astonishing. She always selects the right word to describe even the most commonplace of actions, such as walking or talking. It's an unobtrusive thing, but she words scenes with a precision that is admirable.Ultimately, this is a fascinating novel following events from a simple source that eventually engulf and destroy almost everyone connected with them, like a slow and remorseless tidal wave.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A must read...not because \\"Bella\\" says you should. But because this story is just so powerful. Aside from that one guy you can't ever understand, it takes you to another time with language that is so much like woven yarn."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A great classic read.

My only exposure to the story was the film starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. About halfway through I'm thinking....was the movie this dark? Why do I not remember Heathcliff being so ruthless? Well, turns out the movie version I saw only covers the first half of the book (as I learned through Wikipedia). I imagine the filmakers found second-half Heathcliff to be so unlikeable that even the dashing Olivier could not redeem him.The book was immensely compelling literature, and frankly I tore through it, but I had a hard time sympathizing with Heathcliff's unsatiable appetite for revenge. The second half of the book is like \\"My Name is Earl\\" in reverse. \\"Hmm, who wronged me and how can I avenge them? Hindley? Check. Edgar? Check.\\" It overshadowed whatever love there was between he and Catherine. Not to mention that Catherine was by all accounts a spoiled, unlikeable brat.So 4 stars because it is a fine piece of literature, but wow....not what I was expecting. Dark, dark, dark. Not that dark is inherently bad (Anna Karenina and House of Mirth end shall we say, darkly, and they are two of the best books on earth), but I think I'll stick with Darcy and Elizabeth for my romantic leads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone who is long out of high school, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights (and properly this time!)One literary critic I read somewhere said that the sheer number of characters is deliberately confusing. Certainly, it doesn't make it any easier that there are two Catherines. Nor the frequent use of surnames, rather than first names and vice versa, quite interchangably.Like many reviewers before me I found many of the characters thoroughly odious and of moral outrage. Why Nelly Dean doesn't just leave them all is a mystery to me.One thing I found of great help to my understanding of the book was to paste a clearer copy of the family tree to the inside-front cover of the book. I found this on page 308 of The Scribner Companion to the Bronts by Barbara and Gareth Lloyd Evans. The marriages and births are clearer and far more readable.I also felt the need to take notes from a number of other literary critical works on the book to get my head around the whole plot, the characters, themes, imagery and Haworth landscape.Perhaps for the most serious among us there is a concordance to Wuthering Heights! This is great for those doing a paper on some certain theme found in the book, who want to find all the references to that topic all in one place. If you are wanting to find it: A Concordance to Bront's Wuthering Heights by C. Ruth Sabol and Todd K. Bender, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York/London, 1984, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities Vol. 428.Thoroughly recommended. It only loses a star because I would have enjoyed something slightly less complex, which is really just a reflection on this poor reviewer, rather than Emily Bront."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to study this book a few years ago and i think it was the novel that opened my eyes to all classics. The Bronte sisters are among my most well loved authors and Emily's Wuthering Heights top the list. In fact, my book was so often read I had to glue the cover back on when it fell apart.Wuthering Heights is a deep dark novel full of revenge, passion, love and hatred. I have once heard this book called 'dry' by someone who clearly hadn't read it as Wuthering Heights is so far from it. Heathcliff spends his whole life seeking revenge on other characters right from when Mr Earnshaw brings him home from London. However, it cannot be said that he is the only character seeking revenge. In all of the subplots one character is avenging his/herself on another.Lockwood is among the silliest men ever written about, he is right up there with the bumbling Mr Collins of Pride and Prejudice (another favourite). Lockwood is the only character to whom anything of humour happens to, providing the reader with some light comic relief. Having said that, the violence which taints all characters has not passed over Lockwood who tries slitting the wrists of the ghost of Cathy .The numerous allusions to the devil and supernatural were still a controversial subject, especially for a woman, to be writing about at the turn of the century and Emily Bronte was berated by many for writing such a book. However, without the references the book would lose so much of its full force. Heathcliff would not exist except as the evil man he is.Somehow I love the people in this book but I could not tell you why. The only characters who I find myself disliking are Linton and Isabella, however they are the only ones with any sense of goodness surrounding them. I suppose the reason I love the others is for their passion and love for another.This is the greatest of all the great classics and if you find it hard to catch onto do yourself a favour and persevere. I found it difficult the first time I tried to read it and now it's a favourite"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have had Wuthering Heights in my possesion for 2 years and could at first only get past the first few pages.I bought it after reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. As soon as I got into it and got to know the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine I couldnt put it down! I found myself staying up till late at night just to see what would happen next and trying to study for a test but ending up opening it and getting totally absorbed in the plot and characters. I guess it is a curse to love books sometimes, and weird to make bad grades because of them at points. Get the book it is great for men and women! My dad loves it! Heathcliff is a very strong male character that boys will enjoy. And Catherine is a very real woman character and that girls will enjoy because she is far from perfect and has a nasty temper but the men in her life adore her anyway."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very disturbing \\"what goes around comes around\\" type of story. I personally think that you can have a negative look at the story or a positive look. While reading this book I felt bad for poor Heithcliff, who was treated terribly as a child and fought his whole life to get his revenge. However, at the same time I hated Heithcliff for the pain that he caused everyone while getting his revenge. The setting is a very important part of the story. I think the reader is made aware of the darkness and evil mood of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. As I was reading the story I could easily see what the author intended me to picture in my head. All I could see was darkness simply because everyone is just sad and depressed as though they hated their life and wanted to die, which just laid the way for all the tragedies, heartaches and most importantly, betrayal. They all sat around all day and had nothing to do but engage in silly drama.Even though the plot was clear I would have to say that it was rather hard to keep track of all the characters. If anyone has read this book they know exactly what I am talking about. In physics when they talked about how \\"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\", they definitely must have had this book on their mind! In the beginning we meet a character named Earnshaw who adopts a child named Heathcliff. Heathcliff unintentionally makes Earnshaw's true son, Hindley, jealous. The trouble starts when Earnshaw seems to have more of a connection with his adopted child than his own. Sadly, after Earnshaw dies Hindley takes his revenge out on Heathcliff. For years Heathcliff has to live under his older brother's thumb, which makes the plot thicken. Heathcliff then devotes his whole life toward seeing that he gets his revenge for the way that he has been treated. Wuthering Heights is indeed a classic. However, this book goes too deep into description about certain things and the wording is a bit hard to understand. After I read the book I needed the cliffs notes so that I could fully understand specific things. This book is full of pure evil, which is why I do not recommend it for any lighthearted reader. It is more for anyone who likes a tale about wicked love and sweet revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario.

Heathcliff is soon favored over Hindley by Mr. Earnshaw. A bitter rivalry develops between the two boys which is only intensified later by the death of Mr. Earnshaw.

Catherine is welcomed by the Lintons but Heathcliff is excluded. Heathcliff disappears for three years because of a misunderstanding. During his absence Edgar Linton and Catherine marry. After his return Heathcliff's obsessive love for Catherine and his desire for revenge against Edgar provide all the necessary ingredients for a real tragedy.WUTHERING HEIGHTS can be looked at as a story about love and hate or good and evil.

If I could have fiercly stabbed his character to death I believe I wouldn't hesistate in doing so. The person he loved more than any thing and his only reason for living died yet I can feel no pity at all for him.This book was to me horrifing. I gave it 4 stars because I will NEVER forget it. Such a sequence of terrible, cruel events inflicted by one person in a life long pursuit of vengence goes beyond words. The depth of the sorrow of the characters and pain in this book amazes me. I can barely believe that this was publised in 1847, it does not startle me at all to learn that it did not do well at first.As you read this book you feel as if every decent thing is being obliviated and sucked off the face of the earth and you're left only with cruelty, pain and a longing for revenge.This is by no means a light read. It is incredibly depressing and I'm in awe of the complete horror of it at the same time.There is no other rbook like it, however, I doubt that reading it has made anyone's existance a happier one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A wonderful example of how a book should be written!Enough tantalising family scandals and shocking behaviour,and this book was written in the 1850's!!!

He soon causes unrest and despair within the sibling ranks.With the demise of the owner of Wuthering Heights he is suddenly treated as an outcast.As neighbours of The Earnshaws the Linton family could never have foretold the upcoming events surrounding their children and those at Wuthering Heights.After you finish this scandulous book ( definitely for the 1850's ) there still will remain many questions unanswered eg. who is Heathcliff really ???"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is no need to comment on the contents of this volume, since it coincides page for page with the Penguin Classics current \\"black\\" edition of Wuthering Heighs (Pauline Nestor with Lucasta Miller), a really excellent edition (I omit some little misgivings).What is NEW (and almost unseen on the Anglo-American market) is to have an authoritative and scholarly edition in a really nice hardcover (cloth), WITH ALL ITS INTRODUCTIONS AND NOTES, in good and probably lasting white paper, with even a blue ribbon-marker. A delight to the eyes and hands!Let's face it: Clarendon edition wasn't nice-looking, with a price tag of one third of the US Gross National Product. The Franklin Mint Editions (say the 1979 one) is a very fine item, but it has no introduction and the only notes are the well-done glossings of the dialect tirades. Barnes&Noble; hardcover comes near to parfection at a slightly more popular level, but their text is 1900 Haworth Edition, with its uncredible paragraphing and quaint distorted dialect, with some C.K. Shorter idiosyncracies for good measure.SO, LONG LIVE THE PENGUIN CLASSICS HARDCOVER EDITIONS, AND LET'S SEE IF OXFORD FOLLOWS SUIT (I fear not). By the way, a good signature-sewn paperback with flaps and good, durable paper would do almost as well, but there is almost none in the Anglo-American market."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is truly the definitive \\"epic\\" novel. The animated, wild mental scenery, the perplex love/hate relationships, and the extended tale of two generations. Its story is so dramatic and wrenching it almost borders a soap opera, but luckily Emily Bronte's writing skills and character dynamics protect it from ever being comparable. IThe plot revolves around a possessive, yet unconsummated relationship between the two main characters, a gypsy boy named Heathcliff and the daughter of a respected family, Catherine Earnshaw, and branches off into the consequences of a love too wild and profound to be controlled. A love triangle ensues involving a wealthy neighbor who wishes for Catherine's love and her hand in marriage as opposed to Heathcliff's instability. Her choice influences all the events to come and lives are ruined in the midst of the storm created by a passion too deep to renounce. With its dark themes and violent characters it is considered by many to be the original Gothic Romance novel.Upon its first publishing, the story was considered too harsh and the characters vile, and was rejected by many readers in the early 19th Century. Emily Bronte, having been born and raised amongst the moors and the people bred of it knew no other way of life at the age of seventeen when she wrote this novel.Ultimately, it is the wild and uncontrollable nature that makes the novel so affecting and believable, capturing your heart and your emotions. It drives you into feeling what the characters experience with it's descriptive writing and you then know what is the essence of the story. The book is a work of art made from minimal environmental resources, with the mind and the soul sculpting it into a true representation of love's ability to conquer hate."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece, and I feel confident in saying that it is the best book I have ever read. I'm stunned that the average rateing is not five stars. This book is an amazing work. It was written by a woman who never married and yet her description of the vivid passion that exists between the hero and heroine in this book is so passionate and moving that you almost feel as though you can't understand the raw, almost jealous need they have for one another. It reverts to basic animal instinct. She creates characters that you love one momment and hate the next. These are real humans, not representations. They are flawed in every way that they should be and yet they are the ones you sympathize with. They truly are three dimensional, with all the motivations of love, greed, lust, jealousy, and anger that every human being must deal with. If the characters are not enough to convince you of this novel's superiority, all you have to do is look at the actual construction of it. It's like an onion, starting with Mr. Lockewood as the narrator, then Nellie, and eventually even Heathcliff and Cathy speaking to one another in the white hot core, the climax of the story. The two love triangles, emulating each other through generations, the first a tragedy, and the second resolving the fault of the parents with true love succeeding. It is absolutly fascinating how intricatly and beautifully the story is constructed to tell every aspect of the characters. This novel is so moving. It faces every aspect of ourselves as human beings, at the best and the worst of our capabilitys. It may have been written long ago, but it still holds true to problems we face every day. What emotions do we allow to motivate our deeds? That is the real question that this book asks. The images, and the lasting feelings continue long after you have finished the final haunting paragraph. That is why this is the best book I have ever read. If you think I'm simply babbling, all I have to say is read the book yourself. It will be like nothing you have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Often held up as the standard of the classic gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is, for the most part, a showcase of emotional savagery and a dismal portrayal of the human heart. Not well received when first published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, Emily Bronte went to her grave believing that her one and only novel was a complete failure. A subsequent edition, edited by sister Charlotte, was released after Emily's death and became a worldwide success.Everyone has heard the name Heathcliff, and that must be due to his being surely one of the vilest, most hateful literary characters to ever exist on a page. An unidentified foundling who is brought to the Earnshaw home as a young boy, Heathcliff is forever painfully aware of his lack of identity and culture and lashes out at everyone with whom he comes into contact. For awhile, his dearest childhood ally, Catherine, is his one sanctuary, but in time he begins to hate her almost as much as he loves her. From that hatred is born several generations of misery and pain, as Heathcliff devotes his entire existence to ruining Catherine, her family, and everything she ever held dear, and no one is immune from Heathcliff's wrath - not even his own children.Most of the story is told as a look-back by aging housekeeper Nelly Dean as she relates the whole sordid tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who comes to Wuthering Heights to rent for a short time and becomes curious about his angry, tormented landlord. The past soon fuses into the present, as Heathcliff's revenge continues to plague both his and Catherine's hapless descendants.As dark and depressing a story as it appears on the surface, Bronte's unfettered examination of the twin emotions of intense love and equally intense hatred is powerful, and stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. It's nothing if not a poignant and eerie lesson in the damage one person's tortured soul can wreak on everyone around him. I found myself much more affected by it than I thought I would be. Recommended for any fan of classic literature, particularly the gothic era of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love sometimes encompasses the dark component of obesession and this obsession is beautifully and hauntingly explored in Wuthering Heights, perhaps the most intensely original novel to emerge from 19th century England. This is the story of the passionate love between the wild Heathcliff and the reckless Catherine Earnshaw, both inhabitants of the Yorkshire moors. So passionate, in fact, are Catherine and Heathcliff that their love is doomed to tragedy rather than to fulfillment. When that does, indeed happen, Heathcliff, one of the most original and fascinating characters I have ever encountered, spirals ever downward into a morass of self-destruction and obsession. The symbolism in this novel is rich and complex and not so easily recognizable as one might first suppose. The presentation of the duality of human and non-human existence are deftly explored. Catherine and Heathcliff are violent figures striving in vain to identify themselves as ordinary human beings while disrupting all around them with the voraciousness of their appetites. Both ultimately disintegrate from within due to the passion out of which they are made. These two wildly intense characters stand out all the more sharply when contrasted with the simple ordinariness of Nelly Dean and Lockwood. The novel's central question, of course, concerns the meaning of Heathhcliff, who is both diabolical and yet, at the same time, irresistible. The power of the novel, does not, however, reside solely in the interpretaion of its theme. The setting, the relentless elements of the fire, wind and water of the moors only serves to deeepen and reinforce the intensity of the story. The language, although archaic, is poetic, reflecting Bronte's brooding personal vision. Extraordinary effects have been achieved with a remarkable power of formal organization and a brilliant handling of the time scheme. While encompassing the most domestic of scenes, this novel still achieves the depth of an ancient tragedy. Unforgettably haunting and beautiful in every way."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having read a number of books in my life, I must say I was not convinced this was one I could enjoy when it popped up on my mandatory reading list for my first year in university.How wrong one can be.Ever since Catherine visited MR Lockwood on that stormy night at the Heights, I have been completely spellbound by this novel. I have tried to rationalize my affection and utter amazment over this book, but I have so far not succeeded. To give a reweiv with any kind of substance when it comes to the theme of this book would be pointless. After having read the book over and over again,and having watched the movies made about it, I still cannot tell you what this novel is really all about. Don\`t get me wrong, the plot is easy enough to follow, but the underlying drama is something that keeps haunting me. Maybe that was what Emily Bronte wanted. For the reader to put down the book and forever be spellbound by what he or she had read. I know I am.Maybe, in our sedated worlds, we long for this kind of emotion, this kind of passion. Not just in our love lives, but in our lives in general. The story touches timeless subjects, it erases the line between heaven, hell and the world we know. It might even suggest that heaven and hell are right here on earth among us all.It is utterly compelling and I would recomend it to anybody. Give it a couple of chapters before you judge it, and I asure you it will be the reading experince of a lifetime.This publishment is even more rewarding because you can read the different analysis of the book in the Critical Edition part of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read what the self-proclaimed &quot;immature&quot; reader wrote, and I beg to differ. I love this book not because I'm supposed to, but because I just do. The austerity of the language, which you term &quot;dull&quot;, is what sets the whole tone for such a troubling work. I doubt that Bronte set out to write a classic romance; I believe she was denouncing the sins of her characters. This novel is multi-faceted with its never-ending parallels: two houses (Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange), two love stories, two heroes, two heroines, two narrators, etc. The inexplicable love that two heartless people like Heathcliff and Catherine share is fascinating to say the least. When Catherine cries out, &quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff,&quot; I'm sure many a girl's heart has thudded in her chest. This book sweeps you away to a place and time far removed from us and gives us a view into a harsh and distant world. You don't have to like the book. But don't be so dumb or immature as to assume that no else does either. The longer you study literature, the more you'll see that some books have passed the test of time, because, well, they're just that damn good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up a copy of Emily Bront's classic after being very much impressed with her sister Charlotte Bront's novel Jane Eyre. However, while I did find much to be meritted in Wuthering Heights, I also feel that it fell short of my hopes. The story initially focuses on the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff, childhood sweethearts forced apart by their families. Catherine marries another man, vainly thinking she can love and be loved by both Heathcliff and her husband Edgar at the same time. As an act of revenge, Heathcliff married Edgar's sister Isabella. What ensues is a dark and stormy emotional battle between many very troubled people.Catherine dies halfway through the novel, starving herself to insanity and death when she realizes that the two men in her life will not share her and instead demand that she make a choice. She leaves behind her a daughter of the same name, young Catherine. Heathcliff and Isabella in turn produce a son, the weak and sickly Linton. The remainder of the novel concerns the love affair that develops between Linton and young Catherine, and Heathcliff's violent, vengeful manipulation of their lives.I thought the book was very well written (as it ought to be, to have achieved a rank among classic literature), and I was able to read it with no trouble. Some of the words and terms are a bit antiquated, but someone familiar with works of the time should not find these too daunting. Though keeping a dictionary close at hand is a surefire way to avoid trouble. Bront has excellent word choice and creates very vivid imagery. My one criticism of the writing itself regards the manner in which Bront has chosen to express dialects. The Yorkshire accent of Heathcliff's servant Joseph (and later of young Catherine's cousin Hareton) is nearly impossible to read, with phrases like \\"ut's soa up uh going\\" intended to mean \\"who is set on going\\". My copy of the book has an appendix that \\"translates\\" the most incomprehensible of his words, but it is a great irritation to constantly flip to the back (sometimes several times per paragraph) for explanation, and even the notes there do not decipher everything.The found the story itself to be profoundly disturbing. Wuthering Heights undoubtedly contains one of the largest collections of mentally unbalanced characters I've ever come across in any novel. It is choc full of sadists, masochists, and otherwise troubled and violent personalities. The whole book has a very dark, opressive feel about it, and there were times I found it downright unsettling. I must tip my figurative hat to Bront for her skill in creating atmosphere and invoking feeling in her readers.However, the storyline is a bit weak in my estimation, as the characters' feelings about and behavior toward each other is often quite illogical. The different culture of the time can explain some of this, but there remains, I believe, a general unrealistic quality about the plot. Why, for instance, would Catherine and Heathcliff have ever fallen in love in the first place? Their childhood attraction is easy to explain as the passing fancies of the very young, but their relationship as adults is more troubling. Heathcliff is moody, egocentric, obsessive, and extremely violent; Catherine is vain and naive, narcissistic, and given to wild emotional tantrums when she does not get her way. What would posses anyone to fall for either of the two? Even harder to understand is the timid Edgar's proposal to Catherine. She abuses him repeatedly, mentally and physically, and yet he claims to love her. Why?The next generation of characters is equally unbalanced and ill-matched. I think young Catherine is probably the only main character with some claim on a sound mind, though even she is not without issues. Though she is intelligent and generally strong-minded, she is for some reason a complete pushover when it comes to the frail, sniveling Linton's outbursts of self-pity. Even when Catherine herself recognizes Linton's problems and appears to have lost her romantic interest in him, she still obeys his every whining command when there is no incentive whatsoever for her to do so. Heathcliff is even more violent in the second part of the novel than the first. He physically abuses nearly all who cross his path, including his own son, taking his only pleasure from the misery of others. Another relationship that raises questions in my mind is Catherine's attraction to young Hareton following Linton's death. Catherine has been brought up as a proper young lady with manners and education, and Hareton is a slovenly, shadowy figure whose speech is as difficult to comprehend as the servant Joseph's. The two young people seem to have absolutely nothing in common.On the whole, I recognize the literary merits of Wuthering Heights - as I said it is very well written and invokes strong reactions in the reader. The character development is excellent, even if those characters are mentally and emotionally unbalanced in the extreme. The book explores the themes of love, jealousy, and obsession, and provokes thought. However, it is by no means a feel-good book and I can't say I'd recommend it for recreational reading. This one is probably best left in the academic discussion circles and not brought home to read before bedtime."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all of the audio books of Wuthering Heights, this is my favorite. Janet McTeer brings the characters of Cathy and Heathcliff to life and fully captures the wild passion and pain of the novel. The Patricia Routledge audio play is quite good, as well, but if you are looking for a reading of the complete text of the novel, this is by far the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved this book and I could read it over and over"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights doesn't have the creativity or vividness as that can be found in Jane Eyre. With just a bit more passion, or shall I say obsession, this book will touch the hearts of teenage females more than Jane Eyre. This book was rather a bit too sappy and it felt like you just HAD to give the characters some sympathy. For poker-faced die hard pessimistic readers, this isn't one you'll want to try."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am in the middle of the book right now, so far it has been boring but some parts were interesting. There was confusion with the part of the narrator though. It was not constant and the language used is also confusing. Overall, it could of of been better(on the other hand, the description of certain things were fantastic)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've recently had to read this book for AP Lit, like many of the other reviewers, and I don't see how this is a classic in any regard. Sure it is written in a lovely matter, but there are 15000 people with various English majors who can write beautifully as well. It's hailed as a love story, but at the core of it there isn't any love at all. Just an assortment of angry childish people all who are developed as a still birthed child.Heathcliff and (old) Catherine love each other. But WHY, they love each other is never granted in any regard. They are in love simply for the sake of having a story a write about. That's it. Then the characters themselves aren't just underdeveloped, but they're TERRIBLE people to add on top of that. I am not one of those people who feels the need to love each and every single character, or any of them actually, but this must at least backed up with something to frame the character.Heathcliff is a horrible person simply because, based on what was given of his character in the book, he was abused. Now this aspect of course warrants some sympathy for him. And even though he is vengeful while he is a child, this is completely understandable given how he is treated. However, as a man he does not grow at all. He degenerates to a sadist simply because he didn't get what he wants, why he wants Catherine is anybody's guest.I'll just stop here because I honestly can't go on. The book is far too terrible for me to even go through breaking down each miserable character paragraph by paragraph. To put this book simply; it's basically like an emo's version of a Tyler Perry story. The conflicts exist simply because the characters will it to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a terrible cut up version of the original which had little of the beauty of the real story. It was not worth the paper it was written on."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews below and many have said that this is a love story. If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I realize many would contest my opinion in this feverently, and I've argued first hand with many a Wuthering Heights fan, but I have to say with all honesty, this is the worst book I have ever read.The dryness of the plot is second only to the dryness of Emily Bronte's style. For a story attempting to establish themes of love and hatred, passion and apathy, the book is sure dull as hell.I simply can't see any saving quality in this book whatsoever, save the fact that nothing at all happens so you can skim through it without missing a single element of the non-existant plot. The climax of all action within the book is a scene one third of the way in the book where young Heathcliff hurls applesauce at his effeminate and whiny rival, and it just goes even further downhill from there.It is very obvious in her writing that Emily Bronte has never left her home, as her characters are all pallid one-dimensional reflections of her own disgusting parasitic victorian life. Never in a book, even with the most despisable of villans, have I let out such a cheer as a character died, because with the dying of each character in Wuthering Heights there is a feeling of, &quot;FINALLY.&quot; Every character is dying from page 1, in one way or another, and Wuthering Heights is the &quot;journey&quot; of seeing them to their graves, and breathing a sigh of relief, interlaced with mindless whining from one character or another about how the tea and scones are too cold today.If the use of the adjective &quot;Wuthering&quot; is not a warning enough, then read the first five pages. THe only thing I can thank Emily Bronte for is the knowledge that I'll never face pain as great as she has given me in trying to force my way through her book, and I am probably now able to withstand any sort of torture or physical torment by looking back and rememebering, &quot;It could be worse... I could have to listen to Joseph speak again, or Catherine whine.&quot;I realize there's going to be multiple posts debating this, in an &quot;Emperor's New Clothing&quot; sort of fashion of only those who are smart can see the meaning in this book, but the only meaning this book has is what literary critics and English Professors try to stuff it with, no different than the stuffing forcefully injected into a long-dead thanksgiving bird. For a moment, put away your pride, cast down your defensiveness at the view that you're supposed to enjoy this book, and ask yourself: Is there really anything of value in this entire novel? The critical mind will find the answer. The coward will continue to uphold the sanctity of victorian cow-dung. Enjoy your reading :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gah! This book is the most horrible thing I've read! Heathcliff is a horrible character! I didn't know I was ever suppose to root for him. He borders on crazy and even crazier. No one should be forced to read this dren. I'd rather be waterboardered than read this again...at least the psychological scars of waterboarding wouldn't last as long!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Being a pretty avid reader, I thought my classic repertoire should include Wuthering Heights. I had to basically force myself to read to the end. I have no problem with despicable, morally corrupt characters. The Fountainhead is one of my favorite novels. The problem is that the treatment of them by Bronte just lacks depth. I found the book to be tediously slow, dry, and repetitive. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I really hated this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Everytime I read this novel I find something different; makes me feel something different. I read it every winter and enjoy it everytime."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"So honestly I hated this book...well the characters anyway. I swear I was so angry at Heathcliff I couldn't even fall asleep. I cannot believe how cruel he was. Actually, everyone was cruel and self-serving in their own way. Plus this isn't a love story at all, it's an obession!!! Anyway, I didn't want to finish the book, which of course is NOT possible. I'm glad I read it. I'm glad it's in my library. And I'm glad Heathcliff is dead.BUT yes there is a but, I read some wise words not too long ago and I thought I would share them. In not so many words it goes like this...If a book ever impacts you in any way, whether it be positive or negative, then it can be considered a great book.Hmmmmmmm...interesting. It's true, this is actually a great book. Not inspiring, but definitely thought provoking and apparently for me emotion provoking."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend buying this book because not only is it a literary genius, but it also had notations on the back that helped you understand why a certain word was used or what a word means. I thought the actual book itself had good binding and it was a sturdy paperback. Although I do have to say that if you have never read this book and you don't want to be spoiled, do not read the introduction that is in the beginning of the book. Overall, I recommend the Oxford Edition of Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wurthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a great book. It is set ing the moors of old England. Cathy and Heathcliff are two lovers, but when Cathy marries Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton, he vows revenge on both of them. The protagonist of the book is without a doubt, the narrator of the story, Nelly Dean. The antagonist is the vial, Heathcliff. She write the characters with such description, it is like they are right in the room with you. The plot is so well writing, it keeps you guessing at every turn.This book is written in the perspective of Nelly (Ellen) Dean. She is the care taker to Cathy through out the book, and one of Heathcliff's close friends. The theme has many interpretation, but I think the most noticeable is of the jealousy Heathcliff feels towards Edgar. It warns you of the dangers of jealousy and that i can drive anyone to the very brink of insanity. This book was one of the most intriguing, well written, passion filled, exciting, living you on the edge of your seat wanting more, creative books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I would recommend this book to everyone, 5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first read Wuthering Heights, I was completely absorbed into the phantasmic world. While I have read gothic works like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein,\\" Wuthering Heights tramples them with it's intense passion of the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine. Not everyone's going to love this book, most, if not all the characters, are amoral and cruel people isolated from society. Heathcliff is the classic Byronic Hero; brooding, passionate and driven by vengeance, definitley better than today's wannabe gothic characters(cough...Edward Cullen). Other than that it is poetically written, an open field of meadows and lonely households, snowy storms, etc. If gothic stories are your thing, then pick this up, be warned that despite being hyped as the archetypal story of forbidden romance, that is only half the tale which is filled with bitter revenge; buy this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"haven't read it yet , its in good shape and it came in a timely fasion! thanx."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Depressing, obsessive, tormenting and heartwrenching.

Heathcliff is unforgettable. It's as if part of me is on the moors with Heathcliff and Catherine. There is something so haunting about their childhood romance that never went the way it should have. In fact, I think that this is one of the books that influenced me to write about children. It has a certain Edgar Allen Poe feel to it. It kind of reminds me of Annabelle Lee. The ghostly images of the loss of love by the sea. And I can always imagine the two of them, Heathcliff and Catherine, playing as children, pretending the moors were castles."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Overall a good story, although sometimes it is hard to follow because it was written over 200 years ago and is definitely written in old English.

Should not have taken that long."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The REAL Housewives of Victorian EnglandMr. Lockwood comes to Wuthering Heights in order to rent Thrushcross Grange. He gets stuck there, with Mr. Heathcliff, a rude gentleman, a young woman, and several other strange people. While there, he stumbles upon the diaries of Catherine Earnshaw. After a strange dream, he runs back to town, where Ellen Dean \\"Nelly\\" tells him the story of Wuthering Heights.I'm sure most of you are familiar with a TV phenomenon called \\"reality TV shows\\", particularly ones like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and \\"The Real Housewives of OC/Atlanta/wherever\\". I think it would be a compliment to say these shows cater to the lowest common denominator. They are primarily packed with drunken escapades, unbridled fights, and lots and lots of sex. And you know what? People like these things because of the sheer stupidity. Hell, I'll admit to watching a few episodes of Jersey Shore, and not just because it was the only thing on my hotel TV (although the latter is true too).I've heard copious things about \\"Wuthering Heights\\": it is a classic, it is a love story, it is wonderful literature, it has great imagery/themes. They may be true, but for me, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a freakin' riot book--the Victorian equivalent of the reality TV shows we enjoy today.The characters are vicious, back-biting dogs, continuously making life miserable for each other just for the hell of it. Catherine marries a man she sorta loves just for the title; Heathcliff has an insatiable thirst for revenge; Hindley is weak; Hareton is an evil child; Cathy a ditz; Linton a wuss; Edgar powerless; and Nelly a meddle-some gossip. Probably about the only character not painted in such a poor limelight is our narrator, Mr. Lockwood, who is boring beyond belief. Lock these characters up in a room, and expect them to rail and complain and slap the hell out of each other within moments. They are all sadists and masochists, and I'm not just talking about the obvious Heathcliff. They would make PERFECT fodder for a low-brow reality TV series--I can just see Isabella (post-marriage) b!tch-slapping Heathcliff, Heathcliff and Edgar tearing off each other's shirts and brawling on the living room floor, and Linton and Cathy slipping off to nail each other in one of their rooms.For those that say this is a great love story: Huh? I mean, I get that Heathcliff and Catherine \\"love\\" each other, but it almost feels like more \\"obsessively lusting\\". As for Isbella loving Heathcliff, he doesn't turn around, love her and marry her; instead, she lives in abuse until she finally grows a pair and runs off. Linton and Cathy are constantly being thwarted in their relationship, and it is Heathcliff who forces them to marry. And on...and on... It's more of a \\"How NOT to Love\\" story than a pure romantic love story, like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". NOTE: If you love A so much, marry A. Do NOT marry B and then excuse it by saying you \\"love\\" A so much that you want to *fill*in*the*blank* for A.Also, I found myself wondering several times: how much of this story is Nelly warping? Is she purposefully making these people look bad (even her own mistress, Catherine, she insults regularly)? What parts did she not hear? How would things have been different had she kept her big nose out of the drama?All the complaints I've read are 100% true. The characters are vile and overdramatic; their actions are drastically mean and seem bent for the sole purpose of causing more drama; the framing device threatens to fall apart (particularly when Cathy is narrating through Nelly who is narrating through Mr. Lockwood--can't tell you how many times I forgot who the \\"I\\" was).All the compliments I've read are also 100% true. The writing is very well-done, the story is interesting, the characters are different and not stereotypical, the outcome isn't predictable, and the imagery is vivid and dark.In short: No wonder this was such a controversial book when it first came out!I think this book is definitely more interesting in audiobook format, because the author can differentiate voices, give inflections, and bring to life the arguments and vicious remarks that fly back and forth. Maybe I'm a sadist or masochist like the cast, but I rather enjoyed being a fly on the wall, listening to Nelly's gossip about these sad people and their self-induced miserable lives. It's not a book for everyone, but it's definitely one of a kind.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a great classic read. It is a dark book with a good ending. If you look at the background of each character, you'll understand how they have come to act the way they do in the book. Maybe to the extreme in their actions and hatred, but you can see cause and effect to the situations that occur. Also, if you read about Bronte, you can see why the book is so dark. She had not such a happy life. I wish Bronte would have written more books. Again, a great book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After spending an interesting night at Wuthering Heights in the company of a group of people that seem an abnormally miserable, vile bunch, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, asks his housekeeper to divulge their history. She does this gladly, and so we get the tragic story of Heathcliff and Catherine.I often find the classics to be tedious and boring. Wuthering Heights is neither and I found that to be a nice surprise. From the beginning, the book oozes drama and it stays that way until the very end. For some reason, I've been under the impression that this is a love story. I guess in a dark, twisted way it is, but it focuses more on cruelty and revenge. None of the characters are very likeable. As a matter of fact, a majority of them are quite appalling. Instead of this making me dislike the book, I think it made me like it more. Strange, I know, but it did. Wuthering Heights kept me captivated and has earned it's spot as one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a wonderful classic -- so much going on in the novel on every page that it is a pleasure to read and experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though the performances are very good, I am very frustrated with this purchase, as Amazon describes this set as unabridged. It is, in fact, substantially abridged, so buyer beware."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Wuthering Heights first came out, readers were shocked by the violence and the passion of its story, that is the strange romance between the mysterious Heathcliff and Catherine Earnchaw, the daughter of Mr. Earnshaw who adopted Heathcliff. The scandal was so much that Emily Bronte, when she died, thought that her book was a failure. Fortunately for her, and for its first readers, the story's reputation grew among literary circles, became an important reading for people like Virginia Wolf, and even became a movie in 1939, starring the great Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. As such, the book's reputation has now become an important piece of art around the world, influencing important artists in their works (ex:Jane Campion's The Piano, J K Rowling's Harry Potter, etc.)Most people tend to focus solely on the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine and they tend to think that the story is simply a love story, which is what they did with the Laurence Olivier movie. However, Wuthering Heights must be considered, at least that's what I think, as a tragedy which shows how a simple act of kindness from a good man brought forth discord, jealousy and a story of revenge whose victims, the Earnshaw and the Linton families, soon suffer the wrath of someone who never received the most decent sense of love. Not only that, Wuthering Heights shows how certain families, in distant regions positioned far from big cities, act between themselves as they bring upon each other their own laws. Having had grandparents who lived in regions resembling as much as the moors surrounding Wuthering Heights, I wasn't that much surprised by the cruelty that some of the Earnshaw and the Linton brought forth on Heathcliff.So for me, that book, was a pleasure to read again and again.One thing that surprised me with this book is how Emily Bronte managed to transcript the dialects of the countrymen of that region. Indeed, certain character's dialects are written according to how the characters pronounce them. Though reading it straight on for the first time, might be difficult, I suggest to those that may be rebuked by this type of dialogue transcription to read the dialogs aloud. To me it felt much more easier to understand certain conversations and have more pleasure reading that book.As such, I recommend this book to everyone who would be interested to read a great piece of literature or to discover the original material that brought forth the movie adaptations that they love to watch and rewatch."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit that I went into this book completely unprepared for what hit me. I was expecting something vaguely along the lines of Jane Austen, but darker; I didn't realize just how far into the depths of sadness it would go, and it was incredible.Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff, a child brought into the respectable Earnshaw family. He and Catherine, the daughter of the Earnshaw patriarch, form an immediate, permanent bond, one that will bring years of sadness into their lives when Catherine decides that she cannot abandon her station for Heathcliff, instead choosing to marry Edgar Linton, a privileged child from the neighboring Thrushcross Grange.The interesting thing is that this basic love story, for which the novel is best-known, is only the first half of the book. The second half follows the ramifications for all of the characters, as Heathcliff's cruelty reaches a fever pitch and he destroys everything with any connection to Catherine. This part, for me, was the real meat of the story. It's incredibly dark and occasionally terrifying, written in excruciating detail... but also full of a savage beauty. Heathcliff's chasing after a ghost will simultaneously make you cringe and break your heart, and that is the ultimate measure of success; Bronte created a character that manages to be sympathetic, even when you wish for nothing more but his death.It is not without flaws (I found Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship underdeveloped) but the sheer force of the story is almost dizzying, heightened by the interesting (if occasionally limiting) structure, and I would easily recommend Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with most people interested in classic literature, I had known of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for years and years, but for some reason, I had never made the effort to read it. That situation has been corrected; What can I possibly add to the critical reviews of this great work of literature? This is an amazing novel, with characters that manage to live and breathe. Not many writers can paint characters with this same level of depth. Some you will love, and others you will love to hate. While the book is not what I would label \\"an easy read,\\" it is quite readable considering when it was written. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. I would have loved to have read this book with a club, so that I may have had an opportunity to discuss the many themes it involves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a timeless classic.

The story crashes along with melodrama and emotional episodes galore; and when you set all that against the impossibly lonely and picturesque backdrop of the English moors, it's enough to snare any romantic heart. I won't give you the particulars of the plot... it is at its core a love story, but also a great deal more complicated than that. The relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is all at once pure, spiritual, sexy, intensely stormy and destructive, in a way I've never seen done before in fiction.This is one novel that I feel like I could read over and over, submerge myself in the minds of each of the characters multiple times, and still not plumb the depth of its meaning. The writing is gorgeous, of course, with complexly-constructed but damn near-perfect sentences. This is an emotional, overwhelming, entirely un-sedate book -- a remarkable thing to emerge from Victorian times, from the impenetrable mind of a reclusive female poet. We'll never know what Emily Bronte was truly like, but she was clearly an incredible artist who deserved vastly more recognition than she ever got in her lifetime. The words positively thrum with passion. Truly incredible."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I received the incorrect copy. The image presented is not what I received.

And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \\"got going\\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too.

Heatcliffe is vindictive and cruel and Catherine is a weak and cruel character herself. Not only that, they're both selfish and angry narrowminded. It's difficult to not be moved.And being moved is what this story does to you. If you cannot separate yourself from the Characters, and see the book just as a book, you're going to hate it. You WILL hate the characters and wish they would all just burn in methaphorical hell...But if you do manage to just enjoy the story as a story, which is difficult, then it's a thrilling book with many interesting characters, who submit themselves and each other to odd desputes and whatnot due to their odd character traits. Forgiveness is not really a word in this book and most of the story is about the frustrations from their social places.You might even enjoy the... erm... the social... Oh whatever. It's difficult to separate your feelings from what you're reading. And you keep wondering why they're so stupid and cruel.I aged 10 yrs from reading this books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As CD production and quality was very good, good quality, pleasant reader.But the book it self I did not like.

Think I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what really needs to be said about Emily Bronte's 1847 novel, the brilliantly plotted, superbly structured, & extremely engrossing WUTHERING HEIGHTS, 'cept maybe, \\"if you haven't read it, you really ought to becuz you're in for an amazing treat\\". Quite frankly, I'm jealous of the \\"uninitiated\\" who are about to embark on such a fantastic \\"journey\\", given the great road that lies ahead.For the sake of prospective first time readers who need a bit more info to tempt them into taking the plunge, I'll just say that THIS is the book that made famous the idea of rambling about on a moor with someone whom you fancied. Need more? Well, the protagonist is named Heathcliff (you've probably heard that named tossed about somewhere) and it is he who dominates both halves of this two generational story. Still not enuf? Okay; while it has been viewed by many as a great love story, WH is actually - in the words of Bronte biographer Lucasta Miller - \\"more Romantic (as in the literary style) than romantic\\". Furthermore, while new readers may have already experienced - perhaps, in reading other novels and certainly in watching tv shows and movies - the particular \\"twist\\" on the traditional method of narration that Bronte employs, it must be noted that SHE was the FIRST great writer to use it and, all these decades later, WUTHERING is still unsurpassed in its use. That's about all I dare say so as not to spoil it for new readers.In any event, the primary reason that I am writing this review is to note on the wonderful - albeit relatively short - introduction that is included in this Penguin Classics edition, one that was written by Monash University (in Melbourne) prof Pauline Nestor. If you're like me and enjoy reading intros and other critical pieces about this impressionistic romance AND don't like \\"spoilers\\", I will, as in the case of the novel, keep my comments about the content (of the intro) to a minimum. Indeed, it will be enuf to say that those WUTHERING fans who are tired of seeing Marxist, feminist, revisionist, or any other \\"ist\\"-type reading on this novel will be delighted by Nestor's take on this masterpiece, one that largely focuses on its \\"transgressive power\\". She also briefly critiques many of the various \\"popular\\" interpretations of WH that have been embraced over the years.So, while first time readers will delight in this novel's power - in regard to both its craftsmanship and its ability to rouse the emotions - those who have already read it will enjoy the intro's study as to WHY it has such power, including the power to maintain such a hold over those who have experienced it.Also, like other Penguin Classics editions, this one is annotated, which is particularly helpful in the case of WUTHERING HEIGHTS becuz, as newcomers will quickly discover, the Yorkshire dialect of a certain character is - to put it mildly - difficult for most modern readers to understand.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I read this book, I was 11. It was fairly interesting but I didn't give it any second thoughts. Five years later, I pick it up again and finish it in a day. I am so in love with this book. I keep rereading it over and over again and each time it only gets better. Wuthering Heghts is one of those books that you wish you could read for the first time again. I truly recommend it.

Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.Boy, was I wrong.Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost likeHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1),A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read this several times. It is a good read, but it's more of a story about how NOT to treat people. It at least makes you appreciate your own life after reading it, but it is very depressing. It all ends well with the characters, but not one of my favorite classic novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel was completely different from what I expected. The characters took me by surprise and despite their rotten personalities I couldn't help but love them and wish their sorrow to end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Wuthering Heights was originally published in 1847, it was not well received. The depictions of passionate love affairs on the moors, cruelty and hatred were considered to vulgar and too shocking for audiences of the day. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature and one of the best novels by a woman writer of the nineteenth century.There is something outright haunting about the characters of Wuthering Heights. They complement the eerie moor setting entirely. None of the characters is likable really, but there is something about them that hypnotizes the reader. Heathcliff's passionate love, rage, hatred and unbelievable cruelty, Catherine's puerile and fickle nature just to name a few.Wuthering Heights is not a happy love story by any stretch of the imagination. It is dark, yet passionate. It explores both sides of human nature. The characters can love passionately, then hate completely and cruelly.It is a bit difficult to get into. The opening chapters are very dark and Bront takes a while to set up the characters, especially with the frame story involving Mr. Lockwood, but if the reader sticks with it, the characters are great, the plot is twisted and the raw emotional language Bront uses are worth waiting for.See more of my reviews @ [...]Bottom Line: Wuthering Heights is a must read for English literature lovers and dark romance lovers alike. It's complex, passionate characters are awful but hypnotizing.View all my reviews"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is timeless, with something for everyone! Romance, human nature, man's greed and cruelty, and, of course, it's a great ghost story!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know many people love this book, but I've read it 3 times, and I just can't appreciate it. While I have no complaint with the technical aspects of it (writing style, grammar, etc.), the story drives me a little bit crazy and makes me depressed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this book only 3 stars because I didn't consider it enjoyable reading. I'm sure some will glean much from the writing style of the author. It might be of interest to some to make a study of the different characters and try to figure out what made them as they were. With that said, most likely, to most everyone else this book would be rated with at least 4 stars. For myself, I was really glad to finish it and move on."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Just goes to show that love stories with odd twist span the ages. Is a great story if you like stories with depth."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'A masterpiece' probably sounds like a clich&eacute; for this novel, but that is exactly what it is. From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial. I have a unique image of how I see the story and characters, and that's how it's going to stay.Simply put, everyone should give this book a try, even if they don't like classic novels. It has a thrilling plot, remarkable characters and beautiful language. Condemed when it was first published in 1847, 'Wuthering Heights' stands out today as one of the greatest novels in the English language.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before.

This brilliant reflection rises the sinister curtain about a great land which still keeps its ancestral fears and mythical mysterious . Vasconcelos named Latin America as the cosmic land .What is there behind the coup d'etat which in the last decades have modified the policy face of almost all the latin American countries?The author is Chief Director of the History Department of New York University .He explores meticulously the Cuban case , the Dominican concerns , the terrorism in Venezuela , the social movements in Brasil and the guerrilla in Colombia and Peru .The highlight chapters are those which focus the political and social causes of the military attitude with meridian clarity in Argentina where the analysis of that nation after Peron fall is overwhelming .This pendulum movement between the conservadurism and the modernism with all the derivated consequences of uncertainness before a non illustrated mass make the military dynasty set a foot simultaneously on the accelerator and another on the brake , inmovilizing in this way the natural curse of the social body .Obviously since this book was written years before the globalization fact this circunstance makes an incomplete analysis about a crude and powerful reality which gravites on Latin America as Damocles sword .Since you must face the Third Wave age , all the possible efforts the different countries make for get up on this unstopable race still have not understood for the majority of the political dirigents .And since the fact you easily can observe about the existence of many countries which even do not belong to the First Wave &ntilde; others countries are in the Second Wave and the majority are literally swimming between the second and third wave .The deep consequences and the ancient concepts of nationalism and other mythical codes which still prevails in the behavior of many people makes of that issue an endless concern subject .Despite the passed years its vigency still remains ."},{"Title":"Tom Dodge Talks About Texas: Radio Vignettes and Other Observations 1989-1999","review":"My mother gave this book to me for Christmas.

In true Ludlum fashion, though an early book, suspense, conspiracy and desperation are center. I was prompted to re-read this one after I recently read a short story called \\"Betters Inc.\\" that has a lot of the similar ingredients, just more concentrated. Reading an early Ludlum book is like settling back in your slippers, you just got home... A very good read, if a bit dated."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"The book starts out with murder and deception. A TV host of a 60 Minutes type show, is being summoned to Washington under false pretences and convinced by the CIA that his friends are conspiring against the country. The host, John Tanner, invites his friends to his home for the weekend in order for the traitor to reveal themselves so the CIA could capture them.This is a clever, intriguing and fun book which has glimmers of the genius which Robert Ludlum is about to become. The characters come to life, even though not all of them are likeable or pleasant.I've enjoyed this book (not as much as I enjoyed Ludlum's later releases) simply because it intrigued me, the characters were interesting and the plot was fascinating since both the reader and the main character have no idea what's going on.Even though the book might seem thick, as are most of Ludlum's books, it is a quick read and a page turner."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"A classic of the spy novel, the Osterman Weekend grabs you in a slow, gradual, subdued, cleverly constructed way that defines the essence of suspence writing. I launched into Le Carre and all of Ludlum's other books because of this, and spent many wonderful hours submerged in the life of espionage."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"I enjoyed reading it but it lacked oomph at certain parts... Still, I didn't put the book down until I finished it. So, to all Ludlum fans out there...just read it."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"The book starts off as a decent read, not great. The the following flaws are encountered:1. A very DUMB idea for a conspiracy--ooh, Omega might blackmail businessmen around the country and create a depression! Better to try it in 2002, not 1972, heh heh.2. A very STUPID plot, which just isn't believable. EG, if your family were gassed with ether and left in an abandoned railway depot, would you just keep following the advice of this one CIA guy who was your only contact? I think not. And in the end, none of it makes any sense at all.3. Ludlum is no master dialog writer. His adults mumble, grumble, fix each other drinks, smoke cigs, and try to act like good 1970s grownups, but it's just silly, just plain silly.4. Corny, off-key elements that make the book seem even dumber: a dog's head is severed, etc.In short, this book is flat-out FOOLISH. The recommendation must therefore be DO NOT READ.

The Ostermans are from California, and seem to be the glue that holds all of this together. John Tanner, one of the group, is approached by the CIA stating that the Ostermans are really involved in organized crime, as are the other members of the group.The story if full of miscalculations, deception, and cross-betrayals.

The book was not what it was cracked up to be. After reading Ludlum classics such as &quot;Gemini Contenders&quot;,Holcroft Covenant&quot;,and &quot;Scorpio Illusion&quot; this book was a letdown. It had a great conspiracy plot. The action scenes were short of even being exciting. The conspiracy was as weak as water. The couples who were gathered for the weekend were just as boring. The book never got off the ground. The ending of the book was also very dissapointing. A potential good story was never brought up to a good writing. A major dissapointment."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"This was probably a good book in its time, but it's pretty dated.

I started with The Holcroft Covenant, reported to be one of the classics, which I really enjoyed. Then I read the final book he wrote, The Prometheus Deception, which I enjoyed more than most.This year, I decided to go back to his early books. I found the second book he ever wrote, The Osterman Weekend, in a used bookstore. The book tells the story of John Tanner, a TV news executive who is summoned to Washington one day and told by a CIA operative that one or more of his best friends, the Ostermans, the Cardones and the Tremaynes is a traitor. They are all gathering for the weekend at Tanner's house in suburban New Jersey and Tanner's job is to get the traitors to reveal themselves so the CIA can swoop in and deal with them.On its own, the book is probably worth three stars. It is a quick and easy read, the suspense grows and the reader has no idea where the plot will lead although double-crosses seem likely. However, until the last few chapters, it doesn't really grip you.However, the book shows flashes of the greatness Ludlum achieved later. An ordinary person is thrown into extraordinary circumstances and must get by on his own wits. Ludlum is a genius at making the ordinary person seem believable and scared and yet be the hero who saved the world. The action in the last few chapters is a foreshadowing of the wall-to-wall action that will be Ludlum's trademark in other books. The insight this gives the reader into Ludlum's evolution as a writer was worth an extra star to me."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"This is the first Ludlum book I ever read and it still remains my favorite. For sheet storytelling, suspense and convoluted plot resolution, it remains supreme.It is characterization that drives this book - much more so than the movie - and particularly the interplay among the various guests. This is vintage Ludlum before he became Ludzilla, the author of sagas of immeasurable length. This is also the typical formula that Ludlum uses in his best books - a lone guy gets involved in nefarious activities involving the government and both people and events are not what they seem.The moment when he awaits the arrival of the agent, when the agent walks up and we all hold our breath - the revelation is simply stunning! This is a classic."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"Usually, being kept in the dark by a book is a bad thing. This usually results in a muddled, incomprehensible mess. Not in this case. He successfully pulls off the greatest act of intrigue ever, by intentionally leaving the reader as clueless as the main character.The main character is brought to Washington under false pretenses to discover that his weekend party with three other couple may be a meeting of some Omega agents. The only problem is, no one knows who is and who isn't part of Omega. Now the main character has got to lead a double life, protect his family against Omega, figure out who are his true friends, and worry about the CIA protection.While the middle of the book feels kind of jumbled, and beginning of the book is slightly dull, the book is immensely readable and fun. Definitely not an action packed book (not until the end at least), Ludlum instead brings the low-key mundane trivialities of life into a new light. Does a particular sentence reveal something about his or her loyalties, does weary a gaudy piece of jewelry mean your connected with an organization? Finding out the truth behind everything becomes harder and more alluring than ever.All in all, I would recommend this quick page turner."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"A great story which concerns Jack Tanner, a TV journalist who is drawn into a CIA plot to uncover the clandestine Soviet OMEGA group. Only one snag - OMEGA is in his neighbourhood in a small town - and when friend Bernie Osterman brings his family and friends over for a weekend get-together - one of them is the OMEGA plant, but which one? Several unexpected twists and turns along the way which reach fever pitch when Tanner's family become threatened in many ways! And who is the man giving the orders? A classic conspiracy thriller which paved the way for several more that came later, and one could say it inspired the movies ENEMY OF THE STATE and CONSPIRACY THEORY with its the-bad-guys-are-really-the-government ideas! THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND was also made into a movie itself in 1983, which is also well worth tracking down."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"A major step forward from the disaster that was The Scarlatti Inheritance, The Osterman Weekend is a fast-paced tale of intrigue that may surprise even Ludlum fans. Being one of his earliest works, he was still developing his style and finding his niche, and this book clearly shows that.Gone (or, not yet arrived) are the mammoth chase sequences, the far reaching conspiracies (this conspiracy is on a somewhat limited scale), the beautiful but strong-willed women who only want to help their men, but aren't sure if they can trust them. Instead, we have a family man who finds himself threatened no matter which way he turns.Large portions of the book are written with dialogue only. The book is already his shortest, and the combination makes for a very fast read. However, those used to large narrative sequences from Ludlum will feel a bit out of place, and rightfully so: there are many places where a little bit of narration would have come quite in handy.On the whole, though, I recommend it to suspense fans. It is by no means Ludlum's best book, but it is a good book, and well worth the limited time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"This one is pretty impressive! Ludlum scales down his scope and tightens up the suspense! You should not pick up this book if you need sleep. This book is about what is seemingly a normal American family, but Ludlum keeps piling on the twists and tension until you wonder if anyone in the book is who they seem. This is a must read. Read it."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"A refreshing change of Ludlum's thriller, instead of a globe-trotting hero who speed through Europe escaping mysterious gunmen, this time, the action is much confined to the small &eacute;lite township of Saddle Valley, though the catasthrophe still threatens the entire the free-world.A weekend gathering of 4 couples - husbands all successful financially in their careers, hosted by John Tanner has the making of a classical who-dun-it. Beneath the normally jovial relaxing surface are strong undercurrents that each member of the party knows that things are not what they seem - one or more among their number knows a deadly secret and threatens to expose it or utilise it for self-gain. The CIA operation recruited John Tanner to expose Omega, a Soviet mole who holds numerous influential people in the US hostage. Omega has a time-table when he will squeeze these hostages to do as he bid, resulting in financial, social and economic catasthrophe in the Western world.Action is seen much through the eyes of John Tanner, a man trapped by the CIA, who has no choice but to see his family at risk to catch the Omega.But Omega seems to be on the game, leaving a bloody trail of hints and attempts on Tanner's family.The good thing about this novel is you never know where the author will take you next, the twists and turns are more of classical mysteries rather than a thriller.Ludlum did a fair job, but he could have done better if he had concentrated more on the suspense and leaving of clues. Instead, he gave the settings and characters of a mystery, the plot of a &quot;save-the-free-world&quot; thriller, and the between both worlds, he was unable to maintain a proper pace in either."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"A man hosting a weekend long party and getaway for a group of friends gets an unpleasant surprise when he is told that his friends are spies and traitors. He doesn't believe it at first, but the weekend degenerates into a whole pile of problems and nastiness as this CIA prediction unfortunately for him, becomes true."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"The Osterman Weekend doesn't live up to the promise that Ludlum would normally offer for a weekend thriller read. John Tanner's plans for the weekend are disturbed when he is confronted by CIA agent Fassett. Fassett tells Tanner that some of the three couples who are coming over to spend the weekend with the Tanners as long-time friends are actually part of a huge international conspiracy code-named Omega. But Fassett needs Tanner to help uncover which of the couples - the Cordones, the Tremaynes, and the Ostermans - really are part of the Omega conspiracy. So when the friends of the Tanners visit, the weekend is anything but ordinary, as the various couples hold varying suspicions of each other in a rather icy atmosphere. It is only in the last quarter of the novel that the action and intrigue really heats up and all hell breaks loose. For most of the novel, the reader is just as confused as John Tanner, and the last pages really fly by as you try to discover who is really part of the conspiracy. It's a complex web with various double crossing and threats on all sides. But until the last few chapters, the book is quite easy to put down, and neither gripping nor convincing, although heavily dosed with profanity. For a good weekend read, Ludlum has produced much better gems than The Osterman Weekend. For a more enjoyable weekend, re-read your dog-eared copy of The Bourne Identity or The Matarese Circle."},{"Title":"The Osterman Weekend","review":"This was one of his best early works, really kept me interested as the plot unfolded if you like threatening environment thrillers"},{"Title":"LITTLE BROWN BEAR","review":"I have been looking for this book for at least 30 yrs.

No telling... by standing in front of a car in an intersection, and allowing it to hit him. By doing this he proves...something. Or not. But no matter.The elderly woman driver who hits him is fraught with guilt, and apologizes by sending pies. So begins this little fable about bitterness, friendship and ultimate redemption.The book is a gem, and gut-bustingly funny, particularly if you are a fan of high-end, John Gielgud (the butler in \\"Arthur\\") type wit. Every character - and \\"character\\" is the word - is well-drawn, recognizable and hilarious. The writing is superb. It's a two-read book (though I'm preparing for read Number 3).If you're looking for a book you can't put down, and will really love, this is the book! I give it my very highest rating!"},{"Title":"Spite Hall","review":"A reading of SPITE HALL should convince anyone, who may for some reason have had any doubt, that Mr. Mauro is certainly no &quot; flash in the pan.&quot; Having moved to the novel format, the talented erstwhile short story writer ( GAY STREET) takes advantage of the opportunity to lift his foot from the brake pedal. Indeed, in his latest endeavor he is able to fully indulge his creative talents. As in his previous presentation, he presents the reader with wit and wisdom and delightful turns of phrase; moreover in SPITE HALL he is free to toss over the entire cast of characters a finely woven web, in and out of which they can squirm ,slip, and climb.Gentling his characters across streets of downtown Knoxville while, at the same time, deftly implanting them into the reader's imagination, Mr. Mauro oftentimes is a jazz player: his spontaneous and seamless flights lifting the audience above the core melody as his innovative fingerings articulate nuances of character, subtleties of interaction, and unique insights into the Human Predicament."},{"Title":"Spite Hall","review":"Just so everyone who stops by here knows - I am Jack Mauro, I did indeed write this book, and I have NO IDEA why the subtitle of 'Chronicles of Gabriel Thorn' has been slapped on.

Honest."},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"I have several shelves full of guitar books; And I've been able to benefit from each one in some way. The books that are too basic for where I am, are usually helpful for restating something in a way that makes more sense to me than the more advanced book. and in my mind any thing that helps make something click with me is worth the price. those books that are too advanced for me; I can usually see that they will be helpful in the future and give me some direction on what I will eventually need to work on. This book however, has done nothing for me. the description sounds interesting and helpful enough -- 3 parallel charts of (1) the chord form the arpeggio is based on (2) The arpeggio, itself and (3) another chart of the scale/mode it relates to. You would think this would give you a great understanding of arpeggios, right? Well, for me , NO! I mean if you already know an arpeggio is a chord played one noted at a time. Then All I need to know is the chord form; I don't need a chart of both the chord and the arpeggio! plus ther is no explanation of how to use the material. no exercises; nothing but pages of parallel charts. Ok... \\"Maybe\\" it's useful to have this info in a convenient reference type work, but not much for learning how to use arpeggios musically"},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"This book's title undersells it: it shows not only arpeggios but the corresponding scales and chord forms as well. It does not actually name each chord, but gives chord-scale-arpeggios in fretboard diagrams for each chord type, for example, major, minor, 6ths, 7ths -- on through the various altered forms. As the editorial review says, five positions for each are given. All of this is on one page for each chord type. So for example, you can find five scales, five chord forms, and five arpeggios for Dm7 (assuming you already know where to find &quot;D&quot;) all laid out logically in fretboard diagrams that correspond to one another by position-- all on one page!You'll need enough guitar knowledge to figure out the root of the chord or scale you're actually playing. Also, this does not show you chord progressions. Those could be viewed as shortcomings, but if you just accept you'll have to learn those topics elsewhere, this book becomes extremely useful. In order to actually name each chord the book would be extremely lengthy and repetitive (I have another arpeggio book like that). As it is, it packs a wealth of information into a readily accessible format. One page gives you all the musical possibilities for each chord. This is a great tool for improvising, creating new licks, and composing on the guitar. Its should prove useful for the fairly new guitarist to the more advanced, as it covers simple major and minor chords through advanced jazz chords(-scales-arpeggios). This is a true &quot;fretboard roadmap&quot; all in one book that I expect will give me more material to work on than I can probably master in one lifetime! Its a very simple, logical approach to the guitar that I wish I had found a long time ago.I use this both as an exercise book -- playing each scale/arp/chord up and down the neck -- and as a reference for particular situations: coming up with ideas for soloing over, say, a maj 7 chord - or creating musical ideas for a composition. I play both pick and fingerstyle and the book is opening my eyes to all sorts of new creativity and technical growth in both styles.Other books of this genre force you to turn pages -- or go to another book altogether -- to get from scales to chords to arpeggios. Having it all &quot;at a glance&quot; on one page is invaluable. I've had this book for a year or so, and am only now beginning to realize what a gold mine it is! Obviously not the only book you'll ever need, but if I were marooned on the proverbial desert island (with my guitar of course!) this is the book I'd want."},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"As a guitar player myself I really love this book because it really is easy to understand for one thing; and the other thing is that he (Don) has laid this book out so that you can really get at it. Even if you are and experienced quitarists you can use this as a reference guide and the arpeggios that he has in this book are really basic but tasty beyond imagination. The studies that I have gotten out of this book have given my guitar playing and lot of character and really spiced it up a lot. Another good thing about this book is that you dont have to be an expert player or read music to get something out of it. Even beginners can understand it. I been waiting for a book like this one for a long time. Keep up the good work Don and Thank You."},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"Wow, at first glance this book looks like a bunch of mumbo jumbo. But take a closer look and you will see that this is one of the best ways to completely memorize the fretboard in a short amount of time. The best part of this book is that it shows the chord, arpeggio, and scale. So Not only are you a great book of arpeggios, but also scales and chords as well (In all the shapes and patterns). I would Highly consider picking up this book along with troy stetina's scale book.

I just got a refund from amazon.com though, and that process was very easy and quick, so kudos to them for that."},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"This book is probably a new guitarist's first step in learning how to play jazz guitar. You need to learn bar chords. From there, you can learn any kind of chord known to man/woman. After learning all the chords presented in this book, you can learn a basic scale attached to each chord. This scale is a jazz guitarist's first step to learning solo techniques. After mechanically playing each scale from the 6th to the 1st string, you'll need to learn how to mechanically play or combine four or five scale patterns together so you can play up and down the neck. Once you've figured out how to play (mechanically) up and down the neck (on each chord) you can solo over a certain key per song. The only problem is that you're playing mechanically. A good remedy for this problem is the arpeggio - hence, the title of this book. Once you've learned all the chords and the scales attached to each chord, start learning the arpeggios. An arpeggio gives you an alternate way of playing each scale. The more arpeggios you know, per scale, the better off you are. Another good arpeggio book is the Arpeggio Finder - Guitar Method. It's a Hal Leonard book - and it's pretty good and cheap. My problem with the Arpeggio Finder is that you have to start from the bottom of each page and work up the neck - instead of the other way around. This might confuse you, but if you buy it, remember, the first arpeggio scale starts from the bottom of the page and the last arpeggio (link) is at the top. Why, I'm not sure. Arpeggios For Guitar starts from the top.Anyway, if you want to get the basics from chord learning, try checking out The Guitar Handbook. The chord dictionary in the back is extemely helpful. Once you know most chords and their scales - along with a few arpeggios, you should be a pretty good guitarist. All you need to do is practice. From there, check out Ted Greene. Read his solo technique books and you'll be a genius.In short, I'll give Arpeggios for Guitar five stars. I wish someone had given me this book, back in the day. All the basic chords are in this book. Then, they give you all the basic major and natural minor scales associated with each chord. After learning both chords and scales, they give you arpeggios. Great for begginers and people who want to brush up on their guitar playing."},{"Title":"Arpeggios for Guitar (The Progressive Guitarist Series)","review":"Wow! Finally, a book that ties it all together. Chords, scales, arpeggios and how to USE the arpeggios! Every instructor gave me the same answer to my request \\"Could you explain arpeggios to me?\\" They responded \\"They are like chords, played one note at a time.\\" While that answer is relatively correct, it comes nowhere NEAR giving you enough information.This book does require some additional knowledge of chords and scales. If you have a basic understanding of scales and chords relate to each other, then this book connects that information with arpeggios and HOW YOU CAN USE THE ARPEGGIOS!Even before I began WORKING with the book and I had only spent about 30 minutes reading through it, I had answered questions that had nagged me for YEARS. Be aware that most of the book is more or less reference style presntation of scale/chord/arpeggio, but it will come together for you if you just take time and really pay attention to the patterns and think it through. Yes, you really have to think about the material, but the information you need is there to tie it all together. It is not a \\"paint by number\\" book, but the information is there and very clearly presented.Basically, if you are an intermediate-beginner or more advanced player and want to add more melodic content to your solos/improv, you NEED this book!

Like throwing a few logs on the fire to make the furnace burn hotter, I used Miller's simple plan to lose 16 pounds in less than a month - and then keep it off (something I hadn't been able to do with any other plan). The 20-minute walks after meals became an easy way to keep the furnace hot while the food was being digested, (and the calories burned) and the Muscle Firmer exercises were just right to build my muscles up a bit while also keeping the &quot;furnace&quot; burning efficiently. Miller explains the how-to's very clearly and the focus on &quot;portions&quot; not &quot;calorie counting&quot; took some getting used to (the product's label is right there calling me to read it) but once I saw the genius of using portions, it freed me up to enjoy the food I ate much more. Understanding how metabolism works is the best part of the book. Applying the exercise and eating plan was easier when I understood what was going on inside my body.

An example of this would be an interview with Ann-Ping Chin on Confucianism in today's society. This is much easier for students to relate to than using discussions of ancient religious leaders only.Each chapter has a list of suggested readings, which I found very useful in preparing discussions.

It is told in the first person from the point of view of the young girl. Neither she nor her mother is named. The Crescent Moon provides the only consistency in her life. It is the 1930s in China and times are tough. The mother works hard but never makes enough to subsist so she accepts a series of undesirable marriages and ultimately ends up prostituting in order to keep her daughter in school.The daughter finds after graduation that her opportunities are also very limited. She is very proud and cynical and refuses to play the hand that fate has dealt her, i.e. becoming a mistress or a cleaning woman. She scorns love as an illusion of the bourgeoisie and becomes a prostitute because she feels it allows her control over her life and enables her to support her mother, who is now too old to prostitute. This very profound short story bares uncanny similarities to a novella called Woman at Point Zero written by Egyptian psychiatrist Nawal El Saadawi in the 1970s. I can not help wondering if Saadawi was inspired by Lao She. Both Lao She's and Saadawi's protagonists execrate their hypocritical societies. Woman at Point Zero also bares uncanny similarities to Li Ang's short story \\"Curvaceous Dolls\\" in which the protagonist is stalked by a pair of judgmental eyes.I have been reading through the original Chinese version of the story with the help of my Chinese study-partner. We've noticed that the original Chinese version is more crude and contains some details not found in Shapiro's English translation. I don't know if this was out of fear of offending the Anglophone audience or embarrassing Republican Era China.Another short story in this anthology, \\"A Vision\\" is also excellent. It is also about a woman who due to circumstances beyond her control spirals into a life of prostitution and then dies after a series of abortions. The difference is that the story is told by her childhood love, who for social reasons could not marry her.What makes \\"Crescent Moon\\" so powerful is that it is told in the first person and is void of names and identifying details. This makes it a universal story. I'd say it's like the literary equivalent of Bruce Lee's one inch power punch."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Carlos Torre","review":"There are 105 different games in the book, the vast majority of them in a three-year period from 1923 to 1926. After this, Carlos Torre quit playing tournament chess permanently at the young age of 21. An explanation of this is included later in the review. There are all kinds of games in this book, usually the \\"classical\\" variations, since they were played in the 1920's. However there are some games from Torre and Capablanca that were 1 d4 2 c4 openings where the Queen's Knight went to d2, not c3, and I found that interesting.Carlos Torre was born in Mexico in 1904. His family moved to Louisiana in 1915, and Carlos began playing chess. By 1922, he was the strongest player in New Orleans, and in 1924 he moved to New York City in search of stronger competition. In the first six tournaments he played there, he finished in first place in five of them. He later took first place in the 1924 New York State Championship (Capablanca did not play, possibly because he was not a US citizen, Marshall did not play either in the tournament). Torre then played in the \\"Western\\" US Championship in 1924 (should have been renamed the Midwestern Championship, since it was in Michigan), and again he finished first (Reshevsky took fifth place). The next year he went to Europe to play in three different tournaments, and the rest is history.Carlos Torre of course played one side of the board in all 105 games in the book, and I gave an asterisk in the openings/defenses that he chose in the book's games. The most popular openings in this book include: Queen's Gambit Declined/Queen Pawn Game*, French Defense*, Vienna Game*, Ruy Lopez*, Two Knights Defense*, Old Indian Defense, Dutch Defense*, Sicilian Defense, King's Indian Defense*, Pirc Defense, English Opening*, Reti Opening*, Grunfeld Defense*, Slav Defense, Alekhine's Defense*, King's Gambit Accepted*, and the Torre Attack*, as well as several other openings that appear in one game each. Obviously, this book is filled with all kinds of openings, and would make great reading for a beginner/intermediate player looking for certain openings/defenses that suit their emerging style.Obviously Carlos Torre was a strong master, being able to effectively play so many diverse openings and defenses. But what makes him, and this book, so special, is the quality of opponents that he faced. In a three year tournament career he played against four world champions (Alekhine, Capablance, Em. Lasker, and Rubenstein), as well as over a dozen perennial world champion contenders. How did Torre perform against this world-class opposition? You may be very surprised. Here is how he scored against world-class opponents:Name RecordMarshall 2-0-3Janowsky 1-0-1Reshevsky 1-0-0Alekhine 0-0-1Reti 1-0-2Samisch 1-0-2Spielmann 0-1-2Grunfeld 2-0-1Colle 0-0-1Tartakower 0-0-3Yates 1-0-1Nimzovich 0-0-2Rubenstein 0-1-2Levenfisch 1-0-0Bogolyubov 0-1-0Capablanca 0-0-1Em. Lasker 1-0-0Ilyin-Zhenevsky 0-0-1Rokhlin 0-0-2Kashdan 0-0-1Maroczy 1-0-0Showalter 1-0-0Of the 22 players above, Torre had a plus score against 11, and only a minus score against two! Most of his losses were to lesser players for some reason. Most of his games against the above opponents were played in Europe, in three separate tournaments (Baden-Baden, 1925, Marienbad, 1925, and Moscow, 1925). In Baden-Baden Torre finished 10th out of 21 players, with a 5-4-11 score; Alekhine won the tournament. But Torre was just getting started. In Marienbad he finished 3rd out of 16 players, with a 6-1-8 score; Nimzovich won this tournament. In Moscow he finished 5th out of 21 players, with an 8-4-8 record; Bogolyubov won the Moscow tournament. Torre's overall tournament record in Europe was 19-9-27, very impressive for never having played in an international tournament before 1925.Carlos then returned to New York for a brief break from chess. Unfortunately for him and the rest of the chess world, his physical and mental health quickly began to deteriorate. He may have been one of those people who could not handle success. He always had a sweet tooth, but now he began to eat up to 12 banana sundaes every day. In fact, he got to the point of not eating any hot meals, just snacks and junk food. After several weeks of eating like this, he suffered a nervous breakdown, was hospitalized in a mental institution for some time, and then released. He never played against a top-rated player again. He moved back to Mexico and lived there until his death in 1972. The book's author, Gabriel Velasco, interviewed him in 1971, and the interview is in the book; it's not worth discussing here. Let's play through his most famous game instead!Almost every serious chess player has seen the next game, Torre - Em. Lasker. Some call it a game of the ages, and some call it a sloppy game for both sides. Whatever the judgement, the windmill combination found in the game is very instructive. Fans of Emmanuel Lasker wonder to this day how he allowed the combination to happen against him. The book sheds some light on the subject. There were two major distractions to Lasker that day, before the game against Torre. The first was a heated argument with Richard Reti, presumably about classical vs. hypermodern play. In 1925 the hypermoderns, led by Reti and Nimzovich, were just beginning to put their stamp on the game, and old veterans like Lasker and Rubenstein were slowly creeping to the twilight of their careers, although both were still extremely strong players. The second distraction was that Lasker received a letter stating that a play he had written back in Germany had been accepted for screenwriting. Lasker was overjoyed and went around the tournament tables telling everyone about it. This combination of anger and joy may have made him play several dubious moves in the following game.Torre - Em.

While I can overlookCronn-Mills' less than precise and not wholly accurateexplanation of the Witnesses' pneumatology in thefollowing terms, \\"The Spirit is merely Jehovah'spower, force, or energy\\" (44), I find it much moredifficult to ignore other errors. For instance, hewrites that the Witnesses believe that \\"Lucifer\\" wascreated by Jehovah through \\"Michael\\" to watch over theGarden of Eden until he began to nurture andeventually acted on a desire to have his ownworshipers. Cronn-Mills continues: \\"So, while Jehovah*slept* on the seventh day, Lucifer found andcapitalized on Adam and Eve's fatal flaw--free will\\"(44).I think that most Witnesses of Jehovah reading theaforesaid comments could quickly and immediatelydiscern errors in Cronn-Mills' presentation. There areother slips, but I will resist the urge to nit-pick.Yet, before closing, we must mention the threefolddistinction mentioned in _A Qualitative Analysis_ thatWitnesses putatively advocate or teach. That is, thethreefold division of Satan's world, the Witnessworld, and Jehovah's world (i.e., the new worldorder). I think that many Witnesses, probably most,would take issue with this portrayal of our beliefs.Witnesses do not make a sharp distinction between aso-called \\"Witness world\\" and Jehovah's world.Cronn-Mills needs to reanalyze and rework thisexplanation of Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs.In conclusion, I would like to point out thatCronn-Mills' work is worth reading, if one isinterested in rhetorical and social science issues asthey appertain to religion. His attempt to be fair isnoble. His scientific research is also sound. But someof the theological details are unfortunately explained in aninadequate manner. Furthermore, there are a number oftypos in the book and the writing style employed inthe study is at times difficult to decipher. I am nottalking about technical language as such but thewriter's style of communication. Then again, he maynot be a native American English speaker or writer.That would account for what seem to be textual idiosyncrasies in_A Qualitative Analysis_. Finally, the issues ofsocial interactionism and groups constructing theirown reality through discursive pratices or rhetoricare issues that could be treated in another essay ormonograph. Suffice it to say that Cronn-Mills'\\"construction of reality\\" theory needs to beapproached with a certain \\"hermeneutics of suspicion\\"by the Christian who endeavors to be faithful to God,His written Word, and the very reality of God.Edgar FosterUniversity of Glasgow"},{"Title":"A Qualitative Analysis of the Jehovah's Witnesses: The Rhetoric, Reality and Religion in the Watchtower Society (Studies in American Religion)","review":"The author writes for a very narrow audience, those who are academically minded and who want a discourse on what the paradigm of Jehovah's Witnesses apparently is.For Jehovah's Witnesses, this book is valuable only in the sense that this book shows the understanding that a non-believer walked away with after attending quite a few meetings and after having quite a few discussions with Jehovah's Witnesses. He doesn't get everything right, but then neither do \\"believers.\\"It also bothered me that he accepted some of the negative statements made by apostates (non-Jehovah's Witnesses who are actively against the religion, whether they were once believers or not.)If you enjoy academic language, would like to know an outsider's understanding of how Jehovah's Witnesses view the world, and know the meaning of words like etic and emic then this is the book for you.

A story about life change in the desert is a compelling read by Mary Austin."},{"Title":"Real People","review":"A frequent theme of Thomas Mann's writing is the dichotomy between the \\"Kuenstler\\", or artist, and the \\"Buerger\\", a word that can be translated either as \\"citizen\\" or \\"bourgeois\\". Janet, the central character of this novel, tries to keep a foot in both camps. On the one hand she is Janet Stockwell, the wife of a successful insurance company executive, on the other, she is Janet Belle Smith, moderately successful writer of short stories. (She writes under her maiden name).The novel is set during the two weeks in midsummer which Janet spends at Illyria, a New England stately home. (The story is told in the first person, and is written as though it were being told in Janet's diary). Once the mansion of a wealthy family, Illyria is now, under the terms of the will of its last owner, a colony for creative artists. The name \\"Illyria\\" is probably a pun on \\"Bohemia\\"- both were former names of counties in Eastern Europe, Croatia and the Czech Republic respectively, and both were used by Shakespeare as settings for plays. Every year, various writers, musicians, painters and sculptors are invited to spend a few weeks or months in the house in order to escape from the pressures of the outside world (what Janet calls \\"the world of telegrams and anger\\") and concentrate on their work.Among Janet's fellow-guests at Illyria are Charlie Baxter, a disillusioned Marxist novelist, now a self-destructive alcoholic suffering from poverty, Gerald Glass, a young hippy poet, Nick Donato, a modernist pop-art sculptor from a working-class immigrant New York background, and Leonard Zimmern, an eminent literary critic. The guest Janet is most looking forward to meeting is Kenneth Foster, a more traditionalist artist. Although there has never been any sexual relationship between them, Janet is secretly in love with Kenneth; he is trapped in an unhappy marriage to a drunken and unfaithful wife, and Janet sees him as a kindred spirit, someone who, unlike her husband, understands her creative impulses.Janet has always enjoyed her stays at Illyria in the past, and at first she is happy to be once again in a place she describes as a \\"small private Eden\\". (The title \\"Real People\\" derives from Janet's theory that at Illyria one becomes one's real self, the person one would be in a decent world). Even in Eden, however, there was a serpent and forbidden fruit, and as Janet's stay progresses she finds quarrels breaking out among the guests and she herself becomes more discontented. (The changing weather seems to reflect Janet's feelings; at first pleasantly warm, it later becomes oppressively hot, with a thunderstorm at the end coinciding with her emotional crisis). The catalyst for much of the discontent is Anna May Mundy, the teenage niece of the administrator of the Illyria foundation. Anna May is an attractive but superficial girl, uninterested in art but fascinated by celebrity, and it is her flirtations with the male guests which are the cause of much of the dissension. The crisis for Janet comes when she discovers that Kenneth is secretly a homosexual, and she allows herself to be drawn into a brief sexual liaison with Nick.Although this is a short novel, of less than 150 pages, it is a profound one, partly a character-study of Janet and her housemates, partly an examination of the nature of artistic creativity. Janet's discoveries about Kenneth and about herself lead her to re-examine both her personal life and her art, yet she emerges stronger from this crisis. Paradoxically, her adultery with Nick strengthens her marriage, as she comes to appreciate her husband's good qualities and abandons her fantasies of leaving him. As far as her art is concerned, she is forced to confront the fact that there has hitherto been something dishonest about her fiction and that she has been too concerned to avoid writing anything that might upset her family to her middle-class neighbours. The book ends with Janet resolving to write with greater honesty in future. \\"If nothing will survive of life besides what artists report of it, we have no right to report what we know to be lies\\".For all the high-mindedness of its closing line, this is not a heavy-going or sententious book. Alison Lurie has the talent of combining serious themes with both readability and the ability to draw vivid, and often satirical, pen-portraits, and \\"Real People\\" is a good example of this talent. The novel is, in fact, often comic, as the author satirises the pretensions of various members of the American cultural establishment. (I wondered whether any of these were in fact disguised portraits of real-life people). An excellent book"},{"Title":"Real People","review":"When writers write about writing, the results are usually very interesting. Think of Calvino's \\"If On A Winter's Night a Traveler\\", Byatt's \\"Possession\\", Roth's \\"The Ghost Writer\\", and Coetzee's \\"Elizabeth Costello\\". Alison Lurie's 1970 novel is right up there with them, to my mind. It's only 146 pages long, but what it lacks in length it more than makes up for in elegance and sophistication. Janet 'Belle' Smith - married, early forties, and the author of a well-received collection of short stories - is taking her annual sojourn at Illyria, a New England mansion which has been converted into an invitation-only retreat for artists of all kinds. Craving escape from a deadening home life, Janet is delighted to find her friend Kenneth is on the guest list, but the appearance of the witless waif Anna May and the husky sculptor Nick Donato threaten to disrupt everything. As Janet struggles to construct new stories she is forced to confront some uncomfortable truths about herself, her companions, and the potential fraudulence of her art. Lurie chooses Janet's diary as the narrative device, and it's an excellent choice for a novel which deals with the difference between appearance and reality, between social roles and one's own sense of identity, and in which the protagonist's reflection on these differences is vital. Apart from constructing a neat snapshot of American art in the 1960s, Lurie deftly explores the familiar crisis of female artistry: the competing claims of being a wife/mother and having a creative career which family members more or less refuse to take seriously. But this isn't just about women. It's about the relationship between art and reality. What starts out as a comedy of manners escalates in profundity until it becomes, in the final pages, a concise manifesto on the nature and purpose of art - which turns out to be truth: \\"If nothing survives of life besides what artists report of it, we have no right to report what we know to be lies.\\""},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The type was readable, illustrations interesting.

Austen takes the story of two sisters, one quick to emotion and the other reasonable nearly to a fault and puts them in a similar situation of unreturned fancy. In the right hands this could be an interesting story and you would think Austen would make it so. Unfortunately not, her story is dull and I kept waiting for something to happen. There was no biting irony or under the surface commentary. This being Jane Austen's first novel explains some of it. You see a few glimpses of her use of language and irony but not enough to carry this book. I give this a C-."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"There are two schools of Austen. The first, her ardent admirers, adore everything she does; the second find the snobby world her characters inhabit a perpetual turnoff. Belonging to neither category myself, this book strikes me as somewhat tentative, in regards to Austen's development as a writer. This opinion I'm sure won't endear me to the legions of Austen fans who treasure every word she wrote. But though the story itself is a fine one, the novel as a whole lacks the attention to detail, character, and metaphor that Austen would perfect in her later novels (particularly \\"Mansfield Park,\\" which never seems to get the accolades this novel and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" do). Though Austen compensates for this with various literary techniques (creating an opposite foil for all of her characters, constructing parallels for various scenes, etc.), when it comes right down to it, this is the work of a beginner, a writer just beginning to get her bearings. I know \\"S&S\\" has its passionate proponents, mostly on the basis of its romantic plot, and heartfelt depiction of the love lives of two very different sisters. But on the whole, this book derives its strength mostly from straightforward storytelling, rather than imaginative and poetic writing. Not a bad beginning, but Austen definitely improved her game with her future novels. (...)"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility for my English IV Course. This novel was written by Jane Austen. This book is for a romantic person, adult or young adult. If you are someone who is interested in 19th Century society and the roles of women, this story is for you. Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. The author is well known and the quality of literature is world class, because it is so well known.Sense and Sensibility describes the adventures of two young ladies (Marianne and Elinor) falling in love. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and senses. Marianne is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who have no evidence of wholly encompassing emotions or are without them entirely. She ultimately marries her long standing admirer, Colonel Brandon. Also Elinor is the heroin of the story. The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is weird; she is always after her daughters minding their business. She is the opposite of Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice. She has inherited no fortune of her own but wants the best for her daughters and shares Marianne's romantic sensibilities. The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward and Marianne falls in love with Willoughby.The conflict of the ideas about marriage between parents and daughters is the main theme of this book. If the girls were not yet married, their mothers employed themselves in matching the younger women with eligible men.I recommend Jane Austen's work to all readers who are fascinated with love. This is an excellent book for those who enjoy 19th Century Literature. Even though I missed some details because of the language, I identified with one the girls in the story."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I love all of Jane Austin's works. She captures real life in her day, and it still applies to my day."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Perhaps one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It's perfect in every way!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"As SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY (S&amp;S) was Austen's first published novel, it is perhaps a forgivable sin that this work is almost wholly without that inimitable touch of greatness that makes her later works so wonderful. To be sure, S&amp;S is not completely without charm; as usual, her characters are described along the same uber ironic and caustic lines familiar to fans of her later work, and the soap operish quality of the narrative is, as always, tempered by her wry wit. When Austen sets her baleful eye on the often ridiculous mores of her society, deftly skewing her demographic representing characters with the graceful, devastating wit she made her stock and trade, there is no one better. Yet, in S&amp;S, the other part of what makes Austen so great - the biting, social commentary which is always indistinguishably entwined with plot and that sterling character development we've come to expect - is absent. And though Austen sets her novel up as a didactic tale centering around an overmeasure of both sensibility and emotional excessivity, in the end she fails to create any application, to make sense of the lessons she so clearly intended to teach. The two main characters seem to have suffered trial after trial for nothing, and the rest of the characters, those that MADE them suffer, get off scot-free. That sense of Austen Justice so unavoidable in her later efforts is conspicuously absent here, leaving the narrative in want of purpose and the reader ultimately dissatisfied.A lesser effort from one just setting her foot on the Alpine Path to greatness."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. I thought the book was very good. Austen portrays Elinor and Marianne very well. She shows the love and friendship and the jealously of two sisters. She shows how one sister can be in love and the other is trying to find the bad in that person.In the beginning, Elinor finds someone she really likes and Marianne trys to find the bad in him, like he doesn't like drawing and Elinor does. Marianne is just jealous that her sister has found someone and she hasn't found anyone yet. Marianne wants Edward, Elinor's boyfriend. Elinor and Edward don't last that long anyway because they move to Barton Park.The Miss Dashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton, writes them a letter and invites them to move to Barton Park and live in a cottage. They gladly accept. They tell their brother and his wife and send their belongings in advance and leave. They agree to try the cottage out for a year. Sir John and his wife are very hospitable to the Miss Dashwood's. They always invite them to their house to meet the people of the neighborhood. The Miss Dashwood's rarely accepted.There was on certain time they accepted and met Colonel Brandon, who is a friend of Sir John. Colonel Brandon sets his sights on Marianne. Colonel Brandon likes Marianne's singing and piano playing. Elinor does not like that idea. She would rather him be interested in her instead. Elinor is now jealous of Marianne. She doesn't even care that Edward is supposed to be coming to see her. Their good-bye was like that of a brother and sister. They didn't even kiss good-bye.The Middleton's are always having someone stay the night at their house. The Dashwood's would rather keep to themselves. When Sir John's wife invites them to come to the house the Dashwood's are always busy. The Dashwood's are the type that would rather do for themselves. They are not really the social type. Mr. John Dashwood and his wife live in Norland. They moved there after his father died. Mr. Dashwood made his son promise to provide for his mother and sisters. Which meant that he was to give them money. His wife did not like that idea. She thought that they could find their own money and that the money was the only reason they were still living in Norland. Which in fact was not true. They were still living there because they had no where else to go. Miss John Dashwood thought that they didn't deserve any money from them whether they were family or not. She thought only of herself and her son not of her husband's family.John Dashwood wanted to give them three thousand pounds apiece. His wife wouldn't hear of it. She thought that they would never pay it back because they had no source of income. She managed to talk her husband down to about five hundred pounds. They managed to get out of paying the women any money because they decided to move Barton Park. In the end they both marry and are happy. They don't live too far away from one another, so they can still fight as they please. They can stay in touch with one another because family means so much to them. In reading this book, I had a little trouble understanding and following the context in some places, but I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to young women who like to read romances. It is very much so a romance, yet it is also a book about the love that two sisters have for one another. Sense and Sensibility is rather difficult to follow in some spots. I highly recommend this to young women who enjoy reading romances."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility (Insight Editions), a classic fiction novel written by Jane Austen and published almost 200 years ago, is still an extremely popular story today. Bethany House Publishers recently released the \\"Insight Edition\\" which includes footnotes of trivia, notes, and inspiration to help readers understand more background to this story. It is important to note that the story has not been changed in any way. Some of these notes are historical, that expand on life in England in the 1800s; others are facts about Jane Austen that coincide with the story; still others are themes of faith, or comments on the characters or plot.This was my second reading of Sense and Sensibility and I definitely enjoyed reading the extra tidbits included in this version. The culture of the 1800s is very different from current culture and there were many times that the notes gave me a greater understanding of various situations.I recommend this version to all Jane Austen fans, you will probably have new insights after reading this book. And to those of you who have not yet become Jane Austen fan, give this book a try, it's a timeless story."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I love Jane Austen. A couple summers ago, I set out to read all of her books in one summer - even those I had read before (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). Even after realizing that many of her characters and stories are similar, I still loved her. I love the way she writes with wit and intelligence. And I really enjoy how everyone who deserves to be happy in the end does indeed end up happy.Sense and Sensibility, for those of you who haven't ever read it or seen one of the many film versions, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne who are both alike in passion, except that Marianne is all passion and impulsivity on the outside (sensibility) and Elinor is all composure and caution on the outside (sense). The story tells of secret love, not so secret love, lost fortunes and selfishness, and deep sisterly love. This story, even more than Pride and Prejudice, makes me wish I had a sister or two.This insight edition is different from other more \\"academic\\" versions of classic works, because rather than pages and pages of footnotes instructing the reader as to the socio-historical background of the book.... Well, it's like the editors are reading the book with you. Occasionally there are informative footnotes which tell you what a \\"Barouche\\" is (a four-wheeled carriage pulled by 2 horses that seated four people), or tells you about \\"Harley Street\\" (a street in London populated chiefly by medical professionals). But there are also 6 other types of footnotes that occur throughout the book - usually as an \\"aside\\" on the edge of the page - including notes about Jane Austen's life and how a part of the story relates to it, references to S&S; in film and television, themes related to faith, and notes on characters that the editors dislike throughout the story.While at first, I thought that this tongue-in-cheek note system was a little distracting, as I went onward, I began to enjoy the voices of these women. It was kind of like I was reading the book with a friend or with a book club. So that as I read about something really horrible that Fanny said to John or Lucy said to Elinor and thought, \\"UGH! I think Fanny is such a jerk!\\" there was the comment by my \\"friends\\" in the margin saying the same thing.This version of Sense and Sensibility does not add anything new to the text that Jane Austen wrote, and thus the story of course is great. The Insight Edition does add some contemporary fun to the novel however, and it is likely you would also enjoy taking these friends with you on the journey through 19th century England.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen? 4.5 out of 5The Insight Edition? 3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" by Jane Austen focuses on sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood and their search for love.

Sure enough, there was an end cap in the fiction section covered with retellings and sequels to Austen's beloved novels. Austen's influence can even be found in the popular paranormal genre; Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) and Jane Austen both appear as vampires in two such books. The Insight Edition offers a newly packaged look at the original story of Sense and Sensibility, with a few fun surprises in store.I'll be honest with you. Up until this week, Sense and Sensibility was the only Jane Austen novel I had not yet read. Without this new edition of the beloved classic, it's more than likely I never would have made it through. A few months ago, I attempted to read it from beginning to end, but gave up less than a third of the way into the story. I was baffled. If I can read Pride and Prejudice in two days flat, then why was I having so much trouble with Sense and Sensibility? Like in other novels, Austen writes about marrying for love and/or money, first impressions, and differences in class.Sense and Sensibility is the story of the Marianne and Elinor Dashwood. They are the late Mr. Dashwood's children from his second marriage. At the time of his death, he asks his son Henry to care for youngest three daughters and his new widow. However, Henry's wife has his ear and persuades him to give them less income annually than the promise he made to his father. Marianne and Elinor can only hope to preserve their future by making smart matches. Bold and romantic Marianne has her sights set on the charming Mr. Willoughby, and sensible and logical Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars. Neither gentleman is what he seems, and both girls soon suffer from a broken heart. The loss of Mr. Willoughby prolongs Marianne's sickness, and Elinor silently suffers through Edward's upcoming nuptials with Lucy Steele. Just as it seems all hope is lost for a happy ending, Marianne opens her heart to a new love, and Elinor learns that things are not exactly as they seem.This annotated edition of Sense and Sensibility enhanced a story I already knew through the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson feature film. The editors provided trivia about the movie, ranked their favorite characters and least favorite characters, offered facts about Jane Austen and the Regency period, and provided definitions of difficult words. Whether Sense and Sensibility is an old favorite or a new-to-you text, this is the edition you should read. Lovingly put together by some of Austen's biggest fans, the Insight Edition will earn a slot on your bookshelf.*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"How do you take a book that is almost 200 years old and make it interesting and new to the modern reader? That's a trick question, I can't imagine not enjoying Jane Austen's writing no matter how antiquated the society and its ideals are. Of course I took as many literature classes in college as time allowed so I may be an exception to the rule.The story itself? The cast of characters is impressive; you've got the calm introvert, the passionate young thing, the rake, the snob, the neighbors you roll your eyes at whenever they show up, the man of integrity, etc. And the plotlines are almost as thick as the characters! Frivolity and fun, true love, desperate, gut-wrenching heartbreak, intrigue and secrets, scandal, mix-ups, horrible nasty people you want to punch in the nose (I know I'm not the only one who thought that.)I've made it a personal project to read all of Austen and this was my third foray and probably my favorite to read - which surprised me because as absolutely wonderful as Edward and Col. Brandon are, I don't swoon over them like Mr. Darcy or Mr. Knightley. Not to sound smarmy about it but I think it did have to do with the \\"insights\\" in my margin.The book has a pictographic key so the notes in your margin are categorized by things like historical and cultural details, film references, themes of faith, Austen facts and tidbits, and comments and asides as well as frowny face and smiley face comments. As much as I LOVE tidbits and asides in all categories what I really enjoyed were the smiley and frowney faces - it was like reading the book with a friend who hated the same parts you hated and loved, laughed and smiled at all your favorite places.(I got quite the laugh out of the film reference which stated: In the 2008 miniseries, Edward's bad mood leads him to chop wood in the pouring rain. The film was written by the same person who had Darcy jump in a lake. We approve of both.And yes I did run out and rent the 2008 miniseries after reading that. Kidding. Sortof.)If you were one of those women (or girls - I knew lots of teens who did this) who ran out and bought Pride and Prejudice the book after watching the 2005 film and found the book hard to read - I'd recommend trying it again with the \\"insight edition\\" which will inevitably lead you to Sense & Sensibility.

Instead of tampering with the language or feeling of the original manuscript, it provides fun asides.The margins of the book are dotted with factoids. Some of the details focus on Austen's life, others on English life in general during the time period. Historical details are discussed in some, while slight religious themes addressed in the book are presented in others.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The classic Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is, well a classic.

I'm not sure why, I just never had until I was given the opportunity to review this Insight Edition published by Bethany House. I have to admit that I am not going to be a Jane Austen fan. I struggled with Sense and Sensibility. I actually felt like Tom Hanks in \`You've Got Mail'. It just was not my cup of tea, which is strange because I love books that take place in Regency England and I love Jane Austen themed books.But, I'm not really reviewing Jane Austen here. I'm reviewing the Insight Edition. This annotated edition is filled with trivia, themes of faith, and other nuggets meant to enhance the reader's experience. I have to say that I like this concept with classic literature. I enjoyed taking a break from the story and reading the side notes. The notes are written clearly on the pages, but they do not get in the way of the story.One devoted Austen fan told me that reading a book like this is like watching a movie with the commentary on. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes a reader just wants the story and nothing else.

If that is the case, I highly recommend the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility for those who want to add to their Jane Austen experience."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the first published novel of Jane Austen. Originally published in 1811, the novel went through several versions perhaps starting with \\"Elinor and Marianne\\" in 1795, though it is not certain. I suspect that \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the second best known work of Austen after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I would say that it is not as easy to read as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". One of the reasons for this is due to the importance of what was considered proper behavior at the time, and without an understanding of that standard of behavior, the motivation of the characters is hidden from the reader. Nevertheless, it is still worth the effort to read and overall it is worthwhile. At the same time, it is well worth reading an edition like the Penguin Classics version, which helps the reader understand the period and societal standards which play an important role in this novel.The main characters of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" are the sisters Elinor and Marianne, who are the daughters of Mr. Dashwood and his second wife. There is a third daughter, Margaret and of course his second wife Mrs. Dashwood. When Mr. Dashwood passes away, his estate passes to his son by his first wife, leaving the Dashwood women into lives of reduced means. The two elder sisters experience nearly the same situations. Both find love, then the shock of learning that those they love are pre-engaged.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is written in three volumes. The first deals with the transition of the Dashwood women to their new lives where they leave their Norland home move to stay with distant relations (the Middletons) at Barton Park. Elinor cares for Edward Ferras, the brother-in-law of her half-brother, and Marianne meets and is courted by John Willoughby. Willoughby leaves suddenly for London, causing Marianne distress. This volume also introduce Anne and Lucy Steele, two relations of the Middleton's who arrive as guests, but their arrival causes problems for Elinor who learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to her Edward. In Volume II, it is Marianne who learns that Willoughby has become engaged to another, due to his wasting his fortune and need for wealth. In Volume III the situations with the two sisters and those who they thought they loved is resolved, though in different ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", in my opinion, is more difficult for a modern reader to digest, but that does not mean that it doesn't have anything to offer. There are some wonderful moments and when presented in a scholarly format with detailed notes it can still be enjoyed the same way it was when first published. I don't personally rate \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as high as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it is still a very good novel and an important piece of literature."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, who happens to be my favorite author. I don't think I need to incredible detail here since if you're thinking about reading it, you more than likely familiar with Ms. Austen's writing. I think I enjoy this one because Eleanor is such a sensible character, as is Anne Elliot (my favorite Austen heroine). I felt so much for her and enjoyed experiencing her sorrow and her happiness."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This was my first read for this author and it is worth reading again. Contemporary for its time, this story can still place you back in time and in the minds of the characters."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This novel was a big revelation for me. Even though I love period dramas, somehow the S&S; movie didn\\"t manage to grab me. It was one of those movies, that I wasn't enthusiastic to rewatch, even though I love Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, and think that they did a great job and the whole movie looks great, but it is the story that I was not fond of.So you can imagine that I wasn't enthusiastic to read the novel either. Actually, when it was voted as the next book in my reading group, I decided I would skip it. And then my cousin just gave it to me and when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I loved it! Somehow it is completely different from the movie. Here Elinor isn't an Ice Queen, just a private and mature girl, and Marianne didn't annoy me with her liveliness and passionate views as in the movie. I think the only character I liked better in the movie than in the book was Edward Ferrars.I'm sorry to say that S&S; is quite an understated Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice, Presuasion and Emma usually get all the praise and are the favourites of readers, but this Austen novel is excellent in its subdued pastel coloured way too.If you love the movie or the miniseries, you ahve to read it, and if the screen adaptations didn't really engage you, I'd still encourage you to give S&S; a chance, the novel is well worth the read, I'm sure you will love it!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

I do have to admit that I think Marienne is a spoiled brat who doesn't know a good man when she sees him. Always go for substance over lipstick!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I find the illustrations slightly disappointing so I deducted one star.

The plot has been well covered with these reviews and others, and even if they had not, you would have had to almost spent your life living under a rock not to be aware, so I certainly will not beat it to death here.Briefly though, this is the story of two sisters of the Dashwood family, who find themselves in a state of reduced circumstances upon the death of their father; a plight not uncommon during that era we know as Regency England. This is the story of Emma Dashwood and her sister Marianne, the relationship between the two sisters, their family, friends, neighbors, and most importantly, possible suitors. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Emma (sense?...I wonder), but through her eyes we get a wonderful picture of some very unforgettable characters. Note: If you watch very closely, you will see these same characters amongst us even to this day! More about this later.Now, for one of my pet peeves; most of the members of the reading Western World will tell you that this is Austen's first novel and it is not her best work, or one reason or another. Now being something of a semi-cultural barbarian, I have a problem with this statement. While I will admit that Austen's later works are some of the best turned out in the English language, I do strongly feel that it is quite unfair to compare and contrast this work, Sense and Sensibility, with her later works. Had this been the only novel Ms Austen had ever written, she still would have been listed with the literary greats on this work along. It has all of the elements that her later works include; the insight to human nature, the subtle humor, the fantastic dialog, the complicated relationships, the unfortunate conditions many young ladies of that class suffered during this period of time and the raw emotions that are so understated in each and every line of her work. I hate to beat dead horses, but the dialog in this work is along with the read!I take my peevishness further in noting that many refer to the situations, manners, mannerisms, attitudes and situations as being typically of those of only this period on English history. As far as I can tell, most, if not all, of the situations encountered by the Dashwood sisters are with us even to this day and are merely cloaked in different clothing. Emotions are emotions are timeless and what was true then, is true now, the truth just manifests itself a bit differently now than it did then. We all want love, security, understanding and companionship; have since time began and I suspect we will until time ends. Not all that much has changed. I also strongly feel that if you feel that there is not a definite class system in existence today, as there was at the time this novel was written, then you well may be missing something. It may no be a blatant now as then, but it certainly is alive and well even to this day.Now all that being said, the bottom line is that this one fine bit of writing; a timeless bit of writing and the reader will certainly be much richer for having read it, and as a matter of fact, it does not hurt to give this one, along with Austen's other works, multiple readings over the years. There is much we can learn here. I've often told people that they should read at least one of Jane Austen's books each year just to keep in the front of their minds what writing is all about. And for goodness sakes, I agree fully that there have been some very fine film adaptations of this work over the years and I certainly do recommend that you see them (I personally love several of them), but READ the book also! You are missing out on a real treat if you do not.This review was of the Penquin Classic edition, one of quite a number of editions I have laying around the house. Between my wife and myself, the get quite a workout...I do not know what I would do with out good old Penquin. I will review other editions, as there are some that are excellent, while other not so great and it does make a difference you know.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" concentrates upon life in the Dashwood family and the relationship of two sisters, particularly in reference to the amorous events in their lives transpiring over the course of a year or so. The younger sister, Marianne, represents \\"sense,\\" as she views and lives life in a romantic, sensual, and dramatic manner, while Elinor, representing \\"sensibility,\\" is more reserved in her expressions of feeling, and her pragmatic, moral way of making decisions. While treating one other, at times, with brutal honesty, attacking the other for who they are not, each eventually learns that there is a deep love between them. Additionally, the sisters learn that there is something of value in the dominant characteristics of the other's personality, and this works to positive effect for the love lives of both as time passes.Austen paints a picture of early nineteenth century England, especially with a focus on the position of women, who were largely dependent on marriage for their survival. Yet, in spite of this, Austen's characters hunger for their dreams, for love that does not compromise their existence merely to pragmatic ends. In narrative terms, Austen's genius never fails to come through with unseen twists in plot and beautiful, moving dialogue that has been kept at bay to be delivered to the anxiously-waiting reader at just the right moment."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"i didnt like this one as much as i have like some of austens other works. there just seems to be some element of fun missing from it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"For a long time, this was one of my least favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. But having re-read it recently (it was the first selection for our Jane Austen Book Group on The Book Club Forum), I found myself falling in love with the story for the first time. Elinor is a heroine that one can easily love and respect, especially in the way she controls, and yet deeply feels her emotions. Marianne, however, did grate on my nerves some, but I respect her allowing herself to give herself completely to Willoughby. Elinor and Marianne really do seem like opposite sides of the same coin: one hold everything in, one lets everything out.This book also has some of the best comic characters, especially Mrs. Jennings, the jolly matchmaker. One has to admit how uninteresting her life has to be if her ambition is to marry off every eligible young woman she meets! I also think that Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother and sister-in-law are hilarious in their coldness and selfishness. You can tell that John likes to think of himself as charitable toward his sisters, but in reality he is completely self-centered. His wife, Fanny, is a wonderful villain for the book; she makes her husband seem positively warm."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is a wonderful clasic and I was so happy to find it and it is in great condition!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the best things you can do for yourself is to read or reread one of Jane Austen's books.

In any event, I find her sense of humor and grasp of the English language makes this book a must in any collection of Austen's works. It is well worth purchasing. Too, the Everyman's Library cover is finely done. This book will last on your shelf for years."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is the second Jane Austen book that I have listened to this year. I earlier enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and just finished Sense and Sensibility. It is clear to my why this is a classic. It is a fine romance and a great study in character. It highlights how outward appearances and popularity are not necessarily the most important characteristics. The heroes and heroines in this book have their flaws, but are easy to like and root for. The bad guys are not all bad, and do have some redeeming qualities. This is classic 19th century literature of which I am a fan.The reader for this audio book is Susannah Harker. She does an excellent job with the different characters and makes it easy to tell who is speaking. Her accent seems fitted to a book of this period also.I highly recommend this audio book as a wonderful way to pass your commute or a long trip."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The dual natures of these sisters is what truly makes this novel special. Their natural differences and their abilities in the end to overcome their inborn instincts demonstrate Austen's talent in creating interesting and dynamic characters. For me, this is Jane's best novel (I have not read them all). There is so much to learn from these characters! The men in the novel are complex and interesting as well. Recommended reading. (and yes, the 21st century reader will need to be patient with the language, but the novel is well worth it.)"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is very good--but as one of Austen's earliest works, it's just not her best. That's not a criticism, merely an opinion. And wherever one thinks this falls in the Austen cannon, everyone should read S&S.; Because even when Austen is not at her best, she's is much better than most 19th century authors. There is the humor and romance one comes to expect in a JA yarn, however here it is not so finely honed. Also, there are no minor characters of the caliber of Lady Catherine de Bourgh or Mr. Collins. However, most novels don't have minor characters as compelling, so again chalk this up as observation.The one rub I do have with the plot is Elinor's love for Edward Ferrars. Frankly, Edward is more than a bit of a drip, and it is hard to imagine him inspiring love much less devotion. A bit more believable but still odd is Marianne's transformation (after recovering from death's door because of a broken heart). Once truly, madly, deeply in love with Willoughby, after a period of convalescence and introspection she transfers her affections to the not-it-the-least alike Col. Brandon. It's rather pat, and though plausible, it is just barely so.It is a vast improvement over Northanger Abbey, JA's earliest work; showing the writer to be well on her way to the style and substance of her later masterpieces."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen has a way of writing that pulls you in, or at least for me.Sense and Sensibility is about two sister struggling through the trials of relationships, and doing their best to keep their senses. I specifically liked this copy because of its look. The cover and design is simply beautiful, and that of an older book you'd find in a forgotten bookstore. I saw many copies of this book, but this one caught my eye."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California)."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen begins in her first novel what for her was to be her life long concern: what is the proper role that society should take in the relationship between men and women? In this novel at least, her response is that potential lovers must strike a balance between accepting the limitations upon romance imposed by a society that was ruled by a complex web of social, political, and legal restrictions and rejecting or at least tactfully ignoring those restrictions and thus incurring the wrath of an outraged society that does not easily suffer its laws flouted. In her later novels, Austen implies that wit may be a leavening agent (as in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) that may succeed where pure sense comes up short or raw emotion may be used (as in PERSUASION) for the same purpose.Unlike in her later novels, Austen divides her heroine into two psychologically different young women. There is Elinor Dashwood, who possesses sense in abundance, and then there is her sister Marianne, who cultivates sensibility. In the context of 18th century English genteel society \\"sense\\" refers not to what we would call today as common sense but the unspoken assumption that single women realize that they do not live in a cultural vacuum. The rules concerning the legal distribution of inherited property, the social rules concerning who may dance with whom at approved balls, and the need to marry \\"upward\\" all interlocked to place a velvet-gloved bear hug on women who had some very real and serious decisions to make concerning marriage if they did not want to end up as the next generation's spinster aunt. There is Marianne Dashwood, who is more than willing to make such daunting choices not based on the sense that guides her sister but on the trashy and sensational pulp romance novels of the day. Where Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, a man of honor, if not of the hidden type, she makes her choice based on premises of which society could approve. Where Marianne has an infatuation with the roguish John Willoughby, a man with clear character flaws, she makes her choice based on her own artificially heightened sensibility of dime-store romance books. The basic thrust of the novel is that both sisters slowly and painfully grow to accept that a life based solely on the one or the other philosophy is unworkable. Austen implies that there is a golden middle, albeit one which probably is more closely allied to sense than to sensibility.In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen limits her view of the often convoluted knots of human relationships into a deceptively smooth and flattened perspective in a manner that would slowly change in her later books to include a more realistic, if not more necessarily complex vision that would allow women and men to interact in a forthright way of which even an entrenched society might approve. Though SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Austen's most popular book, it clearly shows in a restricted way the limits that her culture placed on the rights of women to call their own shots."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a book that describes the adventures of falling in love in the 19th century. Love back then wasn't as simple a thing as falling in love today is. Women and men had to abide by the rules their society presented- marrying based on money and status- as the main characters of this book had to do.The book follows sisters Elinor Dashwood, a sensible young woman who does not let her emotions rule her behavior, and Marianne Dashwood, a person who exaggerates and acts on her many emotions constantly. Their journey starts off when their father dies and they are forced to move out to the country to live on a very small allowance. At their new home, they meet a numerous amount of people who turn their life into a whirlwind. Willoughby, a suave and prominent young man, steals the attention of Marianne and an old love of Elinor's returns. Both of these relationships turn out differently than anyone can expect, through many twists and turns.This is a wonderful book that holds your attention through the end. The beginning pages that describe different relations, deaths, and monetary concerns were difficult to follow, as well as some of the different situations throughout the book. But Jane Austins ability to portray the hardships, and results, that both of these sisters had to endure, through different situations of love in the unruly 19th century, was without compare."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"If you are not interested in 19th century society and the roles of women, this story is not for you. The plot is excellent, with many unexpected twists and turns, but the way in which Austen goes about presenting this dramatic story is occasionally hard to follow. Although her descriptions of society in the 19th century are very interesting, they are different than society today, so they are sometimes difficult to understand.Austen presents the roles of women in 19th century society in a new and interesting way. In her book, women were expected to stay at home with the children, and they were not even offered the option of working out of the home. The women in the novel longed only to fall in love, get married, and have children. If they did not get married, they employed themselves in matching younger women with eligible men.The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward, but hardly shows it, while Marianne falls in love with Willoughby and, through her actions, announces it to the town. Both eventually reach a happy medium where Elinor learns that, in order to win Edward, she has to show her emotions more. Marianne, on the other hand, realizes that she needs to be a little more reserved with her emotions.Overall this is a very interesting book though the language is sometimes hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Perhaps the negatives of Jane Austen is the dated quality of the words she used. But, when one accompanies reading with a dictionary, she becomes a thoroughly charming author. I read Jane Austen first in the 8th grade, and found it difficult to follow, and difficult to understand the humor. After the 10th grade, a student gave a lecture on Irony and Seven Common Uses as Seen in Jane Austen's Three Most Famous Novels. After hearing this, I came to a new appreciation. Not light reading, it is the type of book that can be read over and over, and enjoyed more as the years go by. I finished it for the fourth time three days ago, and still find myself dreaming, writing, and even speaking in the cautious and conscious turn of phrase that Jane Austen can so well suspend. While not a book for a younger generation, it is definitely the kind of book that should and will be read. Not, however, as sintilating as her future novels, and not as humorous as Emma or Pride and Prejudice. A good starting point to get into reading British Literature."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty. Nevertheless, even though it is not Austen's best written work, it is still a very amiable novel and a nice light read for any classics buff."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I was pretty dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because I had already read Pride and Prejudice and loved it so much that when I read S&amp;S I found it rather long and un-eventful.

Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book I've ever read, it's witty, smart and enjoyable and it's heroin Elizabeth is someone that everyone can releate to whereas Ellinor is quite pompous and boring. I wish S&amp;S had more of a storyline like the other Jane Austen books because I truly love her books but having said that S&amp;S is still a very good book and I'd recomend it for all Jane Austen fans.

I relish the gems they each contain in their own right."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have seen several productions of Sense and Sensibility on DVD which were all good. I decided I wanted to read the book to get the real version. I was not disappointed. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books. I wish she had lived longer so she could have written more. She was an amazing author."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Two sisters have come of marrying age. One loves rashly and deeply, the other cautiously and with no little reserve - the sense and the sensibility. The contrast set up, Jane Austen takes the two young women through nearly the same set of events. Through love's introduction, intervening conflict and ultimate disappointment, we observe the impacts and the results of these two disparate manners of dealing with the opposite sex. This being a Jane Austen comedy, don't be surprised if things work out for someone in the end.While obviously very well written and full of interesting characters and insights, this, like most of Jane Austen's work, simply \\"doesn't do it for me.\\" Certainly Ms. Austen is not without her modern relevance, but many of the important ideas running through her novels, including this one, are foreign and even offensive. For example, her casual indifference toward the unmoneyed, her obvious belief in the natural limitations of the female sex and the importance she sets on formality set my teeth a-grinding. She writes, as they say, of a different time. Similarly, her writing style is often, including in this book, tedious and opaque. Economy of words and clarity are not so important as obeisance to formality and avoidance of perceived impropriety. As I said, writing of a different time. As one can likely see, my complaints about Jane Austen are more due to my own predilections than any shortcomings of the famed authoress.That said, I do believe that reading this book is good for a person - it will make you more informed and provide material worth thinking on. Several of the characters will stick with you. Ms. Austen has a way of making her characters very distinct despite the smallness of her authorial world. The characters are not Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but the Dashwood girls are worth remembering. Furthermore, the major themes, while not \\"big ideas\\" are relevant to most everyone and persuasively resolved. Sense and sensibility was for me, however, less enjoyable reading than I would prefer. The plot line moved slowly, the ideas seemed dated and the language obscured rather than revealed."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet.

If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is not as interesting or engrossing a book as Austen's later works; some of the characters are boring, the plot is not especially interesting, nor is the ending altogther satisfying (Marianne and Colonel Brandon are surely one of the oddest of odd couples). But it's a very good book, promising much better to come, a promise which was abundantly fulfilled in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Marianne's histrionics drove me up the wall. It took a while for me to realize that Marianne is meant as a caricature; that Austen thinks her as ridiculous as she appears to the reader. Witness Marianne's rhapsodizing about the fallen leaves at Norwood and Elinor cutting her short with her observation that &quot;not everybody shares your passion for dead leaves.&quot; Elinor is the more sympathetic and likeable of the two sisters and Austen clearly identifies with her; Elinor's calm, rational sense and balance promises much better for happiness than Marianne's overblown romanticism. We can see in this first book the emergence of an awesomely talented writer."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"In recent weeks my wife in rapid succesion read this book and Pride and Prejudice and then ran out to the store on a Sunday evening to pick up Mansfield Park. What a disappointment. I hit the wall about p. 20 and could never find a way to get involved. The characters were uninteresting and the situations dull, and I had to force my way to the end. I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen? Should I have tried anoter title -- Pride and Prejudice, say?"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"There is no greater author than Jane Austin. Some may disagree, as is their right, but I will NEVER agree with them. I love her. LOVE, isn't a strong enough word. And, this book is on my TOP FIVE favs. of all time. The story of these sisters is timeless and the struggle for independance while still searching for love, could have been written today. Jane Austin was SO ahead of her time. Elinor and Maryann's relationship is so endearing and the heartbreak you feel for them is all consumming. You won't be able to put down this novel until you are satisfied that this wonderful and amazing women will be content in their respective lives.

No doubt about it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have read 5 of Jane Austen's 6 novels (all but Mansfield Park) and Sense and Sensibility is without a doubt the best of them all. For those of you who were disappointed that it did not match up to Pride and Prejudice, I assure you, it did, and then rose far above it. My English teacher in 6th grade always talked about Sense and Sensibility and how much she loved it. After I read Pride and Prejudice, my first Austen experience, I knew that I had to read that novel. As a warning for you as well, do NOT watch the movie with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet before you read the book. I did that and then I was totally thrown off by the book. Now, it is a great adaptation of the novel, but they mix up the scenes and so I found myself constantly confused because I did not meet Lucy Steele until much later than I thought I would. The movie introduces her much sooner. Another recommendation: if you want to see Jane Austen at her best, read Emma. (My second favorite) Persuasion and Northanger Abbey are good, but nothing like those two."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I was only 11 when I saw the movie.

The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me. Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in. She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such. Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book. My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I don't see why this book is rated so high among readers. I would say it's average at best. I read both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice in the last week. If you have time for only one of them, read Pride and Prejudice, it's much better. In Sense and Sensibility it doesn't seem like you get to know the characters as well as in Pride. The novel seems to drag along for way to long before anything happens in the last few pages. I know the novel has a lot to do with people trying to marry rich, but the focus on money seems to be more prevalent in Sense than in Pride. It's a decent book, but there are others I would rather pick up."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I absolutely love this book.

I have been a fan of Austen's since I read the first page of Pride and Prejudice. I currently own all of her published works, some having been replaced a couple of times due to wear. Since my latest copy of Sense and Sensibility bit the dust a month or so ago, I was thrilled to get Bethany House's copy in the mail this week.In terms of the actual novel, no changes have been made to Austen's original work. The novel is printed in all its glory with my favorite characters and places still in tact. What has been added by several of Bethany House's writers are notes and annotations about the life and times of Austen.The book comes complete with a key, which indicates the type of note/annotation being applied in each instance. The notes fall into the following categories: \\"historical and cultural details [...] from England in the early 1800's,\\" \\"fact and tidbits from Austen's life,\\" \\"references to S&S; in today's culture, particularly in film,\\" \\"unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters,\\" \\"themes of faith drawn from the novel or Austen's life,\\" \\"comments and asides on the book's characters or plot,\\" and \\"the parts of the novel that just make us smile.\\"I LOVE the additional comments, quips, and bits added to Austen's work. They serve to add the insight intended into a world of ladies and gentlemen. The authors who have offered their take on Austen's work compliment the novel by adding interesting references and inserting a little comedy into one of the best loved novels of all time.On the minus side (if you can really call it that), the novel did take more time to read. I found myself reading a page, seeing the notations, and reading the page again to see if the added information changed the image I create in my head of Austen's world. In most instances, it certainly did! It did make the reading more cumbersome at some points, but overall I really enjoyed this take on one of the best loved works of literature. I plan to order the Insight Edition of Pride and Prejudice and look forward to many more such editions.This book was provided free of charge by the publisher as a review copy.

My love for anything and everything Victorian has helped me embrace this novel set in the Regency Period, and so, naturally I fell in love with this timeless piece. This story of the very different Dashwood sisters and their clashing tastes in their choices of men to love, was endearing as well as very frustrating at times. Just when I thought the obvious about Colonel Brandon, Edward or Willoughby- the story took a different turn just to add to the intrigue of it all; classic Austen at its best.The story revolves around love-sickness, love-triangles, a marriage of convenience, age and love, differences of choices and opinions, wealth and social status, influence, family conflict, secret-filled pasts and ultimately...and appropriately so: sense and sensibility. I'm still not sure which of the sisters I concurred with the most; Elinor or Marianne... Austen brilliantly shifts us from one perception to the other while embracing both depending on the situation. Ultimately the girls' reconciliation and love for eachother blends the disparities of state helping them come to terms with their own serenity. Love can then be found and accepted under a new light.Sense and Sensibility is a light read embedded with deeper meaning that brings comfort, peaks interest and offers a colourful variety of figures (the comical busy-body Miss Jennings is indeed very special!) On the whole, this read meshed excitement, passion, drama as well as \`sagesse' in the lives of two otherwise very ordinary ladies of the times. The book doesn't skip a beat with essential meanings and turn of events within every paragraph- With this one, you won't want to blink:)One can never get enough of elegantly written suspense-filled love twists and pangs. At least I can't- Loved it!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Being a Patrick O'Brian fan and knowing he was an admirer of Jane Austen, I gave her a try a few years ago with Pride and Prejudice and found it stunningly good and unforgettable. Sense and Sensibility is my second Austen novel and I hoped for an equally good performance. I would not have had the patience to get very far with Jane Austen earlier in my life. Austen can be stilted, wordy (to say the least), obtuse and just plain difficult to read and understand. She also leaves a lot to the imagination which although frustrating, actually adds depth and emotion. There is also a keen, many-layered understanding of people at their best, worst, and various shades of in- between, along with the associated foibles. Sense and Sensibility is a great story that, at times, had me rushing through many chapters to see the end result. For example, Marianne's encounter with Willoughby in London would make my top ten of dramatic literary scenes (if I were to ever compile such a list). As Sense and Sensibility neared its end, I hoped for and expected the sort of satisfying, happy, and witty ending I enjoyed in Pride and Prejudice, but found an unsatisfying, matter of fact (but perhaps realistic) anti-climax instead. I feel like I am defacing something sacred, but I have to give Sense and Sensibility only 4 stars. It is well worth the time, but if one is to pick their first Jane Austen book, based on my limited experience, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Next on my list is Emma."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This book arrived very quickly and is just what I am looking for. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"After finally getting round to reading the books that launched my top three period film loves (P&P;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), S&S;Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition), and best of all PersuasionPersuasion), it was fascinating to note what Emma Thompson did and did not use in her screenplay of S&S.;As to the novel itself-most surprising and gratifying was the biting satire, wit and sarcasm in Miss Austen's writing. Her carefully veiled views on \\"society\\" good and bad will stand as a historical and societal timeline into the era. A woman's place, or lack thereof, is keenly felt, as is the feeling of helplessness of women with the unfortunate prospect of being born without means. As well as what some women gave up to secure \\"a good match\\". Knowing Miss Austen's own background, the reader doesn't have to wonder how much of her own life was catalyst for her social commentary dished up in the beguiling text of romance.4 stars-recommended."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"A wonderful Jane Austen book.

Great choice! Jane Austen's first published novel (1811) can get lost in the limelight of her other \`darling child', PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but is well worth the effort. There are many editions available in print today, and the text can stand on its own, but for those seeking a \`friendlier' version with notes and appendixes, the question arises of how much supplemental material do you need, and is it helpful?One option is the Oxford World's Classics new revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that presents an interesting array of additional material that comfortably falls somewhere between just the text, and supplemental overload. This volume offers what I feel a good edition should be, an expansive introduction and detailed notes supporting the text in a clear, concise and friendly manner that the average reader can understand and enjoy.The material opens with a one paragraph biography of the life of Jane Austen which seemed rather slim to this Austen enthusiast's sensibility, and most certainly too short for a neophyte. The introduction quickly made up for it in both size and content at a whopping 33 pages! Wow, author Margaret Anne Doody does not disappoint, and it is easy to understand why after eighteen years publishers continue to use her excellent essay in subsequent editions.Amazingly, the introduction is not at all dated. The material covered is accessible to any era of reader, touching upon the novels publishing history, plot line, character analysis, and historical context. Doody thoughtfully presents the reader with an analysis of the major themes in the novel such as; the dichotomy of sense and sensibility as it relates to the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, the portrayal of negligent mothers, men represented as the ultimate hunter, secrecy, deceit and concealment, and the crippling impact of the inheritance laws and primogeniture on women during the Regency era. Interlaced with Doody's interpretations are her astute observations of Austen's writing style with references to pages in the novel and outside sources. The entire essay is well researched, populated with footnotes, and an enjoyable complement to the text.The notes on the text explain the editorial trail since the novel's first publication in 1811, whose subtle changes and their significance might baffle the nonscholars! Moody. The select bibliography is indeed select, and includes many editions that deserve recognition as the best of what is available in print on Jane Austen's life, works and critical analysis. One of my favorites listed is JANE AUSTEN: A FAMILY RECORD (1913) by William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, revised and enlarged by Deirdre Le Faye (1989). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a category including film versions and commentaries which is often overlooked by other publishers.The chronology of Jane Austen's life lists both significant events and what transpired historically in matching columns. The choices are relevant and interesting with the exception of two events that this writer found humorous; - 1795 Jane Austen flirts with Tom Lefroy, and in 1815 Humphry Davy invents miner's safety lamp. I have yet to be convinced that Austen's flirtation with Tom Lefroy had a significant impact on her life, nor am I clear how a clergyman's daughter living in southern England would be directly affected by the invention of a miner's safety lamp. Just thinking out loud here!The two appendixes on rank and social status, and the intricacies of country dance touched upon both subjects clearly, but briefly, using stories from Jane Austen's life to put the era in context. I appreciated the humorous example of how young women attending balls and assemblies were accompanied by chaperones, usually a mother or an older woman, who were expected to pass the time with cards or socializing rather than dancing themselves. In a letter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny! Even though each of these appendixes is short, they do offer a list of books to explore further reading, which I was inspired to investigate.Since contemporary novels do cease to be contemporary the day that they are published, growing even more distant with each generation, notes can become indispensible to the enjoyment of the modern reader. Prof. Claire Lamont has supplied excellent and insightful explanatory notes, allowing for instant gratification with detailed descriptions of language usage, social and historical context, and character and plot insights. I found this the most interesting aspect of this edition, and reading the explanatory notes alone was like reading a condensed dictionary to Jane Austen, her times, and the plot and characters in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY.In short, Oxford World's Classics has pulled together just the right amount of supplemental material from reputable and readable sources for their revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILTY. I found very little wanting in this edition, and recommend it to first time readers, or veterans seeking new insights.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I ordered this version of P & P as I wanted a hard back to add to my few other hard back Jane A.'s novels.

I love S&amp;S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word. Ms. Badel and Maureen O'Brien are the best readers I've encountered yet."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is a superb reading by Sarah Badel. I can find nothing to carp about; she scans the language with such assurance and close attention to the meaning that she shows up the deficiencies in almost every other Austen reading known to me. In most cases these readers brush over and miss the point of Austen's remarks but Badel is so clearcut and precise she consistently illuminates the writing rather than obscuring it as so many others do.It may however be a little understated for some listeners. She is rarely overtly dramatic but then neither is Austen. I think Sarah Badel tracks the author's lightly satirical voice almost perfectly but if you prefer a more animated reading you might try some alternative versions."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"In these days of rampant incivility, when we know far too much about each other, I find it relaxing to escape to the early 19th century and immerse myself in Jane Austen's world.

Instead, I'll celebrate the courteous manners and the formality of even close relationships.The Dashwood sisters are in a difficult position: their father had two families, the first of which produced a son who inherits all his property, and the second of which produced three daughters who are not entitled to any specific amount -- only what the half-brother (and his greedy wife) thinks is fair. So the girls must find husbands who can support them. Austen's skill is that she can deal with these economic uncertainties and class expectations in many of her novels without being repetitious. Everyone knows the rules of the game, and when impulsive, emotional Marianne goes off the deep end, we are all caught up in the fallout of her disappointment. Elinor has a different disposition and an equally complex set of problems that she must face, albeit alone.The great thing about this audio book, and others in the Naxos series, is that it is read by Juliette Stevenson, who does a wonderful job. Her voices are consistent and her trained (and natural) accent is perfect for Jane Austen. Whether I'm in the car or hunched over a sewing project, an audio book is a perfect companion."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Though not considered to be her best work, Austen's Sense and Sensibility is definitely my favorite. The novel tells the tale of two sisters: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Having been left nearly penniless after the death of their father, the Dashwood family moves to a small cottage in the country. Elinor, the more sensible of the two sisters, is concerned with keeping up appearances and not letting her feelings for the object of her affections, Edwards Ferrars, be known. Marianne on the other hand, is the more flighty of the two. She wears her heart on her sleeve, a heart that beats for the charming and alluring Mr. Willoughby. The two sisters struggle with their own love affairs and their social standing in what I would call Austen's finest work.I know I go against the majority when I say I prefer this novel to Pride and Prejudice, but I do. Elinor and Marianne are much softer, more endearing characters than the Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. While the plots are similar, I would say that Sense and Sensibility reveals more about the main characters - their emotions, thoughts, etc. - than Pride and Prejudice does with its main characters.Either way, I adore this novel. If you have never read Austen, I definitely recommend starting with Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Most people who have read Jane Austen will have read Pride and Prejudice. With a title like Sense and Sensibility, most readers will assume that the two books can be interpreted and enjoyed in the same way. Other than having three word titles that employ alliteration in the first and third words, the two novels are more different than similar.While Pride and Prejudice is primarily about miscommunication, Sense and Sensibility is about the maturation of two sisters as they find themselves confronted by adversity. The former topic allows Ms. Austen more room to roam, but within the later topic she has plenty of opportunities to display her story telling and comic talents. While maturation is an important sub theme in Pride and Prejudice, you see maturation better developed in Sense and Sensibility.When their father dies, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret find themselves in exile from their family home with their mother. The family estate had been left to their half brother whom their father exhorted to take care of them. But that promise is soon diluted into doing almost nothing through the selfishness of his wife and his vacillation. A relative kindly offers them a country cottage near his home and takes obvious pleasure in their company.At this modest new home, Elinor found herself entertaining the welcome attentions of Edward Ferrars. Elinor's younger sister, Marianne, is all aflutter over John Willoughby who seems to be committed to her. In fact, everyone assumes that there will soon be wedding bells for Marianne and Willoughby.All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways.In vintage Jane Austen style, all bets are off near the end of the book as characters take unexpected steps that open up new possibilities. There's no one quite like Jane Austen for pulling great twists in her romantic comedies. These twists will cause your jaw to drop.Try not to compare this book to Pride and Prejudice. It's clearly a lesser work, but one that can certainly be enjoyed in its own right."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's 1811 novel, her first published, \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" receives a grand treatment in this Broadview Literary Texts edition, edited by Kathleen James-Cavan. Anyone who knows me knows how I doat on Jane Austen, and for the first time reading her in a Broadview edition, I find myself doating excessively. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first public exposure of Austen's masterful characterization, plotting, and satire to reach the reading public of the Romantic Era. Austen thrives on what I like to call 'the middle of the book,' writing the situations that complicate the lives of her characters, better than almost anyone - almost, it seems, preferring getting her characters and readers in a position to learn from their mistakes, than actually getting them out.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" begins with the illogic of early 19th century British inheritance law. The hereditary owner of Norland Park is on his deathbed, and invites the heirs of his estate, the Dashwood family, to reside at Norland. The Dashwood's and their three daughters come to live there, but are put into jeopardy soon after by the demise of both Mr. Dashwoods - bringing the next male heir (and the girls' half-brother), John Dashwood and his manipulative wife, Fanny to Norland. Greedy as they are, John and his wife soon drive their half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, along with their mother, out of Norland, Sussex, to the Devonshire countryside. Here in Devonshire, in a small cottage, and at a considerably reduced income, the Dashwood sisters and their mother struggle to rebuild their life, while the two eldest daughters, Elinor, 19, and Marianne, 17, try to deal with life and love in the English countryside.Like the well-known \\"Pride (Darcy) and Prejudice (Bennet),\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"s title can be seen to refer to the character traits that mark its two principle characters - Sense on the side of the Enlightenment-influenced, almost certainly emotionally-repressed Elinor, and the overfine Sensibility of Marianne, a great admirer of dead leaves and the dirty ground. As opposed to the former novel, Austen does not really disparage either, except when carried to excess, as each young woman does, instead seeking, as was popular during the period, to reconcile, or strike a balance between rational logic and emotional response. In their love affairs, Elinor's with a distant cousin, the diffident and somewhat mysterious 24-year old Edward Ferrars, and Marianne's with a younger, and very handsome rogue John Willoughby, the young ladies' moral, social, and aesthetic principles are put to the test. While Elinor and Marianne are two of the most cultured, educated, and refined characters in the novel, and while Austen certainly privileges the country over the London metropolis, she makes clear that the ladies' limited interaction with society at large leaves them in a kind of sheltered ignorance which they must come to terms with, both for their sakes and for the sake of their lovers.Austen always does a great job with her minor characters, especially those who serve in comic relief roles - or as the butts of her satire, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no different. In their avarice and greed, John and Fanny Dashwood are the epitome of wholly uncultured social climbers and mindless landowners. In her less than refined, but wholly maternal attitudes toward the Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings (mother of the neglected, but ever cheerful wife Charlotte Palmer and the reticent to a fault Lady Middleton) is as amusing a character, and as warm a mother as one will find in Austen. Colonel Brandon is a fit counterpart to Mrs. Jennings, in his reserved melancholy, while caring just as much about those around him as Mrs. Jennings. The comic pairings of Mr. Palmer and Sir John Middleton with their wives is absolute genius, both being the mirror opposite in style and attitude to their wives - and in particular the relationship between the Palmers, including the continual laughing of Charlotte at the fact that Mr. Palmer \\"never listens to me\\" and \\"never tells me anything,\\" is both highly entertaining, and at the same time, one of the most troubling relationships in the novel.I've praised James-Cavan's handling of this Broadview edition, and now may be a good time to say some more on that head. Broadview and its editors, like the people who put together the Norton Critical Editions, concern themselves with really presenting literary texts in a solid foundation of cultural, theoretical, and critical contexts. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" contains a real treasure trove of such material - the two contemporary reviews of Austen's novel from 1812, generous selections of essays from the late 1700's and early 1800's on contemporary debates on the meanings of the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility,\\" and on the cult of sensibility and the picturesque. Also included are exerpts from poems referenced by Marianne throughout the novel, illustrations of the vehicles they travel in, and a map of the character's London residences. James-Cavan's excellent introduction also lays out the novel's issues in their contemporary, cultural, critical, and theoretical contexts, none more obtrusive than any other, and all quite helpful. Altogether, the Broadview \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a tremendous edition for Austen scholars and casual Janeites alike."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners.Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I confess I own many editions of Jane Austen's works [individual and collected sets]. These Barnes and Noble editions are true value for money - in this instance, Sense and Sensibility is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Sense and Sensibility, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I went into this without expecting much but was soon surprised by how engrossed I became in this classic! This is essentially the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are different in temperamentbut experience similar disappointments in romance. It's interesting to see the contrast in their personalities in deealing with their heartbreaks. Prudent Elinor puts up a strong front, confiding in no one and worrying no one while Marianne becomes the very picture of wretchedness.It started off slowly but once you get into the main plot it's hard to put this one down! You hope for each of the sisters to achieve happiness in love, you smile at Austen's wit in observing the upper social strata, you condemn those who are against the sisters and their family and you eagerly read on for each new development. And, of course, there's the lovable supporting cast of characters who at first are viewed as obnoxious but become dear friends in light of true folly from others. And let me just leave off by saying that I loved Mrs. Jennings from the start ;)."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Can you imagine a world where there was nothing to do but walk and talk? In the historical fiction novel Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen it proves that a story can be more interesting than what it appears to be. One character represents sense (Elinor) and the other represents sensibility (Marianne). The story which takes place in the early 1800's when two teenage girls who move to the country with their mother and sister to live on their cousin's estate. While there, the two girls enter into several relationships. Some will last and others will not. Marianne meets the \\"dashing\\" Willoughby and they soon fall in love, but when Willoughby goes to London things take a turn for the worst. \\"Old\\" Colonel Brandon soon expresses his love for Marianne which complicates things even more. Elinor becomes close with Edward Ferrars (their sister-in law's brother) and eventually makes it clear she has fallen for him, but when Lucy Steel tells Elinor a big secret her feelings are forced to change.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic, comical novel. This book is suitable for anyone about 12 and up. Overall, I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility. I thought that it was a story that was fairly easy to grasp and it taught me a few things about life back in that day. Very few really learn what these people went through. For us, playing piano, playing cards, writing, taking walks, and visiting may not sound that ideal. This is because we are exposed to so many more interesting things, but you learn a lot from seeing the way the girls coped with having a much simpler life. My only complaint about this book was that since it was written so long ago, some of the language is difficult to comprehend. I would rate these book 4 stars out of 5.

It is called the Insight Edition. It was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this book for I had never read it before. I had only watched the movies which lent me great enjoyment. I knew, having read other Austin classics that the novel would be much better than the movies, and Jane (and her story) proved to be a most amiable companion.What sets this edition apart from any other, except Pride and Prejudice, is the wealth of added information from a Regency historical aspect, tidbits of opinion which evidenced delightful humor, and movie trivia. I even learned there was a S&S; under the sea movie which I had heretofore never heard.Astoundingly, I was somewhat surprised at myself because I truly enjoyed someone else's pain and agony for a change of pace. For fully 30 chapters, Marianne was just as full of passion and sensibility at Willoughby's disgraceful treatment of her as any movie depicted. Elinor was just as full of suppressed passion and sense as the movies depicted her, and of course Mrs. Dashwood was so much more sensible than Mrs. Benton of P&P; fame, which made for quite satisfying reading without the frustration of stupidity.If you do not have a copy of Sense and Sensibility for your library, I suggest you pick up this copy.

Several of the comments made me laugh out loud! (Though I wonder if Jane Austen would appreciate the humor in it!)

Austen's greatness lies in her backing out of the box of 19th-century literary moralism and seeing the areas of gray in human relationships and within the individual. Over and over again in this \\"early\\" work (Austen was only 41 when she died) we see characters acting in unexpected ways, even while social strictures are so much in evidence. The most outstanding characters are those who go against the social grain, and Austen unfailingly creates classic foils against whom these interesting individuals can stand out. Entertaining, existing in a stable social world, clever, and funny, this novel is like \\"comfort food.\\" If you're in the mood for a diverting stroll into another century, let this book be your guide.

At every moment of the book vanity is criticized, from its opening to its ending. Many of the characters, even if not actively participating in the story, are vain as they can be.In the very opening of the book, as Mr. Dashwood passes, there is the interference of Mrs John Dashwood , who, in the fear of losing part of her wealth ans status, has her husband, a weak character, reduce the pension that he had promised his dying father that he would provide to his half-sisters.When Edward Ferrars declines to wed Miss Morton, Mrs John Dashwood quickly sets a fit and expells his future sister-in-law from her house due to her disapproval to that engagement that is, in their views, less than favourable. Edward also falls victim to the rest of his family , who disconsiders him as a member of the family due to his choices.Willoughby is another example. In love with Marianne, he chooses to marry a rich woman who will provide him of his extravagances (as he himself later admits) than to open his heart to true love. He is also an example of cruelty, for he leaves a young girl he had earlier seduced to her own luck.A last exaple will be Lucy Steele. Fearful of what might happen to her, she is secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars, but leaves him for his own brother who can provide her comfort in a better way.Although vanty is not exactly the theme of Sense and Sensibility , it is at every moment of the book criticized, and vanity in its own way supports the plot."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"It takes little time for the reader to become completely engrossed.

His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the classics. I just love this story. Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Though not as dazzling in wit as Pride and Prejudice or as passionate a love story as Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility gives the modern reader a true feeling of what it would be like to be a woman of limited means falling in love at a time when Romance was a matter of public discourse. In Regency England, many Britons hailed Samuel Johnson, Isaac Newton, and philosophers of the Enlightenment as voices of reason and logic who relied on empirical data rather than religion or emotion to support their assertions. Perhaps as a reaction to this matter-of-fact and somewhat dry philosophy, there arose a movement called Romanticism which hailed instinct, spontaneity, and feelings over careful analysis. While ostensibly a novel about two sisters' journey to love, Sense and Sensibility is also an extended metaphor comparing the competing intellectual philosophies of Reason and Romance.The title Sense and Sensibility is confusing to many modern readers due to the words' virtually identical meanings in today's vernacular; however, in Regency England, \`sense' was synonymous with 'logic' while \`sensibility' meant something more along the lines of \`sympathy.' In the case of the novel, Elinor Dashwood is a woman of sense whose attitudes toward love are so rational that they leave the reader (and her sister Marianne) wondering if she is capable of falling in love at all. Marianne, by contrast, is so in love with the idea of love (as sensationally depicted in literature and the arts) that she is quite literally swept off her feet without understanding the character of the object of her affection. As the story progresses, Elinor and Marianne must deal with the not always pleasant consequences of their very different approaches to love.Although the novel focuses on the two sisters, Austen supplies the reader with plenty of entertaining supporting characters. While Fanny's calculating manipulation of her husband John Dashwood results in the impoverishment of the Dashwood girls, it also provides the reader with an entertaining twist on the classic stereotypes of the evil sister-in-law and the henpecked husband. Likewise, Mrs. Jenkins' always uncomfortable references to husband hunting make the reader squirm in her chair, even as Sir John Middleton's endless commenting on hounds elicits eye-rolling.The men of the novel do not disappoint, either. Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon all portray characteristics that make them worthy of the heroines' attentions, though they are quite the diverse crowd. The reader may even find her own attitudes towards love deepen and evolve as she reacts to the dashing Willoughby, steadfast Brandon, and thoughtful Edward.In sum, this novel is beautifully written and well worth reading at least once, if not several times."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about a family of women: Mrs. Dashwood, the mother, and Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, the three daughters, who are made to relocate as a result of their father's death. Their home is given to their gullible half-brother who means well and their manipulative sister-in-law who does not mean well at all. Settling in a cottage given to them by a generous distant relative in Devonshire, the girls experience romance and heartbreak.I've heard of Jane Austen's work before, and I read this as a prelude before I read Pride and Prejudice. I have to say, even though it was engaging towards the end, in the beginning I had trouble plowing through the introduction. There was nothing there to grasp my interest, only long, insipid descriptions of the surrounding countryside, and a long build-up to the main plot. About halfway through, when Marianne begins her romance with Willoughby, I actually found myself wanting to read the book and thinking with excitement and a feeling of suspense about what would happen next.The characters weren't perfect, with both flaws and redeeming qualities, such as Elinor, who is very intellectual and polite, but may be missing out on life because she's very reserved, and Marianne, who likes to live life to the fullest emotionally, but is completely devastated when bad things happen to her.I liked that it gave me a feel of what life was like for people in the moderate and upper end class in the early 1800's, as I'm used to stories such as Oliver Twist, where the main subject is life in the low slums, so it was nice to see the other end for a change. In regard to the storyline, it was very interesting in the latter part of the book, when its it is full of romantic betrayal and unseen engagements, and people turning up unexpectedly.This was a good introduction to Jane Austen's books, but based upon to the admiration she has received, I don't believe this is her best, and I'm ready to see what she can do in Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Not as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant.

Sense and Sensibility describes the trials and tribulations of the young Dashwoods who strive to keep their senses about them despite the dramatic flurry of relationships. There are a number of wonderfully entertaining characters, including Ms. Jennings with her loud squawking and gossiping, as well as the Steeles. And, of course, she neatly wraps up the ending as always.Jane Austen is simply brilliant in conveying the idea that indeed, sense and sensibility may not always guarantee happiness and certainly, neither can money and matches of material gain. More was gained than was lost- both knowledge and true happiness were the result of simply answering to the heart and not to the powers that be who called for marriage on the basis of dowry. The Dashwoods, for all their gentleness, sincerity, and society, certainly deserve all of the contentment and satisfaction which can be afforded to them.Anyone who is looking for a cozy book and craving some entertainment and emotional support from a relationship- this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"...It is a suggestion in the way that you read this book. I suggest attacking this piece of literary masterpiece in a three-pronged maneuver - through reading the book, listening to the audiobook and watching the film, as close to the same time as possible. I did it backwards and I wish I had staved off watching the film all the way through...I began my S&S; journey by discovering characters through Mamma Mia, of all places. The groom in the movie, Dominic Cooper, was intriguing to me, so I looked him up and guess who he turned out being? None other than Mr. John Willoughby himself. From there I was hooked on the youtube.com 2007 BBC version and HAD to read the book because I just knew there were holes in the story!The first few chapters of the book were hard to get through, but I had Willoughby's smouldering eyes to keep me going. I read a few chapters, then listened to the chapters over again. I found the audiobook for free on iTunes, under a section by Southern Florida University called Lit2Go. It helped IMMENSELY that the reader had an English accent because the colloquialisms came right through and there were many \\"aha!\\" moments.When I finished both, I bought the DVD of S&S; (BBC version) and I will be purchasing/renting the Kate Winslet version soon.

I'm not saying that it was not a good book. To be frank, it was one of the best book I've ever read. I guess the cause of this is because I've just read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice before this. Both are just as refreshing, but I must say, I did not enjoy this one as much as P&amp;P. For instance, not as much humour was injected into the story. And, now that I think of it, the story is not very much fast-moving. The story lacks of excitement and it drags in every scene. As in, there seems to be a lot of time spent in reading about a particular scene where nothing much actually happened. All in all, this book did not make me read it for a second time.

For me, Sense and Sensibility is another classic and classy example of this master at work. While not as complex to read as something like Shakespeare, the formal language and speech of the nineteenth century is more subtle and difficult for many modern readers, it's not a fluffy beach book. I think it does the modern-day reader good to read a story that requires one to slow down and savor the words and the subtleties of interactions as well written by a great author. This is your chance.Read the book and then watch a movie version- such as the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.

This is a shame, because the format is quite attractive and the print size is very good. I wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher, but received no reply."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was first published in 1811, although it appears that Jane Austen had worked on various versions of the novel since the 1790's. It is less polished than the later, classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it contains all the familiar elements we expect and enjoy in an Jane Austen novel.The novel is built around the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose contrasting styles are the \\"sense and sensibility\\" of the title. Elinor is the elder sister, patient, considerate and practical. Marianne, on the other hand, knows no halfway love of anything in life.As the story opens, their father has just died, leaving the family estate to his son by a first marriage and his second wife and three daughters in near destitution. The widow and three daughters move to a small cottage on the estate of a distant kinsman in Devonshire. Elinor leaves behind the cherished Mr. Edward Ferres, a shy but loyal and seemingly compatible friend, who has however strangely not offered marriage to Elinor. The beautiful Marianne attracts two suitors soon after their arrival in Devonshire, the older, sober and respectable Colonel Brandon, and the young, handsome, and charming Mr. Willoughby. Willoughby wins Marianne's heart, and an engagement is expected momentarily.To Marianne's immense disappointment, Willoughby unexpectedly departs for London without proposing. The two sisters are persuaded to travel with an aunt to London to take part in the social scene. In London, the sisters will learn shocking news about their respect suitors, and each will learn to cope with the help of the other. The journey back to Devonshire will set the stage for dramatic developments for Elinor and Marianne.Austen's sense of dialogue and ability to set up scenes staging are less acute in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" than in later novels, but she makes up for it by a more emotional approach to the characters and some savage if indirect commentary on the social customs of the day. Those readers whose introduction to the story is the excellent 1995 movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will find a longer, more subtle, and complex story in Austen's novel. This novel is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about the Dashwood girls Elinor and Marianne.The time is the Napoleonic years of the nineteenth century though nothing so sordid as the little Corporal's baleful visage will appear in this novel of domestic romance. The girls are forced to leave their home following the death of their father. The estate they live at is invaded by their dullard half brother John and his insufferable wife. The two girls, their mother and younger sister Margaret are off to the West of England to live at Barton Cottage being supported by John the brother.In this novel Miss Jane Austen tells two convoluted love stories. Elinor who is the oldest and most sensible of the girls is in love with Edward Farrars. Farrars is an Oxford man who eventually goes into the ministry. He has been involved in a longterm engagement to the odious but ambitious Lucy Steele. Elinor is heartbroken at this lost love but keeps her stiff upper lip in order to minister to the needs of her younger and more emotional sister Marianne.Marianne is in love with the rake Willoughby who has had a torrid affair with Eliza Williams. He jilts Marianne but lives to rue his rejection of her.As in all Austen novels all is resolved with a wedding. Elinor will eventually wed Edward Farrars and live in a parsonage. Her sister Marianne will become Mrs. Brandon as she weds an older and wiser manColonel Brandon.Along the way we meet the lovable Mrs. Jennings, the fautous Steele sisters and Robert Ferrars the stupid brother of Edward Ferrars. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer are also satirically viewed as a dull married couple living in luxury.It amazes me that no one in a Jane Austen novel really works! As Emma Thompson who directed the film \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" quipped one wonders why these women don't go out and get a job! In an Austen novel there are the inevitable long walks and conversations, mixed romantic signals with mixups aplenty and the occasional dance across the ballroom floor.Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations. She is a great artist with a very narrow focus; a few middle class families living in the country with a love story to be told. Within this baliwick she is peerless, witty and wise. She brings a few hours of quiet where the only sound heard is a bird singing or a carriage rumbling up to the house.Sense and Sensibility published in 1811 is a classic of English literature. Jane Austen is unsurpassed in the realm of Regency romance!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have recently read the novel Sense and Sensibility for an English class project.

I wasn't used to reading books that were written many years ago in that type of writing so it took me some time to understand some things.I love to read love stories and dream about how my life will turn out. Jane Austen did a good job of writing this love story. I think it was so sweet how Colonel Brandon loved Marianne since the moment he met her and in the end, they were together. I was also very happy about Edward and Elinor that they loved each other and another engagement was about to keep them from ever being together but thankfully things worked out.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a great reader or used to Jane Austen's writing.

So its very easy, when you are dealing with a masterpiece, to lean on clich&eacute;s to describe a work.But I don't want to do that. I will, however, tell you that for young romantics who believe in Mr. Right and long walks on the beach, this novel takes you through the breathtaking ride of falling, captively, into love and falling, quite willfully, out. Also, you vicariously experience the emotional stupor of coming out on the other side of such a relationship exhausted...and wiser. Also, if you're like me, you can wrestle with the tale of a woman who believes in the security of decisiveness. Her conflict is how to be sensible in an insensible world, and then, finally, how to reconcile the whimsicleness in herself. Where does the mind retreat and the heart take over? \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" lastly is a tale for sisters. A truly unique relationship, Jane Austen captures the complexity of sisters--persons, peers even, that are equipped with the same tools in life but that often are very different.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Juliet Stevenson is a great narrator she is able to give each of her characters a distinct voice and her intonations are perfect.

It was fun to have the addition of the illustrations as well. They added to the book for me."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"All together, I thought that this book was very good. In classic Jane Austen style, this was a story that followed two sisters through love, heartbreak, and confusion. The story as a whole is very relatable for women everywhere: the classic paths of love that was meant to be, love that could never be, or unrequited love are all followed by the main characters, Elinor and Marianne. Another great aspect of this book was all of the twists and turns; you never knew who was telling the truth or what would happen next, which made it a very fun read. One of the only flaws of this book was that some sections didn't seem to have anything important in them, which made it boring. But when the story got back on track, it kept you \\"hooked.\\"I recommend that readers that want to read this book should read Pride and Prejudice beforehand. This way you will become familiar with Jane Austen through, in my opinion, her best book.So, if you are looking for a fun, but unexpected love story, Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility would be a very good choice."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is an excellent book. When I started it I really did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. I will say though that this book is hard to get through at times, due to the old language used. But if you stay with the book, it will be worth it. The characters are wonderful, and you will find yourself wanting them to be happy. The Dashwood family gives a &quot;girl power&quot; message that makes it even easier to enjoy. Also, this book is easy to relate to, for everyone has known a Maryanne or Elinor before, maybe you are like one of them. I could identify with Maryanne, because I am involved in everything (and love it all) and I know I share my feelings too much. Although this book will be enjoyed more by young females, anyone would like it, for it also has a lot of humor in it used to display the dramatic situations the Dashwood sisters keep finding themselves in. The book became even more enjoyable when I saw the movie, seeing this amazing book acted out was great. I believe all of Jane Austen's books are worth reading, this one especially!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Boy meets girl, they hate each other at first sight, then fall in love. Only Jane Austen could take such a cliche and turn it in a beautiful story, romantic but not corny, witty, and evocative. Okay, the dialogue is somewhat difficult to follow, especially for those of us whose first language is not English (the first time I tried to read this book I just couldn't get past the first couple of pages), but once you get used to it, you instantly fall in love with the story and the writer. I have read most of Jane Austen's books, but this one remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is the story of the Dashwood sisters: the logical Elinor (sense) and the emotional Marianne (sensibility). I actually listened to this novel on audio, and the narrator was so good it was difficult to stop listening to get anything else done. Austen draws us into the world of Regency England, where women are looking for husbands, preferably rich ones, and men are looking for beauty, preferably accompanied by fortune. But there's more to this story than that. I found myself occasionally laughing aloud as the narrator read; some things that were amusing in 1811 actually still are. Jane Austen pokes fun at her characters, and many of their foibles are recognizable as things we would mock today. One example is the description of conceited young gentleman (many of the ladies refer to him as a \\"cockscomb\\") who is seen in a jewelry story arguing with a clerk over the kind of jewel-encrusted toothpick holder he needs to purchase. This is unquestionably one of the best books I've ever read; I highly recommend the audio narrated by Wanda McCaddon, who also uses the names Nadia May and Donada Peters."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"No one needs my naive commentary on this witty, charming, and rewarding stalwart of the canon; plenty has been written about Austen's novels.

The other version ofSense and Sensibilitywas clearly a transfer from a free electronic copy -- containing a partially missing introduction, an erroneous index of illustrations (which are not contained in the book), and hard coded page numbers which just waste space on each page which don't make a lot of sense in a Kindle version and just take up space on the screen.

The series is undoubtedly the best one to own by anyone who is more than casually interested in the great author and her work. The introductions are flawlessly helpful to whatever detail of background the reader wants. The notes explain references and changed or obsolete word usage and are easily skipped by anyone who doesn't want them. The texts of the novels are the most accurate scholarship can now produce. They are mostly the same as in the OUP edition of the novels, but much easier to read because of the typeface chosen. The series also has juvenilia and the unfinished text of \\"Sanditon,\\" omitted from the OUP edition. In the end, I cannot praise the Cambridge series too highly."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of Austen's first books to be published, Sense and Sensibility tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Having lost their father, they had to start life anew, since their half-brother and his wife were not willing to take care of them. So Elinor, Marianne, their mother and younger sister move to Barton Cottage. In their new home, they experience heartache and pain as they mature and grow.Elinor, the elder sister is extremely sensible, even in matters of the heart. When she learns that Edward Ferrars, the man whom she loved, was going to marry Lucy Steele, she takes it in stride. She is sad, but that does not slow her down. Marianne, on-the-other-hand, is very dramatic and emotional. When Mr. Willoughby breaks her heart, she decides she is never going to recover. She starts getting sick often and being melancholy. The story ends well, but both sisters learn to become less rigid in their respective personalities. Elinor realizes that showing emotions is alright and Marianne decides that living life in the past is not useful. Hence, Elinor gains some sensibility and Marianne some sense.Once again, Austen has outdone herself in this novel. Her characters are well-developed. Like in her other novels, Austen's writing paints a charming picture of the life and times of the 19th Century English. The story line is very captivating and Austen goes into great detail describing every aspect. However, it seems that towards the end she wraps everything up very quickly. She mentions Lucy Steele and Willoughby's whereabouts and feelings; she mentions Elinor's and Marianne's respective marriages. She does this without using her usual descriptive language. But other than her ending, this is an excellent novel.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read Austen before, Sense and Sensibility is the novel to start with!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending.

Love and broken hearts play a large role in the plot, and, at times, it is a little much. You really feel your heart going out to the two sisters, feeling their pain. This is an extraordinary story.

Both Elinor and Marianne love each other and try to understand one another. Elinor tries to protect Marianne by attempting to counsel her to curb her sensibility while Marianne advocates her own romantic outlook to her older sister. What each of them fails to realize, until the novel's end, is that without the presence of the other in times of trouble, they would not have a leg to stand on.Both Elinor and Marianne take each other for granted and it is to the reader's gratification that Elinor and Marianne do find satisfactory, and happy, endings when they each adopt a little of the other's philosophical outlook."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Although it's still witty, the tone of this novel is not as light-hearted compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey.&quot; This gives the story a darker and more realistic feel, certainly more depth. The two Dashwood sisters' situation could not be worse indeed. (without money and rank and lost their father &amp; estate) They had a more difficult life than other Jane Austen heroines. We feel sympathetic when reading this story. In general, this book is witty, ironic, yet serious, warm, and very human. It's an irresistible and rewarding reading experience. Also, don't forget to see the movie (screenplay by Emma Thompson) and enjoy the audiobook (narrated by Kate Winslet) as well."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex. The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be. Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable. Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason. But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating. She more than many others can create a little piece of the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do. This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a witty, diverting book that was a pleasure to read. I was eager to read another novel by Jane Austen after so thoroughly enjoying &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and was far from disappointed. Austen creates wonderful stories full of depth, elegance and an endless supply of witticisms. There are so many terrific quotes in her novels that it gets hard to pick a favorite. Don't be hesitant to pick this book up - a year ago I would have laughed if someone had told me that I would be a Jane Austen fan. I'll never regret giving it a chance, so I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is a classic story that really makes you rethink why we are here and what our purpose in life is. It has changed the way I look at some things.The author is not overly wordy and keeps the book moving along at a pace well enough to hold the readers' interest."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Still a great book. Has lasted not because of its silly plot turns in romance, but because of its one-dimensional characatures of English society in her time, with the perfect heroine, Elinor, at its core. Everyone else falls into a niche, is a type, but as the satire is at times very pointed, the story is forgiven. What is not so obvious, because Austen was probably not aware of it, is the utter dependence of all these peoples' lives on the servants who support them. These people do nothing. They walk, eat, dress, visit, read, play games and music, and do needlework or write letters. That's it, with an occasional shopping trip thrown in. It is this underlying life, the life of the servants, that is never mentioned. Only one, Thomas, has any lines at all. It beats me how they filled their days. They simply lived to amuse themselves."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sence and Sensibility has neither the clever mystery of Emma or the endearing heroine of Pride and Prejudice. But we all must learn to except that she couldn't top those two novels.That said Sence and sensibility is worth the read for any Austen fan.The Dashwood sisters various dilemas in love make a good story. We don't care for them as much as our beloved Elisabeth and Jane Bennet, but we wish them the very best all the same.Marianne's self-sensure near the end of the novel for the indulgence of her self-pitty and the lack of obsevance of common civility (in contrast to her sister)is not quite as satisfying as Emma's repentance.And sweet sensible Eleanor is just not as witty or charming as Elisabeth. Neither of the girls tempt us with Fanny Prices sweetness or modesty. And none of the love tangles are as interesting, mysterious or hard to figure out as in Emma.And the villians of the piece just don't match up to Mrs. Norris of Mansfield Park, Miss.Bingley of P+P irritates us more than Lucy Steele.Mr.Dashwoods fraternal neglect doesn't spark the indignation of the Bertrams insensitivity and self involvment.We find more dissapointment in Henry Crawfords disgrace than in Willoughbys.It's a great novel in it's own right but just not Austen's finest work. Which considering how good a book it is, should be a great compliment to the author."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This book is an excellent way to see how English society ran hundreds of years ago. The only issue that people will have with the book is that it is written in an older style of English which can be hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"A book that has a happy end, and lets you dream of long flowing dresses and dashing gentelmen!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Out of all of Austen's heroine's these two sisters were my favorites, particularily Marianne. I liked this book a lot and swooned as Marianne did over Willoughby! A wonderful classic and most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is a story about a family, of a mother and three daughters, as well as their extended family of cousins, step brothers and sisters-in-law and their current love interests. There is selfishness and greed; there are parties and laughter; there is music and books and love; there is heartbreak and deceit. It seems a formula for success.The eldest daughter, Elinor, is the only rational one. Her next sister, Marianne, is a silly, selfish flighty girl who cares nothing of anyone else's problems and wants everyone to focus on her own. The third sister barely gets mentioned, as she is not old enough to fall madly in love with the wrong guy and then make a scene about it when he doesn't love her back.The brother and sister-in-law are greedy and care only about money, even though they have plenty and don't share it with the rest of the family. The cousins are only focused on parties and gaiety and fun.My impression of this book was that they spend the whole time having parties and looking for a husband. They fall in love with men who are unfaithful and they act quite silly about it upon realizing the man doesn\`t love them. The men are all fickle and quite rude about it, pretty much ignoring the girls once they have had enough of them and never communicating with anyone. I almost didn't like them until I recollected that this book was written roughly 200 years ago and times WERE different then. However, I find it hard to relate and also to distance these girls from our modern times. If they were here right now, they would be completely out of place. I would tell them to shut up or to stand up for themselves for God's sakes!This is an era where men and women still marry for money and class. An era where your mother can arrange your marriage to a \\"suitable\\" beau. An era where the women didn't work and then men were landlords as an occupation. It is an era that I do like to read about and would like to understand, but that I have a hard time relating to. Maybe it's Austen's style of writing. Maybe it's just the era.However, for such an old book, it is sometimes amazing how much things really haven't changed. I think this quote still holds true today. \\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy\\".This one just cracks me up. \\"Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\". So she didn't argue with him. She was snubbing him by not giving him the satisfaction of an argument. I love it. What an insult!But the best quote is this one at the end, which redeems Marianne. She finally turns around and realizes that she is not the only person in the world and the learns to respect and care about other people. She realizes that the man she loved when young was worthless and the one who has stood by and loved her for years is priceless.\\"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!\\"I cannot say I really liked this book as much as I thought I would. From hearing what other people have said, I thought it would be absolutely great. It was just okay. I have found that there are several classics that I feel about this way. Maybe the hype is just too much. My expectations are too high. Or maybe I am just not into this style of book. I will keep trying however.I give it a 3 out of 5. I liked this book but I did not love it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself.

I don't care who you are."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a book about two girls who are looking for someone to love. I believe that this can relate to a lot of girls in today's culture. All of the girls in today's culture are always looking for love. They are always seeking for a boyfriend. This book is about two older women who are searching for the love of someone. This book can also relate to the lives of people today because it is about broken hearts and finding the right person. A lot of people today think that the first boy that they date, they are going to marry. That is not true in a lot of cases and that is a lesson that can be learned from this book.This book is about two sisters. Marianne and Elinor are both looking for someone to marry. They are at the age when it is time for them to be married and that is what they want. In the beginning of the book, Elinor has fallen for a man named Edward Ferrars. He is a respectable gentlemen who Elinor falls on love with at first site. When Elinor and her family move away, he promises to come and see them soon. He never comes and only sends a letter. This makes Elinor very upset. While all of this is happening, Marianne meets a man. His name is John Willoughby. He is also very respectable and helps Marianne when she falls down. He carries her home because she cannot walk. This is when it happens. When John meets her family, they instantly like him. He hangs around and is then called out of town. Then, before they know it, Willoughby is called out of town.When the two sisters go into town for a few months, they hear some devastating news. They hear that Willoughby is marrying another woman and so is Edward. This devastates both of the girls and they are in a wreck. In the end, They both ended up getting married. You will have to read the book to see how the end turns out because I don't want to give away the ending for those of you who have not read it yet.In the end, The book was good and I would recommend it to some people. I would not recommend it to all people because as I would put it: \\"The book is a chick flick\\". I would recommend this book to people who like romance and fiction. This book I think would best fit teenage girls.

Content includes table of contents with chapter titles and a somewhat antiquated preface (not by Austen, of course) from the out-of-copyright text.With respect to the content itself, Austen's story and story-telling is amusing and witty, her language is ornate and sometimes a bit tedious, and most (though not all) of the characters are sketched vividly. This was the first Austen book I've read (and the first she published), but I rather doubt it would have remained so popular without the success of her other books; I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or another of her books as a first read.

I caught on pretty fast. The beginning is confusing but afterwards, it makes more sense. Things such as He is very agreeable or five and twenty (25) come up a lot.

All throughout the books they sprinkle little trivia and helpful side-notes. Everything from how things were depicted in film adaptations, to what was happening in Jane's real life at the time of her authorship, to giving the context and definition to various phrases and references in the books, the Insight Editions truly give that extra little verve and interest to the classic works. The extras are well written and added with care by a fellow author (Julie Klassen) who has a genuine love and appreciation for Austen's work.Now, of course, Jane Austen stands on her own just fine, but having always been an avid watcher of DVD Bonus Features, the Insight Edition was right up my alley!

I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it.

A widowed mother taking care of three daughters. Being evicted from their home and moves into a relative's home. The daughters all taught that they don't have to marry into money or their social class. They're also encouraged to be well educated in all subjects.Now in the early 1800's, women were not allowed to own property. They didn't have civil rights that we do now. So when Henry Dashwood dies, the successor of all of Henry's property is John Dashwood (son by Henry's first marriage). Henry's second wife, Mrs. Dashwood (40 y.o.), is forced to find another place for herself and her 3 daughters. John Dashwood is a man who allows his wife to manipulate him. He wants to do right and follow his father's dying wish, but the spoiled wife convinces him otherwise.The title \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was not Austen's original decision. None the less, the title is an example way English teachers want for comparison and contrast essays. The usage of the two terms are also fitting. In this case, sense refers to Elinor Dashwood. She is the eldest daughter and 19 years old. Elinor is reasonable and reserved toward her feelings. Romanticism is apart of the definition of sensibility. Marianne (the 16 y.o. middle daughter) and Mrs. Dashwood both where their hearts on their sleeves. They rely on their emotions for all the decisions they makes. The youngest daughter, Margaret Dashwood (13), is also romantic but is still young.Mrs. Ferrars, Fanny Dasholwood, and Robert Ferrars believe in social class and high status of wealth. None of them have job or money income. They live off their inheritance and marriage dowries.

Yet I found myself caught up in the story of two sisters, one levelheaded(sometimes hiding her emotions) and the other very dramatic. This is a tale of sisters who struggle to learn what love is truly about and of their unending loyalty to each other.What made the book interesting to me were the notes added by the editors. They included Historical and cultural details, information on Jane Austen's life, references to Sense & Sensibility in films, an unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters and themes of faith drawn from the novel and Jane Austen's life. I actually caught myself laughing out loud as I read some of the side notes. The comments helped lighten the tone of the book and made it painless and even fun to read.

The love and loyalty between the sisters is astounding, but they do not understand each other. Elinor is a quiet, sensible and sensitive young lady cheerful and putting others first. Marianne is just the opposite. She has a quick temper, speaks before thinking, is often rude and is full of herself. Her wishes and desires come first regardless of who is hurt.The family lives in late 18 century England where a person is judged by breeding and wealth, looking down on the working class. Circumstances change in the sisters lives and they are forced to move from the family homer to the country. Their half-brother has good intentions as to their welfare, but is overruled by his wife. Through the goodness of a distant cousins and friends, the sisters remain in polite society. Both have feelings for two gentlemen of the upper class, but whose feelings do not appear to be in their favor or any chance of marriage. What transpires in the lives of Elinor and Marianne along with their friends leads to some interesting conclusions.Jane Austen has always been a favorite author of many. However, this is a reprint of the original book first published around 1811. The trivia and notes that highlight this \\"Insight Edition\\" in the right margin is very distracting, and at times I found the story rambling without anything worthwhile being said.Jane Austen fans who want to reread the book will, no doubt, purchase the reprint for the interesting trivia, but I found it very hard to follow, due to the inserts in the margin, and to only hold my attention for short periods of time.This book was provided by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you will love this edition of Sense and Sensibility.I admit I was at first a little skeptical of reading an \\"insight edition\\" as often I have found, in the past, insights to be annoying and often detract from the story. That is not the case in this edition of Sense and Sensibility. I found most of the insights to be very helpful and often amusing.This timeless classic is brought to life in even greater detail through the insights included in this version. It includes many fascinating details from Jane Austen's own life which help explain her perspective on many different situations. Many of the insights have to do with bringing the rich cultural details out to a generation who may not immediately relate to life and places in the early 1800's.For those who have loved (or even hated) the many movies and mini-series' based on this book, you will find frequent comparisons, applause, and criticisms of the film versions.The faith that is evident, though not always clearly, is brought out and given Scriptures references for throughout the book. I found these very interesting as I had never thought of Sense and Sensibility as a Christian book before.This is definitely a book all Jane Austen aficionados will love.

I've read all her books several times and never seem to tire of them. Reading Jane's writings is a bit like curling up with a cup of tea while visiting with a very dear friend. Some things are just meant to be cherished and savored.While I have taken the time to do a little research on Austen's life and works, I was curious about the new Insight Edition of Sense & Sensibility by Bethany House Publishers. The Insight Edition seeks to provide readers with a deeper level of understanding of Austen's world and that of her famous characters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. No \\"Googling\\" required.This recently published version provides clever trivia and tidbits which are sprinkled throughout the margins of the book. Also included is a helpful Quick Guide that acts as a key for deciphering the note's symbols, and a Questions for Conversation section that can be used for book club discussions.While I admit to feeling almost giddy with anticipation over this book, I found myself feeling a bit disappointed by some of the commentary. I was very interested in both the historical and cultural notations, but I really didn't care to read what felt like an overabundance of \\"opinion\\". For example, \\"Mrs. Dashwood would've loved HGTV.\\" {page 33} To me, that felt completely unnecessary. Also the flash of \\"today's society/vernacular\\" while reading a novel set during the early 1800's felt a bit jarring at times.However, the Insight Edition does hold many interesting bits of information that most, if not all, Jane-ites will readily appreciate. I also enjoyed the fresh new cover art, which added a lovely ambiance to this most delicious diversion. :)"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I was excited to receive a free copy of the Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition by Jane Austen($11 .99) from Bethany House!

Much, I believe.Austen wrote a book that is very instructive in how people face life and love. Set in a time when many seemed to thrive on that which was deemed genteel and appropriate, but were very superficial, Sense And Sensibility shows the manner in which two (There were several others, but the Dashwood sisters are the two main characters.) sisters dealt with love. Elinor was prudent, careful, and thoughtful (She used sense). Marianne was passionate (Sensibile is the way Austen described her.). They both fell in love, and both were hurt in different ways. In the end, both learned the value of having a balance between careful, well-thought out approaches to love, and a passionate approach to love.The ins and outs of their loves are not too different from our times. Neither are the people. The great difference is in the setting. Human nature remains the same. We can learn much about life from this book.Bethany House Publishers has done the reader a service by providing appropriate historical details, references to various movies based upon the book, and humorous comments along the way.Who would have ever thought that reading a classic could be so much joy!?!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

The world was a dramatically different place in the early 1800s. The culture was different, the language was different, the governments were different. The entire state of mankind was completely different.So the question is, does a 200 year old book still pack a punch in 2005? Or has it become an archaic, dusty tome that alienates any reader with its unintelligable prose and mindless story? The answer, I believe, is a little bit of both.Clearly, the pre-Victorian writing style varies greatly from the Hemingway-esque brevity that is encountered so often in modern times. Often, Austen's writing is confused and cluttered. It can seem overly pedantic, trivial, and circumlocutious. There are entire paragraphs that can, and should have been, omitted because they are utterly flippant and redundant. The writing style was, for me, a barrier.The society in which the story unfolds; that is, the cultural background, is also quite distant from our own. If anything, Sense and Sensibility is a study in history. We see what life was like back then. We hear it from a primary source. And, for the most part, the petty pursuits of the luxurious upper-class, the countless balls and parties, and the mindless squabblings of money grubbing lords are fine. The reader accepts it as part of the history.The story itself is where the true beauty of the book is revealed. The story is timeless. It proves, refreshingly, that one does not need a massive war or wrenching poverty to create a good yarn. Yes, Elinor and Marianne live ridiculously priveleged lives (and often complain about their \\"misfortune\\"), but we all can identify with the romantic aspects of the tale. We can identify with the characters, the people, who inhabit Austen's world. And the characters are, quite simply, incredibly colorful and richly created. The characterization is where Austen shines.So the main drawback to this story is its age. If you can get past the age of the book or even enjoy it intellectually, you will uncover a gem of a novel. Austen's subject (unlike her prose) does not alienate us at all. Instead, it reacquaints us with the yearnings and struggles of love and friendship. If you can slog through some of the more clunky passages, there is a lot of insight and beauty in this book, as well as a fairly good story."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. It's a very entertaining book. A few pages into this book, I already had taken sides for and against the characters. They are wonderfully believable. Some I disliked; some I liked. The ones I didn't like were money grubbing types who must have been pretty common in that period. The one I most liked was Elinor Dashwood, the eldest Miss Dashwood. She was very pretty and had good sense. Throughout the book, I found surprises. These were unexpected events that twisted the plot. Jane Austen uses the English language very well. This book is almost contemporary in language and is eminently readable. In fact, Sense and Sensibility is a classic worth owning.I recommend Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility to all readers who want a fascinating cast of characters and a good read."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is a story of two sisters, marrian and elinor, which, though very similar in some aspects, and share a very similar unfortunate love affair, are total different in their behavior and approach toward matters of the heart. Tough both emotional in both seeking love and addressing it, one lets her emotions take over just about everything else, and the other have better balance between love and logic.I'm not much of a period novel fan, and didn't like the emma tompson movie so much - so i wasn't too keen on reading this book at first, but as i got into the pace of the story, i enjoyed reading it. what i mostly liked about this book is the fact that though it was written a few centuries ago, the emotions describe in it, and the moral this story tells are still very true till today. the way we all need to balance our inner world with consideration and respect for the outer world.I've been helping two friends through a pretty messy break up while i was reading this book, and i kept quoting parts of it for them, trying to explain how the choice between &quot;being a marrianne&quot; and &quot;being an elinor&quot; is their's and how dealing with grief and lose might be effected by their own approach to love and life in general.I recommend this book to anyone who ever suffered from a broken heart and had to deal with a break up. It's inspiring and interesting"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"While a quick review of any NYT book review will make clear the many ways to evaluate the worth of a book, I've found that, with novels, 80% of my assessment can be delivered by answering two simple questions: 1) did I consistently desire to turn the page; i.e., did the narrative flow unremittingly retain my interest and curiosity, and 2) did the ending leave me with both the ethereal wish for the story to continue in perpetuity and lacking that, the more prosaic desire to immediately read it again.I recently read Pride and Prejudice and, having answered both questions with a resounding \\"yes,\\" expected more of the same with Sense and Sensibility. Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, I was disappointed. The book was successful in holding my interest but in a far from fervent way. Rather than caring deeply for the characters and anxiously awaiting the unfolding of their fates, my curiosity was clinical in nature, wondering at the outcome without particularly strong partisanship. Compared to the convincingly developed, full-bodied relationships between Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Wickham in P&amp;P, those of Elinor and Edward and Marianne and Colonel Brandon come off as shallow, cold and flimsy. To be fair, the ill-fated love of Marianne and Willoughby is carefully developed and generates sympathy. However, the lack of substance behind the Elinor/Edward connection and the lack of credibility supporting the Marianne/Colonel Brandon match left the book's ending with a flatness that far from inspired the desire for a continuance.The other missing factor that really set P&amp;P apart was the wry humor of Mr. Bennett. While S&amp;S is not without similar elements, they are primarily limited to comments of the narrator and lose the effect of being embedded within the dialogue of the primary characters.Is summary, this is not a book that you will put down with disinterest before finishing but is also not a work that will leave you exhilarated by the experience. I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared by Emma (Modern Library Classics), and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others were Pride And Prejudice, and PersuasionAs with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews. In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:Many reviewers (which you may read if you browse other editions here) profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"I must take issue!1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree. Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.) Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!4. Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control! And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.I need say no more, and direct the reader to \\"click\\" all four of the above into his/her cart!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen.

I saw the film before I read the book, but the book didn't let me down one bit. I love how Jane Austin describes the band between the sisters, and how she talks about how they are in love. The chosen words are beautiful too, but you vocabulary has to be in order to understand this book, so that you don't have to grab a dictionary everytime."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen is definitely one of the greatest novelists of the world. I've read Pride and Prejudice &amp;Emma and loved them both. However, I was disappointed with Sense and Sensibility. The story of two sisters altogether different from each other could be an interesting plot ... if it had Austen's usual style. Austen is famous for her keeping her balance between too romantic and too realistic. This time her style is much too romantic and by no means both feet on the ground. The sensible sister Elinor is really a charachter to fall in love with ,but the incredibly romantic sister Marienne has driven me nuts by talking foolishly throughout the book. Still , a good experience and worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen delves into the heart and mind of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. These two sisters, once concious of and obeying the dictates of decor, the other given to the whims of her heart, balance one another perfectly. Austen addresses one of the chief concerns of the romantic period, the importance lent to rational thought (sense) and passion (sensibility). This is a wonderful book which every serious reader should have in his or her collection."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen fans are said to be most enthusiastic in their support for her writing, and after reading Sense and Sensibility, I could understand why. She was a clever lady whose shrewd insight into human nature and English society allowed her to make effective use of satire, and her plots have enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested in what is going to happen next. The dull, dirty world Austen inhabited has limited appeal to me so I can't say the book was highly attractive (which is part of the reason I ranked it with a 6.) By way of recommendation, I would encourage a viewing of the movie version to help better understand the book. Emma Thompson directed a film that I found quite pleasureable."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I finished my first Jane Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice, 2 days ago and was quickly hooked.

In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:Many reviewers profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"I must take issue!1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.2.

Was it interesting? Yes, in a way... Do I want to know how it ends? Yes, I think... Do I think the part that exists is good? Well, no not really. It's not Jane's best work. Or maybe it's just not like her other work. It seemed uneven--too rushed in some parts and too slow in others. Overall, there was not much character development - that is, we didn't learn who the characters are based on their dialogue and actions. Instead, we were mostly told what to think of them, either by the narrator or by Charlotte, the heroine. Charlotte has been sent, on only a very short acquaintance, to stay with the Parkers in an up-and-coming, soon-to-be fashionable seaside town called Sanditon for a fortnight or so. We are introduced to a varied, but not particularly interesting or memorable (yet) cast of characters over the first 12 chapters, which are all that exist of this last novel Austen was working on before her untimely death.As for this Hesperus Classics edition, it is very nice. Printed on good paper in a easily readable font, it is better quality than I would have expected for a small, relatively unknown, unfinished novel. Bravo to them, as I have no idea when I would have gotten around to reading this without the incentive of a nice new, pure copy (as opposed to the one I have which another author completed). While I don't understand why there is a rooster on the (presumably final) cover, it is just fine by me and I like the cover flaps very much. You don't often see them on paperbacks, but they are very useful for holding notes, marking ones place, or just generally making the book stronger and more luxurious-looking than a regular old paperback.

I have read many of Austen's stories and have seen the characters portrayed in movies as well.Plus I enjoy reading books set during this time period.I enjoyed the many variations of notes not typically in study / Amplified editions. I was pleased at the easy to read format they used to include the notes as well.(that the comments were labelled with symbols and in the margins near the text being commented on. The information did change how I viewed some of the scenes that I had previously read or seen which was surprising to me.I didnt enjoy the comments that were listed of a personal nature or that were there to be funny! Ranking of the novels characters which was marked by a frowny face or the smiley faced comments were highly distracting to me. But I know that is a personal preference so I didnt take it too highly into account when giving it a rating. (they are two out of seven of the notes listed!) Many readers may enjoy these comments and would in fact find them entertaining and engaging. I could easily see this text being used in a classroom situation with young readers as well as being read by reading groups / Book clubs. The Group discussion questions were what I thought to be well written and thought provoking.So, if you have met the characters of Pride and Predjudice before or are reading this story for the first time this addition would be one I would reccomend.Note: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes.

When I receivedPride and Prejudice (Insight Edition)as a review copy, I was worried that the text would actually have been changed or modernized, but the words of Austen remain the same, to my great relief. Instead, this version intersperses personal observations, movie trivia, historical background, spiritual insights, and other tidbits of information throughout the text in side boxes.I would also recommend this for younger readers or any other readers who are not familiar with Austen's time period, since it explains some terms and customs of the era that they might not otherwise understand. Any Austen trivia fan will also enjoy it.Some of the comments were rather too obvious and didn't add too much, others were really quite funny. The added info/commentary was really a good mix of just plain good fun and informational. The conversation questions at the end would make this very suitable for book club use, as well.I prefer the side box format to the usual footnote or margin format for \\"amplified\\" versions.

The widowed Mrs. Dashwood and her three daughters are left homeless and with little money. A kind relative offers to rent them a small cottage on his property.The two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, find both romance and heartbreak in their new home. Elinor is sensible and restrained, so that even when she falls in love with Edward, she keeps her feelings to herself because she knows that marriage is not a possibility. She has no money for a dowry.Marianne, on the other hand, wears her heart on her sleeve. When she falls in love with handsome playboy Mr. Willoughby, she doesn't care who knows about it.Both sisters experience heartbreak before they find love and happiness."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Taking place in Norland, England, in 1811, Jane Austen astounds her wide audience with yet another uplifting and eye-opening novel. Sense and Sensibility explores the life of the Dashwood family, consisting of the new widow Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters, the composed and affectionate Elinor along with the sensible and spontaneous Marianne. Inheriting all of his father's money, John Dashwood visits his sister Mrs. Dashwood and gives the three devastated ladies a good share of his inherited money. During the visit, John Dashwood's wife, fanny, brings along her sensible older brother, Edward Ferrars, who develops a very close relationship with Elinor Dashwood. Although they are given a hard time by Fanny, Mrs. Dashwood, and the later promiscuous old friend Lucy Steele, Elinor and Edward establish and progress their love throughout the entire novel. As their love grows, Austen compares and contrasts the trait of sensibility, possessed by Marianne, and the trait of sense, possessed by Elinor. She does this through the two sisters' interactions with their significant others.Just like almost all of Jane Austen's preceding novels, Sense and Sensibility dives into the themes of love and judgment. The reader learns how the characters in the novel become blind when they are in love, and the effect this has on their judgment.Although it is a great read, I do not recommend it to just anybody. Readers must stay attentive to the multiple characters that are introduced throughout the novel; readers must also have strong patience because the novel is written with the old English dialect of the early 1800's. This is one of Jane Austen's best novels, in my opinion. In her novel Mansfield Park, she merely spends the whole novel demonstrating the progression of love in a New England town. In Sense and Sensibility, however, not only is the reader able to explore the development of love in a relationship between two people, but also the progression of individual character qualities, such as those of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. In totality, this novel is one of Jane Austen's best works."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Once criticised as being \\"least interesting\\" of Auten's works, I entirely disagree. Sense & Sensibility is one of my favourites, if not favourite Austen novel. Perhaps not as \\"light, and bright, and sparkling\\" as Pride & Prejudice, it is still a wonderful and enjoyable read, and definitely not as dense as Mansfield Park. Personally, I could not put this book down, when usually with Austen I read a chapter or two a day.The dual heroines is one of the most interesting literary techniques here, interlaced with the usual infuriating members of society (John and Fanny, Lucy Steele), silly women (Charlotte Palmer) and men (Robert Ferrars).My only criticism of the plot would be the somewhat rushed ending, but the story goes through regular \\"ups and downs\\" and enough changes of scenery to keep interest.I often prefer the Penguin Classics versions of the Austen novels. They are easy to carry around and have comprehensive footnotes as well as interesting and thought-provoking introductions and appendices. In this version I prefer the original introduction by Tony Tanner, but the introduction by Ros Ballaster is interesting in its discussion of the opposing themes of the novel i.e. first and second attachments, scream and screen, and of course, sense and sensibility.My only criticism of the Penguin Classics version is the cover art, which I don't feel encompasses the true characters of Elinor and Marianne. While I appreciate the use of 19th century art on the Penguin Classics covers, I never feel that they truly embody the character (except for maybe sickly Fanny Price). As a side note, I do like the cover art of theSense and Sensibility (Oxford World's Classics)edition.In ending, if you are an Austen fan, and haven't read this, you must. Furthermore, if you are considering Austen I would recommend either Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice as first reads. In any case, the Penguin Classics version will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I love the narrator, I love her accent.

She is my guilty pleasure read, like a Jackie Collins of the early 19th century because her novels are just drenched in drama and scandal. They are not really a thinking man's novel, just fun stories to read. I also enjoy the romance aspects of her novels because they are classy, not like the trash smut you read in today's modern \\"romance\\" stories. I feel almost uncomfortable and embarrassed when I read a modern romance story. Well anyhow, when it comes to drama and scandal, Sense and Sensibility does not disappoint. When you commit to the story, it really takes you in. I really enjoyed the protagonist, Elinor, but I was unhappy with Austen's Marianne character. It seems as if Austen could truly identify with Elinor because she did a great job developing her character as level-headed, proud, and classy. Perhaps she took a little Elinor from herself? Now, in the beginning of the novel you get drawn in by Marianne. She commands a good third of the book with her story and her character starts off well developed. You get a true feeling for her impetuousness. She is emotional, passionate, wears her heart on her sleeve. The novel is so interesting until the end. The end completely disappoints. Now I don't know if Austen became uninspired at the end of the novel or just didn't know how to end it better, but it falls completely flat. Like I mentioned before, you get interested in this Marianne character and you know how she is, but then at the end she decides one day to become like Elinor?! Just like that?! An impetuous person like Marianne would not and could not do a 180 with their mannerisms. Then, Austen does no justice to Marianne by having her marry at the end of the novel. It is just so dubious it doesn't make sense. Austen also wraps up all the scandal and drama in almost 3 pages. How convenient! That was just bogus to me. But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans. If I were to make a recommendation to a new Austen reader, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. It is more concise and it is a shorter novel."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This book, like her other books transports me back to that time and place so it feels as though I am a part of that moment in time."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"For the ladies can you imagine a world in which you have no career options except that of being a wife, a world in which everything depends upon how much money you have, and if you're at a loss for lucre, then you'd better marry into some moolah! You don't do anything except go to dances, mooch off richer relatives, and hope you marry somebody before you become a spinster! If you're a man, it's pretty much the same thing, except your career path is more open. You can do a lot if you have money, but like most of the male characters in Sense and Sensibility, why bother?! You got a rich relative to pay your way through life! Just spend your time hunting, whether it be game or a woman, especially a rich woman, if you're a debauched ex-noble who's lost his fortune in disreputable consumerism. All these examples pretty much sum up the world of Jane Austen as portrayed in Sense and Sensibility.Three sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret...Well, let's forget about Margaret, since she's basically a non-character in the book....Well, 2 sisters, Elinor and Marianne are on the prowl for a husband, a well-off husband, since their father has died and left control of his estate to their half-brother, who happens to be married to an uppity and greedy wench of a woman who cuts them out of most of their dead father's money and land. So the sisters and their mother are \\"banished\\" to a charming cottage in the English countryside. Oh, the horror of it, while a lot of England working class and poor were just lucky to find something to eat for dinner in that time period. Elinor is the common sense sister and hopes that Edward loves her, but she can never figure out what his feelings for her are. But she's not going to do anything rash to find out. Just keep a cool head Elinor. Marianne is the exact opposite, youthful, idealistic, passionate, and brash, and falls for the first guy that satisfies her sense of the dashing Byronic hero, even if he might be a cad!I don't know, something about this book rubbed me wrong, even though I thought it was pretty good. All of the characters just seem like parasitic bums, even if they are psuedo-aristocrats. They're lazy, judgemental, and obssessed with appearances, even though they hardly ever have the courage to look under those appearances to see the truth. They really have no activity in their brains. Like animals they are only seeking comfort and security, nothing beyond the most basic of human needs. There is no aspiration to anything. Well, except aquiring money. At some points in the book you wish all of these people had been in France during the Reign of Terror. Then they would have found out their real priorities. I guess, while I could understand the problems of the girls, I didn't sympathize with them. While the spoon they were born with was not silver, at least they had A spoon. It was left to Dickens and Balzac to see how the other half lived. To me, the book's only redeeming value besides Austen's excellent and entertaining style, was to show just how far women have come in the past 200 years, and how lucky they are for being born in the 21st century instead of the 18th!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a pretty slow book. I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, I read every page with sheer delight.

Although not everyone would share my excitement for this book, I don't care, because I can fully relate to both Marrianne and Elinor's plight, feeling poignancy for Elinor's hidden love and jealousy for Marrianne's passionate relationship with Willoughby.Definitely one of favourites."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I fell in love with this story the day I saw the movie. The next Christmas I got the book. I read the book and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm glad Emma Thompson left Lucy Steele's sister out of the movie, but I wish that Mrs. Dashwood's uncle would have been younger with his wife. The book was also very educating for me, because, as I'm only 14, it helped me learn the ways of life back then."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This book well deserves the classification of &quot;classic&quot; literature. I wish I had more time to say everything I want to, so I'll just say, READ THIS BOOK!! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is the first Jane Austen novel I've read. I have to say that I had a very difficult time getting through that book. I find it extremely slow reading on inane subjects. But I am obviously in the minority with that opinion. I expected wonderful stories like Louisa May Alcott's books, but then maybe I am listening with the wrong \\"ear\\". Maybe I was suppose to listen to the sound of the words like a James Joyce novel. I've read a lot of period novels written in that time and place, so it's not a lack of familiarity with the era or the language.I will say that it shows a very real contrast between the use of emotion controlled by intellect vs. total emotional immersion in the subject of romance."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen is remembered fondly for her warmly written romantic comedies. The comedy is subtle and difficult to spot for the untrained reader; in contrast the romance is thickly spready throughout her books, often too easily spotted.Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published work. It is not her most successful novel. By the time Emma was written, Austen was a more successful author. Emma is funnier than Sense and Sensibility; it also posesses a more realistic romance. However, there are positive traits of her style present in Sense and Sensibility.Sensibility, easily slots into the genre of Romance. It concerns two sisters, unfortunately deprived of their family inheritance, and their search for love. One sister, Elinor, is sensible, while her younger sister, Marianne, is a passionate and silly romantic. Austen, in fact admires both her leading ladies contrasting traits, but it is easier to sympathise with Elinor. She puts up with a lot of torment in the novel but never allows herself to break down, unlike Marianne who almost lets a lost love end her life.Happily, there is a trace of comedy running through the book. As usual, the principal humour comes from the characters (the delightfully droll Mr Palmer), but Austen herself has fun with her narrative and enjoys creating set-ups to confuse both the reader and the characters. There is always an element of mystery in her novels. Who will end up with who? And this heightens the enjoyment of the novel.Sense and Sensibility has a lot to offer it. It is a primitive work from a great writer. It has hampered by the ridiculously happy ending. Marianne and the Colonel should never have matched. There is a gloss of reality (often lacking in the book), however when we find out that Willoughby (the bad guy) actually ends up living a happy life. It is a rarity in Jane Austen's novels that the villian (if you can call it a villian) of the piece finishes the novel in a merry vein.I wish I could tell you it was fantastic or indeed awful but I share Elinor's traits, in that I'm not one for exaggerated emotion. It's good but not great."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Personally, I think that Sense and Senibility was a good book, but lacks the wit that was constantly present in Pride and Predjudice.While there was conflict in Sense and Sensibility (both in the sister's jealousy and the the scorn from their lovers later), Austen didn't allow her characters to really address the conflict directly. (For example, why didn't Willoughby explain himself to Marianne, as opposed to using Elinor as a go-between?)While this may be the subtle temper which reflects Austen's style, it also makes it more difficult for the reader to discern any true sense of feeling.The plot is &quot;okay&quot; - boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy scorns girl. In Sense and Sensibility, it's done twice, in parallel. The only difference between one and the other is how each girl copes with it. But, from reading several of Austen's books, I've found that plot development wasn't the author's strong suit.Jane Austen's real strength lies in character development. Her major characters are well developed and dynamic. An interesting aspect of Sense and Sensibility is how Elinor, the logical and practical sister became more emotional, while the ever-feeling Marianne developed a more practical view of her situation by the end of the book.This isn't one I would recommend for folks that have never read Jane Austen before (read Pride and Predjudice first), but it is a book I would recommend it to anybody who likes Jane Austen's style."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I had to read this book for my college novel course. It hooked me on Jane Austen. I am currently reading Persuasions, which is the last book I have to read to have finished all her books! And then I can go around showing off how cultured and well-read I am. Blah blah blah.Anyway, this book has a really great heroine, Elinor, who is perhaps my favorite heroine because she's so much like me, introspective and cautious, and carefully controlled. Her sister Marianne, who is said to be the \`life of the novel' and \`more likeable', is actually a silly, foolishly romantic girl who is passionate and loving. Sure, you love her, but you don't really like her (at least I didn't) and you certainly don't respect her. Elinor however, earns your respect and admiration for her steady character and sense. If you don't know, \`sensibility' is the opposite of sense, it means emotionality and imprudence etc. (I learned that in college!!!) It isn't a common word nowadays, so I thought I'd let you in on the plot. Elinor is sense, Marianne sensibility, and you should be more like Elinor etc. It's a story with a moral, you see, like Pride and Prejudice (Elizabeth is prejudice and Mr. Darcy pride).The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is really weird; she isn't always after her daughters to marry well. She is looking for romance as much as her girls are, as opposed to Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice, who rejoices even when her daughter marries a good for nothing, simply because she's married. It was a good book, with surprising and unexpected plot twists that are pretty complicated, plus loveable characters and a good romance. It almost had me in tears at the end which is a miracle because I never cry, and almost never am moved to tears by a book or movie. Great book, try it out!!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Anyone who gives this book a bad review has no class.

Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Just because this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense & Sensibility has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new.

Though \`sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, \`sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical \`senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story \\"Pride and Prejudice\\").\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels (\\"Emma\\" and the aforementioned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some \`sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The audio is great if you can play it.

Here we follow the adventures of the Dashwood sisters as they find love in an class-conscious Regency England.The Dashwoods, impoverished when their father dies, are forced to live in a small house in the coutry on 500 pounds a year. With such unfortunate pospects as those, it will be difficult for the elder two, Elinor and Marianne, to find good marriage prospects. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferras, a match that seems much more suitable. But again, things are not what they seem, in this delicious tale of love. The young women must use their sense to see what is really there, and their sensibility to see what will be (unfortunately, Marianne uses neither, much to the detriment of the family). Colonel Brandon is the unassuming, unlikely hero who falls in love with Marianne and saves her from death.Having read this book several times, I can safely say that it gets better and better with every reading. I also recommend the 1995 film starring Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and others."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published. By way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Still, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This review is my personal commentary on &quot;Sense and Sensibilty&quot; and, as such, explains and analyzes the novel. Eleanor Dashwood, the main character, is an example of a young woman's position in eighteenth century England. Her dependent situation in a typical Pre-Victorian setting introduces the reader to a common stereotype of the times. Miss Dashwood, a prospective bride at the tender age of nineteen, possesses adequate beauty and genteel manners making her attractive to select suitors. Chestnut hair, rosy cheeks, and plump figure serve her well, in accordance with the latest standard of femininity. However, she is a victim of circumstances. Her father's recent death has left the meager dowry of one thousand pounds, which presents the illusion of an unfavorable marriage As there exists minimal monetary gain, any match would be for the companionship of Eleanor alone. The equilibrium of both attractiveness and virtue offers an amiable personality. Although she is reserved almost to the point of appearing indifferent, the case is quite contrary. She sacrifices personal feeling to uphold and protect the reputations of any worthy acquaintance amid slanderous social gossip. These qualities of self-control, prudence, and nobility are exemplified in daily life. Perhaps they are best noted in her treatment of Lucy Steele, an undermining ninny who neither desired nor expected Eleanor's kindness. Eleanor's selflessness is her most outstanding characteristic, as seen in constant care and consideration for those around her. When her own heart is aching under the strain of Edward Ferrars' impending marital rejection, she suppresses it to help her younger sister Marianne heal from Willoughby's own recent announcement to wed another. Even against the incogitant avarice of the former fianc&eacute;s she bears no lasting grudge. The unprejudiced man who seeks Eleanor Dashwood would have to be satisfied on these terms, as they are more precious than fortune, though rarely esteemed in a material world. The conflict of this book that will intrigue most readers is recognized in the title. Sense, comprised of the model attributes of Eleanor, opposes sensibility, a glamorous self-indulgence. It is sensibility that governs the outrageous conduct of Eleanor's and Marianne's former fianc&eacute;s. Lucy Steele, ignorant of Eleanor's affiance to Edward, confides in her of their own secret engagement four years previously. Lucy is beneath the Ferrars family in class and fortune, therefore making their future marriage a disgrace. Willoughby's guise is still worse. He has fathered an illegitimate child with a scoury maid, unconcernedly teasing the affections of many an earnest young woman. Unbeknownst to Marianne, he is currently betrothed to Miss Gray, daughter of a gentleman and recipient of a forty thousand pound dowry. These hindrances, intended for personal amusement, have now blinded them both to true love. The ceaseless appetite of sensibility has devoured their past and is eyeing the present. Will it be allowed to overtake weakened wills? The climax, predictably tragic, is inevitable for such foolish young men. A third party reveals the secret arrangement between Edward and Lucy, thus Mrs. Ferrars' anger resolves her to transfer the inheritance of eldest son to the other brother, Robert. Eleanor is resigned to believe he will wed the luxurious Miss Morton as arranged by his mother. Marianne receives a formal letter from Willougby informing her that any such engagement must be entirely a figment of her clever imagination, a sort of wishful thinking for a girl of her social position. This throws her into a desperate melancholy, which leads to potentially fatal illness. Everyone is at this point unhappy or unfulfilled in his or her expectation of the future. A complicated code of social formality coupled with personal confusion checks the true desires of each.The resolution to all these issues, however, swiftly materializes. Upon learning that Edward would no longer be the endowed heir Lucy desired to marry, her affections quickly change to Robert. Edward then realizes that he never really loved the fickle Lucy, and relies on sense to direct him back to forgiving Eleanor. Willoughby is not so lucky in his domestic outcome. He forgoes personal happiness to marry Miss Gray, as his own fortune has diminished. Ironically, a breach from sensibility occurs after he has taken a pint of liquor, and he confesses his true feelings about Marianne. He acknowledges all that has been lost for the gain of cold, inanimate money. Marianne recovers from her lovesick illness, and marries a family friend who deserves her. All is well in the marrying off of the Dashwood sisters; their fianc&eacute;s attain whatever it is that they desired and deserved in the first place. Despite mishaps and malignancies along the way, sense triumphs over sensibility. I would higly recommend this book to anyone interested in the gentry of the times, or is a fan of Jane Austen. It is truly one of her finest works, set in flowing language and adequate print. The paperback edition is fine for study, but I would select another for one's family library."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility follows the lives of two sisters, Eleanor Dashwood (Sense) and Marianne Dashwood (Sensibility). The story begins when the Henry Dashwood passes away, leaving his estate to his son, who is only half related to the Dashwood sisters. The girls, their younger sister, Margaret, and their mother are obliged to leave and seek residence elsewhere since they are no longer the rightful owners of the Dashwood Estate. Without much money to themselves, and a conniving sister-in-law who keeps their brother from providing them with any income, the family is forced to move miles and miles away near to their obnoxious cousins who have offered to allow a low rent. As if it weren't bad enough having to leave their home, the move brought with it some other negative outcomes. For one, Eleanor had to leave her love, Edward Ferrars (who happens to be the brother of their snobby sister-in-law), and Marianne ends up falling for a man who is not quite what he appears to be. The story follows the lives of the two girls and their tumultuous relationships, as well as their loyalty to one another. Full of twists and turns, broken hearts, reputation-ruining secret, and surprising turns of events, this novel is sure to hold you until the end!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility. I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader. Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case. This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time. Those who have read S&S; know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate. The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time. Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain. Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon. Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak. Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago. Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her. I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu. I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor. He made his bed, after all. Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book. Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative. However, this novel is not perfect. There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout. I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about. But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends. What a wonderful treat!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma. However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters). Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable. S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters. A really great read--if you stick with it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I don't know why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry but the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and only get better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading. The Enriched Classic edition also has excellent notes to help you understand references or words that may be hard to decipher more than 200 years after the book was written and I found this very helpful."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"What happened to me when I first began reading this novel was that at first try I put it back on the shelf because I thought it was dreadfully dull. Little did I know that I just was not ready to read such a classic, much less a Jane Austen piece. But when I decided to give it another chance I realized that I almost passed such a great opportunity to expose myself to how a novel should be. Sense and Sensibility's twisted plot was a treat, and although the movie was somewhat truthful to the text, I still enjoyed the novel much more. I recommend this novel to people who are ready to face Austen's sometimes frusttrating vocabulary, but trust me, you'll be reaping benefits and will love to read this novel again and again!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable novel. Ostensibly a social comedy centered on romance, this book is really an unusually acute description and analysis of the collision of Enlightenment rationalism (Sense) with the Romantic ideas of the early 19th century (Sensibility). Austen uses the romantic entanglements of 2 sisters to present these contrasting views of life. This is a remarkable way of showing how ideas permeate and influence the life of society as a whole. The plotting, laden with clever irony, is brilliant, and the characters are drawn with Austen's usual insight."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a story about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are as different as night and day. Elinor represents &quot;sense&quot; - thoughtful, considerate and calm, while Marianne is &quot;sensibility&quot;: wild, emotional, and talented. The story opens with the death of Old Mr. Dashwood, who leaves his estate to his nephew Mr. Dashwood (the father of Elinor and Marianne). Mr. Dashwood is about to die as well; he passes the estate to his son by his first wife, John Dashwood. Unfortunately, he has nothing of value to leave his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, 19-years-old; Marianne, 17; and Margaret, 13), though he does manage to get John Dashwood to promise to look after them. But John Dashwood's selfish wife, Fanny, convinces him to give very little. And so, Mrs. Dashwood moves them to Barton, where they live humbly in a cottage on her distant cousin, Sir John Middleton's, land.Before their move, Elinor had met and fallen in love with Fanny's younger brother Edward Ferrars. But Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars are much too snobby to let their relationship prevail. When they moved to the countryside, the two are further separated. Meanwhile, Marianne's romances are just blossoming in Barton. She gains the admiration of Colonel Brandon, but she prefers young, dashing Willoughby, who helps her home one day when she fell and twisted her ankle. This however proves disastrous, as Willoughby abandons Marianne for wealthy Miss Sophia Grey after a long, intimate friendship. Elinor is also suffering from love-loss. She discovers that Edward had been engaged for four years to Miss Lucy Steele, a distant relative of Mrs. Jennings (Sir John Middleton's mother-in-law). At this point, &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem to coincide and we learn that we must have both &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; in a balanced, corroborated manner to have a truly blissful life.The story is very interesting and entertaining, though Austen tended to drone a lot between events. In my opinion, she spent too much time trying to convey Elinor's judgement during parties and other social gatherings (which was wayyyy too often). On the whole, this was a wonderful book, full of fun and surprises (especially at the end!). I highly recommend this book to people at or above the age of 14 (which is how old I am, and I'm telling you it was a bit of a stretch for me - or maybe it was just that I was a little impatient to get my AR reading points). My only advice is have patience, prepare for a lot of rereading (things can get kinda confusing - there were a little too many characters for my comfort), and to watch the movie (fabulous!) afterward. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels at least once, and&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is, at the moment, my favorite,because it was the last one I read. Jane Austen is - and always willbe - my absolute favorite writer. I love the way she can take just an average person and reveal the hero or heroine inside.This is just what she does with Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. The central theme of this novel is not the love between a boy and a girl; it is about the love between two sisters and how they come to a better understanding of each other when they are forced to endure similar situations and handle them in completely different manners.When each sister, through dissimilar circumstances, discovers that the happiness she had believed she would find in marriage is not to be, it at first appears that Elinor is rather cold and heartless - more worried about propriety than feelings - and that Marianne is more in touch with her emotions and would rather express her grief than take into account how her display will affect those who love her...As for the relationship between the sisters, at the beginning, Marianne seems to pity Elinor for her lack of esteem for art and poetry, and she believes that Edward is not worthy of her. Elinor, while seeing the youthful faults of her sister, always keeps a sense of humour and does everything out of love for her and the rest of the family. In the middle, Marianne believes that no one has ever suffered as she, and continues to pity Elinor for her inadequacies...This is a wonderful and deeply moving novel that should be read more than once to be thoroughly understood and appreciated."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sessanbility is one of the greatest novels I have had the pleasure to read.

(Emma first, then Pride and Predjudice.) But Sense and Sensibility is very good on its own if not compared to those two:)Well to begin with Marianne is not as bad as some of the other reviewers have made her out to be. They should take into mind that she spends more than half of the book with her heart most cruelly broken by a man that I fell for just as hard as she did. (Willoughby.... Willoughby!)On a happier note though, there is one man whom I can still love at the end of the book, Edward Ferrars. He is not the wildly romantic man that Willoughby was, but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in others, such as his strength of charachter, his sweetness, and, as another reviewer mentioned, his loyalty. Yes, he is so loyal he almost left my heart broken twice. Luckily, Lucy did one thing right and saved us all from having to see that unhappy arrangement:(Well I really think I've said enough to give you the picture that this story is filled with drama and romance.(For all you that like that sort of thing, I know I do!) Also the romance in this book is completely clean! I definetely appreciate that, and if Jane Austen were here I would thank her for making all of her novels clean, so that girls like me who don't read books filled with trash can enjoy a good love story every once in a while!! :)"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen experience, and it turned out to be mostly what I expected. Flowery writing, wandering storyline, and mostly emotional drama, this is not at all like my typical reading fare. That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was an enjoyable read, with undeniably beautiful prose and often biting social commentary of old British society. While Elinor and Marianne didn't face any life-threatening scenarios or experience any true danger, their experiences trying to attract mates while navigating the social maze of British aristocracy was nonetheless interesting and amusing. The ridiculousness of that society when compared with our norms of today is spectacular. When an entire class is judged by nothing more than the family coffers, and labor seems unthinkable, marriage is of the utmost importance, especially for those unlucky 2nd and 3rd born children who are unlikely to inherit the estate. It seems totally bizarre today, but this kind of thing was apparently the norm a couple of hundred years ago, and is actually quite fascinating to think about (and learn about) while reading this book. And while we still have some elites today, it is hard to imagine the massive social divisions, bigotry, and unequal opportunity of the past. Jane Austen succeeds in her goal of highlighting the wrongs and inconsistencies of old British society. This book is worth the read if you have the time, even if mostly for the stark comparisons it provides with current times."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies.

Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \\"questions for conversations,\\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review)"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is the classic tale of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who share a remarkable bond of love despite their differences.

The notes also mentioned parallels between Jane's life and the lives of her characters. Having seen the 1995 version of the movie, I had some expectations as to what the book would be like. As with most films that are based on books, I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie simply because the book gives so much more depth to the characters and their situations."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"From BethanyHouse, I received a copy of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition. The Insight Edition has \\"trivia, notes, and inspiration to amplify this beloved classic.\\"This book has \\"helps\\" which include, but are not limited to, historical and cultural details and definitions, facts and tidbits from Austen's life that parallel or illuminate the novel, themes of faith, and my favorite: parts of the novel that just make us smile.I have tried *unsuccessfully* to read this entire book. Every time I begin, I get so sleepy I have to take a nap. I loved the movie (with Hugh Grant), so I'm just not sure what's up with me. At any rate,Sense and Sensibility is about three sisters and their mother. The main focus is on two of the sisters: Elinor & Marianne Dashwood. Both young ladies experience love and heartbreak. Of course there are characters you can't help but dislike and the wording that is used to get their point across in a polite yet \\"no-reply-is-allowed\\" is humorous. The notes added into the margins of the book are great helps. This book also includes questions at the end for discussion."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"On the 27th January, 1817 Jane Austen began work on a novel that is now known as SANDITON. It was never completed. Her declining health robbed her of what she dearly loved most, writing, and on the 18th of March 1817 after penning 22,000 words she wrote the last lines of chapter twelve and put down her pen. Four months later at age 41 she would succumb to what is generally believed to have been Addison's disease.Set in the emerging seaside village of Sanditon on the Sussex coast we are introduced to a large cast of characters dominated by the two minions of the community: Mr. Parker a local landowner with grand designs of turning a fishing village into a fashionable watering place offering the therapeutic or curative benefits of sea-bathing and his partner Lady Denham, the local great lady who has \\"a shrewd eye & self satisfying air\\" and cares little about the community and only her pocketbook.The story unfolds from the perspective of Charlotte Heywood, a young lady experiencing her first trip away from her family as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Parker. Sanditon is populated by a comical ensemble of residents and visitors who upon Charlotte's first acquaintance are altogether different than they later appear. Lady Denham's nephew Sir Edward Denham is handsome, amiable and titled but is prone to long inflated speeches in the most pompous and affected style in an attempt to reinforce his own notion that he is a romantic character born to seduce women \\"quite in the line of Lovelaces.\\" (Lovelace refers to the villain Robert Lovelace in Samuel Richardson's 1748 novel CLARISSA who rapes and ruins the young heroine.) He has designs upon Lady Denham's companion Clara Brereton who he shall either woo with affection or carry off. Clara is a poor relation of Lady Denham's who is maneuvering to be her heir and in direct competition with Sir Edward for her favor.Also sharing the spotlight is Mr. Parker and his four siblings, three of whom Charlotte is told are sad invalids, but after their arrival talk a great deal about their maladies but exhibit little consequence of their afflictions. Here we see Austen at her comedic height characterizing the foibles of those who attach illness as an identity and hypochondria as their religion. The one bright light of hope in the novel is Mr. Parker's brother Sidney who we know of only through letters and others descriptions. He may be the only character besides Charlotte who has the potential to set things in balance with his sense of humor and honest opinions. Sadly he is destined to remain the mystery hero of Austen's oeuvre. Add to that a lineup a nest of plot ironies to raise an eyebrow at business speculation and hypochondria, and a sharp jab at the effluvia of novels and poetry and you have a narrative that whizzes along until an abrupt halt just when we are hooked.The uncompleted novel is a great loss to literature but also to the characters who after a bright and comical beginning are left with uncertain futures. What does remain is more than a novelty of Austenalia. SANDITON'S levity despite the author's failing health when it was written is quite remarkable. On first reading I thought it quite energetic and satirical, similar to the burlesque humor of Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY. I then put it aside and did not reflect on it further. My second reading after several years brought an entirely new reaction. Austen has taken a new and fresh direction from her usual three or four families in a country village and sets her novel not about an individuals struggle but an entire community. Money is still the fuel that powers the plot, but her physical descriptions of the landscape and town are entirely new in her cannon foreshadowing what may have been an evolution in her style. SANDITON is a gem that no Austen enthusiast should miss.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, tells a timeless tale of two sisters search for true love and the heartbreaking circumstances they endure along the way. Bethany House's new annotated version of this classic offers readers historical and cultural details about England in the early 1800s, facts about Austen's life, references about films based on the novel, themes of faith, and comments about the novel's characters and plot.Unlike many editions of this novel, Bethany House's version contains a foreword of only two pages and does not give readers a detailed, scholarly analysis of the novel and Austen's life. Instead, this book provides facts and tidbits of information on the pages' margins. I found this edition simple to navigate and many of the notes offered interesting and helpful information to better understand the story. Another unique feature of this version are the scriptural and moral reflections sprinkled throughout the book. The editors often quote verses from Proverbs.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen classics and does not need a detailed introduction about the story and the author's life.Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of reviewing it."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:\\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\\"It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Ultimately, I enjoyed this book, but it took quite a long time to get into it. I found myself rereading many paragraphs, as I really needed full concentration for this one. I will say that the book did keep me guessing throughout. Though I knew that things would turn out well for the heroines, I truly did not know what was going to happen until the very end."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published novel and the third of hers I read. I must admit, I did not like it very much at first. I found it too somber compared to some of her other works. I liked Elinor well enough, but Marianne annoyed me to no end. The men weren't that great either. Willoughby was doubtless a scoundrel, Colonel Brandon was boring, and Edward was a spineless wimp. That's not to say I did not like the book, far from it. Just in comparison to other Austen novels it didn't hold up.All that changed on my last rereading this year. It was such a surprise to see all the humor in the book! How did I not notice before? Yes, it does deal with some dark subjects but there are more than enough funny moments to go around. Mrs. Jennings stands out in particular, especially the scene where she overhears bits of Colonel Brandon and Elinor's conversation. Brandon is of course, telling Elinor he intends to give Edward the living at Delaford. But Mrs. Jennings, not wishing to \\"eavesdrop\\", can't hear everything and jumps to other conclusions. Another funny scene is a man taking forever to pick out a particular toothpick case in a shop, who turns out to be none other than Robert Ferrars. And I must not forget to mention Elinor! Anyone who imagines her as all prim and proper from the movies should take a closer look at the book- she is full of snark! It made me love her even more.My opinions on the men changed as well. Not Willoughby, of course. But on closer reading one notices that Colonel Brandon, while he may seem \\"stuffy\\" is actually quite the romantic. And Edward really is an honorable man. Yes, you all want him to just dump Lucy for Elinor but he felt he was actually doing the right thing by Lucy in keeping his promise to her. And there was the fact that she could have sued him for breaking the engagement...And he's not really so dull either. I noticed he even teased Marianne about Willoughby at one point. He did have some personality after all!So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more. Marianne does still annoy me at the beginning but I feel for her more now, and admire how she realizes the error of her ways in letting her sensibilities take over all the time. The relationship between Elinor and Marianne is really well-written, more the focus than either of the romances. Austen's writing skills were not quite to the level of sophistication that she would achieve with her later works like Persuasion, but still pretty darn good! So, if you already love the book, good for you. If you don't, I recommend rereading and keeping in mind the things I noted in this review. I hope you'll learn to love it as I have."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWJane Austen\\"s \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" tells the story of the Dashwood Sisters, Marianne and Elinor, imbuing the siblings with respective liberal and conservative worldviews. The book is at its absolute strongest delivering illuminating commentary that, in some ways, validates the viewpoints of each sister.The sisters are introduced into society, receiving visits from chiefly the courtly but shy Edward Ferrars, the mysterious Willoughby, and the wise Colonel Brandon. Each of these men reflect on the emotional lives of the sisters, mirroring hopes, potential loves, foolish anticipation and vanity. In the two sisters, Ms. Austen creates a fantastic representation of competing and supportive sisterly, as well as sibling, complexity.A major complaint is that the book feels very creatively stifled, stifled in the lives of the women as well as in the events of true import in the story. In some ways, it begins and ends in the drawing room, and never ventures much to other topics which would be more all-encompassing. It's possible that Ms. Austen is making a sweeping societal statement about the proscribed lives of Englishwomen in her time. However, the storytelling features cast a general slowness over the plotline that precludes much forward momentum."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Believe it or not I had never read this book.

Sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, left with little income following the death of their father, go to live with some distant relations and meet men they wish to engage. However, there are complications, as both seem to be quite unsuitable.I was continually struck by the eloquence with which this book is written and the gracious manner in which the primary characters endeavored to conduct themselves. Did people really speak to each other that way in that era? How interesting that even one described as \`illiterate' can issue such a statement as \\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in sucha way, but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent.\\" The articulacy of the text was almost confusing at first because the poor standards by which most modern authors express themselves is what I am used to reading and speaking. However, that difficulty was soon overcome, and I found _myself_ both speaking and writing with greater vocabulary and altered cadence.I was also surprised that I could find a tale consisting mostly of the conversations between the idle members of British society so suspenseful. I found myself invested in the characters and their eventual happiness so much that I was quite eager to turn the page.Highly recommended. Compared to this, the romantic tales of the 21st century are vulgar and coarse."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I am a huge bookworm and bought this book specifically because of its fabulous cover.

And it was not even popular in its day. Few modern day woman would enjoy this book, and even, far, far fewer modern day men.Basically plotless (excepting cliches) and almost totally irrelevent to the modern reader (who marries for position nowadays?) The only value of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" at all is in its prose, but, here anyways, its quality is not high enough to be a saving grace. This was a stepping stone, but it is from here, next to the Bronte sisters, then to George Elliot before we get something half-tolerable to read, if we are reading for pleasure.Austen's prose is better than average, but it is not the perfect syllable/phenome-diction of some others. And there is nothing -- absolutely nothing else. In one scene, Austen attempts humor by poking fun at some random male character's superficiality, but her only effect is to highlight her own.If you have ever struggled with a Victorian era novel, you will be surprised here, by how much worse it can get. Though published in the early 19th century, this book was basically written in the late 18th century. Some 18th century books are readable, like \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" Some are even, in part, very good, like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" or \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" But the hit percentage was very low back then. The competition of years, of each author trying to do better than his or her influences or predecessors, had not really developed back then. There wasn't much evolution or refinement of entertainment back then because the market had yet to develop.Jane Austen not only never saw a movie, she probably never dreamed of one. She was writing in an agrarian age, before the invention of the steam locomotive or the telegraph. She probably had no conception of an edited, plot-driven story. Indeed, though the world she was living in was more similar to ancient world than ours, I would rate not one but several thoroughly ancient books as being far more meaningful and entertaining.I will be the first to admit most modern popular books are trash, but though this may be slightly better written, it is as superficial and brain-destroying as anything on the NYT's bestseller list. There is not a single scene of imagination, nor one character you can root for. I actually saw someone lulled to sleep by the reading of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" No doubt, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" would put him in a coma or in an early grave."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I'm sure if I hadn't seen the movie, (DVD) I wouldn't have had the least understanding of what was going on half the time.The book was very boring, with long unending sentences and characters that made no sense. Yet, I kept reading and reading until I was done. I think I was determined to make some sense out of it. After words and words of whatever, the ending came to a short, brief end. To this day, I'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon, or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best. Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would have fallen for an idiot like Edward.The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous, and made no sense at all. For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense, made no sense. As to the rest of the characters, they were all ridiculous, pompous or stupid, and had no sense or sensibility at all.The film was much better. Don't bother with the book."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen delivers an interestingly romantic story of two sisters and their everchanging love lives. Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century. As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it. This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships. Although, the intriguing manner of the Dashwood girls did have me interested at times. I found myself laughing at their wit and quirky dispositions. I would recommend this book to an older audience who can appreciate a more old-fashioned style of romantic novel."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen wrote about what women in her time lived through. Marriage and society. Unfortuantly, in present times those subjects can become tedious after the 400th page. If you are not up to an extremely slow book, do not read Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book. That's because I dearly loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson. Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation. I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.But her style! Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.First, he wrote in \\"Remembered Yesterdays\\": \\"Jane Austen? Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\\"Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:\\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No -- there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen. I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen. I credit them with great patience and intelligence. I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task. Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness. There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done. If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then. If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category. I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot. But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"(Warning!! I do give hints to events in the book) Simply put the book is a romance novel that is very long and some what drawn out. It takes Austen pages to discuss how some woman brings her kids to social events so she can talk about them. Just imaging this going from one social event to another. I personally found the book sort of repetative after about chapter 18 of 50. It seems the only way the book is kept alive is by introducing new characters. If you are a fan of romance novels with one of those cheesy endings, then cheese it up with this four hundred page novel. I couldn't get any furhter than chapter 18, I got tired of nothing happening, specifiically action. Like in &quot;One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, which is an awsome book things happened. Not only that it was funny, but realistic enought to keep my attention. In conclusion if you like books were the entire novel revolves around the realtioships between people (soap opera) then this is the book for you other wise keep away."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Seeing how Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen barely makes any sense, I wouldn't even touch this book again, even if you paid me. Extremely long and mundane, Sense and Sensibility is a book that actually requires effort and stamina to go through the entire thing. To me, the three-hundred-and-fifteen-page book translated to absolute gibberish as I did not understand, nor really cared to understand what was going on.Seeing how the there was no purpose to the plot, I was left bored from the first word to the very last. I really did not see the point of writing a story about two well-off, high society women court other men. There was absolutely nothing interesting about that in the story. No one really cares if the ladies must suffer through heartbreak because in actuality, everyone does. Jane Austen could have done a much better job in piecing a more attractive and purposeful novel together.As I read, the more I learned about the characters, the angrier I got. Why does every character have to be a member of a high social status? To me, everyone was snobby, everyone was self-indulged, and everyone was too one-dimensional. The characters were too well-off to even sympathize with. I did not care or feel emotionally attached to any character whatsoever. Each individual was not self-motivated, and they came off as stuck-up characters. I was just waiting for someone to do something, but no, each character has to wallow in his or her own self-pity. People have worse problems to worry about than worrying about the problems the character has. I kept going through the story and saying, \\"So what? Who cares? Fix your own problems.\\" The characters were too detached to make me feel interested.All in all, the story was just bad. It lacked purpose and meaning. Although you have to admit Jane Austen constructs beautifully crafted sentences, sentence style could only take the story so far.

How to arrange for the right guests to see it?) leave me completely exhausted. The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models. And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.But then I wonder: perhaps all this is some fantastic satire?

I saw it on the clearance rack for $2 at Half Price Books and just had to buy it. I was definitely not disappointed. I have two older sisters myself, and Elinor and Marianne constantly reminded me of them. My oldest sister is full of common sense like Elinor, always thinking of the outcome and how actions will affect her and everyone around her before she does them. On the other hand, my other sister is sensible and romantically charged like Marianne. She lets her emotions get in the way of her common sense and is in the \\"right now\\" instead of looking ahead to the future. Some of the situations they were in and the things they did and said also reminded me of myself and things that have happened in my life. Jane Austen did a wonderful job of making these characters \\"real\\" and easy to imagine actually living, breathing, and doing and saying the things she described. Even though I am only 16 and some of the ideas and language in this book were hard for me to understand and comprehend (I am trying to become more \\"well-read\\" and expand my vocabulary by reading books such as these), I was still easily able to relate to the characters and thoroughly enjoy this book.

Instead I am going to review the audio download which is what I had this time. I enjoy listening to books while I clean, it is my way of getting myself to stay busy. I have been known to spend several days with my nose stuck in books having done absolutely nothing throughout the day. Now that I have started downloading audio books to my iPod, I can wear my armband and get tons of things done around the house and go for long walks while having my favorite stories read to me. The best of both worlds! Sense and Sensibility is performed by Juliet Stevenson and she does a wonderful job. Her voice gets a little 'nasal-y' (I'm sure that's not a real word.. lol) and stuffy sounding at times, but I'm not sure if she does that on purpose to suit the characters.

They are vaguely unwelcome at their stepbrother and sister-in-law's home, but they don't have sufficient funds to live easily elsewhere. Luckily, a relative steps forward to offer them a home at a small cottage some distance away.The two older Dashwood girls, Elinor and Marianne, are of marriageable age, and begin scrambling to find appropriate matches. Elinor is attracted by Edward, an awkward man who is her sister-in-law's brother. The match is not approved by Edward's family, who is more well-off than Elinor, and they conspire to separate the couple. Elinor is reasonable and stoic, and bears her hurts quietly.Marianne, an impetuous and emotional girl, falls for Willoughby, a charming man who seems to have good prospects and who dotes on her and the family. But there may be trouble brewing in their relationship as well.I find Austen's novels to be a fascinating glimpse into the difficulty of life in England in the late 1700s. The society is so complex and so rigid, and the characters spend so much of their time trying to navigate their way through the social restraints before they are even free to try to fall in love and choose a spouse.I liked reading about the struggles and triumphs of the Dashwood sisters, although I found the ending of this story to be a little abrupt and not quite satisfying."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

With Sense and Sensibility, I finish a read through Austen's work with her first novel. It is a strange genre, maybe, but I think Austen wrote as much for men as women, and there is something in her male characters, good and bad, for us to think about.Why Austen appeals to the Marxist in me, I cannot really explain. Somewhere, on the edge of her books, the world is moving, rapidly, from a feudal society to one the Bourgeoisies. Maybe there is an idea in a rewrite of Austen from the servant's point-of-view. They are, as I read, only inches from the page.Sense and Sensibility is a decent example of Austen. The characters are well drawn and do not suffer the familiar defects. The story is somewhat predictable, but so are all her story-lines. The story resolves a bit too quickly and neatly, and it ends far too abruptly, but, again, it is the same with all her story-lines.With S&S;, I find that I cannot tell if Austen is parodying, as I have always believed, or if she is not, instead, pining for the world she depicts. I think her readers probably wonder that about themselves sometimes.Probably I did not give the book as much attention as I could have, as I read three of her books in quick succession through the spring and summer in order to finish (be done) with her from my reading list.None of Austen's work can really approach P&P; and so, for me, was somewhat disappointing in comparison. I have also since, read Wuthering Heights and I think it somewhat eclipses Austen on all points except, maybe, that of pure language."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have come to appreciate this more and more. I love austen's works and the struggling characters and emotions in this novel is so accurate that it's scary. The opposite personalities or sense of that keeps this book intense. Their is intense love in this family unit which I find delightful and you are sucked in the whole novel."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I really didn't enjoy Pride & Prejudice, so I didn't expect much from Sense & Sensibility. But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.And the DRAMA! My God! Did people during this time really act like this? With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments. We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts. People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility. It's insane! If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I'm a relative newcomer when it comes to Jane Austen; I didn't finish my first Austen until well into my twenties, and I'm still working my way through the set. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is my third of her novels, and I find myself loving the overall story but at the same time seeing where there are problems with the text.For those who are unaware, the story is about Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who are near-opposites of each other. Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, like some of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", has lost none of its charm and ability to entertain over the years. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are thrown on hard times by the death of their father. Living in straitened circumstances in a tiny country cottage, their prospects for marriage are set at risk in an age in which a young woman's first job was to find a good husband. The two sisters will pursue much different methods in searching for a suitable man. The sensible Elinor exercises almost superhuman patience in waiting for the man of her choice to make the right choice, while her emotional sister will throw herself into an impulsive love affair. Their lives will be further complicated by the well-meaning and often humorous interference of friends and relatives.Austen's talent for ingenuous plotting and excellent dialogue carry a superb story to a most interesting conclusion with an ambiguous moral that fans are still arguing about. For fans of Jane Austen, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth reading again; for new readers, find out what you missed; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"When Girlebooks decided to publish a bicentenary edition of Sense and Sensibility, they were faced with the dilemma of how to make it \\"different\\". Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \\"matchless match\\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \\"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \\"what's to come\\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which would have been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \\"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \\"Doctor\\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \\"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\\"Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \\"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \\"Biography and Criticism\\", \\"Authors Having Fun with Jane\\" and \\"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\\". There is also a complete list of Sense and Sensibility films--surely enough extended reading to satisfy even my enthusiasm for the subject!Sense and Sensibility, the Bicentenary edition is available in paperback, as well as Kindle/Mobipocket PRC, Adobe Reader PDF, Microsoft Reader LIT and Epub editions.

Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \\"acceptable\\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have to say I loved this book. Most of the cogent points about this book have been pointed out already, so I'm not going to repeat them, but add some comments additional to what has been stated already.It's not Austen's best book, it's a simpler book than the ones that come after it, but that does at least make it easier to read - each successive book is a quantum leap in terms of style, narrative, dialogue and plotting over the previous, and Austen was changing the way novels would be written forever.Not that this is a bad book. Personally I liked it because it has something that's not so obvious in her later books, with the exception of Persuasion - the rock hard scathing judgment that comes accross in her letters - her obvious contempt for characters like Sir John Middleton, Lady Ferrars is searing in it's acidity.There are some excellent scenes - the scenes with Lucy and Elinor are classics in their own right, and the coup de theatre scenes when Edward bursts in on Elinor and Lucy, or Elinor throwing open the door after waiting for her mother when Marrianne is desperatly ill, instead finds only - Willoughby!Although the habit of the author colouring the narrative with her own opinions does get irratating at times, (a lesson she'd learnt by the time she wrote Pride &amp; Prejudice, which is neutral and unbiased) this still makes for a marvellous read. Marianne's sensibitility is breathtaking, and the revelation of how individual behaviour is fundamental in preserving the very fabric of society is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Did anyone else feel a distinct sense of disappointment at the revelation of the mercenary, materialistic nature of the otherwise handsome and dashing Mr Willoughby's character? However, I think Marianne's heart-break was eased by the stead-fast and loving Colonel Brandon. I love this novel. I had been forever avoiding experiencing any other Jane Austen novels for fear they would not live up to the high expectations created by the fabulous &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, however, when hearing of the imminent arrival of the fabulous Emma Thompson's adapted version at local cinemas, I decided to take the chance and read this book. I'm glad I did! This is another Austen gem. Elinor and Marianne are wonderful characters, as are all the others. If you are like I was and are afraid of spoiling your first Austen experience with another, don't be. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is another Austen triumph. Marriage, society and class are again given a unique Austen work over!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Being a fan of Jane Austen but never having read Sense and Sensibility, I approached this novel both nervously and excitedly. Reading any work by Austen is a delight, but I was worried this one wouldn't be as good as some of the others I'd read. However, I slipped into the language and time period effortlessly as I was introduced to the Miss Dashwoods and their plights of love and friendship. This debut novel by Austen is light, witty, and charming, and a complete joy from beginning to end.Both Elinor and Marianne Dashwood have fallen in love, but as the story progresses, we discover that both are going to face unrequited feelings in their relationships. Still, though slightly impoverished, the girls are taken under the wing of several friends who introduce them into London society and further the story with many twists and turns. Elinor becomes entangled in secrets she would rather not know, and Marianne plays into the drama of her love relationship grandly. As both girls come to realize what is really important, the story turns yet again and leads us into unexpected events. This is a truly engaging tale, and a terrific introduction to all of Austen's works. Recommended reading for all lovers of classics."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now. It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate. You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story. This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.I received a review copy via Bethany House."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"At last I overcame my inner resistance and read past page 1, which had previously turned me off with its dry accountant prose. Very soon, already in chapter 2, I realized what good use Ms. Austen was able to make of her special style: the chapter narrates how the rich young man, who had made a rash emotional promise of monetary generosity to his 3 half sisters, is talked down by his rational wife, from 1000 Pounds for each of the 3, to precisely nothing for anybody, all step by step. Brilliant.The main theme of the story, the contrast between the two sisters representing sense and sensibility, which might have been called reason and emotion to be clearer, makes me suffer somewhat due to the impossibly complicated communications between the two girls. None of the two can figure out how to shed the stilts that they are constantly walking on. The dialogues are not easily bearable, and then, frankly speaking, both girls are silly chickens in their different ways. Their mother is a silly hen in her manic optimism. The fact that the main personnel of the story is not entirely admirable fades away in the course of the tale. We find ourselves exposed to the horrors of English gentry of the period, and one begins to realize that the silly girls are rather admirably nice people compared to most other people in this story. We meet more monsters than I would have thought possible in the setting.The mother hen has to pick up her nubile 3 daughters and move with them to a cottage in Devon after her husband dies and the house in Sussex, which had been his father's, is going to the girls' older half brother. In reduced circumstances, they all make the best of it. Marriage prospects and related hopes and disappointments are the most prominent subject of thoughts and conversations.Compared to her later colleagues like Dickens and Trollope, Austen, in this book, has the advantage of superior plot design. The later professionals, in the Victorian age, lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals. S&S;, by comparison, is not driven by piecemeal design, not by the need to package publishable installments, not by ramblings from one subplot to another and back to the main story line. That is an advantage that one can appreciate, though it does normally not diminish my pleasure with the later writers.Austen's station in society is clearly reflected in her novel's world: the lower gentry, people who don't work for a living, but who are not wealthy. Her access to other levels of society must have been restricted by circumstances, hence she was wise to stick to what she knew. Her stories are sometimes called 'romantic', but hers was not the romanticism of the romantic school, which was essentially irrational. She was very rational and had a sharp eye for all kinds of falsities and pretensions. The novel's main effect on me, in the end, was a sense of despair about the lack of sensible life choices for women (and probably men too) in the suffocating closedness of the 'society'."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I am a die hard fan of Coralie Bickford-Smith's clothbound series. They are more then just a book, they are so beautiful they could decorate any bookshelf or be a present for someone special. Not to mention the fantastic stories she designs for! Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"One reading is sufficient for most novels, but not Jane Austen's. Her style, wit and engrossing storytelling grow more delicious with every re-reading. I know in general what's going to happen, but there are so many wonderful details and so much rich characterization to rediscover.I loved Sense and Sensibility more than ever this time around.As the introduction points out, Austen's novel was part of an ongoing obsession in the 1790s and Regency period with defining and assessing \\"sensibility.\\" Too little sensibility was repellant; too much, dangerous. Whereas a perfect balance of intelligence, good manners and deep feeling should result in true happiness!The two elegant Dashwood sisters illustrate the point. Nineteen-year-old Elinor is amazingly sensible. When she suffers reversals, she takes rational steps to heal her wounds. Whereas Marianne at seventeen is awash in romantic opinions and sensations, and rather wallows in her misfortunes. Both have to deal with lovers who cause them misery. The plot revolves around how the sisters cope.But Sense and Sensibility is much more than a lesson in proper behavior. It's a feast of social satire full of delectably flawed characters. Nobody but nobody delivers a barbed criticism or witticism more beautifully than Jane Austen. And the Dashwood sisters are captivating young ladies who totally engage our sympathies.Broadview editions are my favorites, with their scholarly introductions and appendices. I particularly enjoyed the detailed drawings of a curricle, post-chaise and town chariot. Now I can picture the vehicles that carry Austen's characters to dinners and balls and on journeys to town and country.Jane Austen began writing Sense and Sensibility when she was twenty-two and published it in 1811, when she was thirty-six. Why she chose to publish it before Pride and Prejudice is one of many interesting questions explored in the introduction."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Love the novel. Happy to have it on my Kindle. I purchased this, however, for the illustrations...where are the illustrations?"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Recently I read Austen's 'juvenalia', and when I started reading this book, I could see a lot of similarities. The beginning of S&S; has a tone of satire. The reader can tell Jane is a young writer, mocking many of society's views which were common at the time.However, as the story progresses, I began to see Jane getting more serious about her subject and caring about her characters. That was when I began to love this book. And it just got better and better toward the end.On a personal note, I found some similarities to my own life in this book. When I was young and in love for the first time, I acted a bit like Marianne, wearing my heart on my sleeve. I think many of us probably did. I loved this book and gave it 4 stars - but you can see how I might be a biased reader.Some of Austen's other books are definitely a little better, but this is also a good book. It's amazing to me that hundreds of years can pass, and a modern reader like me can still identify with these characters."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is going to be a totally different type of review from me. In fact, it really isn't a review at all. It is more of an \\"ode to Jane Austen\\". I truly do think she ruined my dating life but I totally forgive her for it :)First question you are going to have is why do I have a picture of Jane (played by Susannah Harker) from Pride and Prejudice on a post about Sense and Sensibility?Answer: I listened to the audiobook version of Sense and Sensibility read by her and it was possibly the best audiobook I have ever heard! Yes better than Jim Dale reading Harry Potter (which I also really enjoyed)! If I am going to review anything in this post that is it. If you get a chance to pick up this audiobook version, you should. She is very good at making each character unique and keeping you engaged the whole book. It is unabridged so 14 hours long but well worth it.Disclaimer: Yes, I have read Sense and Sensibility a few different times before listening to it on audio. It is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel behind Pride and Prejudice. So the story is very comforting and familiar. I have the characters I love, the ones who annoy me, and the ones I would like to throw to the wolves. However, as with all great books, it always leaves me with the the hope that in the end the nice guy does in fact finish with the girl of his dreams. Austen is one of the best at taking flawed characters that come from a place of good and making them find each other.This book particularly appeals to me because out of all of Jane Austen's characters I am probably the most like Elinor. I am a little more open about my opinions but otherwise she is the closest to me personality wise. I would also like to think that out there is an E. Farris for me, as he is exactly the type of guy that I go for. Smart, Off-Beat humor, Loyal, Kind, and good to his word. So reading their rather understated romance always warms my heart. Plus, I love Brandon and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.So my rating: 5+My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Purchased for my daughter and her school needs (she is home shcooled) and she was very happy with the book, not to mention that the business end was a pleasure and easy to do as well.

I must say that S&S; was a very easy and accessible book to read. The plot wasn't overly complex and it did not feel bogged down and dense like some old classic novels can. I think this would be a great book for someone who wants to read classics but who is worried or scared to.The two main characters are easy to love and I was wondering what would happen the whole way through.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"It took me a lot longer to finish up Sense and Sensibility than it really should have. There are several reasons for this and not one of those reasons is that the book is not very good or engaging- in fact, it is monstrous both. The school year started back up for me on Wednesday which took a lot of wind out of my sails and a lot of reading time out of my days. About a week before I decided to participate in the Austen in August reading even over at Roof Beam Reader's site I had purchased a copy of the Masterpiece Theatre/BBC version of Sense & Sensibility. I simultaneously watched the episodes while reading the book. I believe that this helped me to get a visual of what was going on as well as assisted in deciphering the prose of the time that the book was written in. I had seen this version a few times on PBS and I loved it very much so there were no spoilers for me, though it would have been nice to not know that Willoughby was such a scoundrel and that Elinor was going to marry Edward after all.Mmmmm.... Edward Ferrars....I enjoyed this book immensly, and I am almost ashamed to write this, but it is the truth and I'm striving to be more like Elinor in my life, which in one respect is to say more honest and so I must confess: I prefer the movie version better (the Masterpiece version, as I have not seen the Ang Lee version, yet.). I truly believe I prefer the screen version over the print because it was my first involvement with the story of the sisters Dashwood. If I had read the book first, I surely would prefer it.My favorite thing about this story is the fact that I could have easily been Marianne (or to a lesser degree, Elinor). Even in the 1800&#8242;s in England, girls still fancied boys who are jerks and girls still had a tendency to slight the good guys! When it comes to the opposite sex I have made numerous mistakes in my years of dating. I tend to choose the Willoughby over the Colonel Brandon and then rue the wasted time and the heartbreak caused by my own dumb choice. So, I didn't feel as embarassed and I didn't cringe as much regarding my past mistakes in dudes since Marianne was doing the exact same thing I did at her age: impulsively falling in love, flaunting it all over town, ignoring common sense, getting the short end of the gossip stick, you know, just basically acting in love and then getting dumped for the rich (in modern language: popular) girl and mooning over it for months. However, one part made me feel a little old maid-ish and a little pissed off-ish at Marianne:\\" \`A woman of seven and twenty' \\" (Egads, I am 27 years old!) \\"said Marianne, after pausing a moment, \`can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small\\" (very small, I work in public education), \\"I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.'\\" Gulp!I love Marianne because she is me, but my favorite characters were definitely Elinor and Mrs. Jennings. These two women are as opposite as night and day but I love them both for who they are. Elinor is so reserved and calm and cool and collected and everything that I just am not but that I strive to be. I love her for always keeping her cool and never going nuts and silently suffering heartbreak for MONTHS just to spare her sister and her mother from feeling heartbreak for her. If I'm heartbroken, I'm taking out a billboard and begging for sympathy and pity. Now, Mrs. Jennings, she is a hoot and a holler!! This is a sassy, brash little old lady that I pictured as Sophia Petrillo from the Golden Girls!The brashness, the sauciness, the rudeness, the likability of these two ladies is what makes them the bitchin' characters that they are. Neither of these ladies is afraid to lay on the innuendo and offend those around them, especially when it comes to relations! In addition to the talent of genuinely writing two such different characters that both become so love-able and appreciated and necessary to the rest of the story and the other characters, Austen also portrayed my favorite kind of character: the strong female. In an age of weaklings (see Bella Swan in Twilight) I am of the opinion that showing female characters, especially in this time when so much of their worth was dependent on the men in their lives. Austen blows that out of the water, and as the case with Willoughby shows, the MEN sometimes must be dependent on the WOMEN for money and status! Hu-zahhh Ms. Austen, Huzzah! Though each of her female characters are bad-ass women (even the deplorable Fanny- she knows how to turn John Dashwoods head and get EXACTLY what she wants, when she wants it, and how she wants it) they still find classy ways to tell each other to get bent, especially Elinor when dealing with that despicable Lucy Steele. This is what all women in every country and in all times should aim to be like and I am so thankful when I see these types of characters in books. So, thank you Jane for writing these characters into your works, and like Sophia would say, thank you for being a friend!"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

There is a superb early chapter in which Elinor and Marianne's sister-in-law pares away the direction expressed by her dying father-in-law that his son share his inheritance with his half-sisters and their mother. Jane Austen manages this almost as well as Shakespeare has Goneril and Regan stripping King Lear of his \\"retinue of an hundred knights\\". Then towards the end of the novel, when Elinor keeps vigil at her gravely ill sister's bedside, a horseman arrives who turns out to be the very last person she expected. Between these memorable events, try as I might, I cannot distinguish between most of the numerous female and the few aloof, mysterious and unpredictable male characters, neither can I sort out how they are interacting.What delights me, however, on every page is Jane Austen's prose. Every sentence is carefully fitted into its place, every word connotes its precise meaning, every adjective such as \\"affable\\" and \\"agreeable\\" carrying a specific ranking in a scale of values.In today's parlance, I suppose I would say that the plot and the characters lack the edge that is so sharp and memorable in other of Jane Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811 when Jane Austen was just 36 years old, and only 2 years before the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the span of such a short time, and almost 200 years ago from today, Jane Austen produced two timeless classics. I find it bitterly ironic that in almost every case, a classic is known by the whole world over - celebrated, written about, studied, discussed in painstaking details in a classroom, read aloud in packed lecture halls and admired by masses - yet the creator of it all is spared this knowledge of success.Sense and Sensibility's characters add richness and color to the story, where the central theme revolves around two sisters, opposite in character and ideals, both in mild struggle with the life choices afforded to them because of their situation, their connections, and their small fortune. The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marrianne, live with Mrs. Dashwood, their mother and younger sister, Margaret. When Mr. Dashwood dies, he leaves the decision of their care in the hands of his son, John. John has never played the role of a compassionate step-brother to his father's other family but he is not vindictive or evil. His wife Fanny is. The Dashwoods are politely and slowly forced out of their beloved home in Norwood, as John is persuaded out of any kindness that Fanny found appropriate for their living situation. The compassionate cousin of Mrs. Dashwood, Sir John Middleton, offers the family to live in a small cottage, Barton Park, for as long as they shall like.The sense of duty and responsibility from Elinor is unparalleled. When she learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to the love of her life, Edward, she is stunned and saddened when the terrible news is confirmed as true. We do not see a single outburst of anger, frustration, disappointment from Elinor's lips or thoughts. She continues to care for Marianne's deep wounds over Willoughby and does not mention a word of her own loss. For four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her. How she endures it all is a testament to her character. She exerts herself to be strong, and act with dignity even at the expense of her own happiness.Perhaps it is ironic that Elinor who is the sensible one with such measured approach to her desires is in the end united with the true love of her life, Edward - while Marianne, who is the sensitive, emotional, passionate, idealistic one, is rejected by Willoughby, suffers greatly in love, and is at last united with Colonel Brandon, whom she neither liked nor respected earlier in the story. Is Austen telling us that it is better to be sensitive or sensible, or that both will do as they may, and life will happen all around us, and we shall never choose our destiny - rather, it chooses us?Whatever the answer may be, Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors of all time and I can't get enough of her!

Only regret that she didn't live longer to write more books."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"I always love the vicious innocence with which Jane Austen tears her characters apart, and Sense and Sensibility is a prime example. Her brutally sarcastic observations of the British upper class reduce her antagonists to sniveling school children who cry and grovel and simper their way through life behind a thin veil of dignity, a veil gleefully ripped open by Austen.From her opinions of parents:\\"...a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow anything...\\"to the value of children:\\"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of others.\\"Austen constructs a tantalising slaughterhouse of a book, inside which she adorns her hooks with a dazzling array of conceited, deceitful and shameless characters, few of whom escape her witty blade. All this however is not to say the novel is bereft of heart. As the title suggests, the central theme is the conflict and reconciliation between heart and mind, exemplified respectively in Marianne and Elinor, both of whom are endearing characters in their own ways, despite their flaws. It is this respect, no matter how faint, that Austen shows her characters that elevates the story above a satirical denunciation of her society and allows the reader to lose themselves in her narrative and become attached to her players.The overall flaw for me, were the happy endings handed out like charity flyers, though the fact that everybody gets one - from her most hated of villains to the most saintly of maidens, somewhat tempers the sacchariferousness. Sense and Sensibility was an utter pleasure to read - and surprisingly enjoyable when read side by side with Game of Thrones Book 3 - A Storm of Swords. When the clumsy fantasy writing made me cringe too much I could switch back to the succulent eloquence of Austen, and when sitting around in parlours reading the subtext behind eyebrow lifts became a little tedious, I could flip back to sex and bloodshed. Unfortunately due to the size differences in the books, I was only 44% of the way into Game of Thrones when I finished Sense and Sensibility and was forced to endure another six hundred pages of undiluted lumbering nerd prose."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Love Jane Austin. Hard to put the book down even on rereading it. I only wish she had written more. I love reading on Kindle so I can look up unfamiliar and archaic words. It makes it all the more pleasurable."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"In Sense and Sensible the storyline dwells on the two elder sisters of the Dashwood family, Elinor and Mariane. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and is governed primarily by prudence (sense). Her younger sister, Marianne, is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who do not evidence wholly encompassing emotions are without them entirely. As in Pride &amp; Prejudice, the family home of the Dashwoods has been willed to another member of the family not in the immediate nuclear family. In Pride &amp; Prejudice, the home was entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin. Where there was only an overshadowing of the loss of the estate in that book, in Sense &amp; Sensibility, the house is actually lost to the half brother whose wife, a Ferrar, not only talks her husband out of the generous support to his half sisters that he promised (albeit vaguely) his dying father but makes life in general unpleasant for the Dashwood ladies until they find a situation with a cousin, John Middleton. Part of the unpleasantness surrounds an apparent but unprofessed affection of her brother, Edward Ferrars, for the eldest Dashwood, Elinor.It would seem that the move has quashed the supposed attraction, leaving Elinor attempting to contain her disappointment. Marianne meanwhile strikes up an intense relationship with equally extroverted Willoughby. When Willoughby suddenly disappears, the two girls come together to support each other emotionally through a storm of discoveries, pleasant and unpleasant.Sense and Sensibility develops into its own independent storyline after many similarities with Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although this novel holds its own and is an enjoyable book, I still feel that Pride &amp; Prejudice is its superior in pace, story line and general feel. Sense came out well before Pride and it almost feels that the same idea is being worked out in both - an idea that got clearer and was better communicated in Pride. Pride had a much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar). If you liked Pride and want more Austen, this is your book. If you are choosing between the two, choose Pride ... than come back for this one."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Since enough people have reviewed the novel's plot itself, I'm writing instead about the formatting of this particular (Kindle) version of the book. I liked the illustrations, though they came only at the beginning of each chapter. There definitely could have been more. As to this version's formatting, it was pretty bad. Line's were frequently unintentionally cut off, making the dialogue difficult to read. Also, as a stickler for grammar, I was frustrated with the mistakes in the book, which I believe are due to the publisher's mistakes (I've read other versions and have never noticed it). For example, words are misspelled and punctuation is missing - very annoying. I realize this version only cost me 99 cents, but I was still aggravated while reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"This is my second Kindle purchase of S&S.

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY chronicles the young lives of two sisters, spirited Marianne and the more stable Elinor. After being driven away from home by their step-brother and his wife, the Dashwood family (Mrs. Dashwood, Marianne, Elinor, and younger sister Margaret) settles down in a small cottage in the countryside.Each sister proceeds to fall in love in her unique way: Elinor quietly and seriously loves somewhat-awkward Edward, while Marianne impetuously and passionately gives her heart to the dashing Willoughby. As with most of Austen's works, disparity in social class and inconsistencies in personality cause the lovers turmoil.Austen uses some of the satirical techniques that are so prevalent of her other works. While not as funny as her other satires, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY presents some characters' absurdities quite well.When I read this at the age of 14 or so, I did not enjoy it nearly as much.

But like a truly masterful artist, she can write, essentially, the same story over and over again and still have it be exciting and interesting for all readers. This is a book that can be appreciated by anyone over the 6th grade, and possibly younger. It is a classic that should be a part of any avid reader's repetoire."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; Jane Austen's first published novel (1811), tells the intertwined stories of two contrasting sisters, the lively, passionate, impulsive Marianne and the reserved, self-disciplined, dutiful Elinor. Both experience love, heartache, and eventual happiness in marriage, and both have their beliefs and value systems tested. A host of memorable, comic minor characters combine with the principal heroines and heroes to develop a tale that is both lively and thought provoking, humorous and psychologically astute. Anyone who has ever struggled with conflicts between spontaneity and caution, heart and head, can identify with the central characters of this novel.This edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes a number of helpful supplementary materials that enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the novel. Excerpts from contemporary texts clarify the historical context of the terms \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility.\\" Among the works included are selections from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a classic example of the novel of sensibility, and Maria Edgeworth's &quot;Letters of Julia and Caroline,&quot; an earlier novel of contrasting female characters, in this case two friends, one of whom is sensible and the other romantic and impractical. The edition also includes the whole of Jane Austen's &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; (sic), a hilarious parody of sentimental fiction written when Austen was fourteen. Besides background materials, the volume includes four essays from recent critics that represent a range of different interpretations of the novel.Finally, the introduction provides useful biographical and historical information and outlines a variety of critical approaches to the novel: some critics believe Elinor is clearly the favored sister and the sense she embodies the preferred value system; some critics by contrast believe the novel either consciously or unconsciously betrays sympathy for Marianne and the sensibility she represents; and other critics believe the novel advocates a middle ground between sense and sensibility, according to which both sisters need to abandon aspects of their initial beliefs and adopt attitudes and behaviors associated with the other sibling. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and formulaic, but those who read the novel along with the various background, critical, and introductory essays in this volume should discover a work that is richly complex, ambiguous, and many-sided in its exploration of the competing values of emotion and reason, spontaneity and restraint, and personal fulfillment versus duty to others."},{"Title":"Sense And Sensibility (CH) (Jane Austen Collection)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson."},{"Title":"Rhetorica ad Herennium (Loeb Classical Library)","review":"Essentially a very short treatise, hard to believe it was written over 2,000 years ago. Nothing he says is outdated, except the names. Old age should be a time of learning and gardening, according to Cicero. And conversation with friends. Old age will be what we bring to it by our past lives, both in soundness of body and character and temperament. We do not change as we age. How true this is! My own parents were no different than they had always been. His belief in the division of body and soul, and in the immortality of the soul, is just what the Catholic Church teaches today. Old age is blessedly free of the passions and sensations of youth. We should begin to separate from the body.

The commentary in this book is one of the worst I have ever seen in a Classical text. It provides translations for the most simple of phrases, such as \\"Leges enim silent\\" (the laws are silent), but little to no grammatical help on any of the half to full page long sentences. When the commentary does address these harder passages, it simply gives a translation with no explanation of how it reached that translation/ the grammatical function of the words and clauses. Furthermore, the editor felt compelled to insert hundreds (perhaps thousands, no lie) of punctuation marks that make absolutely no sense and trick/misguide the reader rather than offer any help at understanding what Cicero is trying to say; for example, \\"eum, qui se defendisset, contra rem publicam fecisse, sed, cum invenisset...\\" (pg. 6). The only comma out of those I just cited that has any reason to exist is the one before 'sed.'This edition's only saving grace is the commentary by Asconius that is included; otherwise, I'd give it only one star."},{"Title":"Rhetorica ad Herennium (Loeb Classical Library)","review":"Apparently, they scanned an old copy of Cicero's work, and let the OCR software do all the work.

After that, the hijacker looses his villinous character and the story does not keep you on your toes. On the other hand, there are some chapters that include mild shootings, FBI happenings, and close calls in the airplane.

If such a tome were printed today, it would be instantly labeled racist and appropriately. The fact that Haygood was condemned for being too accepting of blacks then shows how far we have come as a people.

The book contains a number of contibutors - various experts in their field - all of which destoys many of the notions and myths about gun control. I've used the book (and actually I bought a second copy after the first was worn out) as the bible to educate people to the realities Kates brings to light. Kates continues to write and debate his stand and has written other books continuing this theme."},{"Title":"Restricting Handguns: The Liberal Skeptics Speak Out","review":"I read this book shortly before encountering James D. Wright and Peter Rossi's 1983 \\"Under the Gun\\" which was the commercial publication of a study began under the Carter Administration DOJ \\"Weapons, Crime and Violence in America\\".At least for me, these two books marked a sea change in the academic look on guns, gun control, and the beginning of the recognition that there are benefits to guns that must be weighed against the costs in formulating gun policy.Two things stick out in my mind without me re-reading the book.One, British firearms researcher Colin Greenwood points out that British gun crime and in particular misuse of handguns was lower before the first major national gun law, the 1920 Firearms Act, and every gun law since then has been accompanied by more gun crime, not less in Britain. When you look at recent British crime stats, the very crime rate that is most likely to be deterred by defensive guns in the home--home invasion robbery or \\"hot burglary\\"--is higher in Britain that in the USA.Two, Kales tells of going to Mississippi as part of the black voter registration campaign in the 1960s. Kates was armed for self-defense; his companion was appalled. Kates had a well-thought-through defensive-only philosophy, but his companion was stridently anti-self-defense and anti-gun. When Kates met the same person later, he had become a radical bomb thrower, but Kates was still a man who prefered non-violence but had a self-defense ethic.Since a lot of gun control politics is still stuck in the 1960s, this 1979 book is a valid source for understanding the issues of today."},{"Title":"Adam M-1","review":"While I've always been a fan of William C.

Mike Hammer is having doubts about whether he is a mindless killer who deserves to live or a normal man with a quick temper. By the end of the novel Mike Hammer has the answer.BTW, the \\"MVD\\" that Spillane constantly refers to is the Soviet Secret Police, this organization has been called the \\"CHECKA\\", \\"NKVD\\", and \\"SMERSH\\".

Mike Hammer is out of sorts after being scolded by a judge who condemns him as a murderer (although unconvicted). A bit sensitive, Mike takes a lone walk which brings him to a lonely bridge where this story begins with an attempted murder, Mike killing the assassin and the intended victim, scared out of her wits, jumping off the bridge to her death. Mike covers up his own involvement and finds, in searching the man's pockets, a green card. (It turns out its a club card to a Commie (the book's word) organization meant on destroying America as we know it. (The year is 1951, the height of the \\"Red Scare\\")It's all suspense and tough as nails action on the part of Mike after that. What's interesting is how much of the political talk, rants against the people in political office, is the same talk we hear today. Indeed, given the debate about politics today this book could be as relevent today as in 1951 in that regard.Mike is also throughout the book considering the judge's words. Is he a murderer as evil as any other? I'm not giving any of the story away by saying that by the end of the book he determines he is...and that's OK for he has one difference, he kills only bad guys.

But, in some uncommon and difficult-to-explain way, the books of each are decidedly different.First, the issues of \\"One Lonely Night\\" involve more than greed - the impetus for murder and mayhem in Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\" This book involves stolen documents containing \\"information of destruction.\\" Papers of mass destruction. Microfiche.And, this book involves speeches, news alerts and fears about the Commies. The political hero tells the, \\". . . nation of the calamity that had befallen it.\\" Americans were warned \\". . . with a special bulletin that told of all ports being watched, the roundup of suspected aliens . . . The world was in an uproar when the stuff was safe as hell . . . \\" Written in 1951, it may seem dated, but recent events are making it retro.The fear mongers in this fictional account mirror those that administer our union today. Each has an agenda, each has a cause for its igniting a match to fear's kindling. But, in order to prevent ruining this novel - I tell you that the underlying reasons for the fear mongers of this book are hopefully different than those reasons of our political leaders. Oh, how I hope it is so.Hammer is cool. He gets in on with women, he smokes Lucky Strikes, he measures his drinking by the bottle - not the glass, and he kills a lot of people. And, each of those people deserve death. Torturous death. Slow, painful, excruciatingly slow and painful death. But, for the most part they are blown away by his 45.Like Hammett and others of this genre, the similes and hyperbole are wonderfully unique and blue collar. Occasionally, metaphors further color the writing which made Spillane rich and famous - probably two attributes he was not concerned to obtain, but felt no inhibition in accepting the former as it would increase his ability to womanize like his Hammer.This book is good fun."},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"Mickey Spillane's popularity in the 1950s was meteoric. This novel is a prime example of Spillane at his snarling best. The anti-Communist hysteria of post WWII America is the backdrop of this tale of lonely death and bloody vengeance. \\"One Lonely Night\\" is the archetype Mike Hammer story. All the classic elements are present, most particularly Velda, Hammer's delectable secretary. A young woman's dive off a New York bridge draws Hammer into mystery-adventure mayhem. A nest of Commie (the vernacular is everywhere) spies is hard at work on the streets of New York. Unrestrained by official red tape, and at loggerheads with the authorities, Hammer embarks on a typical one-man war against the Russian-based MVD (whatever that is). Spillane's prose is as rough as his fictional alter ego. What the writing lacks in literary style, it gains in attitude and action. Hammer's earthy first person narrative enhances the character. The underside of the big city comes alive. The body count is large. The sex is raw rather than erotic. The climactic scene in the warehouse, on the inevitable rainy night, is compelling. As Velda hangs naked by a rope from the ceiling, the guy with the scythe and the black cowl stalks at Hammer's side and the machine gun belches blue flame and thunder. The day of the guns prevails. Good reading for genre fans and those who enjoy Mickey Spillane's viewpoint. ;-)"},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"The centerpiece of this book is the chasing down of an innocent woman by a commie thug, because the commie thug has a gun, and in New York only commie thugs have guns. This scene is really well done, as is the rest of the book. Anyway fortunately \\"our hero\\" happens to be in the neighborhood..."},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"Hard-hitting is the phrase that most accurately describes the character of Mike Hammer, he is as tough as they come in the private investigating business. The setting of this novel is the early 1950's, at the height of the red scare. Therefore, if you have little knowledge about the frenzy over communist infiltration of American society, then you will have trouble understanding the context.When the story opens, Mike has just been chastised by a judge for his tendency to kill people and he wanders to a bridge. A frightened woman comes towards him and she is followed by a menacing man with a gun. Mike kills the man and the woman is so terrified that she jumps off the bridge to her death.This involves Mike in infiltrating a communist cell, working behind the scenes to aid a decent politician and openly getting engaged to his secretary Velda. The dialog is fervent anti- communist, Hammer repeatedly describes them as vile, vicious and vermin to be killed without remorse. He succeeds in that mission, avenging many wrongs and using the combination of many wrongs to construct a major right.It takes a specific kind of mentality or approach to enjoy the Mike Hammer stories authored by Mickey Spillane. If you find it difficult to absorb brutal killing and the toughest of tough guy dialog, then you will find this difficult reading. It is not spellbinding reading by any means, it is just about a hard man managing in a hard world."},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"This book came out when America was all aflutter with the Communist scare. China had gone Red. The Soviets had \\"the bomb.\\" We were at war (correction, \\"police action\\") in Korea. And Tailgunner Joe was in his ascendancy. Mickey Spillane's earlier Mike Hammer novels had been apolitical for the most part. The villains were just hoods, gangsters, motivated by money.With \\"One Lonely Night\\" Spillane went full-bore anti-communist, without much understanding of the threat beyond the Chicken Little the-sky-is-falling outcry. The reality was that American communists were self-styled intellectuals talking revolution in darkened Greenwich Village espresso shops. The laboring class Marx so adored were not having any of it, and the threat wasn't much of a threat at all.But Spillane made straw men out of the commies and shot them down. And somehow Mike Hammer was the loser for it. As a young man in the 1950's I admired the prose in Spillane's first few novels--and then I came to this one and was weaned. He was way off the mark, but I forgot that until I picked this up again after a hiatus of five decades or so.I will admit that the first chapter is a gem of writing, perhaps the best Spillane ever did. But one gem is not enough to get the book much praise. It's just barely enough to get it two stars from me."},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer was such a huge phenomenon in the early 50s that you'll miss out on all sorts of references in popular culture if you don't read him-- at least one of his inimitably gritty books. This is as good as any (though the first, \\"I, The Jury,\\" is the most logical start). Mike is a full-bore psychopath who hears music in his head when he's gone nuts for violence, who relishes beating and blowing big holes in people whom he's identified as deserving it: commies mostly, but criminals and egg-headed pantywaists of all descriptions had better watch it too. This is beyond parody, since Spillane's writing is already so loopy that it can't be made fun of effectively. But the guy sold FIFTY MILLION BOOKS in a few years' time in the early fifties, so it's impossible to overestimate his effect on the culture of the time.No joke: read one and see. It's good fun, though the plots are a bit transparent by contemporary standards."},{"Title":"One Lonely Night","review":"I should preface this review by owning that I'm not a fan of Mickey Spillane. I understand his importance to the genre, and when he's at what I think of at his best, then I can enjoy his novels. But he isn't really to my taste, so consider that a fair disclosure of bias._One Lonely Night_ tells the story of Hammer, returning angry and bitter from a trial where he is excoriated for \\"knocking off somebody who needed knocking off bad\\". Hammer is shaken and wonders if the judge's view of him is really true and accurate, whether he really is such a bad guy. While in the midst of this reverie, Hammer runs across a girl being chased by a bad man. He kills the bad man, but fails to save the girl as she jumps to her death rather than be part of whatever it was she was involved in. Naturally, Spillane gets involved, and as the plot expands to threaten his beautiful Vera, he gets very involved indeed.The book seems like it's thumbing its nose at critics who accuse Hammer of being too violent. He has to be violent, it seems to say, the world is a dangerous place and violence and vigilence go hand-in-hand.This book contains much of what I dislike most about Spillane's writing-- the simple black and white approach to good and evil, the obsession with the communist conspiracy, and stupid society dames who get messed up in the wrong element and don't deserve to live.To be fair, many people find this one of Spillane's best works, but I really prefer the more crime-oriented Hammer books such as _Kiss Me, Deadly_."},{"Title":"The Letters of Peter Paul Rubens","review":"If you wonder why Rubens is so well respected and you can't appreciate his art, try reading him.

(homage to The Cisco Kid)"},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"This book exemplifies the &quot;quiet craftsmanship&quot; for which Cozzens has been praised (in Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia, I believe). His style is clean and understated; his plotting is as always complex yet tight; his observations of people are dead-on. But what, in my opinion, really puts this novel above Cozzens's other works is its portrayal of the &quot;life&quot; of a modern complex organization (in this case, the U.S. Army during WWII). American society's transformation from an individualistic focus to an organizational one, which reached completion during FDR's presidency, is one of the most significant developments during the past century and a quarter. Yet almost no novelist has attempted to deal with this transformation artistically, and certainly none has done it as well as Cozzens does here. This book's straightforward style conceals its immense importance."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Although the once enormously popular James Gould Cozzens is all but forgotten today, his 1948 novel GUARD OF HONOR is a big, splendid, riveting piece of work which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The action, presented essentially in real time, centers on three days at a big Florida airbase in l943 and its hapless new commander. What makes this book particularly noteworthy is how the many threads of its tremendously complex plot effortlessly come together - rather like a very skilled wind band leaderlessly playing one of the Mozart serenades. It convincingly shows how small, seemingly random events can collide and build to something far greater than their sum. I've been pushing this neglected minor masterpiece for decades. I was delighted, therefore, to learn that GUARD OF HONOR been reissued by the Modern Library. The event was marked by a generous tribute to the book by, rather surprisingly, the jazz critic Whitney Balliett in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Cozzens' masterful social novels, of which &quot;Guard of Honor&quot; is the towering apex, have been erased from the history of American literature by its guardian - the academic establishment - because of his thorny conservatism and unadorned steel-and-rivets prose style. It's our loss. If you compare the ambition and artistic discipline of this wise and sober novel to, say, the latest annual installment of navel-gazing from Philip Roth (to name a writer who enjoys a comparable level of esteem today), you can only shake your head at the profound dumbing-down of our culture.Inasmuch as only a fraction of any armed force directly participates in combat, this stunningly broad study of a Florida air force base in the latter stage of World War II is actually more relevant to the history of our participation in that struggle than a book like &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;. And its look at an early chapter in the unfinished story of race integration in America is arguably more germane than ever, although its conclusions do not sit comfortably. (No televised talking head could hope to express them and still keep his job.) If you're interested in a truly adult novel, in the best sense of the word, you can't do much better than this one."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Guard of Honor is a book about fighting a war in which not a single bullet is fired in anger. Readers looking for blood and glory will find it here only in the refracted light of the home front. But, this book IS about blood and glory; as well as boredom, loneliness, stupidity, comradeship, insanity, bureaucracy, death and many other things associated with the armed forces.Cozzens decision to place his novel in Florida during World War II actually allows him to analyze the military culture in the minutest detail without the adrenaline distraction that actual combat would produce. It's a risky choice, but it works brilliantly.The story contains a bewildering number of characters but is centered around two generous and kind men: Colonel Ross and Captain Hicks. Ross represents the command structure trying to hold an unwieldy organization together through the insanity of war. Hicks is the common man thrown into the same situation. How their lives play out is the heart of the book.If you want explosions and gore, this book is not for you. If you want to know how the military lives, thinks and breathes read this book and cherish its portrait of a world very different from civilian life."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"James Gould Cozzens is the antithesis of Joseph Heller. Guard of Honor occurs in wartime America. It occurs over a three day period and is centered around an event that has racial and class undertones. It is populated with flesh and blood people and not charicatures. It has a point of view but that is revealed gradually and over the course of the entire book. Built, bit by bit, as the players in this drama come into view, interact with each other and depart to be seen again later, sometimes in a different light; seen from someone else's perspective, filtered through the lens of events recalled or experienced. People are revealed by how they react to other people in diverse situations undergoing set backs or good fortune. Heller wished to show that war is ludicrous, Cozzens wished to show that war is, and that people are complex and that what they do and what they think about what they do, matters. That actions taken today and the next day make us who we will be tomorrow and that there are no inconsequential choices. He shows that venality is the default setting and conscious effort must be made to overcome it. Reading this book is like looking in a mirror and hoping that you can do something about what you see before it's too late. My only quibble with Cozzens is his tendency to drop acronyms, literary allusions and unattributed quotes throughout his work leaving you feeling slightly inadequate to the task of reading him.I come to Cozzens late. I intend to read this book often."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"If a contemporary reader is looking for one novel that captures with unerring precision the nature of the military and society in World War II, look no further than &quot;Guard of Honor.&quot; The setting is authentic, and the characters are drawn with abundant sympathy and an utter lack of remorse. The issues, the personalities, the key incident -- all reflect Cozzens' skill deep insight into human nature and the nature of military bureaucracies, the latter resulting from his service on the Air Corps staff during the war. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"The best book about the U.S. Army during the Second World War, Guard of Honor is a forgotten classic and would be turned into a 4-hour movie if anyone could be bothered. A tour-de-force of detail, simple and accurate. A Dickens of a novel"},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Guard of Honor is NOT about World War II, though it is convincingly set at a Florida airbase during the War. It is about human character, the ways we create situations in our (and others') lives and how we solve those situations -- including the situation of racial prejudice. But it's not a book about race, either. Read it -- you'll go back to it again and again, year after year, for new lessons that still apply to our lives today. Persevere."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"A novel of intricate characterizations of a huge number of participants in a bureaucracy, Guard of Honor would probably appeal more to lovers of Great Literature than to lovers of a Good Story Well Told. It is a very long and detailed book. What plot there is involves attempts of some of the lead characters to avoid doing the morally-correct action. Few characters are likeable; few have much integrity. The author likes very long sentences; many paragraphs are absolutely incomprehensible. The ending was quite unsatisfactory to me. However, all those characters are distinctive and memorable - not a small achievement. And, the author certainly understands the dynamics of a bureaucracy. The book is enjoying a small revival due to a rave review in the American Scholar magazine."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Unlike many war books, which focus on either the glory or horror of battle, or both, Cozzens looks at troubles on the home front during World War II. His setting is a Florida airbase, and the action centers around the arrival of black pilots who are being trained as part of an experiment in integrating the cockpit. A few whites support the effort, a few more oppose it, but most characters are more concerned with their own self interest than with larger moral issues. The common desire to win the war doesn't eliminate social problems at home, nor does it trump human pettiness. Cozzens weaves together several interlocking stories, and while the final fabric lacks the exquisite integration that a truly great writer might achieve, it all manages to hold together in the end. Likewise his prose, while occasionally capable of taking flight, is generally adequate but workmanlike. This book is well worth reading, but go into it expecting a very good novel, not a towering classic of WWII literature."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book thinking it was on the same level as \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" or \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" but I was sorely disappointed. It's simply boring even while there's supposedly a world war going on. What's worse is there's no discernible plot. Another reviewer suggested sticking to Herman Wouk and I agree. His three books: \\"The Caine Mutiny\\", \\"The Winds of War\\" and \\"War and Remembrance\\" are about the best WWII novels that I know of."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"This is a pitiful excuse for a novel. I read about 6 books a month, and rarely, once I have started one, do I give up on it. After about 150 pages I threw this one in the trash. I wouldn't even give it to a friend or donate it to charity. It defiles the paper it is written on...why? Because it is soooo booooring. Rather than wade thru this thing, paint a wall and watch it dry."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"This is surely a msterful novel, though I would caution against depicting this as strictly a World War II epic. Anyone who thinks this has only nostalgic value is mistaken. It is classic in every way. Gripping and mesmorizing at once, with moments of astounding resonance for today. \\"20/20\\" covered (01/09)last night the salaries of employees high and low, the way they are valued, with the result being according to their \\"usefulness.\\" In this war yarn, various ranked individuals maneuver to avoid blame and scandal, etc. and it plays out according to their usefulness to command figures; in other words war or peace, it remains the same. Whenever the plot movement lags and minor things intrude, Cozzens' palette of description never fails to amaze. Reading this work, I now realize where \\"Sgt. Bilko,\\" \\"Hogans Heroes,\\" and \\"MASH,\\" derived their inspiration from. The human comedy known as \\"life\\" survives within \\"Guard Of Honor's\\" pages in sweeping form. Makes no difference whether on base or in a large corporation, the class mentality survives. Which leaves us with the question to success, whether it will be determined by genetics or usefulness. Base life is much like a city within a city and Cozzens' succeeds in his entertaining military back drop to the human struggle. Cozzens makes it clear that the bullets and shells we avoid are not on the battlefield alone, no?"},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"A powerful examination of a Florida air base during World War II, told with intelligence and care, populated with many fascinating characters, and while I prefer his later By Love Possessed, Guard of Honor is still a must read."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"Cozzens takes the &quot;war behind the scenes&quot; and makes it realthrough detailed characterizations. He makes it easy tobecome interested in the war because the reader begins to&quot;know&quot; the people involved."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"A gem too often passed up. May be a man's book, but I like it as well. Good for picking up and rereading."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"One reviewer called &quot;Guard of Honor&quot; a &quot;Dickens of a novel&quot;, and it's easy to see what he was getting at: a big book, bustling with characters and situations, covering a time and place from many angles to make a detailed portrait...that's what Charles Dickens did best, and that's what Cozzens certainly INTENDS to do, but it simply does not come off. There is just too much fat here, too many long, long scenes that go nowhere and provide no particular insight, too many long, long conversations that all too obviously serve only to mouth the author's philosophy, too much anticipation for too little payoff. Buried far underneath all this is a good story, a great writing style, and a few good characters. Critic Noel Perrin's singular enthusiasm for this novel is touching, but this is NOT the great novel of World War 2. Leave that to Mr. Jones or Mr. Wouk."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"If you are interested in an \\"action packed\\" war novel, a story of the lowely soldier's traumas and disillusionment, or even a book with a insightful, reflective social message, keep shopping--Guard of Honor is not for you! I usually avoid \\"action packed\\" books, and even though the realities of war often require some sense of trauma and disillusionment (at least for troops in combat positions), I can appreciate a book about the mundane lives of state-side officers responsible for turning the gears. But despite assessments of this as a \\"mature\\" work--one which my 27 year old brain can't yet comprehend (an insulting and meaningless implication I have found in much critical literatue and discussions about the book)--its fundamental lack of a meaningful social message and reflective potential for contemporary readers are more responsible for its relegation to the dustbin of literary history than the imagined \\"liberal bent\\" of the so-called \\"academic establishment.\\"Foremost, Guard of Honor reads like a manifesto. Its characters are shallow and seemingly created to make a point, not to depict human life and experience. Cozzens' point, it seems in reading the novel, his war diaries (A Time of War: Air Force Diaries and Pentagon Papers 1943-45), and the work of leading (only?) Cozzens biographer Matthew Bruccoli, is to support deceptive and secretive policies--I won't spoil the plot, but the Brass makes huge blunders in the novel. One such policy is to perpetuate segregation despite direct orders from the Pentagon to stop segregation (this happens at the beginning, not a spoiler). Certainly, Cozzens uses very fancy rhetoric and logic to rationalize such decisions and depict Lt. Edsell, the sole character with a sense of egalitarian justice, as a \\"sorehead,\\" a Communist sympathizer, and an ignorant liberal idealist. This is only one of many instances in which shallow characters are conjured to lay another rail for the crazy train that is this novel's plot and ideology.I read the whole book, less annoyed by the over 600 pages (maybe 100 actually developing the novel in a significant and disciplined way) than by the novel's self-serving ideological constructions. The end of the novel gave me little to ponder and reflect upon, besides deepening disgust for the elitism and prejudices Guard of Honor exists to justify. What else can we expect from an author many critics (rightfully) see as the writer of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) establishment in the pre-Civil Rights U.S.?To be fair, Cozzens is stylistically gifted, constructing many beautiful and dense paragraphs and sections, for which I am awarding an extra star. Unless you're a huge war novel buff (and feel like you have to read them all), or have some direct experience in the military (and are thus able to parse the jargon in the novel), read Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead or Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny instead. They're far superior World War II novels, even if perhaps stylistically inferior to Cozzens' Guard of Honor (who had ten novels under his belt at the beginning of the war; considered in that light, the \\"mature\\" Cozzens should be way out of their league, not comparable, at best)."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"This book left me with too many unanswered questions. The biggest question was in regards to the racial incident. How did the black soldiers feel? Cozzens makes no attempt to answer this question with a character portrait of one of the black soldiers; all the portraits were of white officers. There are a lot of loose ends that needed to be tied up. There are so many characters, it's hard to keep track of who's who. Cozzens also has a very dry style of writing that left me cold emotionally.Still, since the story was only limited to 3 days, it was intersting that he did leave so many loose ends. How many of our life stories and problems are tied up in such a brief period of time? How many members of a large organization affect the days events? This book was a kind of &quot;literature verite&quot; merely documenting 3 days in the life of an army base. The confusion of the officers is apparent in the fact that no single person knew all the facts. Obviously we do. These aspects gave this book the extra star. All the same I cannot thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Guard of Honor","review":"I had a difficult time relating to this book and enjoying the characters.

He still lives in New York and sees his old friends from his childhood in Coney Island. His friends don't seem to respect him, either.He sees an opportunity to change his life when he meets an old university friend, the Protestant Ralph Newsome, who used to copy all of Gold's course work and who got better grades for it. Newsome now works for the President, who is impressed by Gold's writings, and a high government position is dangled in front of Gold. To ease his way into the government, he duly decides to divorce his old wife and marry a daughter of a rich establishment family. This leads to humiliation at the hands of the father of that family. \\"You have aspirations and regrets and feelings of inferiority and I don't,\\" Pugh Biddle Conover tells Gold.The novel takes place in the late 1970s, after Henry Kissinger's stint as Secretary of State with presidents Nixon and Ford. Gold has been collecting materials about Kissinger for years and plans to write a book about him. Gold detests Kissinger, as does everyone else in the book. Kissinger is \\"a noisy, babbling fellow who was always trying too hard to be entertaining and made war like a Nazi,\\" Conover says. To which, Gold says, \\"please don't put me in the position of defending the one person on earth I disapprove of most.\\"Conover mocks Gold as a Jew and for his political aspirations. Both Conover and Gold's father believe that Jews have no place in government and that Kissinger was an aberration.Gold is well aware of Kissinger's infamies: \\"his role in the Cambodian war, in which an estimated 500,000 died,\\" and his involvement in overthrowing the Allende government in Chile. Yet, when Gold angrily asserts that Kissinger wasn't even a Jew, is it because Gold really does detest Kissinger or is it because Gold himself wants to be the first Jewish Secretary of State?This is a very good novel. Some objections, however, have been made about the ending. Without revealing it, I will say that the unexpected event is the sort of thing that jolts people back into reality, as it does to Gold. Another criticism of the book is the stuff on 1970s politics and events. In my opinion, there wasn't too much of that and also I thought that by mentioning these things, it made the novel more realistic.\\"Good as Gold\\" has been unfavorably compared with \\"Catch-22.\\" They are different books, despite some similarities (for example, the government officials that Gold encounters could easily have stepped out of \\"Catch-22\\"). \\"Catch-22\\" is a book mainly about young men and appeals to readers in their 20s (perhaps the only time in their lives they will ever read novels); \\"Good as Gold\\" deals with the themes of the middle-aged. It is a book about a mid-life crisis and dealing with aging family members.It is also a book about an outsider desperately wanting to be an insider and how far he will go to get ahead. Gold believes Kissinger is vile and yet...It's a useful novel because it records a phenomena that occurs again and again in American life. Perhaps another novel about ambition will be written some day about a protagonist who gazes with disgust and envy on Colin Powell or Condoleezza Rice, instead of Kissinger. Until then, we have \\"Good as Gold.\\""},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"It so apropos today. Bruce Gold has a job at the White House... to make sure the politicians say absolutely nothing of any importance at all, but sound like they are. This book is biting. Hilarious. I have read all his books and oddly enough while I loved Catch-22, and Something Happened, this one sticks with me. It is all about the Orwellian newspeak which I seem to hear everywhere these days. But done with a wicked sense of humour. Laugh out loud funny. The best political satire I have ever read."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"Good As Gold is Joseph Heller's third masterpiece. Heller, who sadly left us in 1999, was notorious for taking an eternity between books (13 years between his first two.) And, although this may be true, one thing is certain: when Joe Heller delivers a book, it's a guaranteed masterpiece. Every new Heller release is an event. Good As Gold is as good as the best of them. By turns screamingly funny and heart-piercingly true, this is one of the few books that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. The book works simultaneously on multiple levels. It is a fable of \\"The Jewish Experience\\" in America; it is a satiric and highly biting look at the hypocrisy and incompetence at work in everyday government affairs; it is a funny and all-too-sad peek into the lives of the typical American extended family (you could also see the entire thing as an attack on Henry Kissinger - indeed, the only complaint I have about the book is that Heller sometimes follows this tangent too far.) The book, as always with Heller, is very cleverly written. There are no numbered chapters: instead, the book is split into a number of different sections, all with a certain title, which also happen to be titles of works being written by the protagonist (who is, among other things, a writer) - in this way, the book plays out the very story and experience it is purporting to have the main character write himself. An essential read from the greatest American author of the second half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"Bruce Gold, an apathetic professor, is offered the chance for success, fame and fortune in Washinton D.C. But, he must first reshape his life, which may mean cutting out his wacky family. Furthermore, he's faced with the task of writing about the Jewish experience in America, but isn't sure he's lived it and thus has to figure out what it is. So, starts Good as Gold.The novel starts somewhat slowly, with sometimes tiring descriptions of Gold's get-togethers with his strange family. These are somewhat boring in the early part of the book, but do become more entertaining as the book goes on once they begin to become funny. The memembers of his family are strange, particularly his father, mother-in-law and brother. They bring the most entertainment to the family scenes as Gold faces the frustration of dealing with his father's incorrigibility, his mother-in-law's hostility towards him and his brother's prodding and teasing.The story certainly has laugh-out-loud moments, particularly the scenes in which Gold is conversing with his friend in Washingtong Ralph, who is very vague in what he does and has a contradictory way of speaking. Moreover, is the strange Andrea Conover, a beautiful women in love who with Gold, yet wants to continue her relationships with other men and doesn't see why that would bother Gold. The sexual escapades of Gold are quite entertaining as he seems to have no trouble attracting beautiful women with strange behavior.The problem with this book is that although it certainly has many funny moments, it doesn't exactly seem to go anywhere. The reader is exposed to quite a few scenes with Gold's family, but maybe a little bit too much. It would have been nice to see more events unfold in Washington D.C., as scenes dealing with politicians are probably the funniest. The story doesn't have much in the way of plot development, but rather numerous funny moments with family, politicians and women. Moreover, the worst parts of the book were the sections dealing with Henry Kissinger. Gold despises him and sometimes whole pages are boringly dedicated to discussion of Kissinger. It bogs down the book.I've read Catch-22 by Heller and this certainly isn't as funny, but it does have its own hilarity and ridiculous moments worth of quite a few laughs. It isn't great, but I think it's worth reading if you're really interested. I actually give it a little above 3 stars, but not enough to warrant 4."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"In \\"Good as Gold\\", Joseph Heller does for Washington what he did to the military in \\"Catch-22\\". As a fan of Heller's other works, I had high expectations for this book. While I thought there were a lot of humorous moments, it is a notch slightly below \\"Catch-22\\" and \\"Something Happened\\".Welcome to Washington where if something is not working, try the opposite. In Washington, everybody has a job working for the government yet nobody knows what their job is. It makes far less sense than the politics of high school homecoming queen. Enter Bruce Gold. Bruce Gold lives a paradox like the one in Washington. His family lacks respect for him despite his achievements. He is a college professor and author, yet his father respects his high school dropout brother more. When the president likes his writing, Gold seems to be a shoe-in in the president's inner-circle. But first, Gold needs a wife that is not so dumpy. Other extra-marrital affairs might also help his career. Gold has his sights set on the Secretary of State, but he needs more connections and places more stress on his pressured integrity. At this point, Gold wonders if it is all worth the price he is paying. His family still hates him and his soon-to-be second wife is far inferior to the first wife. Is Washington really worth the trouble?There were a lot of aspects of this book that I liked. I do not feel that the story engaged me in the same way some of Heller's books did. The story just seemed to go to long in some areas and lost me. Heller is a very gifted writer and one of my favorites. I would still recommend this book to others. 4 1/2 stars would be a more appropriate rating."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"Joseph Heller is probably the only writer who could always make me laugh out loud. This is a book about a college professor and writer who gets a chance to go to Washington to work for the President. An old friend of his works at the White House and invites him to come to work there, but won't tell him what the job is or when he can start. The friend tells Gold that they want to make a big announcement about the appointment, but want to keep it secret. Everything this guy says is an oxymoron.Meanwhile, his family is driving him crazy. His father and step mother live in Florida during the winters, but come back to New York for the summer. The whole family is anxious for them to go back to Florida, but they keep stalling. Gold's brother makes idiotic comments, constantly badgering him and trying to get him into a fight. Gold is always being put into a position where he can either argue and look like he's showing off, or ignore the comment and be criticized for ignoring the mistake in his brother's comment.If you've enjoyed any of Joseph Heller's other books, this is more of the same, so you should get a kick out of this one too."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"This book tells the story of a Jewish English professor's trials and tribulations. It spans his family life (including his large extended family), his sex life (he has serious affairs with several people who are not his wife), and his professional life, both as a teacher and a writer. He has a friend in the White House who insists that he must join the government unless he musn't, an FBI man following him around who thinks he's a disgrace to the Jewish faith, and a big brother who delibrately misquotes scientific knowledge to draw him into arguments.All of these trials are scathingly sattirical, and often very funny. I was especially amused by the White House shenanigans, which sound a little too true to life, especially in light of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. My other favourite parts take place at the university, such as his admission that course descriptions and titles are written to attract students, not to reflect the course's content (e.g., the course &quot;Montheism and Monarchy from the Middle Ages to the Modern&quot; was actually a course on Shakespeare's tragedies and histories, &quot;except Julius Caesar because the Romans weren't monotheistic, and Othello, because there's no monarch&quot;). Other parts have not aged quite as well, but are still amusing.There are a few problems with the book however. At times, Heller gets carried away to the point of being vitriolic. While this is amusing in small doses, there are times in the book where several pages (say 4 or 5) are devoted to trashing Henry Kissinger, or denigrating Jews. It goes on so long that you get the impression that it's now Heller saying these things, and not the character, which moves the book out of sattire and into political science.All in all, however, if you can stand these overlong diatribes, it is an enjoyable and funny book. Maybe not quite as funny as Catch 22, but close."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"While it is undisputed that Heller is our greatest writer, there are some who would rate Catch-22 as his greatest work. Those people better take a second look at this book. The Gold family is unparalleled in our literature. Sid Gold is the perfect parody of Melville's Ishmael. Social commentary in the guise of comedy. While others have tried, only the true master Heller does it justice."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"I read this book 10 years ago, and it still remains vivid in my mind.

Poor, poor Gold. Or so we think at first, until he starts being glorified by the White House and his friend, Ralph, sometimes suspected of being anti-Semitic - yes, Gold is a Jew - offers him a job (unless he can't offer him a job), where he will be able to guarantee success and prosperity (unless he can't). Being promoted without even having a title, Gold climbs the government ladder, pleasing everyone with his bitter jokes that, for some reason, are appreciated because they are taken seriously. He separates from his wife (who barely seems to notice), he meets a Washington girl, Andrea, who he must marry in order to gain enough respect in the White House's eye to gain a respectable title, but Andrea wishes to marry him only when he achieves this title.

A friend of his, Ralph Newsome, has promised him an important place in the current administration. Newsome never really tells Gold what the job is and is constantly contradicting himself. He tells Gold innumerable times that the administration (the President) is very proud of his work, even though he hasn't really done any work at all. For example, he served on a committee that met only twice- long enough to have coffee. Then they dissolved the committee saying that their job was complete.

The jokes in this book are amusing about once (the Washington man and his refusal to pin anything down) but Heller hits the same note again and again . . . and then again and again, until it stops being funny. This book is far too long, far too little happens, and the characters are thin and poorly developed. Frankly, if I hadn't liked Catch-22 so much, I would have put this book down after about forty or fifty pages. Plus: knocking Henry Kissinger may have seemed incisive and topical when this book came out, but it isn't all that interesting today. Unlike Catch-22 (and, to a lesser extent, Something Happened) which still seem to be modern and relevant, this book has dated badly. It was unfortunate (and disappointing for me) because I think it proved Heller's talent to have clear limits, limits that he reached, for the most part, after two books."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"This book was a bit of a mixed bag for me. It is strongest in those parts where it most resembles Catch-22. Heller is extremely good at emphasizing the absurdity of bureaucracy, in any form. In this book he manages to take on politicians, higher education and big money, high society, all to great effect. The dialog in these portions of the book is a roller coaster of parody and cynicsm that \\"boggles the mind\\", to borrow a catch phrase from the book. This is Heller at his best.However, the portions of the book that deal with Gold's family and personal life left me disappointed. While Heller seems to be trying to take aim at family dysfunction, I just couldn't bring myself to care enough for these characters to really connect with any of the family strife. While there were moments of dialog that showed spark, most of the portions delving into Gold's personal life simply felt flat and monontonous, and slowed the entire pace of the book down."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"The funniest book ever written, but also a touching and meaningful one. It is about the price -- and ultimately the futility -- of escaping from the old neighborhood. It also a work that brilliantly lampoons the world of policy wonks, neo-cons, and academic charlatans. Back in the 70s Heller foresaw the new Dark Ages of the Reagan and post-Regan decades (although they wouldn't turn out to be nearly as funny). You can divide the world between people who don't \\"get\\" this book and those who do. The latter comprise a small fraternity for whom Good as Gold is the true Bible. It's a masterpiece, no matter what anybody says."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"This would have made a brilliant 20-page short story. Instead, it ballooned into a 450 page novel.I found the beginning quite clever and funny, with an odd mix of characters: the brother who states incorrect facts just to annoy Gold (our academic main character), the self-obsessed small-time publisher friend, the Washington man who promises everything and nothing in the same breath, contradicting himself outright with everything he says, the cantankerous and demanding father who keeps refusing to go for the winter to Florida, so he'll be out of his kids' way, the rich racist father of the nave yet trampish, smart yet stupid Washington lover.However, after about 50 pages, it became an ever duller round of the same scenes, played with minor differences: Unpleasant family dinners (what family on earth gets together so often while hating each other so much?) followed by unproductive Washinton meetings where he keeps getting promoted without having secured an actual job, followed by dull conversations with his wife or stupid ones with his lover, followed by his lover's father calling him by all sorts of Jewish-sounding last names that weren't his. All of these scenes are darkly funny. Once. But they get old fast, as do the way-exaggerated speech patterns of all his characters. I know Heller did all this on purpose, but it hindered my enjoyment.Most of the stuff about Kissinger and other 70s politics was lost on me, since I wasn't quite born then. The unremarkable political newspaper articles pasted into the text especially began to bother me. If I'd had more context, I probably would have enjoyed it me. Without context, I skimmed a lot. However, for someone more politically minded, or who remembers the 70s, I can see this being interesting.I also feel that if you're going to use up to 21 terms or entire phrases in a foreign language (Yiddish, I believe) on ONE page, and then continue this trend for several pages before and after, you need to at least give us enough context to understand half of the words.I suffered through numerous unpleasant uses of coarse language and bawdy humor, often placed so abruptly I couldn't avoid them. If that sort of thing bothers you, you might choose a different book.My favorite part is when our main character is heard saying \\"I don't know.\\" Washington picks it up as the best, most brilliant line ever. Apparently no one in Washington has ever said it before. It becomes the catch phrase, an stroke of honesty to be admired, a completely new concept. Great, insightful writing there.Now if Heller had only cut about 400 pages..."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"Joseph Heller hit it out of the park with this book! As a career military Soldier, I loved Catch 22, so when I came across this book I knew I had to have it. I've never been so tickled by the clever truth as seen by Heller. He finds the humor that is so much a part of political life and takes it to the logical conclusion. Most people can relate to the humor and how politicians often work in endless contradictions or non-committals.Heller exposes the journey of a Jewish professor (Gold) who finds himself on a mission to take a spot in government life. Gold doesn't really even know what he wants, and what is more he doesn't know what it takes to get there.Much of the book also revolves around anti-semitic humor that will crack you up!Gold strives to get into the President's cabinet and even gets promoted several times without ever getting a job. Throughout the book Gold realized that he has to give up so much that is truly cherished to get into government jobs and he finally realizes that it takes his soul."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"More proof of what a great author Joseph Heller was. This book rivals Catch 22 and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"i once read an interview of joseph heller in which he stated he came up with the idea for novels by coming up with an opening sentence. assuming that to be true here, this is a novel about the jewish experience. when we view this book from that perspective, we have a better appreciation of it. we have gold, who is out trying to write a book about the jewish experience, continually rejecting his jewish heritage. it is not until the end when he finally embraces it.the political humor is exaggerated and doesn't work as well as it did in catch 22 where the setting of war makes the absurd normal. his family life is archie bunker/michael like except for the very touching lunch between gold and his older brother sid. this conversation brought the family into focus.other characters like liebowicz and his fiancee's father border on the ridiculous and don't add a lot to the story.this is not vintage heller. suggest your reread catch 22 instead."},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"What happens to, and around Bruce Gold, a middle age Jewish professor teaching English literature in a Brooklyn college, during his short association with the White House. It could be read on many levels and from serval perspectives: a satire of Henry A. Kissinger; a parody of &quot;Eastern liberal establishment&quot;; a farce of the White House politics and politicians; a documentary of Jewish experience in America; a novel of American social life in (post) vietnam era. Family, work, career, life, death, desire, love, sex, races, religion, politics, truth, they are all there. A touching story that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time, a delicious dish sweet and bitter simultaneously, the best gourment food for thought.The ending is not very satisfactory to me, the return of Dr. Gold to his cultural and family roots is hasty, forced and out of character, this might be more due to the nature of the book, including the need of every book to have an end, than anything else. Some sexual contents are unnecessary, comparing their counterparts in &quot;Catch 22&quot;, they give a feeling of Heller playing pranks on readers. Or is that part of satire ?"},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"...But, then again, what is? I guess my expectations for this book were way too high. I loved &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and it ranks amongst my favorite books of all time. But &quot;Good As Gold&quot; seemed...off. It reads almost as if someone was trying to immitate Heller (a poor immitation at that). It was nearly as funny as &quot;Catch-22&quot;, nor was the humor as dark or ironic. It was absurd, for the most part. Only Ralph and the other Politicians in the book had lines with any real biting social criticism that were comparable to EVERYTHING EVERYONE said in &quot;Catch-22&quot;. It does make many interesting comments on politics in America, though frankly they are expessed elsewhere in a more productive manner. I found my copy at Half price books for about a buck, and I consider it worth that much, at least. In short, read &quot;Catch-22&quot;, if you just love it, read &quot;Good as Gold&quot; for a Heller-heroin fix...(I do need to write up my favorite quote from the novel though...from Ralph- &quot;American Democracy is the most rigid aristocracy on earth...&quot;)"},{"Title":"Good as Gold","review":"If being being Jewish in American means being immature, spiteful, and rude to your family, that doesn't make this book any less obnoxious.

Not just the exclusion of certain parts of the story (which has already been mentioned by other reviewers), most of which is given to us in an encapsulated form, but a lot of what is in the book just doesn't flow right. One of the most egregious examples comes pretty early in the story, there is a moment when the present day JLA is getting ready to go into the future, and Wonder Woman mentions that Batman didn't show up. Then, in the next panel we see the JLA being sent into the future and Batman is there! No explanation whatsoever is given as to how one panel before he wasn't there and then suddenly he was there. And there are many more instances like this throughout the book, which can be really confusing to the reader (not to mention irritating).Still, like I said, there is some good stuff here, and if you don't mind scratching your head from time to time trying to figure out just what in the world is going on, it's not a horrible read, but it should have been much better."},{"Title":"JLA: One Million","review":"Others have commented on how this is incomplete. This is why.This only has the JLA issues. There were cross-overs to all the major strips.

You don't get to see Captain Marvel - the current one - wake up in the distant future and create a new protege as he becomes the Wizard and helps the Flash fight the enemy. Yes, the current Captain Marvel, with long white hair and a white beard, slept for millennia.I know these details because I was reading the comics when this story-line came out.

The story includes Poirot's friend the mystery author Ariadne Oliver ( who bears a close resemblance to Agatha Christie).The book is narrated in the third person. It is always delicious fun when Poirot and Oliver join wits to defeat crime!Plot: Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist is attending a literary party. She meets the obesely odious Mrs Burton-Cox. This grand dame informs Ariadne that her stepson Desmond is planning to wed Cecilia Ravenscroft. Desmond is the son of Kathleen Fee who was the mistress of Mrs. Burton-Cox's first husband. Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurton-Cox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia' background. It is believed that Miss Ravencroft's parents committed suicide. Another theory is that Celia's father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him. The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel's action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants. This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murder/suicide. We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly. Dolly has spent time in a mental institution. She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths. Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son. Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read. It is not one of her greatest mysteries but is a good solid read. Well done Dame Agatha!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a die hard fan of Agatha Christie, especially Poirot. Even to me this novel was boring and dragging. There is very little story. The plot doesn't have the juice enough to sustain a novel. It could have done well as a short story.With the dog biting the mistress, I was able to guess the ending. I have never correctly guessed ever before when it came to Christie novels.At some point, the book felt more like a psychology book, only the contents may not be correct psychologically. I wish I hadn't started this book in the first place. There are a lot of repetitive events in the books which is really tiresome. Anyway, I wish a better experience to anyone who wants to read this book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense. There was not enough material for a novel in this story. Poor Poirot! Poor reader. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Detective novelist (and Christie alter ego) Ariadne Oliver has been coaxed into attending a literary party, something she, like Christie, did not enjoy and avoided whenever possible. Mrs. Oliver's experience at this one would ensure that it would be a long time before she attended another. An overbearing woman, Mrs. Burton-Cox manages to corner the author cross examine her about her goddaughter, one of many Mrs. Oliver has managed to acquire through the years. And now that the young woman, Celia, is quite grown up, one with which Mrs. Oliver has quite lost touch. It seems that Celia and Mrs. Burton-Cox's son are engaged, or will soon be, and Mrs. Burton-Cox wants to know if Celia's mother killed her father or did her father kill her mother. Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend, Hercule Poirot, for guidance in the matter. Soon the pair, each in their own unique way, begin to tackle the problems, re-establishing contact with Celia, investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. Burton-Cox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat, giving the reader more information into her (and perhaps Christie's) personal life, than any previous stories. It is interesting to see Oliver's and Poirot's different approaches to investigation, even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote, nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Christie books never disappoint. I haven't read one of her books in years, but I am reminded again why she is the gold standard against which all others are measured. In solving this puzzling mystery, Poirot must carefully pick through the often foggy memories of the \\"elephants\\" to get to the truth of the matter. Of course, he does, in his own fashion. I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This book was one of the worst Agatha Christie books I've ever read.

It beats other most other author's work, though!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Well,first of all I'd just like to start off by saying that Ms.Christie was not a charlatan writer.Her gift for writing was innate and affluent.( as illuminated in some of her better books).'Elephants Can Remember'is not a very rich novel and will certainly not make you bang your head against the wall.The ending is disappointing and the plot is somewhat infertile.As said by one of the reviewers,the climax is flat.I was not completely thrilled ,however,for Agatha Christie starters,give it a go!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Elephants Can Remember was one of Agatha Christie's last mysteries; in terms of rating I would rank it as slightly below \\"satisfactory.\\" While it is far from her best, it is not quite among her very worst, either.The weaknesses of Elephants Can Remember are several. First, there is a marked lack of action of any kind. Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past. Therefore, the whole book consists of conversations. There is never any danger or threat to anyone living, so there is no element of \\"excitement\\" as in most of Christie's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery, as it were, becomes fairly apparent to the reader about mid-way through; the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the reader/listener already knows. The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable. I won't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible, but that is never called into question. Her explanation for it, as it were, doesn't hold water.The only really excellent thing about this book is the narration."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Not her best work but an enjoyable read-I'm not an Ariadne Oliver fan so maybe thats why I didn't love it"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

No plot development, no mystery, tedious and predictable. I didn't read any of the reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of spoilers, and because as a die hard fan I had trust in Christie's work. But I had no idea this was her final book, or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it. I feel bad for her. She is truly a classic, and one of my favorite writers of all time. But I really wish I had skipped this one, and I recommend you do too."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I loved this book! I love horror and mystery books and I'm so glad I found Agatha Christie. I cant wait to read even more Agatha Christie books."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I found this late Agatha Christie novel disappointing compared to most of her earlier works. The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past. Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved. There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people, hashes things out in her mind, then tells Poirot what she was told, then he hashes things in his own mind, then he tells others, ... Uh! The same \\"fact\\" or \\"theory\\" is repeated in many places, to the point of insulting the reader's intelligence. This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose. Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory. Overall I give it 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie's last Poiret full-length story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine. This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie's weakest product. I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings. We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver. As Christie's alter-ego, Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age, including total inability to recall anything or anyone, and stress over shortcomings in one's career, such as writer's block, and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct, both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decade-old case of murder, suicide, or accidental death. Poiret warns all at the on-set that nothing good will come from this painstaking re-enactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious in-laws need to know. Unfortunately for Miss Christie's reputation, she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going, especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Hugh Fraser is the perfect narrator for Agatha Christie books. Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver banter back and forth and it is a delight to listen to this story. It kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It was with a certain sense of sadness that I read \\"Elephants Can Remember\\", knowing that it was the last book Agatha Christie ever wrote that featured the beloved characters of Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. Of course, there isCurtain, which stars Poirot and takes us to the end of his career as a detective, but this had been written several years prior in order to give Poirot a proper send-off and published after Christie's death.So this, for all intents and purposes, is one of the last Poirot mysteries, and certainly the last appearance of Ariadne Oliver, the mystery novelist that Christie often used as a self-insert to convey her own experiences and frustrations as an author. These would range from Ariadne's irritation with her literary protagonist (as Christie similarly held toward Poirot), to her habit of eating apples while she worked, to her bemusement at certain readers who would write to her in order to point out her mistakes. Here, she expresses her awkwardness concerning fans that gush excessively over her work.At a literary lunch Ariadne is approached by a compete stranger and asked a question about a godchild she hasn't seen in years. The woman who introduces herself as Mrs Burton-Cox asked Ariadne an incredibly personal question concerning her god-daughter Celia Ravenscroft's deceased parents: was it Celia's mother who killed her father, or Celia's father who killed her mother? It takes a while for Ariadne to remember the circumstances that she's referring to, but finally recalls that Alistair and Margaret Ravenscroft were found shot dead near their house, in such a way that made it impossible for the police to tell whether it was a double suicide or a murder/suicide.Ariadne discovers that Mrs Burton-Cox's son is engaged to be married to Celia Ravenscroft, and suspects that his mother is trying to form a wedge between the two of them by insinuating that Celia may have inherited murderous impulses from one of her parents. But Ariadne seeks out her god-daughter's permission to investigate the deaths further, and wanting to know more about her parents' demise, Celia agrees. Naturally, it is to Hercule Poirot that Ariadne turns, and together the two of them go on the hunt for \\"elephants.\\"The witnesses are all elderly now, and it all happened so long ago, but Ariadne has faith in the \\"elephants\\" of the old saying; and Poirot agrees, believing that even little details and false assumptions may prove valuable. Together the two of them try to piece together the mystery of the past, in a book that relies heavily on oral testimony and the memories of those present.As a book written near the end of Christie's life, it's clear that she's slowing down. \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" has a few recycled concepts, several flat characters, and is one of only two of her books (thus far) in which I've been able to guess the conclusion far in advance. And trust me, if I can guess it, anyone can! There are lots of meandering speeches, some inconsistencies regarding the time-line, and many obvious details are held back simply because they would telegraph the ending too soon. Finally, solving the case has less to do with deduction than it does with finding the person who knew what happened all along.Yet there's a lingering presence of melancholy present that makes the story more important for its context than its content. Christie knew that she was nearing the end of her life when she wrote it, and so there's an emphasis on lost love, putting the past to rest, and young couples looking forward to the future with hope. Likewise, the fact that Christie may have been in the first stages of Alzheimer's disease brings certain bittersweetness to the fact that the novel relies so heavily on the importance of memory.It's rather sad to read, but impossible to dismiss if you are lasting fan of the author, especially since it's clear that Christie was getting ready to say goodbye."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It is quite obvious, early on in this book, that the author was advanced in years. The math is off, so badly, and so often, whenever the subject of years comes up: how many years ago did it happen? How old is so-and-so now? etc. Also, the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot, pretty much; Ariadne Oliver, though only supposedly middle-aged here, is more muddled than most eighty-year-olds I know. Even the victims' ages: 60 and 35? Pretty unusual, that. If the wife/victim were only 35, why was she so worried about her advancing age?So, if the reader can get past all the muddle, it is still an entertaining read, IF, as I say, the reader is a die-hard fan. I am, so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: Christie's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get. She really hearkens back to very early Christie, in her inability to understand, much less handle, romantic love in any sort of realistic manner."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I re-read this one recently, as it was one of the first Christie novels I read as a teen. Something about it had always stuck in my mind. It is interesting re-reading all her novels now and especially interesting to see the reviews of this one.Funnily enough I agree that it has several weaknesses and the fact that this is a \\"later Christie\\" shows. There are some points (a couple of children mentioned that I thought would at least be interviewed are only mentioned, no present-day action etc) that make this book compare unfavourably to her better ones. Also, Poirot doesn't quite sound like himself in this one and if Ariadne Oliver irritates you, you may want to pass anyway!Having said that, there is something quite melancholy and haunting about the ultimate resolution. If you take this more as a romantic mystery/tragedy, I think you will appreciate it better."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am on an Agatha Christie run right now.

Mrs. Burton-Cox is curious to learn the truth about the murder/suicide of Celia Ravenscroft's parents.This was a different type of mystery that was interesting to follow. You already know who the victims are you are just trying to learn who was killed first. Who was the actual person to murder and then commit suicide. Mrs. Burton-Cox is concerned because her son and Celia are planning to get married. She doesn't want her son marrying some one who may decide to kill her son.

Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a \\"murder in retrospect\\" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever. It's her very last Hercule Poirot novel, and one can see that the writer is very old by now (82). There is no freshness left in her prose; it is stale, predictable, corny, and generally trashy. As other reviewers have said, the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story. To make a full-length novel out of this really is ridiculous. The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie's greatest strength: the plot and the denouement. With dozens of pages left to go, the reader *knows* the solution! Unheard of in the world of Christie; if for nothing else, then for this the novel cannot be rated higher than 1 star. However, the characters and dialogs are boring and cliche-ridden as well, so the book has no redeeming qualities either. Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book; no crime, no mystery, no real conflict among characters; it's all just endlessly boring talk, talk, and nothing but talk about the past. The only interesting thing, perhaps, is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel's detectives, Ariadne Oliver -- a mystery writer. But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer, Agatha Christie -- they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book's literary quality. It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book; this title cannot be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" does not read like a typical Hercule Poirot mystery. Agatha Christie's famed detective is drawn into an old case by his friend, the amateur sleuth and mystery writer Ariadne Oliver. The case involves what was apparently the double suicide of a loving husband and wife, and the concern that these past actions might have left a horrible impact upon their children.The story switches between the findings of Ariadne Oliver and Hercule Poirot as they each go in search of 'elephants' who might remember what happened around the time of the accident, because after all, an elephant never forgets. While there is no definite evidence as to what happened, there are those who have never accepted the double suicide theory because they couldn't answer the question why. But with Poirot and Mrs. Oliver working together, a long-unspoken truth is certain to be uncovered.\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" is classic Agatha Christie, in terms of mystery. It's central mystery has a unique, if perhaps a little predictable, twist, the denouement of which is quite evenly paced and satisfactory. However, this might be one novel where the time period of the plot is more glaring than others. The prose is heavy-handed at times and one does get a little sick of all the mentions of 'elephants'. The characters are borderline two-dimensional and, therefore, the reader does not care about them, even if they are still interested in the mystery at hand."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book, so it pains me to be so negative, but her age really does show. The story isn't interesting, the mystery isn't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self. The exception is Ariadne Oliver, who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character. This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery, and she gets an excellent send-off. The same cannot be said for Poirot. This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, though not the final one that was published, since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death. I haven't read it yet because I cannot bear to, so I'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read. I just hope it's superior to this one!In this one, Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver's god children. They were found shot to death in the woods, but what happened? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa? Was it a suicide pact? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon, then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she hasn't seen in many years, to ask questions about what was happening in the family, to try and put the pieces together with Poirot, who is busy talking to the police. It's quite similar toFive Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect), another Poirot murder in retrospect. The difference is that you'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off, as I was. I can now say that about only three of her books (Peril at End House: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)andThe Mirror Crack'd (Miss Marple Mysteries)being the other two) and sadly, it doesn't make for a very interesting read. More annoying still is that in this book, a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery, he should find and interview person X, because she might be able to help them with the truth. And so after pages and pages of wasted time, Poirot finds and interviews X, and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY. She is flown to England, she tells her story and then the mystery is solved. So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed?! That guy could've talked to this character himself anytime he liked! Christie also employs a method I've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot, the master detective . . . hire a detective! In lieu of actually writing plot development, she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character. And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever, so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time. Normally I'd decry this as a lazy author's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action, but in Christie's case I'm charitable enough to substitute the word \\"lazy\\" with the word \\"elderly,\\" which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole, I have to admit that I wouldn't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan. But if you're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote, then go for it. I am too, so I can sympathize. Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one. It's just not up to Christie's usual standards. Luckily, she wrote enough phenomenal, classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published, and all Christie newbies can rest assured: it gets a heck of a lot better than this."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie, but this mystery was lacking. I figured out whodunnit about halfway through the novel, but thought to myself, &quot;No...it can't be so-and-so! That would be too obvious.&quot; Well, guess what. It was. It was still a good read because I enjoy Ms. Christie's writing style and interactions between characters. If the mystery itself is not the only important part, then it's a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Inspite of a good character analysis and settings, this book falls much much below the usual standard of A.C. The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It could have been solved in half the time. But it is not, and to appreciate or understand this novel, readers must place it in the proper context.The problem was at first vague; Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne's goddaughter killed the father, or was it vice-versa. The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before. As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne's goddaughter, she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern. Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot, and together they embarked on elephant-chase to pry for secrets from the past.&quot;Elephants can remember&quot; was published in 1972, that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel &quot;The Mysterious Affairs at Styles&quot;. Many people did not even live that long. Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years, and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.Other similar novels before this whereby Christie's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness, Five Little Pigs, Mrs McGinty's Dead, Ordeal By Innocence, and Nemesis. The common theme among them was that the investigator(s) had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present; but from their recollections, clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime. What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless. Elephants is such another tale.Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot's grand finale, but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary? Proofs have to be gathered, and evidence, motivation, etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who, but to recapture the atmosphere, the mood, the aura of that time in the past, and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives. Also no less important was Poirot's being able to relate the past (in its correct perspective) and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor. It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" which was written in 1927. The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide. Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction. Many people are interviewed (the \\"elephants\\" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself. Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not \\"herrings\\" at all. They are giant signposts. Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago. The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher, \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" was originally published as \\"Five Little Pigs.\\" I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice. There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title \\"Queen of Crime.\\""},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am fan of Christie's work but this one is a huge disappointment.

I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution. The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here; all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages.

Personally, I enjoyed this book. Christies narrative is top notch and the solution to the mystery is neatly tied up and intuitive. I tought Christie did an excellent job of taking the reader from point A to point B and all the way to the end. Little clues were dropped along the way, as well as a few blind turns.

She does not reveal her reasons for wanting this information, but her request sends Mrs. Oliver right to Poirot who does much of the sleuthing for her. The two friends take separate paths in order to interview as many people as possible who can remember things from the Ravenscrofts' past. Mrs. Oliver dubs the witnesses as \\"elephants\\", people who will not forget important details which may help them solve the case. The mystery in this particular novel is not as difficult for the reader to unravel as it is in most of Christie's books, and that spoiled the fun for me a bit.

This book proves a theory though; there's a significant change in Mrs. Christies writing over the years; the nice young lady who writes well-puzzled, crafted, formula, to-the-point murder mystery; and the old lady who's slightly bitter to the modern world, but writes more real and cozy books, about peoples lives. More relaxed and less upthight books. This book falls into the latter category. That doesn't mean it' a bad book, no-no! It's good, but different from earlier works. The later books seem to be more relaxed, and more about looking back, and viewing things from a distance; about great characters telling(not acting)great stories!

His book of memoirs Not So Wild a Dream, published in 1947, is mostly about an action-filled 15 year period from high school graduation in 1930 (age 17) to the end of World War II (age 32). During that time Sevareid professionally and personally went through a number of adventures that typify his \\"Greatest Generation\\" and events of the world at large.Sevareid was one of the pioneering \\"Morrow Boys\\", a team of radio journalists who filed daily radio journalistic pieces from Europe during the war. This allowed him to travel to many places and get up close to the front and fighting. Sevareid is at his best narrating his adventures, the book is episodic and some of the best include: Bombings in London during the Battle of Britain; the plane wreck while going over \\"the hump\\" into China; his experiences in Paris during the \\"phony war\\" and \\"Exodus\\"; the horrors of war on the Italian front; the D-Day invasion and subsequent Battle of the Rhine; the mutiny on-board a Liberty Ship in NY harbor. His accounts of the Great Depression, when he tramped around as a hobo on a train are really excellent, as is his description of a 2500 mile canoe trip, which is covered in more detail in his 1935 book Canoing with the Cree. These two books, written while still a young man, would be his most popular, and last real literary output - although he always considered himself a writer first, most of his later career was on television..Sevareid was known for writing \\"think pieces\\", for example in one transcript, aired late in the war to popular acclaim, he talks about the unknowability of the experience of combat for a soldier, the impossibility of words to describe the immediate and often irrational emotions and thoughts of a soldier. These \\"think pieces\\" became a trademark of his later in life as a TV reporter, and Not So Wild a Dream often goes off on a thinking tangent. If there is a theme to the book, Sevareid is seeking the essence and spirit of his time and generation, what we might call the \\"Zeitgeist\\", and he often comes very close to capturing the immediate feeling of change. It is why this book is so important as a primary source for documenting the times and his generation. One of the more profound moments for me is when he sees a change in his generations attitude towards war:\\"Our own men, whose cult was antimilitarism [in the 1930s students were highly anti-military], whose habit is to identify themselves merely as civilians in different cloths who detested soldiering, now subtly changed. There was a dash and verve about them that I had rarely observed before, and young boys would frankly say: \\"In Italy all i used to think about was going home. Now I kinda hate to quit before we get to Berlin.\\" It was if they suddenly realized they were soldiers by profession, with the honest desire to complete this masterpiece of their skill down to the last detail.\\"Sevareid is right, during WWII the American military went from a small and and unpopular enterprise to a large beast that to this day is a major force in American culture, the consequences of which Eisenhower predicted in his military-industrial complex speech. Another area Sevareid muses on is the waning power of Britain and the ascending power of the USA - which given the events post-Cold War and the \\"Rise of the Rest\\" of the world, also has a prophetic tone. To get an idea what the US will be like as it becomes less relevant in the world - with the rise of China, India and the rest - one only has to read Sevareid's account of the waning power of Britain in the last chapters of the book."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"I ran into an old friend in the library stacks, an old CBS commentator pictured on the back of his book, \\"Not So Wild A Dream.\\" For one who was always captivated by this worldly-wise soul, Eric Sevareid, pages into this memoir of his early years to manhood and full citizenship at the close of World War II I was in complete enthrallment. Like striking the richest vein of learning. Inside this \\"memoir\\" you wil find three adventures: the earliest taken by Sevareid and a companion by canoe and foot over 1300 miles of northwest waterways at age 17; then a railway tour of the U.S. in the thirties, filled with nuggets of whimsy and wisdom, leading to the outbreak of World War II,the final adventure spanning 4 continents, major Allied campaign areas while raising a family and meeting deadlines.All the captivating storytelling gifts man can struggle for are on display in this wonderful look at the Greatest Generation in the first half of the 20th Century by one of our very own. Compelling human drama, amazing quickly-drawn human sketches and thought-provoking commentary when normal words begin to fail are the seldom-realized resources of this journalist of the House of Murrow. For those who know that time and place only through Life or Time magazines, this will color in all the gaps with greater dimension. This is a treasure trove for aspiring writers of any level to read one who walked with Dickens, Gibbons, Herodotus, Churchill and Gertrude Stein at his side, the antidote for the TV jackanapes who serve us propaganda with no historical context under the banner of \\"headline news.\\" Sevareid represents the elite of Murrow talent who were first in the service of truth, skeptical of those who wandered away from that path and had the integrity to caution those who thought otherwise.Henry Adams, another American, represents the patrician class; Sevareid, a classless original."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"I truly believe this book should be required reading at the high school or college level.

THE AMAZING THING IS HE WENT FROM A RAGING LIBERAL TO A UN TYPE SPONSOR IN JUST SIX YEARS. WELL WRITTEN AS EVERY THING HE DID IS AND FILLED WITH ADVENTURES OF A WAR CORRESPONDENT"},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"Well, yes, Eric Sevareid's autobiography to the year 1946 is a good read by a seasoned world observer. He grew up in the same North Dakota milieu as my father. I liked the part where he was advised not to enlist during World War II because he might find himself \\"...cranking a mimeograph machine in the public relations section of some Nebraska army camp for the next three years.\\" Surely his contributions as a wartime news correspondent served in good stead.I'm not sure Sevareid thought much of women-he refers to an \\"honest whore\\" and \\"old crones.\\" His wife is barely mentioned. Then again, he was a product of his time. Sevareid ends his book with, I guess, a plea for niceness and not bad war. As has been said, however, men love war. It is \\"...like lifting a corner of the Universe and taking a peek.\\" We'll never top that."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"Eloquent and incisive, this classic memoir of youth, work and war harks back to when Americans felt confident about their future and place in the world. Sevareid represented important transitions in media, from print through radio to postwar TV, and as one of \\"Ed Murrow's Boys,\\" he helped make them happen. The early journeys are rendered well, but many readers, like this one, will hurry on to the journalistic career and his thrilling World War II years. ES offers shrewd and (mostly) generous insights on people and events, shedding distinctive light on familiar incidents. (His survivor's' tale of a celebrated Burma plane crash expands on the modest account in J.P. Davies, \\"Dragon By The Tail.\\") The one jarring note is frequently-expressed satisfaction with his own reportage, though many broadcasts really were \\"scoops.\\" Perhaps best of all is the optimism and expansive sense of confidence about America's prospects, though Sevareid also acutely anticipates a time when things might not be so promising. NSWAD is a potent antidote to the debatable contemporary sense that the nation has lost its way."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"The quote in the first review should be &quot;Post proof ... &quot; and not &quot;Post proves.&quot; Makes sense that way."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"Those who choose to read Sevareid's Not So Wild A Dream will quickly find themselves in an encounter with a great mind and a writer who had command of the English language. Sevareid vividly describes his upbringing on the Northern Plains that naturally conditioned him to be an isolationist of the post World War I variety.Sevareid remained true to his early isolationist convictions when he became involved in the peace movement of the 1930s at the University of Minnesota. He eagerly took the Oxford Oath, promising there was no just reason that could motivate him to take up arms for his country. As a student leader he played a key role in a successful challenge of the ROTC requirement for all male students.Sevareid's early journalism career took him to Paris and he witnessed first hand the Spanish Civil War and the rise of Fascism in Germany. His description of a 1938 visit to Germany at the height of Hitler's power is a masterful account of the totalitarian nature of Nazi rule. Readers will also be impressed with his insightful description of the fall of France to the Nazis in 1940.At this point in his life Sevareid did something that few people ever do. He admited that his earlier isolationist and pacifist views were in error and embraced the notion that war was required to defeat Facism and its frontal assault on the most basic ideals of western civilization.Sevareid's book was published in 1946--a time when most Americans were content to enjoy the fruits of victory after the enormous sacrifice that was made to win the war. But Sevareid was one of the first to write about the nagging issue of how peace would be maintained. His insights concerning the wartime conditions in China and the problems that would likely emerge after the war were clearly visionary.Sevareid's skill as a writer makes this book an excellent tool for teaching about this era. As a professor I often use parts of his book in class to help students understand the attraction of isolationism in the period between the World Wars, or to enable them to understand the essence of Fascist political ideals."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"I wish this book were required reading in high school. If this book were written today, you'd assume the author (a broadcast journalist) was referring to its not being so wild a dream to become a celebrity. The title comes from &quot;On a Note of Triumph,&quot; the CBS broadcast marking V-E Day: &quot;Post proves that brotherhood is not so wild a dream as those who would benefit from its postponement would have us believe.&quot; This book follows Eric Sevareid's childhood, to his activism in college and the belief that &quot;war is outdated&quot; or barbarism to his unflinching belief in why fascism had to be defeated. This is every bit a philosophy book as it is a memoir and so eloquently explains how the changes brought about by the defeat of fascism could bring together mankind, reaching from Paris, France, to Sevareid's hometown of Velva. Shows Sevareid's mindset and how important World War Two was in terms of defining a generation. When you read this book, you understand why Tom Brokaw called his book &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; Stop whatever you're doing and read this book! You'll understand Sevareid, his generation, what America is supposed to be about, why we fought the war and why brotherhood is not so wild a dream! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"An outstanding book in all respects. First, he wrote so damn well. It sounds like his television commentaries, which were so beautifully worded. And for a whole book. Next, he just happened to be discussing some of the most momentous events of the century. The fall of France. The courage of England. India. China during the war. And then his own fascinating story. The 2200 mile canoe trip he took at 17. The forced parachuting into the jungles of India among the Naga tribesman. Next, his commentary: He was only 32 at the time he wrote this book; yet he is so perceptive about many things- a developed world view, a self described &quot;liberal&quot; seeing the collapse of Old Europe and wondering about the future. When I saw him on TV (years ago), I had no idea that this was his background. And, now, he is a forgotten man. So much more- even American atrocities in warfare, a disdain for Gen. Matt Clark and his vanity and news management. So much still very timely. And, still, I think, despite all that he had seen, a hope in the future of mankind. Great book."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"The rarest of coming of age stories, one that deals not with the emotional struggles that adolescents face upon reaching social maturity, but instead a story of a generation and a nation (would that we Xers had a representative as articulate and thoughtful as Severeid) coming to terms with their ideological commitments and global responsibilities."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"I happened to be watching &quot;This Week With David Brinkley&quot; afew days after the death of Sevareid. Toward the end of the programBrinkley asked Sam Donaldson, George Will and Cokey Roberts ifthey had any comments they would like to make about EricSevareid. They all started talking at once and they were allsaying the same thing. In their enthusiasm I couldn't hearthe title. I wrote to David Brinkley and he was kind enough toanswer me and provide me with the title.This is a powerful book. It takes you from his youth throughthe end of the 2nd world war and there is not a false notefrom beginning to end. I am assuming that anyone who reads this willknow that Eric Sevareid was a journalist in print, radio andtelevision.

I have read them both more than once, and Sevareid is the best.This is the book to read about America in the 20th Century. The depression, riding the rails, the incredible canoe trip Sevareid and his friend made, pre-war Europe and Nazi Germany.Then, the war. Sevareid saw it from Asia and Europe. He survived the crash of his C-46 crossing \\"the Hump,\\" and returned to Europe to see the end of the war.You see the war as he saw it, and you read one remarkable story after another. Sevareid's account of the war is personal, on a personal level. He writes of people and events. the GI slogging through Italy, and the impressions left by encounters with the great and powerful.What a great book. He wrote thoughtfully and beautifully. His observations are remarkable. You feel America when you read his book. What a treat to have this book around. Just fabulous."},{"Title":"Not so wild a dream","review":"I used to watch Eric Sevareid's sternly eloquent editorials for the Evening News shortly before he reached CBS's mandatory retirement age in 1977 - few had his vision of America's greatness and its flaws. In this eloquent 1946 memoir, Sevareid (1912-92) describes coming of age in North Dakota and Minneapolis, plus his early years in journalism. Sevareid canoed uncharted waters at 17, rode the rails, and was an activist at the University of Minnesota during the Great Depression. After a couple years in newspapers, he joined Ed Murrow at CBS Radio on the eve of World War II, covering the 1940 French collapse, and later parachuting from a falling U.S. warplane into the Asian jungle. This gifted if insecure journalist makes the Depression and war against Fascism seem like the very real struggles they were, rather than as mere facts from some textbook. He also sheds his early idealism for a more practical view of a changing world. The author called Murrow &quot;the man who made me,&quot; but Sevareid was a born newsman.Sevareid's dedication and high standards (a rarity in today's news) led another columnist to describe him as \\"North Dakota's gift to journalism.\\" Readers may also enjoy the memoirs of his CBS colleagues like William L. Shirer, Walter Cronkite and Howard K. Smith.

I suppose there is first the pleasure of seeing a young Eric Sevareid; the boy behind the wise old television commentator. But mostly it is the pleasure of seeing the world of the late 1930's and the early 1940's through the eyes of a young man desperately trying to be honest. It was mainly supposed to be about WWII but if you look closely, there's famous American phonies, a little shame for his country's racism and just a little awkward homophobia.

Robinson's life was not an easy one. He was of a Jew of Roumanian origin and his family came to U.S. in order to find a better life. E.G. became both rich and famous, but he was not a happy man. His marriage was very difficult and he also suffered during the times of MacCarthyism. He was a great patriot, but was a target for accusations of communist sympathies. He had a reason to be bitter. All this he describes with great self-knowledge. He probably made the greatest mistakes with his son, who had all that money can buy, but did not have father who is present when needed. However, he was a very demanding father who thought that this leads to good results. It is sad to know that these mistakes will continue during the present hectic times. E.G. loved art, especially impressionistic modern art, and his collection was world-famous. E.G. is not rude to actors he was working with, but was a difficult and challenging to producers, directors and writers. One also wonders, why an intelligent man must go with the required model for the famous actors and must live expensively and show off his money. Very good reading."},{"Title":"All my yesterdays;: An autobiography (Signet Books)","review":"What I find most frustrating in buying books since I like first editions is that many of the booksellers here at Amazon skip the details and instead tell you how many books they ship.

I think Amazon should have some listing standards.This book was well described and a joy to receive, haven't had a chance to read it yet but a great addition to my collection."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"What a town, I guess in the past when I have read Cujo, and Sun Dog I didn't realize they took place in the same town. It wasn't until reading the first chapter of this book that I had to hit myself in the forehead for not paying close enough attention. Now the title made sense that it was the last Castle Rock Story. That poor fictional town has had nothing but one disaster after another.This book is about a man who comes into town and opens shop, claiming that he has just what you are looking for. Each person in town has something they want more than anything, it could be an old Baseball card or even a fishing pole just like Dad's, Mr Guant will have it in his shop for a price. It might not be what you think you would pay for something as rare, but Guant is a fair trader.I enjoyed this book but not as much as I expected to. The idea sounded great, but I was expecting a bit more suspense and creepiness. I found it slow from time to time as well and thought more could have been cut out because I didn't feel it added to the plot at all. In terms of the plot, it kept me interested but not enough to were I couldn't wait to get back to listening to it. I was fine taking a break and picking it up when I had time. I also felt the ending was a bit predictable, but it was very enjoyable still.For me the best part about this book was since I listened to it in audio, it was read by the man himself, Mr Stephen King. It was such a thrill to have King read this because then I got to hear the voices as he meant them to be, the way they must have sounded in his head. I really enjoyed that and King is a good reader for audio. I have listened to books before where the author has read their own works and it was disappointing. King was defiantly not disappointing when it came to reading this."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Why read: Reading all of Stephen King's booksWhat impressed me: I love Stephen King, but he has a really annoying habit of writing these mind-blowing stories and then sort of ruining them with something unnecessarily over the top in the end. Having not seen the movie version of Needful Things, I was very worried the ending would not work for me. I was so pleased to find that King kept everything on track and making sense to the very end. And as always, King shines when he focuses on internal character development and Needful Things showcases that on a large scale. We see into the entire town's inner desires, secrets and greed. Things get scary well before you realize anything supernatural is even going on.What disappointed me: So long. So very, very long. This fantastic story just dragged on unnecessarily. Since the start of his career, people seem just completely unwilling to really edit King's books. The story works as is, but could have worked as well and been less intimidating to readers had it been cut down a bit.Recommended: Definitely. This is classic horror. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I had read this once before and forgot, which tells you something about the story. Not Kig at his yes, but as always, not bad either.One of his thinnest plots as you know from early one what the general outcome is going to be.Good cottage reading."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Let's face it: Stephen King is not usually the best writer when it comes to creating realistic characters. His ideas? Almost always good (and usually original); but the people who populate them? Frequently not so much. Very frequently disappointing, mostly because so often stereotypical -- the abusive husband, the horny teenager, the frustrated housewife, the classroom bully, the office slob. More than one of his books have been ruined, in my opinion, just because the characters inhabiting them have been so poorly written (witness those stumbling through the The Dark Half, for example).But Needful Things is the antithesis of that, and proves beyond a doubt that King can do it all, that he has the potential to write the perfect book. This is a book about character, after all. Human nature, and of course, good versus evil. And although it literally concerns the battle between good and evil in the same way The Stand does, or the Dark Tower books do, it's still more a book about the inner man than the outer events, spectacular as they are. In other words, it's less about Leland Gaunt than it is about the people who are susceptable to a Leland Gaunt-type personality. What makes one man more easily tempted than another? And what keeps one man essentially good where another falls?Most of the story is about inward battles, as the devilish Gaunt gives the various citizens of Castle Rock their fondest desires -- for a price. They do not have to pay, of course. There is no force applied. But if they want their little piece of heaven, well, then they have to give up a little. That's only fair, isn't it? And the fees Gaunt extracts lead to an inevitable terrible toll -- all the more terrible, because the people of Castle Rock bring it on themselves. Gaunt is merely the encourager, the string-puller. No one has to go along. But they do.And the story succeeds so well because nearly all the characters act and speak believably for a change. Everybody has understandable, human reactions. Everyone has deep and complex layers, and a gray moral center, just like a live human, just like the reader. Where does right and wrong come from, and what does it ultimately mean in the short span of a human life? That is just one of the themes of this book.Beyond all this, the story is great fun, well-paced, unpredictable, funny in places, horrifying in others, and contains a few special treats, like the bully Ace's tragi-comic return to Castle Rock (one of the characters from King's much-earlier novella, The Body). So this is definitely worth the read.A movie was based on this book (or a sanitized version of it), but leaving out the more intriguing events. And it was not funny at all. Meanwhile, the human struggles of the heart that King describes are what make this a good book. It's really not about what ultimately happens to Castle Rock or its citizens."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"a few spelling errors in it from translation from text to e book format but they are easy to overlook and do not hinder enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"i think needful things is a good book with an original plot. the only problem is that it's too long : to tell the whole story, 450 pages would have been the perfect number for a book like this.Anyway buy it and you won't be disappointed.SK RULES!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Classic Stephen King.

Actually, it was the last Stephen King novel I read. I had read most of his novels until that point. But while reading \\"Needful Things\\" I realized that I had read it before. I realized that this great American writer, whom I adored, had run out of things to write about."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is soooo enjoyable. King's at his best on this one. You HAVE to read this book.you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Steven King is a man with with a different slant on life,very entertaining cant put the book down. I have read 7 of his books so far,never a dull moment in his books. I have to laugh with some of the things he comes with."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"All things considered, I think that you'd have to say that, at the time this book was first published, this was the best that Stephen King had ever written, bar none. Undoubtedly, the novel still stands out for its pacing, clarity, and remarkable lack of bloat (I'm a fan and I have to admit that some of his books have been a little longer than they needed to), and it's those qualities that best recommend it to prospective readers. There's a lot of good in this book, and any casual reader ought to enjoy it.However, the book also suffers from a few problems that might bother some readers. First, the obvious--we are talking about Stephen King, and that means that you're going to have some severe language, occasional violence, and sexuality. Very few of King's books have actually succeeded in avoiding those qualities, and while this one isn't the prime violator, it still might not be such a great idea to let your thirteen year old child grab this book off the shelf before you've screened it.More fundamentally, there are some elements of this book that could potentially frustrate tried and true King fans. One of the most recent criticisms leveled against Steve goes something like this: he's letting his lazily developing series (the Dark Tower books) dominate everything that he writes. That is most definitely true of this book. Those who have some passing familiarity with Roland and his journey will recognize some literary Easter eggs in the novel's conclusion, and the cosmology that Stephen King alludes to is most definitely that of the Dark Tower series. This wasn't a problem for me--I happen to like the Dark Tower books--but it could be a problem for readers who'd just as well have nothing to do with it.As usual, what King has managed to do in this book is take a story older than the combined age of all his many readers and turn it into something new and entertaining, though, and for that he should be praised. The characters in this novel (particularly Alan Pangborn, who I myself doubted could fill George Bannerman's big shoes), while certainly not deep (one of King's faults is the fact that his characters almost invariably end up defining themselves on the basis of one or two idiosyncratic traits) are endearing, and any reader of Needful Things will likely find himself remembering Alan, Polly, and Leland after he finishes the book. The usual King touch for detail is also intact--a fact which combines with his casual and neighborly voice to make this book a very easy one to read.While Needful Things may not measure up to the bar set by later entries in King's catalog (Desperation comes to mind, along with Hearts in Atlantis), the book, taken on its own merits, is an enjoyable last romp through a familiar setting made new, and while it probably won't challenge you to rethink your world view, it should be more than adequate to the task of entertaining a reader for more than a few hours."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In my humble opinion, there are two types of stories King does better than anything else -- the quiet, small, personal stories (like \\"The Body\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\") and the huge, sprawling, multicharacter epics (like \\"It\\" and \\"The Stand\\"). \\"Needful Things,\\" King's farewell to the mythical town of Castle Rock, fits squarely among this second category and is just as good as any previous entrant.Picking up unresolved characters from a wealth of his other stories (ranging from \\"The Body\\" to \\"The Dark Half\\" and many more), King weaves a great tale of a small town where emotions run high and grudges don't fade. Enter Leland Gaunt, proprietor of a new shop in town, \\"Needful Things.\\" Whatever it is you want the most, Gaunt has it -- and for a very fair price. Or so it would seem.Gaunt somehow knows the history of this town, the old rivalries, the quiet hatreds and the dark secrets, and he uses it to play the various characters against each other, turning the town from a powder keg into a ticking time bomb.This book has all the King trademarks -- the omniscient devil-figure (Gaunt), the flawed but ultimately noble hero (Sheriff Alan Pangborn), well-realized children and dozens of fleshed out characters that bounce off each other and interact as realistically as anyone you've ever met. At once both dark and hopeful, it's a great read and worth picking up for any King fan."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is only the fourth Stephen King book that I have read and I must admit.. it was my favorite. I have read Eye of the Dragon (too fairy taleish for me), IT (good but I saw the movie first which took a lot away from it I feel), Pet Semetary (enjoyed it a lot) and then Needful Things. My sister-in-law is an incredible Stephen King fan. She has all of his books on softcover and she started me out with Pet Semetary which I enjoyed. But somehow when I read Needful Things I got more into the characters and could see a hidden plot that may not be evident right away. You can take it to another level and start to realize that we end up doing just this.. we sometimes end up putting too much emphasis on personal things rather then family and friends (which most find out later when it just might be too late).I'm only 22, not the all knowing by any means, and I read this book when I was 19. Still after a few years have passed, the characters are fresh in my mind. I feel that only a well written novel can do just that.If you have some time I suggest this novel for so many reasons.1) It may not have the guts and gore like some of King's other works but there is a fear that is evident whenever the shop keeper is mentioned, especially his eyes.2) Around this time of year we tend to focus too much on material aspects in our lives... This book helps an individual to step back and realize.. Are all these items really that important?3) It's just plain interesting, a great way to spend some time up in a small town in Maine 8-)Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.P.S. I welcome suggestions as well for any Stephen King reads. I'm still a newbie and would enjoy another persons perspective other then my sister-in-law. (...)"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"With his no-nonsense brand of legerdemain, King introduces the reader to a townful of quarky individuals with deep dark needs wedged not too deeply within each of their psyche. When villian Leland Gaunt opens his shop, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, he teases each of Castle Rock's good neighbors' desires to the surface by waving under their respective noses just the right object symbolic of some unfulfilled emotion. He doesn't ask for much in return---a paultry amount of money and the performance of a little prank played on a specified yet unsuspecting neighbor. In a little over a week, the town is duking it out with Gaunt rubbing his hands in anticipation and Sheriff Pangborn blinking in disbelief.From the start the reader knows that Gaunt embodies evil and his intentions are not to please but to achieve Castle Rock's swift destruction. However, I don't think the genius of this tale lies within its plot, but rather in the way King makes you salivate over each citizen's downfall while probing within to determine which 'Needful Thing' Leland Gaunt would use to entice and destroy the actual reader. His simple style deceives us into believing that we have &quot;already heard this one&quot; and then as we feel his well-crafted trap clench one leg, he scares the living daylights out of us as we realize the monster we fear the most is growling within our closest closet.I listened to an unabridged audiobook version of this book on a long car trip and found King's kinky prose fun and focusable.

Needful things is as creepy-crawly scary as they get and King has, again, excelled himself with flawless writing that has you suspending belief right from the first page. It's a poweful story of a junk shop that seems to sell exactly what the customer wants. But all is not as it seems (and why should it be in a Stephen King novel?).King's descriptions and narratives are absolutely 100% right. The story never seems to falter or lack pace, despite the sometimes long internal conflicts of the main characters.I'm slowly piecing together a list of ten books to take to my desert island with me.

When I first started it I was amazed on how great he had everything set up in a way where it would be impossible to blow the ending.

All in all, this is probably the best character-describing he's done to date, save MAYBE It. But to read something 700 pages long and getting a bad ending almost makes you want to never buy a long book again.

The book catches your attention right when it starts. It keeps you guessing throughout the entire book, &quot;what's going to happen next?&quot; It's a pshycotic thriller. One thinks &quot;How is this happening?&quot; But after a while, you no longer care, you're too enthralled by what's going on Stephen King really brings these people to life. He releases the demented thoughts or fantasies from the dark recesses of one's mind, igeniously. The entire book as a whole is great. The ending might leave you hanging a bit, but the entire book makes up for it. Might there be a sequal to this fascinating horror story or a spruced up version of &quot;Mr. Gaunt?&quot; One can only hope.Enid, Anaheim, C.A."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"In tradition of 'Salem's Lot, Stephen King writes Needful Things through the view of many characters, not just one main character, and keeps the reader guessing throughout the entire novel what will happen to which character. It works so well in Needful Things that I found myself reading madly and gaping my mouth many times. Truly a gruesome and horrifying experience, in Needful Things, King creates great characters, Alan Pangborn, Norris Ridgewick, Polly Chalmers, Nettie Cobb, Hugh Priest, Ace Merrill, John LaPointe, and maybe the best villian he has ever created in Leland Gaunt. The way he makes Gaunt so low key and friendly, and evil at the same time is wonderful. He also ties in all his other novels which have taken place in Castle Rock such as Cujo, The Dead Zone, and the novella The Body, very well. Sure, you'll be flipping back to see what character did what to whom when the novel takes its turning points, but that's the fun of it. How King can write so many things in 700 pages and keep the reader hooked and interested. And of course, the ending in which evil does not fully lose. God I love that! Needful Things, one of Stephen King's most entertaining books. A must read!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Many of Stephen King's readers (including some of the author's diehard fans) agree that the author's novels lost some of their pizzazz around 1987 or so. Although King's ability to create believable characters has remained strong throughout his career, he seems to have grown tired of the horror themes that inspired his earlier works.Needful Things is a bright spot among the post-Pet Cemetery novels. Despite the formidable length of the book, King's tale of a curio shop that caters to people's innermost desires is captivating from beginning to end. As another reviewer pointed out, the premise of the story is not exactly original--but this doesn't make Needful Things any less entertaining.The story is set in familiar King territory: the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. SK interweaves a number of complex subplots within the dark underside of small town life. Near the climax of the tale, the story switches rapidly from one subplot to another, practically compelling you to turn the page to discover what happens next.Although I liked Needful Things overall, there were a few points that could have been improved:-SK once stated in an interview that he would go for the gross-out if he couldn't scare the reader outright. (I am loosely paraphrasing a very old interview here.) Many of Stephen King's earlier works contained some genuinely spooky scenes. (Who can forget the woman in the bathtub in The Shining?) However, SK's later works tend to rely increasingly on B-movie gore. Needful Things contains a few too many descriptions of blood and guts, and a couple of scatological references that could have been omitted. I'm an adult and I've read worse, so these passages don't bother me--but this isn't the kind of writing that King enthralled me with in Salem's Lot and Carrie.-One of the key subplots of the story hinges on a conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants living in Castle Rock. At times, the intensity of the enmity between the two groups seems a bit unrealistic. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise well-crafted latticework of back-stories and subplots.If you didn't like Insomnia or Dreamcatcher, then you should give Needful Things a try. You may not like this book as much as The Shining, but it stands out among SK's more recent novels."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Not enough is said about some of Kings's books (Needful Things, Rose Madder) and people tend to cling on to his most commercial books (The Shining, It, Pet Semetary). I think that people tend to overlook some of his novels. Needful Things is a book that I enjoyed very much but I never find any else who feels the same way. Now I'm not saying it's perfect, there are other books I feel that are far more deserving of that title, but it is still a good read.Pros: The story takes place in King's imfamous Castlerock.King masterfully writes multiple characters and plot lines.Mr. Gaunt is creepy, creepy, creepy.It's easy to get lost in King's longer novels, so I always feel more involved/attached to what's going onCons: The ending is a little anticlimatic.I wanted more from the \\"last Castlerock novel.\\"While compelling it might be a little unlikely that all the characters in the town would be so easily manipulated and secretive about their deeds.But in the long run I did find Needful Things to be a book worth reading. It's not the best, it's not the worst, it's the middle of the road. But somehow King's mediocore or bad books tend to be better then some author's best."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"P>I first reviewed this book several years ago. It was one of the first books by Mr. King that I had read. I loved it.Now that I've had the chance to read much more of his work, what do I think of it now?It's still great.This is one of his best cast of characters assembled here. Alan Pangborn, Norris Ridgewick, Henry Payton, Ace Merrill...everyone is very real-seeming and three-dimensional.But as is often the case in good fiction, the villain steals the show. Leland Gaunt will entrance the reader as much as he did the people of Castle Rock, while simultaneously making you loathe him utterly.This is interesting, because most of King's villains are able to evoke *some* sympathy for the reader; Randall Flagg, IT, and Tak are just a few examples. So what's the difference? Why are those three--among others--capable of being rooted for while Leland Gaunt receives only boos?Randall Flagg, IT, and Tak only want to kill you, and they have semi-indentifiable motives. Gaunt, however, simply wants to be entertained by the carnage and chaos. He'll steal your soul and sow havoc in the same way that you or I would turn on the TV. He'll manipulate whole towns simply for his amusement. Thus it is that King does an excellent job of portraying him as a demon who deserves nothing more than absolute destruction. Overall--still great!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"To me this is one of Stephen Kin's best novels ever. He develops the characters even better than in his usual stories. I love the way that the town goes from completely normal to reverting into chaos. The plot is this. The town of Castle Rock is like any other town, until a new store, Needful Things opens up. As people go into the store, they begin to realize that the owner, a weird man named Leland Gaunt, has possessions that they have always wanted. In exchange for selling them these items, Mr. Gaunt has them play a prank on another town resident. Eventually these pranks end up turning the town into an insane war zone, and I won't give away the ending. One of the best things about this novel is that even though the plot is a tad unbelievable, King makes it believable with his fantastic writing style. I only wish that I could give this book six stars.Even if you are not a fan of Stephen King, I strongly urge you to go out and buy this book. Believe me, it is a chioce that you won't regret."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I began this book with no expectations. Unlike some of Stephen King's earlier stories, which have long since become classics of the horror genre, I knew very little of this story, and so I approached it simply as another book from a favorite author of mine.Early on, I became engrossed in the book and really enjoyed the early exposition-King has an uncanny ability to really put you in the mind of the character and transport you into the story. Each of his principal characters seemed to be pretty well developed. Alan Pangborn, the sheriff of Castle Rock and Polly Chalmers, his arthritis-ridden girlfriend, are the central characters of a cast of literally the whole town, and they act as the backbone of the story.Things are foul once more in Castle Rock as a new store, named \\"Needful Things\\" opens, providing would be customers the chance to own the one thing that each has always needed in their life...with prices that seem too good to believe-and they are. The owner of the shop, Leland Gaunt, accepts repayment of the many items purchased with the playing of \\"innocent\\" pranks on various members of the Castle Rock. These pranks begin to crosswire the town in destructive, and deadly, ways.King, who claims that this is the last of his stories to be set in Castle Rock, uses this tale to tie together some of his earlier stories set in the locale. Especially interesting is the return of \\"Ace\\" Merrill, who made his debut in \\"The Body\\" (Stand By Me as it was called in it's movie format), as the one of the villans of this tale. Throughout the story though, King makes references to some of his earlier works, such as Cujo, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, and does it with a subtlety that only true King fans will pick up on.What I found dissapointing about this story was the last 20 pages or so. Everything was building and building, as it always does in a Stephen King story, and then suddenly it seemed as though King pulled the carpet out from under the reader. (NOTE: Story Spoiler ahead) It turns out that Leland Gaunt is the devil, or at least one of the devil's minions, who has come to capture the souls of anyone who would dare make a deal with him. By the end of the story, Gaunt has successfully managed to cross-wire the town and literally turn individuals, and congregations against one another. People are killing each other in droves, fighting and destroying the town and, caught in the middle of all of this is the sheriff and his girlfriend, who alone seem to realize what Gaunt is doing. As they confront him, Alan sees Gaunt as he truly is, the devil, and confronts him on the street corner in front of his store, where Gaunt was fleeing with a dufflebag full of souls. He confronts Gaunt and defeats him by pulling a magic trick out which transforms itself into a brilliant light-presumably the light of truth and righteousness-and drives the demom away from the souls, which he then sets free. Gaunt flees with nearly no fight and disappears into the heaven, drawn away by a demonic horse and carriage.If you are going, \\"um, what?\\" at this point, I simply nod my head with you...I said the same thing. As King is known to do sometimes, he builds character and story in such a way that it has nowhere left to go. As a result, the culmination of his stories are sometimes disappointing, though they generally seem to make sense. This one seemed to just end, as though King rand out of idea, had had enough fun destroying Castle Rock and all its tenants, and said, \\"okay, I'm done\\", putting a lousy ending on what had been a great story up to that point.For fans of Stephen King, this is not a bad book at all...it's characters and settings are as good as any of the more recent King stories...just understand that this reviewer felt cheated in the final pages of the tale. For those who are looking for an introduction to Stephen King, I would say that you try some of his more recognized books-like Pet Semetary, the Shining, Salem's Lot or even Christine or Carrie. This one is a good story, but it lacks the culmination that these earlier works provide. This book, like many of King's more \\"recent\\" writings, tends to meander some, and leaves the reader feeling as though there should be more ahead, when in fact there isn't.-Scott Kolecki"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"From the only man who can describe pure evil. Needful Things is a jawdropping tale of evil in a Maine town. The only things I know about Maine come from Stephen King novels and the more Stephen King novels I read, the more I want to go there. As usual the King is not afraid to write down everything from his mind of insanity and this book is not exception, he is undoubtely the greatest American author and dare say the world!!!!While this is a great novel, note to the squeamish or to parents: this novel like almost all of Stephen Kings novels is quite graphic, don't be surprised if it talks about a knife going into someones stomach in really graphic detail. The detail will scare the living crap out of you, it will make you afraid to go to sleep, it will make you cry, it will make you angry and if you can't hold in your hormones, it will make you aroused, which brings me to my next point: Parents of kids who are too young to be read Stephen King(5-12), the language is really obscene, there is graphic violence, and there is graphic sexual content including sex, masturbating, male/female sex organs and just stuff your children shouldn't know about. But, that doesn't mean that teenagers can't read Stephen King, they just shouldn't start here. I suggest newcomers into the world of Stephen King should read his early stuff like Salem's Lot, the Gunslinger, or the Dead Zone.(I know I probably didn't give a good enough review for five stars, but I'm used to doing music reviews, so I'm just now doing book reviews, so just bare with me.)"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"A simple clever idea neatly executed.If the devil came to your town or city to destroy your community, how would he go about it? This book provides a convincing and entertaining answer to that question. Mr Gaunt is new in town, new yes but he knows the residents only too well, he knows more about them than they know, he understands their pressure points and the price of each of their souls.The cleverness of this book is that it is so believable, the genius of Gaunts game lies in the differences between human beings, when he sets out to make one person destroy another he plans his moves exquisitely, breaking Wilma's windows seems relatively mild to the boy he selects for the job, yet to Wilma, it is calculated by Gaunt to make her homicidal with rage. Animal rights mean little (morally) to the man he selects to kill Nettie's dog, yet to the lonely, vulnerable and unstable animal lover Nettie, it turns her into a monster. Smaller misdeeds are turned into terrifyingly larger ones with great profit for the Devil Gaunt. Everyone has different values, everyone's endurance limit is different, and so like a row of dominos the town begins to lose it's mind."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I didn't have half the faith I should have when I started reading this. Most of the negative criticism on this page (at least of the thoughful sort) is complaining about some of the same stuff I loved about it. The vast canvas of characters, the definitive Good vs. Evil motif, and the (very necessary, in my opinion) great length of the novel all make it great.The recurrence of Alan Pangborn is great...but when Ace Merrill (I always picture Keifer Sutherland in Stand By Me) showed up, I was elated.Farewell Castle Rock, and hello to the best novel (to date at the time of it's release)following The Drawing of the Three.(Excluding the expanded version of The Stand, which for all intents and purposes outdates both)..."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I read Needful Things when it was initially published and watched the movie as well, but in my opinion, there's nothing like hearing this author narrating one of his best works. Mr. King makes this story come alive as he knows firsthand the intonations, local jargon/dialect and feelings of each character because he wrote it. I have a good imagination, but hearing this from \\"The Horses Mouth\\" is a rare treat indeed. He evokes humor, creepiness, sympathy and much more. The characters jump out at you and you feel as though you're a citizen of Castlerock. I'm not here to review the content of the book - even though it's one of my favorites. I'm here to convince those that really love it to give it a listen. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Having never read a Stephen King book before, it is now obvious that I should've started with a more highly praised example of his work, but unfortunately my opinion of him as a writer has diminished along with my desire to read any of his other work.The premise was great. As a mysterious new shop opens in Castle Rock with an even more mysterious proprieter, the citizens are slowly ensnared by its appeal. 'Something for everyone' is Leland Gaunt's catchcry, and it appears that he is not wrong. He's a generous businessman, always ensuring that each and every person's 'needful thing' is just within their affordability. But of course, that's just the monetary price....The book then descends into chaos, with the town being turned against one another by Gaunt's machinations and by their desire to protect their coveted possessions. How this was ever allowed to go on for 790 gruelling pages is beyond me. But unfortunately, when I start a book, I've got to finish it. I thought that the monotony of it would be overshadowed by a spectacular conclusion, but I was somewhat disappointed.Not wanting to elaborate on the plot too much for the sake of those who are interested in reading this book, but the sheer stupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock is impossibly unrealistic. Anybody who lives in a small town will feel vilified by the way King depicts the residents of Castle Rock. Some other reviewers have downplayed the ludicrous conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants. It makes Northern Ireland look like a place of peaceful coexistance, and made me read it with complete incredulity. I was shocked that King really believed that his readers would accept such a half-baked excuse for a believable storyline.To cut a long story short, as I wish King had done with this novel, Needful Things promises a lot but fails to deliver, which I'm sure residents of Needful Things could sympathise with with regard to their acquisitions from Leland Gaunt's shop. Just don't be deceived by the interesting blurb - i was, and i spent the next few months it taken me to get through this book regretting it. The book basically boils down to a bitter indictment of consumerism and our reliance on material goods for a false sense of fulfilment. It's just a pity King taken 790 pages to convey his message via a dubious plot, dubious finale, and underdeveloped andover-stupid characters."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is not a bad Stephen King novel. The problem is that it does not really have any monsters per se, and is more about people and how their desire to \\"have\\" and \\"want\\" something can spell their doom.

Needless Things, however, was too disturbing to finish. wanted to see Leland Gaunt get in the end, but didn't make it. perhaps King did too good of a job on this.. Still want to explore other King books. He's an extremely good author. I'll leave this one alone. Donald"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I disagree with most of the reviewers of this title on a number of counts. First, I consider that King's later novels, in general, are better than his early ones. Bag of Bones and Cell are brilliant. Second, having made that point, I consider Needful Things to be one of King's weaker later novels. Leland Gaunt just doesn't work very well as a villain--his motivations are unclear and his characterization is inconsistent.One more point: The relationship between Polly and Sheriff Pangborn, which is central to the novel, never really rises above the level of bathos. I'll give this three stars--the writing style IS very strong.Wish I could say the same for the plot."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"A most intriguing and terrifying journey into the darkest depths of the human heart.

The length of this book (and the lack of editing thereof) was enough to make me have to come up and gasp for breath at times (and I am a King fan). For those of you enraptured with the world of Stephen King and the horror he creates, Needful Things will be like a crisp beer in a raging alcoholic's hand. The citizens of Castle Rock in this book are the kind of characters we know when reading King; well-characterized but steryotypical(sp?). Leland Gaunt, the shopowner of Neeful Things, is an entrancing villain, the best thing about this novel. As with most of King's fiction, there is plenty of violence, both purposeful and outright unnecessary. The action and machinations and interactions between the characters kept me going; the only thing which stopped me from giving this book four or five stars was the editing. The first two hundred pages can be a bit slow and heavy to digest and you may find instances where you ask yourself is this really needed? But then, the book deals with the things we crave and need and how these superficial desires can get out of hand. So, if you are willing to ride through 700+ pages of classic Stephen King storytelling, at the cost of some portions slow as erosion, then perhaps Needful Things is just what you need . . ."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"...but the ending left me hanging.

And it is quite a huge price. We are not talking about money. They are told what they have to do to earn the item.

It is just different from some of Stephen King's other work. This book doesn't really deal with supernatural events and people with special powers and abilities. Needful Things, all in all, a very good novel with several shocks and twists but to me it was just a very enjoyable story with a clever beginning, middle, and end. When I mention shocks, I do not mean scares. This book is not at all scary but the unexpected turn of events or the relationships between the characters is what urges the reader to continue reading.When I first began it, it seemed a little boring. As stated in my Misery review, the book only gets interesting when something actually starts happening and we feel the people's reactions to it. It is, by far, one of the best King books that I read not just because of its twists but all of its realism despite the villain. It feels as though you could meet any of these characters anywhere if you bothered to look. King has a gift for making realistic people, just not making them go through realistic situations. Once again, he bombards us with violence, sex, drugs, and other events that don't make a single difference to the outcome of the story.Needful Things takes place in Castle Rock, a small town in Maine that was the setting for other King novels such as the Dead Zone and Cujo. A new shop has opened and has quickly become the talk of the town. Needful Things, as the mysterious owner Leland Gaunt calls it, is a different kind of shop. Inside of it you will most likely find what you've always dreamed of having but have never received. Mr. Gaunt is willing to give you the item but as always there is a price to pay. The more Mr. Gaunt sells the more the Sheriff of Castle Rock Alan Pangborn begins to realize his awful plan, which results in a gigantic battle between Alan Pangborn an Mr. Gaunt.Once again, several thoughts in the book are just sick including a particular character who commits suicide (I won't tell you who just so not to wreck the story) and a battle with a poisonous spider which I still don't believe should have been involved in the story. Sure, the ending is farfetched but clever and does ensure room for a sequel(although it probably won't take place in Castle Rock).The characters and storyline are well developed and change thoughts many times throughout the book. Although the actual villain of the story, Leland Gaunt felt as though he was the main character in the story. His wicked and charming ways make it hard for us to distinguish whether he really is evil or whether he is the calm gentleman all the customers recognize. Very recommended and fun to read, Neeful Things is a novel you shouldn't miss out on. It's one purchase you will not regret."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is the first Stephen King's novel that I read. this story is funny because of King's special black humor---this novel is hilarious(and cruel) horror fiction.

One thing reviewers don't realize is a 1 is terrible, a 5 is average, and a 10 is perfect. That makes a 9 a very high rating.Now, for my review. This book shows exactly what I see in Stephen King. I don't think I have ever read a book with so much imagination from any author. I stayed up all night reading the last 200 pages. Though that statement have become a cliche in book reviews, it is very true.Never before has a book been this intense. People who have read it may say I'm sick when I say this, but I actually had a lot of fun reading this book. Once you get into the revenge aspect, it becomes a morbid roller coster ride that is just great. This is the first time I've read the last pages to see who lives. Trust me, when things get going, it becomes an addiction.Now, for my sour apples. One thing I wish King would do is cut down on the violence a little. The characters getting shot in the head may help the stories roll, but I don't appreciate it in its splattery detail. Lastly, the ending is fairly happy for a King book, but it seemed blah to me. But, aside from these gripes, it is a great book, one of kings best."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Many of Stephen King's books have had the location on Castle Rock, Maine. King says his farewells to this town with one last story.Leland Gaunt is the stranger in town. He has just opened his new curio shop called NEEDFUL THINGS. Everyone has a dream. Everyone has a price. Gaunt has learned to use his customer's dreams and wants against them.It starts with 11 year old Brian. He finds a '56 Sand Koufax baseball card. It's his heart's desire. No money is not a problem. Do a little task for Gaunt and it is Brian's. The task is a high price, but not too high for Brian's dream. Just pull a simple prank on one of the towns folk. No one would ever know who did it. But Brian's victim assumes it was a rival and retaliates against an innocent person. This, in turn, causes more hate and more pranks.Meanwhile, Polly can barely hold a glass due to her rheumatoid arthritis. NEEDFUL THINGS just happens to have a pendant that takes away all pain for her. For the first time in years, Polly has no pain. Just do a little task...just a prank, really...Hell begins and pranks become deadly. How far will people go to get their dreams? But once you have had your dream, for even a moment, how can you give it up? What would you do to keep it?"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Here it is 1998 and in my rather sensable opinion, I claim that this is the last great book of the Stephen King legacy! In seven estranged years, King has yet to publish a book that intrigues my curiousity and wonder. His writing technique has greatly altered over the duration of years and his novels have become practically predictable. Will this be the Last Great One? Only King can answer that!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I live in Europe, in south of Hungary (in Szeged). I think Stephen King write ewrything, what European people think from the USA. This is a book from the experiences real and from the relations of friendly-world and dark-world. It's a masterwork from the horror."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I apologize that this is more commentary than review, but many other reviews go into the details of the plot. Let me just say that this book's Evil One plays his game with people's greatest longings, pitting one against the other, while creating carnage and destruction in the process. As it plays out, it is irresistible. Splendid Stephen King.However. . .after reading most of the Stephen King novels, I find myself always approaching his resolutions warily. He draws me (and, presumably, you) into a wonderfully imagined situation where average people are enmeshed in some horrific web of evil, at which point he sometimes suffers an imagination cramp (or loses interest?) and starts blowing things up, revealing his Bad Guy as the father of all horrors--usually through a series of skin-splitting, gooey, pus-coated transformations. In other words generally laying waste, over many pages, with familiar Stephen Kingish gadgets.I was loving Desperation, for instance, but found myself increasingly frustrated by his endless digressions, page after page describing the rotting disintegration or gory destruction of various characters.The greatest disappointment for me, however, was Rose Madder, where his unusually straight approach to a frighteningly real character--an abused and pursued woman--was sustained until the very end, when he suddenly shoved the whole problem into a painting on the wall and brought on one of his monsters. Perhaps dealing with the plight of a woman cornered by a truly brutal man was more than King wanted to deal with. We'll never know.So as the dynamite was being planted in Needful Things, I began to hear my Another Apocalyptic Ending alarm. But, happily, it faded. When all the bang boom crash became merely the background for a far more satisfying and original resolution, I found myself much relieved. A contented feller.The epilogue, in fact, even left me laughing. It's a nice little twist.Last thing: Was I the only one that found himself/herself snerkling at King's black humor descriptions ofthe Faithful out in the storm, pounding away on each other as their town blows up around them?"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Well the book was a trip it was cool but also pretty scary to go along with everything else. Killing a kid to get a baseball card is screwed up, don't you think. It's a good thing that man stopped it all. Facing a mass murderer like that takes guts. They get into a big scruffle then the man throws the mass murderer into the big fire place. That's awsome. To be honest, I kind of felt bad for the guy but at the same time I didn't. So with a mass murderer dead, the town goes back to normal. But I don't think the guy who killed the mass murder will have a normal life from the drama. But I don't think he'll have guilt following him. Castle Rock, the small town in Maine, was the perfect place for a mass murderer."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things focuses on what the town of Castle Rock thinks is a great bargain when it turns out, they're paying more than what they've bartered for.The characters are well written and developed; King has a way of telling how each character feels through 3rd person. Everything is tied together at the end of the novel making it very enjoyable."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This one is great.Once again much more involved and interesting than the movie even though the movie was pretty good. Be sure and read it even if and maybe especially if you saw the movie."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I just finished this, it rocks. A great ending to Stephen King's Castle Rock stories. The only bad part of this book was the epilogue (You've Been Here Before), it was one of the worst ones I have seen. I wish King had ended it where the last view of the town was shown. Other than the terrible epilogue, this was a magnificent novel.P.S. Stay away from the movie, it is a piece of crap and it sucks."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"9.0 STARS OUT OF 10!!!!!!!!!Once upon a time, I was 13 years old and hanging at a buddies house. Unlike most of my peers at that age, I was an avid reader. I graduated from the Hardy Boys, to Goosebumps(LOL), and was currently tackling John Grisham and the like. I was waiting to get onto the next game of NHL 93 for Sega Genesis when I noticed my buddies mother's bookshelf in the living room. I started digging through it and with pure luck I ended up with Needful Things.I hadn't the slightest idea that this book was the epic ending of a set of books occurring in a small town called Castle Rock. I hadn't the slightest idea who Stephen King was except he wrote horror novels(some of which were turned into bad movies), and that those novels sold very well. That stuff didn't matter. I cracked open that hefty book and before long I was addicted. It seemed like I was missing out on some inside jokes and plots, but it didn't matter. The book blew my mind. I couldn't believe the time I wasted the last few years reading anything different.Anyway, 14 years later, I have read pretty much everything King has written a handful of times. With nothing good to read of late, I've been reading some of King's novels for the 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th time. Needful Things was just finished for the 2nd time.Stephen King visited the fictional town of Castle Rock in several novels including the Dead Zone and Cujo among others. This is the \\"last\\" of the Castle Rock novels. The book starts with a new shop in town called Needful Things. It seems to have at least one item that everyone who shops there just HAS to buy. Usually such items would cost an arm and a leg, but not at Needful Things. These items are all for very cheap barring the customer does the owner of the shop a little favor. These favors are overall pretty small tasks and range from seemingly harmless pranks to petty mischief. As you would think, the owner of this shop has a little secret that the townsfolk are soon to find out.Needful Things is a long and pretty good novel starring not only new characters but also a handful of characters from Castle Rock novels past and present. While there are many little references and inside jokes(A scene with Cujo's ghost was my favorite), you do not need prior knowledge of Castle Rock to enjoy this book. My only qualm with this book is the very ending. This is a long book with A LOT of slow building tension that leads to a very exciting last one hundred pages. To me the last scene is very anti-climactic and hinders an all around good book from being an all around GREAT book."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Another small town gone wrong. All of the great, almost real characters you've come to expect from Stephen King. The concept was the real pull for me... evil comes to a town and manipulates the residents into turning on one another. I've always been interested in the thin line between good and evil... about what it takes to turn a good person bad. That is what this story explores.And just a side note: This is no longer \\"The Last Castle Rock Story\\"... that title should now be given to Lisey's Story. Many of the deputies from Needful Things appear in Lisey's Story, some of the action occurs in Castle Rock, and Lisey herself lives just a bit outside of town."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is NOT his best, but ONE of his best. I was completely enthralled with the concept of a guy visiting a small town and turning the people of that town against each other. wow. It could have been a bit shorter, but that Stephen King's vice. We have to deal with it.--review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things is masterfully written, with realistic charecterization. It shows a mind-boggling variety of charecters, and each is portrayed incredibly well. The range of charecters spans from schoolboy to madman, and it pained me whenever I was forced to put it down. It will grapple you and hold you in your seat for hours on end. Personally I love a nice thick book, but if you don't, you might like it a bit less. It is quite a long book, and even I was tiring by the time I reached the end."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Sheriff Alan Pangborne moved to Castle Rock,Maine to get away from the big city and get some peace and quiet.Unfortunately Leland Gaunt has moved to the same town.And has set up shop.And what a shop!

I can't recommend it Enough !"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is one those books by King that people either like a lot or not much at all. I love it, putting it only behind IT as my favorite King novel. The story is carefully woven together to culminate in the destruction of one of my favorite settings in any of King's novels, Castle Rock. The book is billed as the final Castle Rock story, but I hope King reconsiders and chooses to continue the Castle Rock saga. People who read King for gore or sheer terror probably won't like Needful Things; however, those who like the way he developes characters should find it a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"There are three types of King books: the really long epics, the reasonably long tales-about-a-town, and the shorter individual stories about individual people. &quot;Needful Things&quot; fits into the middle category, and boy is it good. OK, it starts quite slowly, but the likeable characters make you want to read on and find out what happens. By the time you're halfway through the plot itself begins to pick up momentum, and the final chapters steamroll by in a flash. Castle Rock is one of the better and more likeable communities King's created--Polly Chalmers, Alan Pangborn and Norris Ridgwick are all enjoyable heroes (and heroine), and Leland Gaunt is a really creepy old demon, one of King's really memorable villans. OK, you might still be a little unclear as to exactly what HAPPENED once you finish the book, but the characters are so good and the finale to spectacular that you won't really care. Great stuff--perhaps a bit too fantastical for some, but if you enjoyed &quot;Insomnia&quot; you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is certainly one of King's most original books and the idea is very, very interesting. The book is not as dynamic as some other SK books but certainly hits deep into your mind. It makes you think and it shocks. So if you're a passive non-thinking potato don't read this book, it will be too hard for you."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful things is a very well written, clever novel with a very unique plot that keeps you going until the end. The end is the problem, though, with the big spider and Gaunt flying away and everything... If King would have thought more about the ending This would be a better book. The bad ending doesn't ruin this book much for me."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"That's right. I've read some of Stephen's books but surely this wasn't the best. It starts like you can't leave the book for a second, but when it comes near to the end it becomes more like you force yourself to finish it. It has too much fantacy, something I don't like. I prefer horror stories more connected to true life, that you'd think maybe that could really happen in some place of the world, but this one, not a tiny chance."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The story of a demon incarnate from Akron, Ohio who sells residents of a small town their dreams is unique.. worth the money."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is a grest book, it starts a little slow but once it get's going it is one book that is hard to put down.Stephen King at his best."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The plot is most intriguing.

It has plenty of characters, surprise turns, and even some trips down memory lane."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"A new store, Needful Things, opens in town, and its proprietor, Leland Gaunt, offers unbelievable bargains to Castle Rock's troubled citizens. Gaunt doesn't require payment in dollars; he prefers payment in \\"little pranks\\".Winning over Castle Rock's inhabitants with intelligence and politeness, Gaunt's reputation as a gentleman spreads quickly. He lets a boy get a valuable baseball card for next to nothing, providing the boy plays a \\"little prank\\" on someone. Like lighting fire to a fuse, Gaunt sets people against each other. He finds their weaknesses and exploits it. Often just one little act could turn people to finally killing their enemies even if their enemies were not actually responsible. The result is death and mayhem.As the dreams of each strikingly memorable character inexorably turn to nightmare, individuals and soon the community are overwhelmed, while the precise nature of Gaunt's evil stays just out of focus until it's too late.Somehow or other Stephen King manages to make every character memorable. The story revolves around a few main characters, but they're intertwined with the minor characters so skillfully that they're tight as a knot without any loose ends. The writing is extremely sharp and a joy to read. The first half of the book is relatively slow, however, climax at the end is immensely rewarding if you take the time to finish it.Needful Things was fantastic. I'm sorry I haven't read any other Stephen King books - this is the first Stephen King novel I've ever read, not counting On Writing. Although labeled as a horror writer, Stephen King goes beyond giving his readers goose bumps. Beyond the blood and gore lie very human stories of love, hate - and redemption."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I've always liked Stephen King's books, but this one didn't quite do it for me. The story premise was interesting, but I just didn't get into the heads of most of the characters. Those I did identify with in most cases didn't survive to the end of the book. King does evoke a strong sense of setting, and Castle Rock is definitely a town I'll be happy to visit in other books. Since it's the last of the Castle Rock books, and not very strong, I wouldn't recommend it as a good place to start when reading King's books."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Outside of the Dark Tower series, The Stand, and It, this is my favorite Stephen King book. For me, Leland Gaunt is my third favorite Stephen King villain with Greg Stillson and Randall Flagg in the top two spots. This novel ends the Castle Rock novels, even though Stephen King did mention Castle Rock in some of his future novels, but this is the last one where Castle Rock is the focal point. The Castle Rock series ends with a bang, quite literally.What I like most about this novel is that Stephen King takes his time in developing the characters before the chaos is put into full swing near the end of the novel. Stephen King has his work cut out for him in that the vast majority of the novel concerns itself with the deeds that Leland Gaunt has his customers play on other members of the townsfolk and thier consequences. Even in the midst of the chaos that is slowly rising up, Stephen King succeeds in giving us characters who are very realistic.The novel is slow to begin with, but at the last part, it reaches an extremely fast pace. There are parts in the novel that are fast paced, but even the parts that are fast paced are written in detail. Some may find the attention to detail a bit boring, but I found that the detail added to the richness of the novel. In a way, the climax of the novel helped to shape on particular fight sequence in \\"The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower.\\"\\"Needful Things\\" is an excellent read and the characters are compelling. It is obvious from the start that Leland Gaunt is the villain, but the depth of his villainy is not seen until the final part."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"The dull town of Castle Rock, Maine has its ordinary routines. Everyone knows each other's business and they enjoy the peace and quiet, especially after travelers who have a summer cottage leave for the fall. However, there is a new traveler in town and he's doing more than just visiting.With several items in the store window, Leland Gaunt opens 'Needful Things' which sells odds and ends that are 'one man's trash, another man's treasure.' The prices seem reasonable enough, however much is in your pocket and a promise to do a favor; to play a little prank on someone. Seems harmless... until you piss off the wrong person and things start to get out of hand.Leland Gaunt starts selling even more 'needful things' and people who want them are willing to pay any price, even if that means their souls."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Leland Gaunt might be an incarnation of evil, but that doesn't make him a one-note character. The dynamic between Gaunt and Castle Rock's inhabitants is in a constant state of evolution: sometimes Gaunt is the focal point around which the other characters gravitate, a spider capturing more and more victims in its numbing, deadly web; at other moments, he is at the periphery, an active observer of his creation like an inferior demiurge who relishes in pain and mayhem - the prices he commands for the 'needful things' he sells is much more spiritual than material. The most interesting aspects of the novel are related to religion and the sacred. Gaunt takes the guise of Good as he seemingly brings wonder to people who didn't have any, and he appears to give his clients access to the sacred while violently cutting them from the profane world; but this is less a religious experience than a pernicious illusion devised by a dark magician. The book's structure is such that its length poses no problem to the reader - it is quite the opposite. King delays the inevitable Pangborn-Gaunt confrontation as much as he can, and the pace quickens in the novel's second half. 'Needful Things' lends itself to a plethora of allegorical readings, including Gaunt as the guru of a dangerous sect; as a druglord; as an author of macabre fiction (his clients need to 'believe' his stories as much as readers do and they soon become addicted to his 'work'). This is not an easy novel, but one that inquisitive readers should look for."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I've only read a few Stephen King novels, and I'm glad I read this one. It is exceptional in its story telling, and characteriszations. I consider it the second best novel I've read by this author (the best being &quot;The Stand&quot;)."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Stephen King once said about this book, &quot;Everything's for sale, but the only price is your immortal soul. I thought Needful Things was hilarious!!&quot; Sadistic, eh? But I have to agree with Mr. King, because I just loved the town's (Castle Rock) slow descent to madness, and its inevitable destruction. Even though not a drop of blood is spilled till almost page 300, you are hooked from the beginning of the book, where you meet Leland Gaunt, the Proprieter of Needful Things (a store with all your heart's desires, at only the price of your soul and to play a &quot;little&quot; trick on one of your fellow townsmen) till the chaotic destruction of Castle Rock, one of Stephen King's most memorable locales, home to the stories &quot;Cujo&quot;,&quot;The Dark Half&quot; and the excellent short story &quot;The Body&quot;. This book is also superbly written with King's haunting metaphors and spine-tingling characters that scratch at your back, but strangely the last 50 pages or so seem to be not as well written in some of the action sentences, but that dosen't mean the ending isn't good. Also, I think King did a good job of keeping the plethora of characters in order, as SK managed to tell ALL.. the characters' stories without the plot falling apart, and I applaud him for that. Congratulations Mr.King, you have crafted an excellent story that stays with the reader after he finished it, and once again you have entertained me. Also the end was strikingly funny and sadistic to me (The VERY END) and topped off what was to me, a very Needful Thing in my Stephen King collection"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"is a great SK novel. The charatchers are interesting and what also makes it more interesting is the storekeeper is how he uses the people of Castle Rock turn on each other.This novel is one of SK's best, and truly this is a must have for hard core SK fans like myself.This ranks with the big boys like 'The Stand' 'IT' 'The Tommyknockers' 'Insomia' 'Carrie' 'Salems Lot' 'The Shining' and my list goes on.If you want to be scared and looking for a good suspense novel, then this is it."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is another very very enjoyable book from Stephen King, master of the sprawling apocalyptic horror novel painted on ridiculously large canvas. This novel is no different. t's a many-paged volume that you might at first blak at reading, but rest assured, all those pages whizz by in a flash.Several things aid this (aside form a fast-paced and exciting plot): an easy writing style, lots of characters, all fully formed, who are always freshening up the material because it means that there is always something different going on. The relatively short sections of the book encourage the reader to read more. And the fact that the book is just plain engrossing.The characters are all very real, very human. (Unfortunately, the one flaw in King's books is that most of the characters in all his books remind me of many that have appeared before, just with different names. His characters remain basically the same. But, with always using such a large cast, this cant exactly be avoided.) Many of them are not always likeable (but still they remian painfully human) and because we dont always like them, i suppose that makes the ending a bit easier to cope with. However, there are a couple of really likeable characters ti balance it out.This, while being an excellent, rather creepy, book, is also a bit depressing, though. So, if you're not feeling well-disposed in your attititudes toward humanity at any point, that is not the time to read this book!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is one of my favorite Stephen King novels.

From there you make your bet. You will win, but at a price--paid to the devil.I couldn't put this book down. It hooked me from page one."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I can remember reading The Dark Half and liking it in a weird way for it's brutality and its straight-forward horror, then Four Past Midnight and getting mostly mixed feelings and finally buying Needful Things the day it came out in hardcover and plunging right into it with both feet. \\"The Last Castle Rock Story\\" everyone proclaimed, and all I could think was how could that be? Castle Rock was Stephen King's personal stomping ground. I was fearful that this meant the old wordslinger was getting ready to retire (silly me) and that I had better suck up Needful Things as if it were the last book that was ever going to mean anything to me. I have been a King junkie since I was 13 years old. That's going on 24 years. Jeez, it has been a long time, but I truly consider myself an afficionado and an expert on Steve-O's work, having read pretty much everything he's ever published. Needful Things has some mighty big shoes to fill if it was going to be \\"The Last Castle Rock Story\\"....In the town of Castle Rock a new store is just about to open: Needful Things. Well...what ever could they sell in a store like that? Everyone in The Rock is pretty curious as small town intrigue goes. Leland Gaunt is the proprietor of the mysterious shop and he has just arrived in town to set all Hell loose. See...that's what he sells, Needful Things, and there's always two parts to a price, money and a deed. Everyone who steps foot inside his little store finds the most needful of things.It seemed to me that after the hodge-podge that was Four Past Midnight, that King was holding back, saving something special. Needful Things not only gets you reacquainted with The Rock and its current natives, it also brings back some old favs as well. Ace Merill from \\"The Body\\" is back. So are nods to Cujo and The Dead Zone. The plot is rather simple, but so fully formed around its rich characters and cool gossipy tidbits, that you can;t help but fall fully into it right away. So grab a bench, light a smoke, and get ready, because all hell's broken loose in Castle Rock and the devil's dealing the cards.Dig it!"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is more about the scariness of human nature than the scariness of things external to us, and this makes it a great book. You think again and again about what your own response would be to the kind of temptation that the characters in this book are presented with, and you probably find yourself worrying more than a little.My big problem with this book is that the bad guy, Leland Gaunt, is not believable. What exactly are his motives? In the first part of the book we are led to believe that he is just a mischief-maker, and this I could accept. But then it turns out that his powers are incredible and that his motives are much more malign, and this is where I can't accept things.Let's face it, this guy is so powerful that he could start WW III without even working up a sweat. So what's he doing setting up shop in a small New England town and messing with the heads of the local yokels? It doesn't make sense, and this spoils what would otherwise have been a really great book.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This seems to be an appropriate summation for many King books. Here we find a story idea so haunting and compelling that it should have been a masterpiece. I also loved the clever title (yes, it was the people of Castle Rock who were the real &quot;needful things&quot;).Unfortunately the characters in this book (except for a few of the &quot;regulars&quot;) are bland and two-dimensional. A lot of the people were introduced for the sake of being killed in the demonic web, so I suppose the author thought it would be a waste of time to really flesh them out.Another problem was the rambling and unfocused plot. Surely King could have presented this great story idea in a more concise fashion and it would have left a big impact. Instead he drives it into the ground, ultimately draining it of its disturbing originality.Finally, the ending was trite and uninspired and bore absolutely no relation with the rest of the book. I got the definite sense that the author had no idea how he wanted to end it. He just kept writing and writing, going where ever his fancy took him, and finally, after about 400 pages too many, made up an ending and tacked it on. It's a dissappointing place to have left such a creative story.Having said all that, this is still a good book. The majority of it is still riveting. A real page-turner and, on the whole, one of his most enjoyable stories. Now if only Mr. King would learn to exercise a little restraint...."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book is one of the most perfect examples of the pure art of story telling imaginable. Not just content with developing a handful of characters, King presents a weird and wonderful array of actors in this novel. Sheriff Pangborn, Polly, Nettie, Wilma, Keeton, Hugh Priest, Ace Merrill, Brian Rusk, Myra Evans, and of course, the villain - Leland Gaunt. The storyline centres around Gaunt's new store on Main Street, Castle Rock - a shop called 'Needful Things'. By seemingly coincidence, the shop always stocks the one true desire of each and every customer who enters under the green awning. And it is always affordable - in many instances, the price is just the loose change in your hip pocket.The reason for this is that Gaunt is not interested in monetary assets - it is souls he is after. Each purchase made comes with a small prank to be played on an unsuspecting member of the small town.As pranks get more serious, and more and more people realise their heart's desire lies within the new store, the town descends into chaos.King's ability to develop so many characters, and the fact that they are ALL so different, and so interesting, made this book my needful thing. I found it more entertaining than horrific - only one scene disgusted me, when Polly found out what was really inside her arthritic-curing charm.The final one hundred pages were told beautifully, and in my mind it was easy to imagine the chaos descending, as explosions and murders happen almost every minute.Overall this was an brilliant, excellent example of story telling. This was my first King novel - and it definitely will not be my last."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"(that should be 4.5 stars, by the way) I must say, I'm one of these people who will praise King and his works until the end. Everything is GOOD. Nothing is BAD. All works are created equal. But this book broke formation and stood out from the rest. Instead of projecting a film into my head (as he always does.....come on, admit it!), King managed to project an ACTION film into my biased skull. The climax simply blows you away. But it is not just the explosive ending that earns this book the title of STANDOUT.The characters are engaging (cliche, cliche) and wonderfully developed, and you feel even 'closer' to them than you are normally brought to feel with King books. Mr. Gaunt is quite the appealing Lucifer (&quot;...Fe***tio gives me a headache.&quot;). The paced storyline is built up beautifully, making it extraordinarily hard to put the bloody thing down; and when it is all over, you feel quite low in that you are longing for more.For those of you who read King plainly for the sex and violence/horror, you will not be disappointed. As I said, the book is an action film, and all action films are quite abundant in violence and gore. Enough said. And the relationship between Polly and Sheriff Pangborn (and to a lesser extent, between Myra, Cora and Elvis)should be enough to satisfy any hetrosexuals out there.So, all in all, a highly enjoyable read that, while perhaps not awarded 'classical' status by critics, is certainly a personal favourite for me. And, for a change, the movie complemented the book (relatively) well.Please, give it a shot."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is a book midway between the early gory, boogery King and the current thoughtful horror of the human heart King. It's good. The main characters, Polly and Alan are like people you might know and like."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I prefer Stephen King's short stories to his novels and I picked up Needful Things without reading the previous books in the series. While I wouldn't recommend doing this, I was presently surprised and enjoyed the read. Not a lot new here for King, but what he does, he does very well. Fans of King will enjoy Needful Things and newcomers to Kings work should find the series nice diversion.BJ [...]"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I just want to advise readers about this excellent writing masterpiec"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Needful Things, I would argue, is King's best work.I have read most of his work, and I find this one mostintriguing. The way he blends characters with events andtime is incredible. He has a wonderful sense of revenge andmystery, but at the same time love and peacefulness, inNeedful Things. I give it two and a half thumbs up. Greatpage turner. Once he gets into your head, he has you. That'swhat makes him a great author."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Over ten years ago I picked this hardcover up in a bargain bin. I started it but laid it down and didn't return to it until just recently. Now I remember why I laid it down. Long and boring. This book would have made a wonderful short story. SK was really stretching things by making an epic novel out of it. His editor was asleep at the wheel, it seems.Skip it. There's a reason this novel rarely (if ever) appears on the \\"favorites\\" lists of SK fans."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, and not just because it's a Stephen King piece. It's just a damn good story. The characters are easy to care about and they seem very realistic in how they deal with the calamity that befalls them. It was also great to see strings tied up from the prior Castle Rock stories."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"Sometimes you discover an author, enjoy the hell out of a couple of their books, and just keep going. Before you know it, you've read most of their material, but you've found that the magic just isn't there any more. For me, Stephen King is one of those authors, and Needful Things is one of those books. It's a decent book, and gives the reader nothing more and nothing less than can reasonably be expected. But I found myself wondering throughout if I wasn't suffering from a bit of King Burnout. Reading through some of the reviews on this website, I can't help but wonder if some other folks are, too.Just a thought here, but I really am starting to think that King novels are even better on audio book. I have listened to several while on long road trips (Cell, Insomnia, Salems Lot, The Shining, Duma Key). I have enjoyed them all.So for this review, I'll do my best to cast that bias aside. It's easy to criticize King for being \\"unoriginal\\" or \\"unimaginative,\\" but there really are only so many different variations within one genre. Yes, The Stand was better. Yes, Salems Lot was more suspenseful. Yes, \\"It\\" was more psychologically gripping. So what? That still doesn't change the fact that there is nothing wrong with this book overall.Leland Gaunt is a good villain, Alan Pangborn is an interesting hero, and for once (spoiler) King doesn't kill off the female lead. His descriptions of small-town life and drug use are detailed and gripping, and the plot he lays down enables him to slip in some social criticism on religion and materialism along the way.Still, I had a few minor problems with the novel. I had a hard time believing in \\"Buster\\" Keaton as the slowly unraveling politician, just as I had trouble with King's gleeful, over-the-top depiction of Big Jim Rennie in Under The Dome. I also didn't quite buy King's depiction of the Baptists-vs-Catholics material in Needful Things. But again, I suspect this is my Stevie King fatigue rearing its ugly head again; his post-1980s bad guys all seem to be politically conservative, religious, or sexual deviants. Or some combination of the three. In this sense, Needful Things is basically Under The Dome Lite.With all of that said, I called Needful Things a B- book for a reason. Newcomers to King should enjoy the hell out of it, and it's not bad even for King burnouts like myself. If you're on the fence, I say just buy the thing--you'll thank yourself later.NOTE ON KINDLE EDITION: I just bought a Kindle, and so far I have enjoyed it. But a warning to anyone who is excessively bothered by typos and is considering buying Needful Things on Kindle--you're going to pull your hair out. The OCR software they used on this one was pretty bad, and the cool woodcut-looking illustrations at the beginning of each chapter were hopelessly muddled. Still, I found it to be worth the nine bucks I paid."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"I think that everyone should read &lt;u>Needful Things&lt;/u> by Stephen King. It's a 750 some odd page book, but it is a real page turner. Compared to most King books, &lt;u>Needful Things&lt;/u> moves *very* fast. It really taps into the truth of human nature and materialism -- I don't want to buy &lt;em>anything&lt;/em> at all &lt;strong>ever again&lt;/strong>. As usual there is a heroic male character with an emotional Achille's heel which he has to overcome to \\"save\\" the female character. If you've never read a Stephen King book, they are the only two characters that survive usually -- not even the dog. King doesn't seem to like dogs.The only negative I could give you is just a complaint about King's writing style: One minute you're reading a wholesome horror novel and the next thing you know one of the character's is talking about a woman's \\"hard erect nipples\\" or other nonsense like that. I have no objection to \\"hard erect nipples\\" in literature, sometimes its appropriate -- but King likes to *randomly* insert pornographic language which adds nothing to the content and really intterupts the flow of the novel [ wrote the blogger who's nipples were hard and erect ] -- SEE! Do you see how that was jarring and interuptted my review?&lt;u>Needful Things&lt;/u> was most definately worth my time and as such I will give it a five out of five. Five what you ask?Hard Erect Nipples.(...)"},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This book, although not scary at all to me, was an excellent book. The book is really addicting, as well as all of his books. I started reading it and would not stop for many hours, which is really unusual for myself. King is an excellent author, not only for what he writes about, but how he writes it."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This was only the second or third Stephen King novel that I read (I've read half or more now). Needful Things was perhaps the book that made me enjoy King so much. The tale of a friendly (or is he?) shopkeeper that sells whatever it is that you want the most appealed to me for some reason. I'll keep this brief and say I recommend this to any reader."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"This is a wonderful book. When the Devil (AKA Leland Gaunt) opens his Needful Things shop in town, there is something for everyone if they are willing to pay the price (mainly there soul).What kind of things praytell. Well for 11 year old Brian its a baseball card, for Polly a necklace that soothes her arthritus for Ace it's a fast car.Strange, shortly after the shop opens, towns people who have known each other for years are starting to kill one another. Why? That's what Sheriff Panghorn wants to know.One thing for sure. This is a wonderfully well constructed and entertaining novel. It has minimal blood and gore like in other horror novels, including those by Mr. King; however, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"NEEDFUL THINGS","review":"That was the worst ending I've ever read from Stephen King. And I've read CELL.We have a story full of lots of characters -- too many to keep straight -- and the wonderful horror that sweeps over their town. Good work.Then we have the ending. Out of left field, we get all these extra \\"facts\\" that weren't introduced at all, just silly deus ex devices to fake us into feeling some symmetry when our hero and villain face off.SO CONTRIVED!
