First, humans think the newts are devils. Next, they are killed and examined. Once their strengths are understood, they are exploited by greedy manufactures. Until war breaks out...Response to the newts varies by country: Germany does terrible experiments on them, in France there is labor unrest, England bans them from entering the country, etc.Throughout, Capek's ironic sense of humor sparkles.An excellent read --- and lesson to learn."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"This title doesn't often come up in lists of the best sf works of all time, but it definitely has a place there. Profoundly hilarious, this book and its characters have influenced many a science fiction writer since its release (anybody see a little bit of the Newts in the &quot;Gungan&quot; from the most recent Star Wars film?). Read it or suffer."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"To get a good look at what colonialism did to the Africa and the like, then read this book. There are a few flaws, I think, in that those colonized want to seek revenge. However, this is a great book for young people and adult to read and analyze without getting too caught up in race."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I've been going back and forth between three and four stars with this one for some time now. I want to be fair, but also want to avoid being too &quot;top-heavy&quot; or overly-positive with everything. That said, I must finally admit that while this is certainly a good book, I don't think it will become one of my favorites. Three stars, I think, is my final decision, and I mean that positively - it's a book deserving fully of three stars.Capek was certainly important to science fiction, an accomplished writer, and possessing of generous wit. I found myself laughing out loud from time to time despite the overly serious undertones contained throughout. The middle section dragged a bit with its profuse and long footnotes, which grew irritating after a time. I know Capek was being as &quot;authentic&quot; as possible with a work of fiction, but I myself am glad that it has not been much emulated since. There are a few obvious religious parallels and of course political messages. But at the heart, it is an enjoyable science fiction story. I consider three stars to be a good rating for a good book, and I encourage skeptical readers to push their way through it."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Karel Capek wrote this book against the dark clouds of the unholy duos of communism and nazism, of the world of Hitler's and Stalin's. The pessimistic, yet humorous outlook on humanity and the adversities befalling it at the nimble hands of the newts, is as valid today, as it was in 1936, when this book was first published. Shrouded in a wealth of detail, the &quot;War With The Newts&quot; anticipated much of what happened in the decades after the 1930s, anything from the population explosion to the horrors of World War II. Capek's book is to literature, what Herge's &quot;Tintin&quot; is to comic books. You will not regret reading it - warmly recommended!"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Capeks understanding of human stupidity and the evils that follow it is unmatched in my opinion. Yet the tone in his work is overwelmingly charming and outrageously funny. He is also my favorite writer,and in The war with the newts his genius is evident on every page.He tells the story in a highly entertaining way.Instead of having one or two main Characters hapek jumps between all kinds of different people from the most variyng walks of life, and through the the mirror of their experiences the reader sees the reflected Grand Worldspanning plot. A wonderfull book. Read it. It makes you feel good."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I am sure the translator is a native Czech speaker, which is half what's needed. The other requirement is someone with facility with the English language. That's not to be found in this Kindle version of War With the Newts. The Kindle book is cheap, but I'd pay $9.99 for a competent translation."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"this book is funny and clever and ultimately really chilling; it's easily one of the best sci-fi novels ever written, and it does an amazing job of skewering the whole idea of using sci-fi as social critique (there are a number of chapters that play with \\"what do the newts symbolize? the disenfranchised proleteriate? the racially oppressed? nazis? fascists?\\")."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"War With the Newts is a Swiftian social satire from the Czech science fiction writer Karl Capek. Gulliver's Travels uses humanlike animals to represent or critique human traits. The principal difference is that here, the Newts come to us. Newts are intelligent, amphibious salamanders that Capek, in what he probably doesn't realize is a digression into mysticism, calls Nature's other attempt to achieve the pinnacle of evolution. After being discovered on the verge of extinction by a pearl-hunting sea captain, the Newts quickly develop an advanced civilization in the context of twentieth century Earth.The Newts serve two allegorical purposes for Capek. They represent the worst of humanity, and they bring out the worst in humanity. At first, they are treated to typical ugly colonialism and have visited upon them every atrocity and indignity one could imagine humanity inflicting on a weaker race. We also see Capek's political views, at least to the extent that he thinks all the major political movements of his time were just silly. His disdain for communism explains the fifty-year gap between first and second printing of the novel. Nazism is presented as buffoonish, capitalism as plain evil. As we look more closely at the Newts, however, they become menacing in their racial lack of interest in art, science, recreation, or anything beyond the rudimentary religion. By the end of the book, it is clear that we are rooting for humanity as the war comes. Man does not live by bread alone, but the Newts live solely on oysters.I had thought to read Newts as a diatribe against war, starting it as we begin our unlawful invasion. But pacifism isn't the point of the book; if there's a moral, it's that we must treat each other decently and responsibly. But the last chapter could have been written by an Iraq hawk, as the world community mulishly refuses to unite against the growing menace of the Newts, to its ultimate doom. Newts is a Frankenstein story, like R.U.R, and a good one. But ultimately its target audience should have been WWII Germans, and today its trenchant pronouncements on the dangers of technology seem poignantly obsolete...too late."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"A Newt is a kind of salamander, in this case, a highly intelligent and all-too-willing-to-learn-from-humans salamander. Of course, the Newts, like any species which decides to ape humans (oops! too many species in one sentence), must go to war with them. Er, us. Imitation, flattery and all that. The book is 240 pages with a minimum of one cry and one laugh guaranteed per page.Karl Capek, the Czech novelist, essayist and playwrite, died shortly after the Nazi invasion of his country, thus saving the Nazis the trouble of sending him off to a concentration camp. He is (all you SF fans will know) the fellow who dreamed up the word \`robot'. He also had a good hook into human greed, hypocracy and pomposity. He was a democrat without illusions, an occupation requiring a doctorate in humor, black, tongue-in-cheek and otherwise.In the end - well, in the end the Newts only want the very same things we want. Not very comforting, is it?"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Intelligent amphibious creatures (newts) who can speak and use tools are discovered in Indonesia. Scientists, movie stars, corporations, politicians and armies all take an interest in encounters that are sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, but always thought provoking in their gentle satire of how people tend to behave when confronted with something new. Capek wrote this book in 1936, a time of technological and political upheaval. This book combines an absorbing plot and humorous flourishes with a fictional examination of how destructive humankind's collective behavior can be despite the best intentions. The book has aged well-- Capek wasn't very interested in technology, but rather in exploring how his fictional but often very familiar world reacts to a big, unexpected change."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"While on a trip to the Czech Republic, I decided to forego the usual Kafka and Kundera and look for some less well-known authors. I found this little jewel in a bookstore in Prague, and immediately began to read it. Though I must admit it took a little effort to read the first few chapters, It presented a very entertaining experience. Capek's satirical comments, presented in a wonderful, offhand manner (exceptionally funny are those about Aryan supremacy and British pride) add a touch of lightness to what is, in essence, a very dark book. An anti-utopia in all its glory, this novel is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Capek wrote this novel, parallel in theme to R.U.R., but delightful, delicate, hilarious; and repeatedly sad, sweet, personal, and tragic. I read it around age 15, and later discovered how much of the tone of my own writing (and media satire) was started from Capek. Sharp, fresh, and behind it all, Capek's view--humane, decent, written as the destruction of Europe approached."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"The amazing thing--well, one of many amazing things--about &quot;War with the Newts&quot; is Capek's use of a kind of &quot;multimedia&quot; approach to this novel. He includes newspaper clippings (in a font which resembles a tear sheet), &quot;scientific&quot; articles, minutes of executive meetings, and other odd props to provide a rich ensemble of Newt source literature, all carefully archived by the thoughtful Mr. Povondra, a former butler and self-assessed catalyst for the new Salamandrian epoch. The break in text, both visually and conceptually, the hard swing between narrative and press clipping, reminds one of the multimedia format of magazines such as the late Mondo 2000, Wired, or the books of J.G. Ballard. All this from a man writing in pre-war Czechoslovakia! Palpably sarcastic yet brilliantly subtle: Newt professors in gown and mortarboard in tin bathtubs, benighted sea captains, hollywood starlets, and looming diluvean apocalypse. Prescient, funny, and important."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"...and this is also the genesis of science fiction as a medium for social commentary. Long before Kurt Vonnegut, Philip K. Dick, and Douglas Adams mined science fiction for dark pearls of wisdom, Karel Capek set the stage with the delightful &quot;War with the Newts.&quot; A long-time favorite of mine ever since I studied it in a literature class in college, I enjoy revisiting this book time and time again. Capek effectively uses a time-line approach to document the exploitation of the &quot;newts,&quot; all the while poking fun at (then-current) Aryan superiority, rascism, and &quot;bonehead&quot; science. The assumption of the inferiority of certain classes of people is shown by Capek to inevitably lead to the downfall of the world as we know it. Since Capek's time, other authors have followed his path with some success, but Capek remains the master of this genre, and, along with H. G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Jules Verne (oft-imitated authors in their own right), he must be considered one of the pioneers of modern science fiction"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I found War With The Newts in a box sent over by the Red Cross when I was in Vietnam in 1967.

I don't believe there is a contemporary satirist who is Karel Capek's rival."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Capek has created a world that is at once fantastical and believable. The novel brings you into a history that after several pages seems very real. Entertaining. Though provoking. Humorous and sad. This book is a find. Can humankind ever learn from history?"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I had to read this book years ago for high school and dreaded it because it sounded boring (no offense). However, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an interesting yet intellectual book. I think that you would have to be a politics, economics, sociology, psychology, biology, and english expert to get all out of this book that you possibly can. The seemingly outlandish plot of newts overtaking the world somehow loses its ring of fiction during the course of the novel and a reader begins to see how it all happens. You begin to question human history and where are we headed. The sarcasm and wit it takes to write such a page turner is true talent ( not to mention the insight of culture). Don't be mislead like I was and pass it by- it is worth the time to read"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"Of all the books I have ever had to read for a class, this was the greatest book of them all. I've had the horrible experience of an assigned book, but this book makes up for almost all of that. A brilliant satire on the world, I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone (and have many times since reading it). This book can be applied to any situation or time period. In the end, this book is great! [sorry it's not a more descriptive explanation, but anything more and the plot of the book would be revealed :) ]"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"For those of you who are not familiar with czech writing, I recommend that you start with authors like Kundera (which bears no resemblance with Capek), Sotola (master of the written word), and Skvorecky (this one you'll like).After reading those books, you will have an insight in czech prose, and you will thank me for mentioning it :)Okay, now serious... This book is about war with the newts (that is what the title says, is it), but it wouldn't be much of a book if it were only that... If you like to think trough major philosophical, and ethical problems, considering Politics, Policy, Antrophology, education, sexualness this is the book you should read.Problems beforementioned are integrated in the hillarious story with such marvel that often you'll stop and wonder, asking yourself: \\"Where was I thinking, what was I doing\\"... It's funny, It's intellignet, it's very serious once you give your thought to it... what else do you need... Great introduction to czech prose"},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"I remember when I was a child and I used to be so fascinated with certain stories because the plot just kept getting better and better and the stioy was so good that it always made me want to read more. This is exactly how I felt about war with the newts. The story line was so interesting and funny that I just wanted to read more to see what was going to happen next. A unique part of this book was it's ongoing footnotes, which provided humorous additions to the plot or just gave interesting facts that made the story even more appealing. If you want to feel like a kid again and just enjoy fantasy like story, read War with the Newts."},{"Title":"War With the Newts","review":"This book is definitely a must read. If you like Vonnegut, you'll love Capek. He can make you roll on the floor laughing on one page, and instantly become panicked on the next. A truly enlightening book."},{"Title":"Production functions (Macmillan studies in economics)","review":"A short and straightforward explanation of factors of production and how to model these quantitatively. Much of the book involves explaining the key Cobb-Douglas production function. You will need a first course in multivariate calculus to understand the derivations. But Heathfield deliberately keeps the treatment as simple as possible. Just enough analysis to illustrate ideas like Elasticity of Substitution and returns to scale.The book is still quite valid today."},{"Title":"Berkeley Square","review":"Great book to add to my collection.

The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America","review":"As a reporter for a weekly newspaper in Hudson County, I was able to interview Sid twice -- once for a profile in anticipation of his visit to the Beatlefest in Secaucus and later when he worked with a local promoter for a benefit. For both stories, this book helped bring out details of his life and his passions I would have missed, and helped me ask the right questions. It is a fun book about a special man, and for me, the book enlightened me about the details behind some of the more historic events of my life, such as what really happened when the Beatles came to America in 1964. This was a trip down memory lane. Thank you Sid."},{"Title":"It's Sid Bernstein Calling ... The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America","review":"&quot;It's Sid Bernstein Calling&quot; might seem to be one, long show business success story, but it's not.It's way better. It's many entertaining show business success stories in the life of one man.&quot;It's Sid Bernstein Calling&quot; is a well-written story of the many and varied successes of a kid from the Bronx, who took his chances and managed the biggest acts in show business.Bernstein was the first guy to sense that The Beatles were going to hit it big; he organized the world's first modern rock concert (The Beatles, Shea Stadium, August 1965) and his tireless promotion of superstar artists is a textbook in real world show biz promotion.The book is well written, a pleasure to read. Arthur Aaron's well-researched writing tells Sid Bernstein's story and never gets in the way of dealing with Bernstein's experiences, personal life and work ethics. The ups and downs are all there. Bernstein holds nothing back. It's a real story about the real thing.Read it for such great ancedotes as how a piano got him to promote Abba, how he helped Tony Bennett sell out Carnegie Hall, helped promote The Young Rascals and the dozens of other superstars who have benefited from his golden touch.Sid Bernstein is a rarity today - an honest, trusthworty and hardworking musical and theatrical promoter. A must read if you want to know about show business and treating people with class and respect."},{"Title":"It's Sid Bernstein Calling ... The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America","review":"Sid Bernstein is nobody who would be called shy. His bold and confident approach to the music industry made him one of the most successful and historical legends among characters whose sheer presence could eclispe even superstars. Naturally, the book reads like Bernstein's personality: it's straightforward, New York-brassy, and honest. His personal, behind-the-scene accounts of the English invasion and its two major acts -- The Beatles and The Rolling Stones -- are worth the price of the book alone. But there's more to be learned about the evolution of the music biz from first-person advice than almost anywhere else. Best of all, it's a very quick read."},{"Title":"It's Sid Bernstein Calling ... The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America","review":"This isn't really a review, more of a statement. I happen to know Sid Bernstein very well. He has become more than a friend. I consider him Family. I just love all of the fantastic facts that he wrote about. I have read it several times. As a result when I find out someone's musical tastes, I purchase his book and give it to them as a gift. He was a very important part of the Music Business. He should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's incredible how many lives he touched in his career. His Birthday is this Wednesday!

The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America","review":"I believe the author has taken another weak stab at weaseling some more dollars out of a periphial relationship with Sid.(maybe once he stood in line behind Sid when getting his morning Bialy?)Since I am reviewing this, I also belive it should clearly be labeled as a work of fiction, as it is obvious to me the author continues to be a schnorrer of others fame for his own meager financial gain in my humble opinion.Unless you know the author, (like the past reviewers, posting \\"canned\\" reviews) I believe you should consider your purchase of this so called \\"book\\" just a contribution to his retirement plan.As I said before in my title, I believe this poor excuse for a self published \\"book\\" is an opportunistic con, similar to a dimestore comic book."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"What a letdown?

The worlds McReynolds weaves in this book, and the sequels (Dreamstone and Prince of Time), are so rich and intriguing that I have since reread the trilogy several times, picking up new things I've missed in previous readings.

The marauding Normans wanted the keep for themselves. The only residents to escape on that fatal night were the children of Merioneth. One of the survivors, Ceridwen, finds her life totally intertwined with her former home. The present Lord of Merioneth (renamed Balor) insists on taking the beautiful Ceridwen for his bride in order to harness the magic that she, unknown to herself, possesses.Ceridwen's savior comes in the form of a disillusioned warrior who lost his faith when he became a slave in a Moslem household during the Crusades. Dain's only goal until he lost his heart to Ceridwen is to uncover the secrets of alchemy so that he can be rich. He is unaware of the powers residing just below the earth's surface until he falls prey to the same destiny that is Ceridwen's curse and hopefully her eventual blessing. Believing in someone again, Dain prepares to fight friend and foe to keep the Welsh maiden safe at his side.Glenna McReynolds, known for her whimsical category romances, produces a stunning single title release that unleashes talents that have been hidden in the shorter formats of her previous novels.

The &quot;wild folk&quot; of themountains, meadows, and caves and the people from the castlegather with the three persons needed to &quot;call the dragons&quot; and lookinto the scrying pool to mark the eternal cycle of life, death andrebirth. They are Rhiannon, caller of the dragons, Nemeton, a greatsorcerer, and Rhuddlan, leader of the Quicken-tree tribe. But whenRhiannon peers into the pool this night, it's the fall of CarnMerioneth she sees as a band of soldiers advance upon the Keep.Five-year-olds Ceridwen and Mychael are spared onlybecause they've disobeyed and ventured into the tunnels to catch aglimpse of the festival. Nemeton's daughter Moriath, their nurse,also survives, and smuggles Mychael to Strata Florida Abbey whiletaking Ceridwen to Usk Abbey where she herself grew up -- andhid a mysterious book. Also spared is Rhuddlan, who seals theweir gate and traps the dragon larvae in their dark maze. Yearslater, he must again bring together the threefold union who canopen the gate and free the pyrf: himself, Ceridwen ab Arawn,daughter of Rhiannon who inherited the gift of calling the dragons,and Dain Lavrans, successor of the sorcerer Nemeton.Chapter one opens with a less than brave groom being sentto fetch the Danish sorcerer Dain Lavrans to the great hall ofWydehaw Castle. The little man is so terrified of the mage thatwhen lightning strikes as he grabs the gargoyle door knocker hefaints dead away. Lavrans opens the door to find a man frozen toit, and delights in the knowledge that he will be accredited withaccomplishing the great feat himself.Lavrans goes to the great hall and discovers he's beensummoned to tend the wounds of a jewel-like beauty captured byRagnor the Red, Wydehaw's most bestial knight. Chained to thewall, Ceridwen has been gashed across her forehead, has a deepbite wound on her shoulder, and a broken ankle. Lavrans is theonly man the red-haired giant is frightened of and therefore plays onhis fear of spells and dark incantations by using a magic trick. Hetakes a green bauble from his pocket, deftly doing sleight-of-handwith the orb as he gives Ragnor a choice; take the stone and keepthe maiden, or have neither. As he chants of faerie dreams anddeath and serpent stones for effect, the tiny slip of a girl suddenlysnatches the stone from him herself -- thus sending Ragnor fleeingin horror.Dain takes the maid to his tower to tend her, and finds thather innocence is like a balm to his old and weary soul, helping himheal from his disgraceful past where he was known as &quot;the Swan&quot;to a desert slaver. Ceridwen remembers love, but having been tornfrom everyone who ever cared for her at the tender age of five, sheis very hungry to know it again. Together Dain and Ceridwen mustface a destiny foretold by their ancestors, and embark on anadventure that could either tear them apart or seal their fate forever.Glenna McReynold's turn of phrase and humor is asengrossing as her story and characters. Through rich descriptionand detail she allows readers to slip on the cloak of the charactersand become them, feeling their desolation when love seems lost andelation when obstacles are overcome.

Altho I thought the characters lacked fullness, I'm sure this was deliberate...you can then go back in time and create stories based on Ceridwen's and Mychael's mother and father (who died early in the novel) or create another novel centered around Dain, as a Crusader. I would enjoy reading about his desert slavery--it was an integral part of this book, in an indirect sort of way. Almost like David Carradine in the TV series, Kung Fu, where he constantly had flashbacks and remembered key conversations in his life that helped to mold him. I enjoy strong heroines and altho Ceridwen developed strength, I felt she was more willful than strong-willed. She was more a victim of circumstance rather than a central person, which is why I think the author now concentrates in her next novel on her twin brother, Mychael. I enjoyed the sorcery and would have liked a little more of a glimpse of the dragons. Nevertheless, I will read the sequel, Dreamstone."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"A terrific story. I thought the characters could have been a little more developed but it didn't dampen my enjoyment a bit."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"This novel is seething with dark emotions and danger. This is not a light fluffy read, nor a book for the faint hearted. If you like your men dark and dangerous, your novel dealing with the intracacies of emotions, and your women just a little bit misterious, then this is the book for you. Read it, you'll love it!!"},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"This anthropological, sociological and archaeological study is one of the most daring and profound things I've ever read. Ms Eisler's primary sources are valid (I've checked) and her conclusions are mind-boggling. PLEASE read this book even if you check it out of a library or borrow it from a friend! It may be the most important book you ever read."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"I'm a very avid reader and I tend to be open-minded when it comes to books. By the time I got half way through this book, I didn't care anymore. The story went on and on and on and... well you get the picture. I was really disappointed because this had so many good reviews."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"I was eager for a good historical read and instead I get disjointed fluff that was mostly to boring or incoherent to bother reading. The love scene was sweet and tender and about the only decent thing she wrote in the entire book, which tells me that this is simply a classy porn novel and not a romance- Boo"},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"The odd thing about this story is that there is a Cerridwen and Rhuddlwm who are connected with a Welsh Witchcraft page at: http://www.newageinfo.com/bus/cymry. They knew nothing about The Chalice and the Blade, but their story parallels the Glenna McReynolds story. They are Druid/Witches and so are the protaganists of the story. They are married. Rhuddlan and Ceridwen are not, but they were lovers. They are members of a Welsh Druid based religion ( Y Tylwyth Teg) and so are the two characters. I was not only amazed, but also flabergasted at the synchronistic event of Glenna Writing this particular story. You see my name is Cerridwen and I am a member of Y Tylwyth Teg which Glenna wrote about without knowing us. In fact when I called her she too was dumbstruck at the similarities between her book and the real life religion she writes about. Her book is not only one of the most fascinating historical fantasy books on the market. But in some respects it carries many elements of truth. This comes from the extensive research that Ms. McReynolds undertook before writing this wonderful tale. A must read for all those interested in Druidism and Witchcraft.

I was really hoping to see some demonstration of the girl's so called powers but that wasn't until the end. The thing that really repulsed me was the description of perversion amd sexual urges.

Not sure about those other readers who complained it was too slow - certainly the plot was reasonably complex and filled with intrigue but it just made my imagination take off... It would translate beautifully to the big screen! There would be epic chase scenes, scenes in great halls with feasting, flashbacks to torture scenes, mystery, intrigue, pagan nature rituals, evil villians, heroes storming the castle... It would be epic - fantasy, magic and the middle ages come to life.Please, someone make this book into a movie!"},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"Glenna McReynolds makes history come alive in this great book of passion and magic. Set in 12th century Wales, the characters come alive, and you'll remember them for years to come. This was a book that was hard to put down, but like in any good story, there has to be an end. Too bad because as you read it, you wish that it didn't come to an end. Praise for Glenn McReynolds!"},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"A great romance. . .but the whole thing with the dragons was a big disappointment. I don't want to give the end away, but the part when they release them I found was very confusing. One thing that really bothered me is that it was very difficult for me to invision the dragons. The adjectives used for their description were too vague.The romance part was great though."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"Lovers, druids, dragons, magic and more; this story had it all. This is one of the best written books I have ever read. The characters are well developed and interesting and the love story is terrific. I could not put this book down and cannot wait for Glenna McRenyolds' next book."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"This book, this story is very well written. The detail and the passion put into this book brought the characters to life within my soul. The passion that this author writes with gives life to the story in such a way, that when you reach the end there is a feeling of sadness. The sadness wants the story to continue. This book was obliviously written with truths from history, which makes it much more fascinating. The way she starts the book is with complete consideration of the reader. She explains how words are pronouced, there are maps and a page or two of explanation of characters and who they are. Very well written. If fantasy with a hint of history is what you like you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"Though I am not sure why the comparison to the works of Ms. Gabladon (talented in her own right, but, very different styles) other than for the sake of PR (same publishing house, different divisions), this is a wonderful story. Though unevenly paced at times and a bit choppy in her writing, Ms. McReynolds has brought us a beautiful story of two people who just want to move on with their lives and forget the pains of their prospective pasts. Ceridwen and Dane fit together well and the progression of their meeting and falling in love is handled steadly and realistically. They are part of their environment and have been molded by it. When they both allow themselves to love, Ms. McReynolds does not become sappy or sentimental. She has brought us two people damaged by their past yet who are willing to risk themselves one more time for love. The story of the three men in the Crusades and how it effected each one and how the destruction of Carn Merioneth effected Ceridwen and Mychael is done in a wonderfully subtle way to the main story to show why each character does what he/she does. It adds to the here and now of the story without drowning it. This is not an easy skill and Ms. McReynolds does it beautifully. Full of magic and tricks and dragons, the real message here is that all can be survived, handled, and overcome through the best magic of all - love."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"If you are expecting an exeptional fantisy story, I would not read this book. I know that writers of fantisy must sometimes be vague to add to the mystery of the magic they write about. However, McReynolds crosses the line into confusion. This is fine at some points in a story, but this confusion is the main plot of the book. I did not think that I would have enjoyed the romance as much as I did. It is not exeptionally original and very predictable, but I enjoyed the love story far more than I have enjoyed many others by writers of the same caliber. I recomend relaxing when you read this, do not sit and try to think out the plot logically. Instead, sit back and enjoy the easy reading of the beautiful love story intertwined with adventure."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers that pegged this as boring. You want it to pick up . . . you want to like it . . . but in the end . . . NOTHING. This book has the feeling of waiting for the story to really start, but it never does. The writer is too concerned with introducing dozens of secondary characters and while some of them are more lovable and interesting then the hero and heroine others are pointless and you find yourself wondering who she is talking about. (FYI the front of the book has a list of who is who and a glossary which should warn you not to start this incomprehensible at times mess. This is not an epic tome as to amount to needing as much.) Other parts of the book where more information and back story is needed she skips it entirely. This kind of story is right up my alley, but I couldn't like it no matter how I tried. Halfway through I thought to myself . . . well I made it this far I want to see what happens, but the climax is just as bad as the rest of the story and more time is given to the demise of an earlier protagonist then the main \\"villains\\". Do not waste your time there is so much better out there."},{"Title":"The Chalice and the Blade","review":"This began with a reasonably interesting concept and story idea, but the plot keeps draggin on. Sub-plots and secondary characters keep coming in and it's getting boring to read and to follow everything that is going on.

It has romance, magic, and an adventure full of mystery. I could not put it down until I had read the whole thing. It was not a &quot;typical&quot; romance novel.

The text however is useless, unless you need to be told that putting in lots of options will raise the price, create the floorplan based on your family's interests and that you shouldn't spend more than you can afford. It really isn't anything more than you could get with a 10 minutes trip to the website of a log home manufacturer, except that it has much less info!It tells you, for example, that you should make careful and deliberate use of all the space by planning it carefully, but does not show examples of good planning, give you thought provoking questions to ask yourself, or anything that could help you do it.The book mentions that there are 2 types of log cabins, names them and gives a few uncaptioned photographs, without even one word to tell you what the advantages of one over the other might be.It tells you that a complicated roof is more expensive than an uncomplicated one. Did you need to be told? It does not tell you what the choices are in roof styles, the advantages and weather reasons you might want one more than the other, dispite the cost, and it certainly does not tell you what the price differences are (even an approx % difference would have been a start).It does not suggest anything useful and should only be bought by someone who is on their way to the log home manufacturer in their area so that they can point to the pictures in the book and facilitate the teaching the company will then have to provide. This is for a person buying a finished, installed product, not building a home.I was very disappointed and would never have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore. It is meant for someone who buys magazines exclusively for the pictures and does not read the articles. This will not help you build a house."},{"Title":"Small Log Homes: Storybook Plans and Advice","review":"This book is for the log home dreamers and offers affordable and attainable log home plans.

It basically goes over building a log home...ok - well I thought it would be focused more on its title: Small Log Homes: Storybook Plans and Advice.

It's not meant to be a \\"how to\\" manual, or provide detailed information. It's just a starter for those dreaming of building a log home.Some of the positives are that the book itself is high-quality, the photos are very good for the most part, and it does provide enough information to help determine if a log home really is for you. Some of the negatives for me are the photos are unrelated (there will be photos of the exterior of two log homes, followed by a photo of a kitchen, followed by a photo of a porch, followed by a photo of another kitchen . . . interspersed with text that may or may not have anything to do with the photos shown); I would have preferred groups of photos of one home at a time so I could understand the house better. And the plans and elevations at the back of the book are \\"stand-alones\\" for the most part; they are unrelated to the photos shown earlier in the book. It would have been nice to have plans and photos of homes actually built.It's a nice \\"starter\\" book, so I gave it four stars.

It is very informative for those who want a small log home. But when I say small, I mean small. If you, like some wealthy ppl I know, think that 4000 sq ft is small, this book isn't for you. Also, the author included a lot of valuable information and suggestions for making the most of small space.

The black and white photographs looked OK, which was no doubt a major technical accomplishment. However, the line drawings (floor plans and elevations) were too faint to read so were no use whatsoever.Also, I believe that the work should have been proof read after converting it for use on the Kindle. The first half on one sentence was several pages from the last half; and the last half was spliced into the middle of another sentence in an unrelated paragraph. Also, the reference in the text to (I believe) page 5 was frustrating as there is no Kindle pagination reflecting the original pagination.In terms of content, the ideas in this book are hardly original. The floor plans and elevations might be helpful if one could see them on the Kindle.All this being said, the details shown in the photographs were helpful to me and might be to others too. However, subscription to a log homes magazine would probably be a better choice for this type of information as the pictures are brighter, clearer, and in color in the magazines.One more thing: This book addresses small log homes. This is not to say that it addresses inexpensive log homes. I would caution the reader to be aware that many of the homes pictured are small, expensive log homes. They may not be multi-million dollar homes, but square foot for square foot - they are much more expensive than conventional construction.

In general, I find her humor easy to relate to and often find myself laughing out loud to her observations and stories.However, in this book, it seemed almost as if Laurie was stretching and/or overcompensating to fill a book with humorous stories relating to Christmas. It was almost as if she was trying too hard to make some stories funny, and it just felt a little redundant. Overall, it's a quick read, and not terrible by any means.If you are choosing to read your first Lauire Notaro book, I would definitely not recommend this book, but instead recommend that you read \\"The Idiot Girls Action Adventure Club\\" and/or \\"Autobiography of a Fat Bride\\" to get a true picture of her writing abilities."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"zany hilarious and full of life... wonderfully written fun!

Her collection of Christmas stories is excellent. While a few of the stories are re-prints from a few of her books, she's the type of author where you can read the same short story over and over and it will still be just as funny when you read it first.

This is her fifth (and unfortunately, her shortest) book to date. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book as I did when reading her four other books. My only complaints about this book are (1) it was too short and now I'm jonesing for her to release another title, and (2) three of the stories were repeats from prior books, meaning I'd already read them but because I love her and the book was so short, I re-read the three repeated (and retitled) stories anyway.

Just when you think you had a rough holiday season..."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"Laurie Notaro's fifth essay collection is short and sweet holiday reading. She delivers her unique brand of Idiot Girl humor on all subjects relating to the holidays, from pre-used gifts to the Year Laurie Ruined Christmas to fiber optic Christmas trees to taking aged Nana out shopping at the mall. Notaro's earlier books have focused on specific time periods of her life--single life, being a bride, married life and being an aunt, and so on. In contrast, the essays in this collection span all periods, from her teenage years, to early boyfriends, up to Notaro in the present day.Fans should be forewarned that a couple of essays are repeated here (two each from Autobiography of a Fat Bride and The Idiot Girls' Action Adventure Club). They fit well into the collection, however, and there's plenty of new material to justify the investment in the latest installment of the adventures of our favorite Idiot Girl."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"The air is crisp, the malls are full, your wallet's empty. Throw in some carols, stressed-out shoppers, sugarplums, never-ending lines, truffles, tinsel, tantrums and Laurie Notaro, and you're experiencing the most wonderful time of the year!AN IDIOT GIRL'S CHRISTMAS is far and away the funniest Christmas book I have ever read. Within the first eight pages of this delightfully twisted look at the hectic Christmas season, I laughed so hard I literally fell off my chair. There has never been a book that captures the stress and humor of the season like this, and undoubtedly it will become a Christmas classic for holiday-crazed women everywhere.This is yet another gold star on Notaro's growing list of books that includes THE IDIOT GIRL'S ACTION ADVENTURE CLUB and WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE PRETTIER. But this latest effort takes Notaro's slanted and quirky humor to a new level.It showcases the Notaro family at their best, with the twinkling tree and in all their Christmas finery. The holiday stress that we can all understand (the crazy party guests, the \\"re-gift,\\" and the horror of having to make a trip to K-Mart on Christmas Eve) is given a voice, and in that voice you too can find humor in the chaos and commotion of the holiday season.With chapter titles like \\"O Holy Night or The Year I Ruined Christmas\\", \\"Jingle Hell\\" and \\"Christmas Death Trap,\\" those already familiar with Notaro's humor can only imagine the twisted tales of \\"Christmas magic\\" that she weaves between the covers of this book. And if you're not familiar with Notaro's previous works, AN IDIOT GIRL'S CHRISTMAS is the perfect prescription for anyone suffering from Grinch syndrome. There is no way you can read it and not laugh out loud!So get yourself some cocoa, put the shopping list away, let the wrapping wait, and curl up with AN IDIOT GIRL'S CHRISTMAS.

I'm sad that her books only come out once in a while. I actually find myself laughing out loud as I'm reading about her crazy tales.

While it has a touch of the Bridget Jones, it refrains from the more annoying chick lit garbage clich&eacute;s. In fact, it is quite unique, as Notaro seems to be a grown-up, married punk chick with incredibly great prose and humorous style. She's empathetic, but also naughty enough to be real.

For any girl who has ever felt out of place or a little dumb or tripped over her own feet this book is for you!

It's a fun read. I especially loved the one about taking Nana shopping and shared it with two friends of mine who are dealing with demanding, cranky mothers in their late 80s.

It is just as funny and enjoyable to read as all of her books! Her books make me laugh so hard that when I read in bed, my husband gets annoyed with me for laughing so loud. Can't wait to read more from Laurie!!!!!!"},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"As a late arrival to the Laurie Notaro fanwagon (I didn't discover her until her third book), I got off to a slow start, finding her humor too confrontational at times, and too self-abasing at other times. Still, I found myself hunting down her previous books, and before I knew what had hit me, I was laughing and reading bits out loud to savor them.My favorite Notaro pieces all seem to involve shopping. In An Idiot Girl's Christmas, the standout essays are Deck the Mall, in which Laurie takes her Nana Christmas shopping, and Have Yourself a Kmart Little Christmas, in which Laurie finds herself in a crowded Super Kmart just before closing time on Christmas Eve.In another chapter, The Most Unfun Christmas Party Hostess Ever, we get an intriguing glimpse of Laurie's husband (although we still don't know his name). As they get their house ready for a Christmas party, unnamed husband asks \\"Do you think if I put my new Emily Dickinson biography on the coffee table that it will spur conversation?\\" Apparently, in his circle of friends, this is a distinct possibility. Laurie knows her friends, on the other hand, will \\"debate whether or not I know that I married a gay man.\\"An Idiot Girl's Christmas is a pretty short book, 142 pages in a hardcover the size of a trade paperback, but it's priced accordingly, and you'll definitely get your money's worth in laughs."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"In true Laurie style, this book will make you feel better about your worst Christmas memory. Because inevitably, hers is worse. Way worse.A really quick read (I picked it up after work yesterday...took it to the gym...and was finished before dinner) but fun and entertaining throughout. There is no filler in this short, but sweet book. Just lots of Laurie's unique humor encapsulated in bite sized Christmas stories of true horror. My favorite I think being the Super K-mart at midnight on Christmas Eve story.If you've read and liked ANY of her previous work...this book should be on your Christmas list...hopefully positioned above the puffy Christmas dish towels and nylon underwear large enough to cover a sports car in a downpour."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"I laughed, I cried and I wet my pants (only a little bit). Ms Notaro triumphs against adversity yet again and we are all invited to witness it.

For many of us, the Holidays are the most stressful time of year. Laurie Notaro has the insight meld her internal narration with true bits of hilarity that only happen during the holidays. Self-professed as a \\"non-intellectual\\" (unlike her husband) and not one of the crazies that start talking to you in line at Safeway; Laurie Notaro is comfortable somewhere in the middle, watching Anna Nicole Smith with the same horror & facination you would a train wreck. She offers useful solutions to quandries like controlling the eldery from coming unhinged in public places, and would REAL SIMPLE magazine print her solution of what to do with those 4 pks of white cotton brief panties in their \\"Things That Do Double Duty\\" section. Laurie Notaro never disappoints. I love this woman! Her book was my favorite Christmas present this year."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"Amen to the other reviewers! Couldn't have said it better myself, but I'll put in my $2(inflation) worth! The trip to KMART and the shopping trip with Nana are my personal favorites.

Notaro is for you!"},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"Let me preface this review by saying I am in love with Laurie Notaro. I think that if I lived closer to her I may become her stalker. =) Ok so that's not completely true, but what is true, is that I can't get enough of her books, and the Idiot Girl's Christmas is no exception. If you've ever done anything remotely clumsy, stupid, or asenine (especially whilst enjoying a cocktail of some sort) or have a crazy family, you will love Notaro's books. I literally laugh out loud (of course people do think I'm nuts; especially when on a plane by myself laughing like a mad cow...)Anyway, buy the book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"I really enjoyed this collection of holiday stories from Laurie Notaro. I own all her books, and am likely to buy a laundry list if she wrote it, so I didn't really mind the \\"re-runs\\" from AOAFB and IGAAC. The new stuff was, as usual, fabulous, irreverent, and hilarious. \\"The Most Unfun Christmas Hostess Ever\\" stood out as a favorite. If you're looking for a quick break from the holiday nightmare (even if only to peek through a window at someone else's), then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"I have read every one of Laurie's books and not once have I kept quiet. I laugh out loud in embarrassing, room-silencing, bladder testing, tummy aching, eyes streaming outburts throughout all of her books. This one is no different. If you read this book, be prepared to buy every other one of hers. In my opinion, she is one of the best life is a comedy authors out there. Even if you don't get this one, DEFINATELY purchase \\"I love everybody\\". It is her best book, ever."},{"Title":"An Idiot Girl's Christmas: True Tales from the Top of the Naughty List","review":"An extremely quick read. Almost always hilarious.

At no point in the book did i think of putting it down because it was so good.

This is one of those works, one that should be required reading for high school students, or, at the very least, for college students, if it isn't already. The horror that was the A-bomb unleashed unbridled power over the city of Hiroshima. Arguments could be made for both the necessity for the bomb to end the war, as well as the unnecessary and catastrophic violence unleashed.Either way you argue, Hersey's Hiroshima shows the true nature of the bomb from when it was dropped, the after effects, and the resulting long term medical problems the Hibukusha had to live with for the rest of their lives. I was awestruck at the description of what had happened, at times shaking my head at the power of such a bomb. Soldiers who had their eyes melted out of their sockets, people whose skin was slophing off, skinned burned off leaving raw and puss covered skin.These are of course present throughout Hersey's account, for how could we see what the survivors of Hiroshima went through if the descriptions are not there as well? We see unselfish and caring individuals putting their own health and safety at risk to help others worse off. We see the strength of human nature to struggle on despite the hopeless feeling that imbedded into all who were present.Hersey does a great job showing what happened, with people whose lives are all interrelated and connected in sundry ways, as well as to show how their lives carried on in the years after the A-bomb had been dropped. This is most certainly a recommend for young and old alike, and I would recommend it to all, regardless of the genre's they prefer to read.5 stars."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Next to Night by Elie Weisel, this is a very affective and powerful book that gives us a glimpse of the actual people that were affected by historical tragedy. While reading this book,i couldn't help but feel sick to my stomach to think of my own country's stupidity to release an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Many debates or thoughts that may surround this book is whether or not it was necessary for this event to happen, or if the war could have ended differently if it weren't for this tragedy. But more than anything, it will make you think of how so much carnage could ensue from a man-made weapon, and esp. make you think of how lucky we are in the 21st century to know for sure that nothing like the bombing in Hiroshima will happen again. If you are into history, esp. Japanese history, or the history of WWII, i believe that you will enjoy this. Even if you aren't a history buff, i think all people should read this. It may not be the BEST book to read about the event that occured in Hiroshima, but it's probably the first if not the only book that has first-hand accounts of the people who actually went through it and lived."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This was a great book. It was slow in some places, especially the end, but it is overall an engrossing read. It tells about six survivors - (1) Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk (2)Dr.Masaku Fujii, a physician (3)Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor's widow (4)Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest (5) Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young sergon (6) The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church - of the bomb dropped on hiroshima, written only from their memory and the incredible talent of John Hersey. This is a classic that truly \\"stirs the concience of humanity\\" (The New York Times)"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is powerfully objective. The facts and the details, the hardships that the six main characters go through make you question President Truman's morals and true consideration in his execution of the operation that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.The novel loses some steam in the last twenty pages or so, but I still highly recommend it if you don't have to read it for school."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"After reading John Hersey's Hiroshima the only thing I could say was WOW! and nothing else. It was possibily one of the greatest book I'd ever read I call this a good choice"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hersey, is about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened to six people before and after the explosion.

This book helps people who has never experienced war to understand how terrible and awful the war is. It has been more than 50 years since the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima. However, there are many people who are still suffering from the aftereffect of the atomic bomb today. After you read this book, your perspective of an atomic bomb would be different. I believe that we should never use the bomb again. I suggest to read this book, especially if you have never experienced war.

I hope peace will be with us in our world forever."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is a wonderful depiction of the horrors and tragedies associated with war. Hersey successfully involves the readers by his graphic accounts of the destruction inflicted upon the city and the victims. Altogether, Hiroshima is an incredible learning experience. Hersey tells this story in a way that no history books ever will!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I feel that everyone, especially High School students, should read Hiroshima. Although it is not the most exciting book, it portrays many important themes. It also teaches significant lessons. John Hersey avoids preaching readers; instead he keeps a journalistic point of view, and tells it like it is. He unfolds the lives of the victims before and after the explosion. Furthermore, he gets personal with the readers. Personally, it wasn't one of my favorites, but it did make me think. The book made me develop a greater appreciation of life. As a result, through his teachings, Hersey attempts to reveal vital messages which in turn may help prevent another event like this from occurring again."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Although I found Hersey's novel to be somewhat touching, I am not fond of his writing style. His detached, journalistic view creates an emotionless mood. Perhaps this style was effective with some readers, but it didn't go over with me. Maybe I have a preference for flowery writing, but I found that Hersey's gruesome details of peeling skin and oozing puss made me sick rather than sympathetic. When the author shows no emotion towards a situation, it is difficult for the reader to do so. Instead of focusing on the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the survivors, his story centers on the technical aspects of their survival. The reader feels sympathy toward the survivors because of their situations, NOT Hersey's portrayal of them."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"While achieving acclaim for his novel Hiroshima, I feel that John Hersey's work is overrated and does not meet the publicity it has received. I admit that, yes, he did an incredibly accurate job in describing the survivors and their ordeals. His non-preaching point of view proved critical to the universal feeling which emanates form this novel. It is said to have reached individuals across the globe with famous persons like Albert Einstein ordering one thousand copies. I do not dispute this, but I feel that in his effort to be non-biased, he loses many readers to a lack of interest. This novel is presented in a manner that quickly becomes mundane and boring. Certain ideas and events show up over and over again in slightly differing circumstances. Also, the story, while pristine in preciseness, is extremely confusing. Two of the six main characters share the same last name and as the novel progresses, an additional two hibakusha change their names. I felt bewildered while reading. I found myself having to go back and re-read passages, sometimes pages. This novel just could NOT keep my attention. Hiroshima has the potential to be a truly touching book. Hersey's viewpoint is perfect, the possibility for greatness is there. Unfortunately though, with long and overdone descriptions and confusing details, I don't feel it was a literary success in any light."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is an extremely moving story that paints a very realistic picture of tragedy. Hersey does an excellent job of telling the survivors' stories in an honest, non-blaming way. Although the plot became monotonous at times, Hiroshima makes the reader think deeply and experience a sense of compassion for humankind. It is important that people from both sides of World War II's battle lines listen to the ideas and themes Hersey presents. In addition, students and adults alike can learn about the mass devastation from Hersey's honest writing style."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I thought Hiroshima was a very good book. John Hersey provided a very personal account of the atomic bomb, through the real-life experiences of six people. I learned a lot about war and the dramatic effects it has on the lives of people. Hiroshima also showed me how war can bring people together, and how the bomb, although devastating, became a common bond to all in Hiroshima, Japan. I do however feel that this book was rather one-sided. It didn't say anything about that was happening to the Americans, so it made me feel like the United States was completely wrong in dropping the bomb. All in all, I feel this is an excellent book that can teach some very valuable lessons."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is a powerful must-read. This book tells the compelling stories of six Japanese individuals that survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. The portrayal of the survivors arouses compassion and sympathy in the readers. Told from a realistic viewpoint, Hersey tells it like it was, without choosing sides or casting blame. This point of view is very effective because Hersey's own feelings and thoughts are invisible throughout the novel. Thus, the reader is able to form his or her own opinions without being influenced. Hiroshima is definitely a worthy read, proving both informative and passionate."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book Hiroshima by John Hersey, gives the reader a true feeling of what war does to those which experienced within the war. By reading Hiroshima, I came away with a sense of reality to the war itself. Hiroshima allowed me to realize the drastic effects of war on all people. It was also intiruing due to its showing of the pesonal accounts of the six survivors. Although, I felt Hiroshima made the reader feel soory for the Japanese when in fact, the Japanese began the bombing in the firs place. Overall, I felt Hiroshima was a very well-developed book which made the reader understand more of the effects war brought upon people."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"There will always be those who will consider this piece of work of as anti-American propoganda, just look at two of the customer reviews. This book is not about excusing the atrocities of the Japenese (The Rape of Nanking, treatment of POWs), some say it would but they forget that two wrongs do not make a right, and might does not make right. This is a book about human expieriences about how a horrible weapon made a hell on earth, the consequences years later and how the Japenese and American goverment made it no less easy for the survivors. (The only quible that I have with this book is that it doesn't mention that Japan was suing for peace before the the Bomb was dropped.) I wish I could say that this book will change the way everyone looks at war, but there will obviously be those who justify revenge tactics."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"We are used to hearing about the numbers that died, and suffered. But what Hersey does with this book is he shows the people embedded in the statistics of war. When we wadge a war against another people we want them to be mean, vicious, and only conqurable by extreme measures.However this book dispells the propaganda and the politics. It moves you passed the biased depictions in American history books. It shows that we did not bomb the Japanese government that actually order the bomb dropped on Pearl Harbor. We bomb women preparing their children for school, and men reading the morning newspaper. I guess for some readers these victims seemed too human, too much like themselves and their families that they didn't like the feeling of empathy this book inspires for &quot;the enemy.&quot;Hersey also shows that there may be other great atrocities against mankind with greater fatalities. However the repercussions of this event made countless succeeding generations suff! er like no other before its time.There is a scene in the book where a man reaches to help a person trapped. He reaches his hand for the person and the man's skin comes off, as though it were clay. In another scene the author descibes the misery some of the survivors had to suffer when their cells literally began to self-destruct releasing toxins and breaking down organs.These scenes show the graphic and true misery that spell the word war. If anything it should not put Americans on the defensive, it ahould inspire us to learn from our egregious mistakes and help to find a better way to resolve our international conflicts. Although we like to think of ourselves as being one nation under God, God was not on our side that day."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is an interesting history book. It takes place when United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It gives a real life story of what happened to the civilians living, and dying in Hiroshima, and tells of their point of view of the war. This is an excellent book for everyone to read. It takes you back to when one step, one movement, one thought, meant life or death to those who lived through the atomic bomb at Hiroshima."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I thought this book was great. It tells about a bombing of a civilian city in Japan, called Hiroshima. When the atom bomb lands, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, and thousands of others go through pain and suffering, and many of those eventually die. The book tells about six individuals living in Japan, and each of them go through radiation sickness, depression, and the sight of watching others die around them. This book is a true story, and it lets the world know about the true devestating consequences of bombing. Although this book may seem too depressing, it is important to read about others who suffer, and it may make someone think twice before using an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book Hiroshima was not what it seemed to be to me. I thought it would have a lot more depth to it and the six people that John Hersey interviewed were usually just being normal and didn't really show real deep emotion toward the tragedy that has happened in this book. The people in the book were interesting to read about but they were just too plain. If there was a country's president or someone really important, not to say that they weren't important because that is a great gift to be saved from dying in an explosion that had an impact on the whole world. If you choose to read this book, try to look at it as if you were one of those people so then you can get into the book a lot more than what I did. I did do that in the first and fifth chapters so I understood it much more than what I did in the chapters in between. I would like to recommend this book to those people that are into real climax stories and role-playing stories. I also recommend this book to those of you that choose a tragedy over a comedy or suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I thought that John Hersey's Hiroshima could have packed a huge impact, but the power wouldn't be felt immediately. It wasn't until the second time I read through the book that I got any type of emotion out of it. Although the purpose of the book was to inform readers of the effects of nuclear warfare, I experienced more of the suffering aspect. Granted, this was the first account I've seen of how devastating the bomb was to individuals, but the effect I think it was supposed to have (one of utter disgust for our country's ability to do this to other people) completely missed me. I didn't have a heart-felt reaction to the book. I didn't actually feel sad for the people involved. I didn't hate America for their actions. On the other hand, I didn't hate the book. I just didn't think it had any real purpose. Yes, it did give an accurate account of the lives of the hibakusha, but it failed to show why it was doing so. I think if Hersey would have explained the inner importance of the emotions of those people, I would have gotten more out the book. It wasn't a bad read, but the lack of purpose brings this one down. I'd give it 2 stars, but in this case I'll give it 3."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hersey, describes the bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima. It takes the reader into the lives of several people who survived this tragedy. The suffering of the people of Hiroshima is described in great detail. It is a good description of the horrors of nuclear warfare and accurately describes the effects of the bombing. However, this novel is not a history of the first use of a nuclear weapon. It neither explains the reasons behind the American's use of the atomic bomb nor does it describe the terrible actions of the Japanese during World War II. It does not put the events into any historical context and it spends no time explaining what would have happened of the atomic bomb was not used. John Hersey never claimed that his novel was an unbiased history, but he could have described the events leading up to the bombing. Before reading the novel one should have at least a rudimentary understanding of the overall actions of both the Japanese and Americans in World War II. Hiroshima is well written and easy to read, but it is not as great as it is often made out to be. I recommend this novel to everyone, but I also urge anyone interested in the reasoning behind the bombing to read other novels that give a more accurate view of Japan during World War II."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hershey's Hiroshima describes the tragic aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945. This novel portrays the effect it had on the civilioan population-causing the reader to feel sorry for them. The novel does not describe why the bombing was necessary nor does it describe any of the equally, if not more, terrible actions commited by the Japanese durring World War II. It is a good description of the effects of nuclear weopons but it only describes the effects of them. The book is not a history of World War II and does not describe the conflict at all. It should not be taken to be more than it is. However, it still is a good read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"On August sixth, 1945, an atom bomb dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, killed 100,000 Japanese people, and left a dent in the lives of many, but six especially. When Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and the Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto heard the blast, their lives changed forever. John Hersey did not know what kind of impact his best seller Hiroshima would be. An impact so hard, that if left a mark in many book readers as big as the bomb to Hirsoshima. I felt the deep meaning of this book, after all, many people died. The country of Japan was like a child sitting on a stoop, and the United States bomb like an eighteen wheeler coming straight at the child going 150 M.P.H. The bomb was a symbol of how powerful one thing can be, it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. The bomb is almost like the ultimate sense because it sees peoples faces when it is ready to attack, it smells the fear in the air, it touches us, but it burns like nitro does when thrown through the air. This book reminded me of George Orwell's 1984, Big Brother and the U.S.A. are the godlike enemies, and Winston Smith and Hiroshima, like Toto from the Wizard of Oz, just sitting in a basket. In conclusion, I come back to one quote of the book, when one Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura's children cried, \\"Itai! It hurts!\\", and then Mrs. Nakamura said, \\"There's no time now to say it hurts or not.\\" This showed me that, even though a bomb had dropped, she hadn't lost her sanity, and she had every intention of surviving. This book will be on my shelf for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Upon being assigned to read this book for my 10th greade english class, I wasn't thrilled. The first book I read from my list of required reading was &quot;Brave New word&quot; by Aldous Huxley. I was amazed by the greatness of this book and I now list it as one of my favorites, all of which are behind my all-time favorite &quot;God Bless You Mr. Rosewater&quot; by Kurt Vonegut. So naturally I was set up for dissapointment the minute I opened this book. Despite this I was impressed by the vivid and caring descriptions of John Hersey, though I do regret the fact that he fails to mention that the attack on Pearl harbor came during peace time and therefore was probably the most vicious. I'm not so sure that the atomic bomb needed to be dropped, but I would be awfully upset if I were sitting here typing this under Communist rule. Truthfully the bomb upsets me most for its harm to the environment. The overall sentiments in this book were how the Japanese are people just like us and how the effects of the bomb were awful. Good sentiments but ones I already knew none-the-less. If you think the Japanes are monsters and think we should drop another bomb on them tomorrow for good measure you'd better read his book. If not, its really not worth the time or trouble. It is because it was well written that I gave it 3 stars. I would not describe it as even handed by any means, though. The bottom line is that the message in the book has been used before, will be used again and most likely will be done in better ways."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hersey, is about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened to six people before and after the explosion. Their names are Miss. Toshiko Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki and the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto. Hiroshima is a very graphic book with sickening descriptions. I think that some of these descriptions were as graphic as the ones in The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston. \\"Pus oozed out of her wound, and soon the whole pillow was covered with it.\\"(Pg.81) is just one of the many gory descriptions from Hiroshima.I thought that Hiroshima had its ups and downs. For one, the book was very confusing because there were lots of people and the story kept switching from on person to another. I found myself lost in a a sea of words at times because of this. That was the main bad facet of the book. On the other hand, I thought the book was good because when you did understand what was happening, you felt as if you were actually there because the descriptions in Hiroshima were so vivid. Also, I like the book because it showed you what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and what could happen if a nuclear war broke out. Overall, I though Hiroshima was a good book. I would recommend this book to people who like History and especially WW2."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I really liked this book. It is small and a very quick read but completely worth it. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"My daughter is reading it for a 9th grade class. I skimmed through looking for the telltale signs of Modern Liberal indoctrination. Unlike her Human Geography book, which is loaded with Socialist thinking, this book is genuine in following several characters as they dealt with their lives after the destruction.As some other readers pointed out (I didn't read every review), Hersey doesn't dwell on the moral issues. It's a genuine look at the characters. It's written in a rather dry style that lets the characters stories speak for themselves and allows the reader to form his or her own conclusions.(Now, if this book was written today or maybe by someone else, I wouldn't be surprised if the book was more of anti-war/anti-human tome that is typical of today's Modern Liberals. I'm talking about the now-normal attacks on Western Civilization, American exceptionalism, Conservatism, Bush, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to say Halliburton was involved in the building of the bomb or that one of Cheney's uncles was key. If you want to learn about Modern Liberals, watch the video at YouTube called \\"How Modern Liberals Think\\" by Evan Sayet. As Amazon pulls urls off these reviews, just go to YouTube and search on \\"Evan Sayet\\" and pick the \\"How Modern Liberals Think\\" video.)Anyways, if you want a book on the human aspects of some of the people bombed, then you may enjoy this book. Just remember, the alternative to bombing was many more deaths."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"In my opinion,Hiroshima was not really a good book becoz mainly the setting out of the book was too confusing for the reader.I know the writer trying to create an atmoshpere of what's happening but i find it too difficult to remember what had happen to the last character i've read.Also it was pretty much predictable and i find it hard to understand some of the words the writer use."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This story retraces the steps of six of the survivors of the blast from the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Japan on August 6, 1945, which claimed over one hundred thousand lives. The details described by the six were similar in many regards: the frequency of the sirens signaling U.S. air raids in the days preceding the bombs; the silence accompanying the flash of white light when the bomb hit; the people lying broken and dying in the parks and streets of the city; the fires blazing in every neighborhood.The horror that accompanied the attack and its aftermath is recounted vividly. The hospitals couldn't initially handle the throngs of wounded that flocked there, and only the absolute sickest could be treated with any urgency. People literally melted in the streets. Survivors contracted radiation sickness from the bomb's fallout that lasted for years, oftentimes leading to cancers. Prejudice predominated against survivors of the blast (who were called \\"hibakusha,\\" or \\"explosion-affected persons\\", and whose average life expectancy was 62), who found themselves without government aid and as objects of discrimination by employers.I learned a lot about an event that is described quickly in most history textbooks, in addition to the above-mentioned details. For instance, the book describes a surprising indifference within Japan to the ethics of dropping this weapon of mass destruction. However, the overall tone of the book shares that indifference. Things were described clinically, which tended to belie their magnitude, and the third person omniscient narration didn't convey the panic which the survivors must have felt. The character development was pretty lousy, too, and I would have traded the six shoddily-developed characters for a single well-developed one.As an important aside, it is hard to avoid drawing parallels between the WWII climate and the current post-September 11th war we are currently engaged in. Despite being horrified to read about the details of the atomic bomb fallout, I strongly feel that use of these weapons of mass destruction may be warranted against nations such as Iran and Iraq. I realize this is serious language, but the magnitude of Hiroshima as a deterrent cannot be underestimated in terms of the protection it offered Americans (including the soldiers that did not have to risk their lives in battle). For someone who believes in protecting us the citizens of this nation at any costs, it is a very realistic option that shouldn't be taken lightly, but should not be ignored or followed by the word \\"never.\\""},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I recently read this book for my 10th grade English class and was devastated as an American the amount which this book shows the American government and people as the bad guys in a war they started. The book failed to point out that American and Japan were at war with each other. In an act of, yes, great human loss at the time, in turn ended the worst war in human history. I believe that the book does do a good job of illustrating the horrors of nuclear warfare, but that is it. It fails to state reasons why we had to do it. The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is one of the defining points in history, and most controversial. If people who actually try to understand the reasons why it was necessary to end the war. I am pround as an American that we had a leader (Harry S. Truman) who had the guts to drop the bomb and end the worst war EVER. Just for any one who cares our fire bombing raids with the B-29 bombers killed many more people than the atomic bombs did, yet no one has made arrguments about why we shouldn't of fire bombed all those cities. Think about it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"As Japanese troops surrounded the city of Nanjing, hundreds of bombers flew overhead, dropping thousands of pounds of cases filled with anthrax, thyphus, or the bubonic plague. Invading soldiers took turns raping women, children, and the elderly. Nearly 200,000 of the city's two milldion residents died a few days after Japanese occupation. Many more were to follow. More than 20 (maybe even 30) million died in China and Japan from Japanese atrocities committed during World War II. In Japan, history books portray all sides as victims of an unfortunate &quot;incident&quot;. Indeed, Japan is cast as the victim nation, falling to the militarisim of the Americans. Japan's conservative government has only recently allowed for honest discussion of Japanese atrocities committed during WWII in school history books. Largely ignored in the West, and overshadowed by Hitler's extermination of Jews, slavs, etc, the forgotten holocaust is completely ignored in high school text books.! Many times, there are sections devoted to the dropping of the nuclear bombs on Horishima and Nagasaki. Less than 200,000 Japanese lives were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. An invasion of the Japanese home islands was estimated to cost at least 1,000,000 American lives and even more Japanese lives. And, Japanese forces were still strong in Manchuria and Korea, where they were systamatically destroying all evidence, including victims, of their holocaust. Speed was vital in ending the war. However, Japanese zealousy (as experienced by American troops in Okinawa and other islands, wasn't going to let that happen anytime soon. Indeed, the Japanese government was warned quite a few times before the attack. It seems to me that the Japanese government, and its supporters (many of them civilians) are to blame for tens of millions of deaths, including those in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This review may annoy people who feel strongly about the book or the incident, but Hiroshima really is the driest read imaginable. I had to teach it to an extension English class and when the time came to discussing the text, all 24 students owned up to not reading it because it bored them senseless. I couldn't feel angry about that because I too found it so dull that I struggled to get through it. I ended up supplementing it with other non-fiction texts. Three successive classes have all proclaimed it the most \\"boring\\" book they have ever been asked to read for English. This review is more for teachers pondering using it as a study text. Don't! Your students will thank you for it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Although this subject has been touched upon multiple times, John Hersey manages to cover what we AREN'T told. The book has some strong moments, which are a little too vivid at times.

Only one aspect makes this book unique: the point of view. Focusing on a third person point of view, the author tells the many survivors' stories from a bystander-like perspective. Other than that, it's the same as everything else, but that I truly enjoyed.Overall, the book is alright; hell, who am I kidding? The book is horrible. It starts out fairly dull, but then becomes moderately exciting as you read into it. Towards the last quarter of the book, it sucks to put it kindly. It's like somebody is slowly driving a railroad spike through my cranium from 11:15 A.M. - 12:40 A.M. every other day, as I watch the seconds hand on the clock slowly creep past the six, hoping that it will reach the seven, then the eight, and maybe if I am lucky, the nine. When in fact, the clock finally reaches 12:40 and I hear the bell ring for my next class, it's like the angels of heaven are peeing liquid gold into my ears. So, do yourself a favor (a big favor), and don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is meant to make Americans feel guilty. They should not.

It is written as the surviors of the destruction of Hiroshima excatly remember it. This book tells of the horrors these people had to endure.

It contains the stories of several survivors of the nuclear bombardment of Hiroshima, from what they were setting out to do that fateful morning until how their lives turned out decades latter.The first portion of the book, dealing with the survivors' stories of the bombing and its immediate aftermath, was the stronger of the two. It was as haunting, mesmorizing, and terrifying read as I have ever had, yet weighed in at only about a little over hundred pages. The latter portion of the book, which Hersey added years later to show how his subjects' lives had turned out, was somewhat disappointing.Overall, this is still an excellent book, whose haunting images will remain with you for the rest of your life. Well worth a few bucks and a couple of hours."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's classic account of six bomb survivors begins with what they were doing when the bomb went off, and continues through the minutes, days, weeks, and months after the first A-bomb use.

Middle School and up."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I read this book in high school. Yea sure, I got a B+ on the report, and forgot about it. Now, 30-blank years later I read it again, to see what I missed. WOW!I am not a big fan of nuclear warfare, been to the 50's, know &quot;duck-and-cover&quot;, and I wish it would all go away. So, I thought that politics would be involved in this book, somehow. Well, let me tell you, the stories in this book, all 6 of them, are remarkable and without equal. When you think you've read or heard it all, there's more. The pure harsh cruelity of man against man is hard to imagine, be it from strangers, friends, family, authority, wherever it comes from. The carelessness of suffering, friends &amp; family, and the casual attitude of the situation is stunning, absolutely stunning. Never can the high school student in me actually understand this book.The Japanse culture is wonderfully represented in the suffering they bore after the bomb. I received a great lesson in the people of Japan and the way they look at life and death. Having missed the war, I can't feel the hate for them that some may, but to have lived through what they did, I feel now only sadness and sympathy. God must have a special place for all these survivors.This book is an emotional ride that I was surprised by. 2 nights, and it was over, but what a 2 nights. Mr. Hersey will bore into your guts and give your real emotion. You will be appalled by the pain, calousness, matter-of-factness, media hype, and even greed. I was stunned by the last of these. The book takes no position of right or wrong, just relates the story in a cold fashion that gets your attention. No drama, no excitement, just the story, the facts.Prepare yourself, then read this book. The emotional roller coster awaits. Thank you Mr. Hersey."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a very informitive book about a very serious event, the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. This informitave book on the lives of six people who survived the bombing dipicts what they were doing right before the bomb went off, how they protected themselves, and how they felt. In the continuation to this book John Hersey writes a fifth chapter as a sort of check up to see what the people in this book have been doing since their last interview. This book not only deserves great reviews it also deserves five stars. If you would like to read an interesting, informative book about the bombing of Hiroshima this is your book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Our world is in the midst of an aggressive nuclear arms race. The US as well as Russia, UK, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have active, flourishing nuclear arms programs. Iran is scurrying to catch up. Countries who are enjoying economic windfalls like Venezuela plan to use the money to get in to the military, probably nuclear, arms race. Finally, terrorists are scrambling to acquire nuclear arms for their own \\"jihads\\".In \\"Hiroshima\\", Hersey documents, not only the horrifying immediate effects of \\"The Bomb\\", but also the life-long tragedies that it's victims endured. The documentation of the life-long effect experienced after the blast, provides a most terrible and important perspective.There are excerpts in the book that try to put a positive political spin on the events that occurred after the blast, however that political spin does not balance against the awesome pain and destruction Hersey's eye-witness account describes.Anyone who is human should read \\"Hiroshima\\" to understand the horrible danger our governments and fanatics are placing at our doorstep. Everyone who is in a position of power in deciding how to use these tools of destruction should read this book as a reminder of the human chaos they would cause.Hopefully Hersey's words will remind all of the horrible consequences of the nuclear arms madness."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"An extremely vivid picture of atomic energy.

The book describes not only the people's actions, but also their emotions. If i did not read this book, i would still see the A-bombing on Hiroshima as just a terrible thing that happened and would still only see through the pictures in our history textbook.Everyone should read this book whether they are interested in the A-bomb or not, because this book will open your eyes to the power of human beings to kill and destroy everything around us. Hiroshima is one of the most influential book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"When the A-bomb hit Hiroshima at 8:15 AM on August 6, 1945, Hatsuyo Nakamura was observing a neighbor through her kitchen window as he patiently tore down his home for the sake of the city. In a flash of light and a matter of moments, Nakamura and her three children were scattered across the home and buried in piles of rubble that had, just moments before, been their home. In the aftermath of the bombing, Nakamura, a tailor's widow, and her children were left alive, albeit destitute, and were forced to rebuild their lives from scratch like so many others across the city. Nakamura's response? The bombing had been her fate, which, according to Japanese tradition, must be accepted. In the aftermath of the bombing, it was reported that 78,150 people had been killed, 13,983 were missing, and 37,425 had been injured. Nakamura was one of the lucky ones. She was a survivor. Or, as the Japanese people preferred to state it, Nakamura was \\"an explosion-affected person.\\" In Hiroshima, John Hersey tells Nakamura's story as well as the stories of five other individuals who were fated to experience the bombing. Hersey begins with a description of the humid August morning through the eyes of each \\"explosion affected person\\" that he interviewed and continues to follow his characters lives in the years after the explosion. The most recent version of Hiroshima includes an extra chapter, written 40 years after the event, that reveals the fates of Toshinki Sasaki, Masakazu Fujii, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Terufumi Sasaki, Kiyoshi Tanimoto and, of course, Hatsuyo Nakamura. All six of the characters in Hiroshima lived very different lives, both before and after the bomb, yet all were bound through the horrors they experienced and their inexorable drive to live and overcome. For some, the motivation to live was personal. Nakamura lived only to support her children. Father Kleinsorge, a German priest, was compelled to work beyond his injuries in an attempt to rescue his fellow priests and friends. For others, motivation stemmed from a desire to serve the mass population. Dr. Terufumi Sasaki was the only doctor in his hospital to survive the explosion completely unharmed. As the dust settled over Hiroshima, he quickly became aware of his good fortune and managed to provide medical care for thousands of injured victims using only the scattered array of supplies before him and a pair of glasses borrowed from an injured nurse. For days, Sasaki worked with little rest to save the lives of those who had been more unfortunate than he had. Years later his medical practice flourished but, despite his success and his contributions to humanity, he died regretting that he had been unable to do more. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, also helped hundreds as he worked tirelessly to transport wounded and bring supplies to and from Asano Park. For most, though, the motivation to live was simply human instinct. Dr. Masakazu Fujii was injured so greatly that he was unable to attend to patients in the direct aftermath but later went on to fight for peace and raise funds for a variety of endeavors in the name of the Hiroshima victims. Toshinki Sasaki remained pinned under a pile of books for hours before being dragged out and left in a makeshift shed for days. She suffered for months from the pain of a badly mangled and broken leg that was never properly set. Later in life, she became a nun worked through her physical and emotional scars guided only by the light of faith. The six individuals whose lives were documented in Hiroshima overcame unfavorable odds and went on to live successful, happy lives. Hersey delicately weaves the details from the life of each character into a bittersweet account of the Hiroshima bombing. Hiroshima is unusual and wonderful because although it is a non-fiction piece, the emotion of the event is not lost in an overwhelming amalgamation of facts. Hersey's descriptive account of the tragedy overflows with agony and pain but leaves the reader with a greater understanding of human capabilities and the knowledge that the drive to survive cannot be bounded by language or by nationality."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima was published in 1946 - a year after the bomb was dropped - in New Yorker magazine. Uniquely in its history, the magazine devoted its entire issue to Hersey's 30,000 word essay. Only later was it turned into a book; the final chapter on the subsequent lives of the six subjects wasn't written until 1985.Hersey set out to put a human face on the consquences of the atomic bomb. All earlier news accounts, articles and stories had been focused on the statistics, the science, and the effort that led to the nuclear weapon. Understood in that context, understanding what Hersey was trying to do and say, the book is even more remarkable.It is not a novel; a novel is a work of fiction. It is an essay, a work of reportage. This story is true. The book is all the more remarkable because Hersey was born and raised in China, the son of missionaries, and had no reason to be sympathetic to or about the Japanese. A war correspondent for Time, he earned a commendation from the U.S. Army at Guadacanal. He cannot fairly be accused of anything but supreme objectivity. By telling the true stories of six survivors in an absolutely straightforward way, without judging the decision to use the bomb, he put an intensely human face on the consequences.He was criticized at the time and is criticized today for taking the events that day out of context. The bomb is supposed to have saved a million American casualties (a highly suspect figure today). It was supposed to have shortened the war by a year or more. Those critics are themselves missing the true context. At the time, the historical events leading to Truman's decision were well known (although recast in February 1947 by Stinson). Hersey's goal was to make the story real in a new way. Those facts are well and good, Hersey is saying, but there were bad consequences as well. In the process, he created a remarkable book.I was glad to see New York University recently named Hersey's Hiroshima as the best single work of reporting in the 20th century. As events unfold in the escalating nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent, everyone needs to understand the human consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. By helping keep Hersey's work before us, perhaps we can avoid another Hiroshima or Nagasaki."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"When the atomic bomb dropped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima was a thriving city of two hundred forty-five thousand people. By 8:20, one hundred thousand of those people were dead. Combining the broad perspective of the absolute devastation of the city with the tiniest details of six individual lives, John Hersey provides a powerful closeup of a few survivors of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, giving the carnage a human perspective.Focusing on Mr. Tanimoto, a Methodist pastor; Mrs. Nakamura, the widow of a tailor, and her three children; Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician in a private clinic; Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, S. J, a priest in a Catholic mission; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital; and Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in a tin works, as they survive the initial attack, the author follows their daily movements, their subsequent illnesses, their fears, and the eventual outcomes of their lives. The victims become human, and their concerns become universal, as Hersey shows them digging themselves out and helping their neighbors, filled with an \\"elated community spirit\\" in the days and weeks after the bombing.Details of the fires following the bombing, the unexpected radiation sickness, the mysteries surrounding the kind of bomb this was (some Japanese believed that the allies had sprinkled powdered magnesium over the city and then ignited it), the devastating rains that followed, and the monumental scale of the damage are presented in straightforward, factual style, the horrors of the reality so overwhelming that Hersey had no need to try to control his narrative by selecting details or ordering them for effect.Published in the New Yorker in August, 1946, this anniversary remembrance had immediate and dramatic repercussions, perhaps because the focus on \\"ordinary\\" Japanese citizens, much like the Americans who read the article, as opposed to \\"the enemy,\\" resonated with his readers. Thousands listened to four days of its reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account. By raising also the question of the ethics of dropping such a bomb (which some of the Japanese agree was acceptable as a normal part of the war), he also forces his readers to consider the long-term implications of atomic warfare. Dramatic, powerful, and very personal, this account of six lives, changed forever, is a monument to the human spirit in the face of incredible adversity. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"On August 6th, 1945, a bomb with the explosive force of 12,500 tons of dynamite was shot into the heart of the Japanese metropolis of Hiroshima. Not only did the initial blast virtually topple the city, maiming and killing tens of thousands, but the radiation unleashed by the atomic bomb inflicted countless more with radiation poisoning that caused chronic sickness and even more gruesome deaths. Less than a year after the attack, journalist, John Hersey, interviewed six survivors for a special edition of the New Yorker. The issue sparked a sensation, selling out within hours and gathering extensive acclaim from Hersey's peers. The article was sent to members of the Book-of-the-Month club as a selection and was read aloud on special radio broadcasts all across the world.Reading the paperback edition of Mr. Hersey's extensive article, I had little difficulty seeing why it gathered such acclaim. He does not just take readers to the scene of the bombing; he takes them behind the eyes of those affected. Mr. Hersey temporarily disregarded the sociopolitical and moral debate concerning the atomic attack and told a straightforward, compelling and vivid story of human beings coming face to face with mammoth, almost surreal, tragedy. This new addition, featuring an additional chapter that reveals the fates of the six survivors forty years later and describes the social stigma, medical difficulties and psychological and philosophical adjustments involved in being a \\"hibakusha\\" or \\"explosion-effected person\\" only makes this journalistic triumph even better. I highly recommend Hiroshima to anyone interested in atomic warfare, World War II, Japanese culture or those who simply wish to read about the human experience at its most grave and epic."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima isn't meant to be great entertainment. The point of journalist John Hersey's account of six survivors of the Hiroshima bombing (Miss Sasaki, Rev. Tanimoto, Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki, Dr. Fuji, and Mrs. Nakamura) is meant to be an unbiased view of the actual horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that killed over 100,000 residents of that city.John Hersey carries the book right along, never holding up for a minute. All the details of the accounts of the six survivors are written in great deal, and create a series of emotions unsurpassed by many works of both fiction and non-fiction on the subject.For all of you readers who found it boring, I guess you didn't understand what you were getting into. This book must be read with the knowledge that it is a journalist's account of the bombing of Hiroshima, not a straight-forward work of non-fiction.P.S. In all the new publications of the book, a detailed account of the lives of the six survivors the years following the Hiroshima bombing is included as a kind of epilogue written still by John Hersey."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"As it stands today, John Hersey's \\"Hiroshima\\" is a two-layered book. Written in 1946, the first four chapters, comprising 90 pages, describe the experiences of six inhabitants of Hiroshima, from the morning of August 6, 1945 when the bomb was dropped, through the following year. Added in 1985, chapter 5 adds a further 60 pages that enable the reader to trace the long-term consequences of the bomb on the lives of these six people, as well as Japan and the world in general.The witnesses chosen by Hersey, \\"who were among the luckiest in Hiroshima\\" (p87), insofar as they were not instantly vaporized, burned to a cinder or flayed alive, are wonderfully diverse. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was a Methodist minister; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a war widow and mother of three; Miss Toshiko Sazaki, a clerk about 20 years old; and Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a 38-year-old German Jesuit.The last two, Mazakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki, were both doctors, a profession much in demand in the aftermath of the bombing, as only 65 of the 150 doctors in the city had survived, and most of them were so severely wounded that they could not be of any assistance to anyone. As for the 1,780 nurses, 1,654 were either dead or incapacitated, resulting in massive overwork for the small and virtually helpless remaining staff.\\"Hiroshima\\" is of value mostly as a testimony, adding six more life stories to the existing literature, and enabling the reader to form a more complete picture of the aftereffects of the blast. Unlike \\"Children of the A-Bomb\\" though, a volume which I recently reviewed, it gains strength from its interweaving of the individual stories, as people meet and lose sight of each other, giving the book a unity and a dramatic construction that is reminiscent of the familiar disaster-movie pattern.Quite unobtrusively, the author also manages to give us the big picture, through the sparse, judicious use of statistics and other general information. The book thus answered some of the questions I had left after my previous readings on the subject, such as the role of charitable institutions after the bombing, Dr. Sasaki illustrating the work of the Red Cross for instance.I also wondered whether the Japanese had suffered the same fate as some German civilians in the firestorms of WWII (as described by Jorg Friedrich in \\"The Fire : The Bombing of Germany 1940-1945\\"): getting stuck and burned alive in boiling asphalt. Hersey partially answered this question by mentioning that in the afternoon of August 6, \\"the asphalt of the streets was still so soft and hot from the fires that walking was uncomfortable.\\" So some of the horrors endured by the Germans must have been repeated there too.This book may well be the best introduction on the market to Hiroshima as seen by the victims. It can be helpfully complemented by the aforementioned \\"Children of the A-Bomb: Testament of the Boys and Girls of Hiroshima\\" edited by Dr. Arata Osada; Keiji Nakazawa's 10-volume manga \\"Barefoot Gen\\" (a rather ugly but powerful series, which is much superior to the two movie adaptations); Paul Wilmshurst's 2005 BBC documentary on the subject; and Koreyoshi Kurahara and Roger Spottiswoode's brilliant \\"Hiroshima\\" (1995), which seamlessly blends stock films and reconstructions in a dispassionate narrative of the events leading up to the dropping of the bomb."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is an excellent overview of a handful of people who experienced the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima, Japan and the rescue efforts by some courages individuals immediately afterwards.Given the recent concerns of the U.S. and many nations with Iran potentially becoming able to produce a nuclear weapon and the continued issues with North Korea's program, and the overarching concerns related to the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, this book shows the real horrors of what an atomic explosion causes, both immediately - death and destruction - as well in the immediate and mediate aftermath - the terrible suffering of the survivors(including, severe burns, radiation poisoning, cancer and particularly leukemia, etc.). Particularly compelling was the story of how most of the population that survived the immediate blast effects, desperately sought out water, and how some priests stationed there from the west tried to help survivors.This is an excellent, well-researched, and brief overview of the effects of an atomic bomb explosion on a city."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The Saturday Review of Books claimed that anyone who is able to read should read this book. I wholeheartedly agree. The city of Hiroshima was destroyed by the first atomic bomb on April 6, 1945. This book begins on that day, detailing the terrible destruction and the hardships that fell on the citizens of the city.The book follows the lives of several survivors-a doctor, a housewife, and a German priest among others-as they struggle through the ruins of their homes and the lingering effects the radiation had on their lives for decades afterwards.Hiroshima is a testament to humanity and its will to survive, to move on, and try desperately to not repeat the tragedies of the past. Appropriately, Hiroshima points no fingers of blame, but instead shows the best humanity has to offer in the face of unspeakable horror."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book Hiroshima, by John Hersey, follows the lives of six survivors of the Atomic Bomb, dropped on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 AM. The book chronicles the lives of these six survivors up to forty years after the dropping of the bomb. On that day, more then 100,000 Japanese were killed, and these six were fortunate to live through it. The survivors had to continue their lives through their will to survive, overcoming all obstacles such as pain, poverty, disease, famine, and lack of humanity. The survivors of the bomb had to live the rest of their lives suffering with more then just their physical pain, but also with their social non-acceptance. People would not hire A-bomb victims, or Hibakusha (literally- explosion affected people) because Non-Hibakusha employers developed a prejudice against survivors, and their descendents. The employers were scared that victims would come down with a disease making them unreliable workers. This was the case for survivor Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura. Mrs. Nakamura, weak and poor, began a courageous struggle, which would last for many years, to keep herself and her children alive. She was forced to work many laborious jobs, such as delivering loaves of bread, selling fish, and cleaning houses for her neighbors, and still earned barely enough money to put food on the table. Because of her weakened condition due to radiation exposure, Mrs. Nakamura had to rest for two of three days for every week she worked. Help to her did not come until 1957, thirteen years after the bombing, when the Diet, the congress of Japan, passed the A-bomb Victims Medical Care law, which gave free medical care to survivors. Other survivors of the Atomic Bomb went through pain, both physically and socially, as a direct result of the explosion. Miss Toshinki Sasaki, at the time of the explosion, was at work talking to a co-worker. The force of the bomb knocked down bookcases, which landed on Miss Sasaki's left leg, crushing it instantly. When rescuers found her, they carried her into a field, under a tin roof, next to two dying people, whose skin was peeling off. Here she sat for two days without any food or water, with terrible pain. Three years before the explosion, Miss Sasaki was engaged to be married, by arrangements through her parents. The couple liked each other, and accepted the arrangements. The two started a life together, but her fianc&eacute; was drafted into the war. Upon his return, after the bombing, he did not come back to her. His family had had second thoughts on allowing their son to marry a Hibakusha and a cripple. Miss Sasaki eventually gave up hope on finding a husband, and decided to become a nun. Besides continuing difficulties with her leg, she endured liver dysfunction, night sweats and morning fevers, borderline angina, and blood spots. At a banquet celebrating her twenty-fifth anniversary of becoming a nun, Miss Sasaki made a speech. \\"...It is as if I had been given a spare life when I survived the A-bomb. But I prefer not to look back. I shall keep moving forward.\\" Miss Sasaki had a forgiving heart and decided to keep moving foreword with her life. She was going to have the bomb affect her life in the smallest way possible. The survivors in this novel are great examples on how life goes on, even after the human spirit has endured all types of hardships. Miss Toshinki Sasaki and Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura continued living their lives, making it as best as possible. They overcame pain, poverty, disease and famine also getting through a time of discrimination. This book is definitely worth reading because it shows the human beings willingness to live, even after experiencing ones worst time in life."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima was John Hersey's brain child about his feelings on World War 2. Even though this book is not the best source if you are interested in statistics and the United State's side of the story about the Atomic Bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, instead Hersey turns the tables and shows how the Japanese dealt with the disaster they were tossed. Hersey investigated and interviewed six people who lived through the bomb and retells there survival tales. Just like in many of his other books Hersey is able to show the problems he finds in the world, and lets people know about these problems through his work. His ability to turn around and show a situation from another point of view is the reason that Hiroshima is such a great work."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey has written a powerful novel of the Hiroshima bombing and its aftermath. To show the horror of nuclear holocaust through the eyes of the survivors is the best way to convey it. The 6 survivors documented in this book where extraordinary people who went on to do something with their lives instead of being bitter. The story that was the most inspiring was Dr.Fujii and how he helped others. Then after the war, he enjoyed life to the fullest and helped many foreigners as well. The sad thing was that even though they had nothing to do with what happened to them , the survivors were shunned even by their own people for being &quot;hibakusha&quot;. To know what that is, you have to read the book. So I encourage whoever sees this review to read the book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is an excellent book to display the events in a war the opposing side cannot grasp. All too often a society justifies heinous acts of war if they are summarized as &quot;bomb&quot; or &quot;conflict.&quot; Hersey puts faces to the generalizations and numbers, forcing a reader to understand that enemies are people with hearts, minds, and souls. The book wasn't a question of opinion, &quot;Should we have done it?&quot; Rather, it was a journalistically unbiased approach to telling the survivors' stories. The novel creates community among demographically diverse readers by unifying concepts of survival, humanity, and reconciliation. Hersey's essay simply was not the redundant, overused concept of, &quot;Don't let history repeat itself.&quot; The book was an epiphany; readers met survivors and were forced to be put in their shoes. Readers saw how the people of Hiroshima weren't revengeful, just desperately wanted the hate to end. The novel was not Anti-America or Pro-Japan, it broke all culture boundaries and lines of hate to form universal realizations. Yes, compassion and sypathy are inevitably felt, but the book did not press guilt upon a reader. I praise John Hersey and Hiroshima for letting the stories of six survivors be known - the entire truth of their pain and courage. Every day is sacred in its opportunities to change lives and have lasting effects on the future. Through reading Hiroshima, all readers are woken up to harsh realities and are inevitably changed."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima truly captures the horror of the historic event. This extremely accurate book should be read by everyone. John Hersey gives a vivid description of the lives of 6 people who lived through the traumatic experience of the bombing at Hiroshima. Through their stories, the reader can see how hard it was to deal with the pain and suffering that people had to go through. Hiroshima helps people to appriciate all races, colors, religions, etc. because it creates a sense of community. A hundred thousand people died due to the atomic bomb. This book helps to put faces and names to the statistics. It makes the reader realize that those who died were people with dreams and wishes for their futures and their families. Those innocent lives were cut short within minutes because of the bomb's disastrous effects."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"One of the most socially important books of the twentieth century, inspiring thousands to work to eliminate these truly evil weapons, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; by John Hersey is composed in clear prose which lets the horrific event and its aftermath stand for itself, with no commentary or moralizing. It may be cliche, but this short book should be read by every citizen of our nation (the only country which shamefully used the worst weapon of mass destruction ever devised--not once, but twice). Nowadays, in our 24-hour media-saturated milieu, we seem to filter the tragic through a peculiar detached distance. &quot;Expert&quot; commentary and gloss go simultaneous with the news events themselves; indeed the media feeding frenzy becomes the story half the time. In contrast, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; is powerful in its understated prose and its six unforgettable narratives."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"One of the most remarkable things about John Hersey's Hiroshima is when it was published, within a year after the bomb was dropped. It is easy to admit our faults, it is easy to show our mistakes--if faults and mistakes they were--many years after the fact. But to face the horrendous, factual reporting of the effect of the atom bomb on the citizens of Hiroshima so soon after the fact, is in itself remarkable, and a tribute to not only the New Yorker, which published Hersey's account, but to the strength and open mindedness of the American people in their willingness to assume responsibility for what we had done.It is the opinion of many people, myself included, that World War II was America's finest hour because we faced an enemy in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan that had to be defeated, and we defeated them. But it is also the opinion of many people that we did something so monstrous and so unnecessary by being the first (and still the only) people to use nuclear weapons against civilian populations, that it is hard to find justification, redemption or peace of mind. Could Hiroshima have been avoided?The second most remarkable thing about John Hersey's Hiroshima is the utter lack of editorializing, the complete absence of any sort of political statement, the sheer avoidance of the maudlin and any kind of deliberate jerking of tears in the text. Hersey lets the reportage speak for itself. The elegant flat tonal quality of his report serves all the better to let us see exactly the human consequences of Truman's monumental decision. The terse, evocative quality of the titles of the four parts of the book, \\"A Noiseless Flash,\\" \\"The Fire,\\" \\"Details Are Being Investigated,\\" and \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" tell in skeleton form the entire story, and suggest, ever so subtly, the appalling suffering and loss that the people of that Japanese city experienced.Hersey began with the moment--\\"The Noiseless Flash\\"--when the bomb dropped, and ended with the naturalistic aftermath as he described how in \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" the grasses grew back and green velvet covered much of the ground under the blast. This follows the ironic bureaucratic response suggested in \\"Details Are Being Investigated.\\"Yes, let's investigate the details, for all the good that will do. Let's also second guess Truman's decision, for all the good that will do.Fifty-five years have now passed. A long time. And still there remains the question: did we do the right thing?Social critic Paul Fussell wrote some years after Hersey's report an essay entitled, \\"Thank God for the Atom Bomb\\" in which he argued persuasively that the United States really had no choice, and indeed Truman's decision was the only one he could make. The main point being that to take the island of Japan with conventional forces would have cost the US a million casualties. It was strongly believed that the Japanese would fanatically defend their homeland, even with sticks and stones if necessary. A secondary argument concerned the position of the Soviet Union. During the time it would take to ensure surrender by conventional forces, the Soviet Union would probably become involved, and Japan might have become a divided country as is Korea today and as was Germany not too long ago. In the final analysis, this argument goes, at least hundreds of thousands of lives were saved and the Japanese themselves benefitted from being the vanquished of the US alone, allowing us to help them to a speedy recovery.There are other arguments about demonstrating the bomb on a coral island, and the counter argument that there were only two bombs, and that at any rate our resolve to use the bomb would not be proven by such a demonstration, etc.I used to teach Hersey's Hiroshima to high school students, and I would include Fussell's easy as a counterpoint. My feeling has always been that Truman did indeed do exactly what he had to do. Whether that was the right thing to do is another matter. Curious. I don't think Truman could have acted otherwise, but I am not so sure it was the right thing to do. Such is the nature of our ability to know and live the truth.Hersey's insistence on focusing on the everyday people of Hiroshima--on Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk at the East Asia Tin Works, who had just turned her head to talk to another girl, on the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who was two miles from the center of the explosion, delivering a cart of clothes to a home in the suburbs, and on four others--allowed him to universalize the Japanese experience so that everyone in the world might know that these people could be anybody.Perhaps this is the saving grace, that we know beyond any shadow of a doubt the incalculable human suffering that ensues from the use of nuclear weapons, and so perhaps we will never use them again, us or anyone else.If they had never been used, perhaps the temptation would have been too great, for us, for the Soviet Union, or some other nation, to use them in the hope of gaining some advantage. But seeing the unmitigated horror of their use, we are all forestalled.I say \\"all.\\" But would Osama Bin Laden, would Saddam Hussein, use such weapons?Hersey's Hiroshima is therefore not just an artifact of history, but a warning still relevant today as well as a most compelling reading experience."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's slim little volume here is an immensely powerful pathetic argument against the dropping of nuclear weapons in particular and against war in general. He deals with the aftermath of the lifetimes of several survivors of the dropping of the first nuclear weapon on an inhabited place. Many were killed instantly, others were crushed in the debris and rubble, and others weren't as lucky - dying a slow death from burns and radiation.This is an immensely humanizing work that I wish those in power would read or at least be aware of before they made devastating decisions. We in human race have been lucky enough that we haven't had to write a sequel to this book based on a different war and a different place on the same scale. Sadly, we write little ones every day."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a surprisingly simple piece of John that talks of six seemingly ordinary people who survived the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. It starts on the morning the bomb was dropped, when they were going about their normal lives, and ends several months later as they struggle to piece their destroyed lives and bodies back together.The lives of six of those survivors are retold in the days following the bombing. When the bomb hits, the first of the survivors Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura is watching her neighbor's house and overseeing her sleeping children; they all end up covered in debris when their house is destroyed. Miss Toshiko Sasaki, an office clerk, is leaning over to speak to a fellow worker when she is blasted out of her desk and trapped under heavy a bookcase; which later causes her to break her leg because she couldn't free herself out. In another case a medical doctor, Masakazu Fujii, is reading on his porch when he is thrown into a river and squeezed between two large timbers. Terufumi Sasaki, another doctor, falls to the floor in the corridor of the Red Cross Hospital and gazes in wonder at the scene outside the window. Which at the time everything is silent and covered in debris. Meanwhile Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge awakens in the vegetable garden of the Catholic mission house, injured and dazed. Finally the noble Kiyoshi Tanimoto throws himself between the wall and his desk back at his house. In the hours following the bombing, each survivor attempts to free himself or herself, find loved ones. Most of the six survivors are hurt, but they are all alive. During the evening of August 6, the survivors struggle to endure and help each other. The city is a ball of flame, and the park is filled with radiation rain and whirlwinds. The suffering of thousands of people and their wounds and burns are described repeatedly. With such strong words that when I read this story I felt that I was there experiencing Hiroshima myself.I really felt that this book captured not only my attention but Americas because it is a clear understood book that explains in simple word what happened August 6 1945 and with such vivid details. Well like the cover says \\"Anyone that knows how to read should read it.\\"By: Dhamar Herrera"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's slim little volume here is an immensely powerful pathetic argument against the dropping of nuclear weapons in particular and against war in general.

Codes of honor. You think of Greeks, and Samurai, and \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade;\\" of French and German soldiers who meet in No Man's Land to share Christmas treats then return to opposing trenches.But then here comes Nanking, Stalingrad, London, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. Total war, as the phrase goes. A reversion to tribal days, perhaps, when warring foes fell men, women, and children alike, to void vengeance. A weapon now to instill dread, to sap the will, to raise the costs of conflict.Hiroshima: August 6, 1945, 8:15 a.m. That's when John Hersey\`s story begins, with \\"a noiseless flash.\\" It begins not in the White House, nor in the Imperial Palace or the B-29 that dropped the bomb. But in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, where Toshiko has just turned to speak to a co-worker. In the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital, where Dr. Sasaki walks down the corridor, a blood specimen in hand. In the minds of six who survived, at a half dozen points across the city, at the instant the atomic bomb exploded.Here Hersey does not pontificate, excuse, blame, or rage. He reports. With meticulous detail, in short, clear, declarative sentences, with controlled understatement. To describe a human experience so beyond words and thought that it can be grasped only through the senses.So, through the eyes and ears of these six hibakusha, literally, \\"explosion-affected persons,\\" we see the scarred multitudes fleeing the fires, hear the shocked silence of the radiated dying, feel the flames, and smell the putrefying flesh. Working like a novelist, Hersey puts us there, scene upon scene, with dialogue and pertinent detail, to show the reality on a human scale. Not commenting, but showing:\\"The hurt ones were quiet; no one wept, much less screamed in pain; no one complained; none of the many who died did so noisily; not even the children cried; very few people even spoke.\\"And:\\"Mr. Tanimoto found about twenty men and women on the sandspit. He drove the boat onto the bank and urged them to get aboard. They did not move and he realized they were too weak to lift themselves. He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glovelike pieces.\\"Or:\\"He saw a uniform. Thinking there was just one soldier, he approached with the water. When he had penetrated the bushes he saw there were about twenty men, and they were all in exactly the same nightmarish state: their faces were wholly burned, their eyesockets were hollow, the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks.\\"And:\\"She kept the small corpse in her arms for four days, even though it started smelling bad on the second day.\\"Though a Yale and Cambridge educated journalist, novelist, and Pulitzer Prize winner, Hersey uses simple words, simple sentences, and a direct, conversational tone to tell a story that would dwarf any language. He gives the numbers: 6,000 degrees centigrade; 70,000 of 90,000 buildings destroyed; 100,000 killed, another 100,000 hurt in a city of 245,000. But cold facts, Hersey realizes, cannot encompass the horror. Only by reliving the day and its aftermath through the eyes, ears, and words of those who experienced it can we approach it. Simply and hauntingly, Hersey places us at ground zero, with austere language that vibrates with intensity:\\"They told her that her mother, father, and baby brother...had all been given up as certainly dead...Her friends then left her to think that piece of news over. Later, some men picked her up by the arms and legs and carried her quite a distance to a truck. For about an hour, the truck moved over a bumpy road, and Miss Sasaki, who had become convinced that she was dulled to pain, discovered that she was not.\\"A year later, the August 31, 1946 edition of The New Yorker devoted all its space to Hersey's Hiroshima. Newspapers worldwide reprinted it; it was read aloud over radio. Since then it has, for good reason, become a classic of American nonfiction.In its final chapter, Hersey quotes a Hiroshima priest who had been away from his mission house the morning of the attack:\\"It seems logical that he who supports total war in principle cannot complain of a war against civilians. The crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable, even when it serves a just purpose. Does it not have material and spiritual evil as its consequences which far exceed whatever good might result? When will our moralists give us a clear answer to this question?\\"Some 65 years later, while some still await an answer, Hersey's Hiroshima still breathes a clear reply."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This novel is the best, accurate, and historical record of the people of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb hit in 1945. The entire town was left in ruins, and the people had to do all the could to make it out and survive. It was the most horrible moment for Japan, and thousands died, and even more were left sick or died for radiation poisoning. It also makes you wonder, is this worth the cost of victory? I give credit to this author for gathering these historically accurate summaries of a good variety of survivors of the bombing, as well as returning decades later to conclude his biographies of these brave survivors. The novel is not a pretty one, but shows how pushing one button can change the lives of thousands of people in a matter of seconds. Its sad seeing what these people went for, as well as sad how some of these survivors ended up dying. This is an emotional book, and shows a Japan's point of view after the bombing, which many Americans weren't aware of the full extent these people suffered."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I assigned this book to my AP and Dual credit kids to give them an idea of what occurred during the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This updated version has an additional, \\"Aftermath\\" chapter in which the lives of these six individuals is updated to around 1980. I find myself looking at humanity differently now. What the crap!? How something like this happened and how little it is talked about is unbelievable. Having read basically nothing else about this subject I would have to say that this book is a good point to start at that will not allow you to ignore this piece of human happening any farther.

Having read a number of historical works on the Pacific War, I was full bottle on the political and military reasons for the action. But Hersey surprised me in two key areas: he wrote the original work in 1946, so it was all raw narrative & he nor his subjects made little comment on the morality of the weapon - he just told their stories. The final chapter - written 40 years on - gives the book its closing credits.You don't need to be a war history buff to get something great out of this little book. I visited Hiroshima in 2008 and found the city to be booming, yet scarred. It was surreal to stand at the hypo-centre of the blast and visit the A-Bomb Dome.

The book does not take Japan's side, or even America's side in the War topic. No matter what the readers views are, this book is extremly valuble to those fact thirsty and to those WWII students.

The message that the book sent to it's audience was good, but the overall story wasn't exciting enough for me and became rather boring towards the ending of the book. I felt that some of the details included toward the ending were unnecessary and seemed to make the book drag on. One, and probably the only part of the book I did like was the first chapter, where it was described where all of the characters were when the bomb was first dropped and how far away from the center of the blast they were. I felt it was interesting to see the different activities the characters were performing at the time of the bombing and then how they were all in the same state of shock and wonder after the bomb was dropped.

I thought the stories of the terrible attack on Hiroshima were so depressing that the Japanese killed about 1/3 the people we killed in Hiroshima. Instead of an air raid we flew over and dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, one of the only atomic bombs ever used in a war. I thought that it was sad that the people were getting sick and dying from the radiation and not even knowing about it. They didn't even know what hit them; they thought it was just a bombing raid. This angered me. But hopefully since we have done it once, we might not do it again or any other nation for that matter.The book was only worth four out of five stars because it didn't relly go into a lot of detail on how they lived after the bombing.

Hiroshima did not leave me with that feeling; by the end of the book I felt a sense of disappointment and confusion. Hiroshima is a historical-fiction novel based on the dropping of the Atomic Bomb. The author, John Hersey, was very confusing and graphic in describing each character's situation throughout the entire novel. These six characters were introduced to me within one paragraph. From that point on I was confused, then I became frustrated. The only reason that I read the book further was because I thought that it would get better and more exciting, but it didn't. The book described each character's reaction to the Atomic Bomb in an unorganized fashion. For example the book began with Ms. Sasaki being crushed by a bookshelf located behind her; this caused her left leg to break. Next, we met Mr. Tanimoto, who was unloading clothes at a friend's house when the bomb went off. Then, the author shifted to Mrs. Nakamura, a tailor's widow, who was in her house at the time of the bombing. Next, we met Dr. Fujii, who was sitting on a porch in his private hospital when the blast occurred. Then, Father Kleinsorge a German priest, was introduced, he was in his room when the Atomic Bomb detonated. After we met Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki was brought into play, he was carrying a blood sample in the Red Cross Hospital when the bomb went off, and a cinder block wall shielded him. After reading this incoherent chapter I felt utterly confused. In the follow chapters, instead of explaining what happens to each character, one at a time, the author tells as little as possible about one character before he switches to the next character. I learned that Mr. Tanimoto avoided the blast by diving behind a rock. The author then changed to Mrs. Nakamura; who was buried in debris, after digging herself out she then dug her children out of the debris. She then left her toppled home and preceded with her family to Asano Park, a safe haven for the wounded. For no apparent reason the author then began to tell us about Father Kleinsorge who, after the bomb exploded, began to pull people from the wreckage. After less than two pages of discussion about Father Kleinsorge, the author began to talk about Dr. Fujii, who had fallen off his porch into the river, and was pinned between two pieces of timber. Dr. Fujii, after being trapped between the fallen lumber found that his arm was badly injured. Before I could fully compensate this situation the author \\"pulled a one-eighty on me\\" and began to reiterate what he said earlier about Father Kleinsorge, this time he eluded to how heroic Father Kleinsorge was, and how he helped save his fellow priests and parishioners. After these brief details, the author began to speak again of Mr. Tanimoto and how he had ran several miles to find the other priests in his congregation to give them aid. After three pages of discussion about Mr. Tanimoto, Ms. Sasaki was brought into the picture. She was trapped under the bookcase for a long time, and after being rescued she was left outside in the courtyard, unable to move because of her leg. Before I could fully understand the graveness of Ms. Sasaki's injury, Dr. Fujii was reintroduced, he was said to have traveled to his parents' roofless house, where he stayed for a few days. Once there he wished he were better so he could tend to the people in Asano Park, but he wasn't. The \\"last section\\" of chapter-two told of how Mrs. Nakamura, once in Ascano Park, found it extremely difficult to receive food, water, or medical treatment. Also in this \\"section\\" Father Kleinsorge was told to have been fighting fires in Ascano Park, which were sweeping through the woods. He also fetched water for the wounded victims who lied helplessly on the ground. At the end of chapter-two the author talked about Mr. Tanimoto, who went to the riverbank and stole a boat from five dead men. He then began to ferry victims across the river to Asano Park where they would be safe from the raging fire on the opposing side of the riverbank. The last three chapters of the novel were very incoherent, much like chapter one and two. Chapter-three was very unorganized, and like chapter-two, the author bounced from character to character. I found it very difficult to realize the main topic of this chapter. But after much analysis I realized that it was a chapter about people dealing with the injuries they had sustained, and the losses that they had suffered. By chapter-four the author hadn't changed his odd style of writing, and still I was confused. Chapter-four, mainly talked about the effects of the bomb, such as radiation sickness and how it affected each character. Also chapter-four foreshadowed what lied ahead for or each of the six characters. Finally, in chapter-five the author became a little bit more orthodox. In chapter-five the author told what happened to each of the characters after the bomb, and how they rebuilt their lives. This was a very powerful chapter, and I was able to absorb the full affect because the author didn't bounce from one character to another. The book Hiroshima, because of its layout, was confusing and it had a limited sense of organization. Even though the book was confusing, it still showed me how senseless the dropping of the Atomic Bomb was and how this destruction affected so many lives. I would persuade a person not the read this book unless they can pick facts out from the text and keep track of them. If not, the reader will be utterly confused throughout the entire novel just like I was."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"If this book were offered in conjunction with treatises on the attack on Pearl Harbor, the brutality of the &quot;Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere,&quot; and the rape of Nanking (recall the picture of the burned, wailing infant sitting in front of rows of burning buildings?), then it would be a valuable literary addition to our understanding of World War II. Sadly, it isn't. What you have is the worst, laziest kind of journalism--journalism by anecdote, the kind of cognitively defective writing that appeals to cognitively defective liberal high school teachers.This book rips Hiroshima from its context, and moreover paints an extremely biased picture of exactly who the Japanese civilians were, and what they thought about the War. Not a peep from Hersey about how the Japanese civilian citizenry was solidly behind the militarism of 1930s Japan, about their celebrations over the brutal, absolutely brutal, destruction and occupation of the Korean pennisula or Manchuria. Also no mention of the fact that the Japanese population was willing to fight to the last person if and when the Allies were to land on Honshu. Saipan and Okinawa were almost *nothing* compared to what awaited the Allies.No, Hersey didn't see fit to include the context of the bombing of Hiroshima; only the suffering...Ignorant Americans who lack even a rudimentary understanding of the Second World War will continue to lap up this journalistic detritus, blissfully unaware of brutality, militarism, and xenophobia brought about by Japan 1910-1945.But the book is not all anti-American propaganda.

I was given a Language Arts Project, which I had to read a novel and do twenty entries. I chose Hiroshima, because I thought i would be able to learn more about history and what not. I learned more about history, yes, but the book in itself was quite dumb in my opinion. The book is about when we (America) dropped the Atomic bomb on Japan. It tells the story of six Japanese people, and what they had to do to survive throughout the \\"war\\". Having six people, however, made the book very hard to follow. John Hersey (the author of the book) had to switch stories every three or four paragraphs, so that got pretty annoying and hard to follow. If your are looking for a book to read for a history project, this is one I would reccomend. If you are looking for a book to read just for the sake of a good book, this is one that is good, but hard to follow. Not recommended. By me anyway. Thank you for reading this reveiw, I hope this helped you with your decision of the book.

Yet, it fails to captivate the reader throughout. Hersey's style of writing, although intriguing, leaves the reader on a \\"cliff hanger\\" every other page; the novel tries to cover to much at the same time. In this novel he tries to explain that many people got A-bomb sickness, such as one of his many characters, Wilhelm Kleinsorge. This sickness would stay with a person for the rest of their life, and eventually kill them. Hersey does a good job of expressing individual cases of this radiation sickness, but as each story gets more intriguing, it is suddenly interrupted to begin a new section of another story. In my opinion, Hersey would have been much better off if he changed the style of the book into a \\"make your own story\\" book, so if the reader wanted to see the next part of a certain persons story, then he/she could flip to the certain page that it is on."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"A very good non-fictional account of six survivors of the first atomic bomb used in warfare. The publisher's note in the beginning says it all in the last paragraph- This isn't a description of how the bomb works, but what it does."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Published in The New Yorker in 1946, \\"Hiroshima\\" was the result of in-depth personal interviews with six of the victims of the atomic blast that hastened the surrender of the Japanese in WW2. These victims were ordinary people going about their ordinary lives. Then, on a hot August day, there was a bright flash of light and the world they lived in changed forever. It is estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the first blast and, over the next few years, more than another 100,000 died as a result of radiation poisoning. Through up-close and personal interviews, the victims Hersey interviewed became very real people to me and I will never forget their accounts of the dreadfulness they experienced. They included a Japanese Methodist minister who was educated in the United States, a war widow and mother of three young children, a German Jesuit priest, an office clerk and two different doctors. Through their eyes I saw the dead and dying, the horrible burns, the wounds that didn't heal, the destruction of homes and the displacement of families, the lack of medical care and the absolute devastation everywhere. Through this article, the American people became acutely aware of the horrific affects of nuclear weapons.Forty years later, the author returned to Hiroshima to again interview these same six people. One of the women had become a nun, another woman suffered with radiation sickness for years, one of them tried to erase all memory of the bombing, one had become a prosperous doctor in his own private clinic, one of them suffered from his wounds for the rest of life, and one of them wound up touring the United States to raise money to rebuild his church and help young girls injured in the blast to have reconstructive surgery. And, during all these years, two of these interviewees had died.The impact this small book had on me went well beyond its 152 pages. I will never forget it and can't help wondering about what the result will be now that so many countries have nuclear weapons. This book makes it all real. It is both an excellent piece of journalism as well as a wake-up call for the future."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"It's pretty impressive to think that a book like \\"Hiroshima\\" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped. John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.Interviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city. Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not. The color of your clothing means everything. White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it. Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn't. But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal. It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes. Hersey's book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can't help but be moved by the reality of it all.My one criticism of \\"Hiroshima\\" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase. For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister. With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one. Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, \\"See? They aren't heathen devils. They are Christians, just like you and me. That's who we dropped the bomb on. That's who we killed.\\" This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima by John Hersey is great book and I would recomend to anyone that they should read it. Hiroshima is about the dropping of the first A-bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Tells true stories of several surivors from the moment of the bombing to their years after the bombing. This book truly stands up to expectations of \\"Who is able to read, should read this book.\\" I think that everyone should read this book, not only for pleasure but for the true understanding of the Atomic bombing on Hiroshima through true stories told by people still alive today."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is one of those books that every person should read at least once in their lifetime.

Such as a german preist named Father Wilhelm Kleisorge, who is one of the few not harmed by the bomb, travels all over the city of hiroshima and does amazing deeds for people that were helpless. He risked his own life for people that thought of him to be a spy for the americans. In this book it summerizes the begginning of the bombing write down to the end where they are on their way to recover or if not already.This along with other stories like it are in this amazing book.

This new edition also includes a chapter written 40 years after the bomb, following up o the lives & fates of the 6 survivors.While the book can be extremely graphic & detailed in describing the results of the bomb on many of the survivors, no one would b able to read it without being impressed with he disaster these people went through."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey&iexcl;s &iexcl;Hiroshima&iexcl; is a tale of survival for the book depicts how and what the witnesses and survivors of the atomic bomb overcame. An outsider might consider someone who had escaped the life-threatening situation of the bombing lucky, but each survivor had to endure the aftermath. The effects, ranging from the guilt of living, lost of friends or family members, physical disabilities caused by the bombing, made the lives of survivors extremely difficult. Throughout the narratives of six different characters, they each went through diverse ways of surviving the bomb and many other side effects both physically and emotionally.The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was an unexpected event for the residents of the city. Surviving the initial blast proved to be only the first step in the emerging nuclear age. When the bomb struck, in knee-jerking reactions each victim reacted differently towards &iexcl;the tremendous flash of light that cut across the sky.&iexcl; (p.5) Other than the nimbleness of the Hiroshima citizens, their escapes from death were a matter of luck. Some of the survivors were shielded by barriers and some by simply turning away. For example, Mr. Tanimoto, the pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, &iexcl;threw himself between two big rocks in the garden&iexcl; (p.5) in order to avoid the flash. As for Mr. Sasaki, a surgeon working at the Red Cross Hospital, &iexcl;he was one step beyond an open window when the light of the bomb was reflected&iexcl; (p.14). He ducked in order to avoid the &iexcl;gigantic photographic flash.&iexcl; (p.14) During this flash of light, thousands of people perished, yet Hersey&iexcl;s focus follows the trail of those who were spared.After the bombing, the survivors not only have to face injuries and emotional pain, but also faced the challenge of rebuilding their lives. Hiroshima was left without the necessary requirements of life such as water and food. These needs were met by in the short-term by the outside aid agencies, but the long-term challenge of recreating a life was left to the determination of the hibakushas. Life was easier for the survivors twelve years later when the Hibakusha Medical Law was put into effect. The law provided a wider range for assisting the health, medical treatment and the welfare of the survivors. Yet, in each case, the six survivors have somehow constructed a meaningful life.In the medium and long-term aftermath of the bombing, the struggle for survival continued. Researchers noticed unusual diseases and symptoms appearing in the hibakushas. Survivors were developing &iexcl;A-bomb cataracts&iexcl; p.104, including stunted growth of children and mutated babies with heads smaller than normal. It was found that some of the pregnant women exposed to radiation had given birth to children with severe mental retardation. This condition is known as, microcephaly. These problems exacerbated the suffering of the survivors, especially given the traditional Japanese attitudes toward handicapped children. Other strange symptoms appeared also, some unexpected and some problems kept re-occurring, problems such as leukemia and cancers. A-bomb victims have to live through the fear of undetected diseases emerging without prior warning. The psychological effects also influenced the hibakushas, the deaths of family members or friends and the aftereffect of exposure to radiation can heighten survivor&iexcl;s anxiety and fears.Aside from the physical wounds, emotional wounds were even harder to mend. The hard-gained properties of the survivors might be destroyed, leaving the hibakushas penniless and homeless. Not just the lost of material goods but the lives of family members might also be gone or endangered by severe injuries. More distressing, people also suffer from &iexcl;survivor guilt&iexcl;. For example, men lived while women died, parents outlived their children, and wives or husbands widowed. Even worse, some hibakushas might suffer because they ran away, ignoring people&iexcl;s &iexcl;Give me water&iexcl; (p.31) and &iexcl;Help me.&iexcl; (p.18) For instance, in the book, Mr. Tanimoto &iexcl;realized he was taking to much time&iexcl; (p.31) to &iexcl;carry water to the suffering strangers&iexcl; (p.31), he decided to &iexcl;run away&iexcl; (p.31) from those who were &iexcl;crying their thirst.&iexcl; (p.31)The memories still linger and haunt the survivors&iexcl; lives. Like in the story, Dr. Sasaki was bothered by not having to identify the corpses dragged out to the mass cremations, where &iexcl;with the nameless souls might still, all these years later, be hovering there, unattended and dissatisfied.&iexcl; (p.109)"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a book that reconstructs the experiences of several people, including a German missionary, following the dropping of the A-Bomb on that city. It is a quite graphic and moving account, one that evokes the true horror that the survivors experienced. The debate as to whether the dropping of A-Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was necessary will probably never be solved. Personally, I don't think it was necessary, but that is irrelevant here. The book is simply an attempt to put a human face on the incident, the failure or denial of which makes such heinous acts possible (I'm not defending the Japanese--they too committed unspeakable atrocities). The book's message is one of great importance, and therefore very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hersey brought to light the true horror that thrust humanity into the atomic age, Hiroshima. Often, in the United States, we see the bombing of Hiroshima as a means to an end. Some say the use of atomic weapons during World War II saved millions of American lives, and perhaps those sentiments are true. However atomic weapons have also brought Americans to the doorstep of hell all too often. It wasn&#65533;t so long ago that Kennedy and Khrushchev stared down the barrel of nuclear annihilation, both holding the fate of humanity in the palms of their hands.Oppenheimer was right. Following the first atomic test, he recited words from the Bhagavad-Gita, &#65533;Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.&#65533; And in a way, he had become death. He opened a Pandora&#65533;s box that can never be resealed.Since we are destined to live with the threat of nuclear weapons, it is all we can do to attempt to halt the proliferation and use of said weapons. Hersey&#65533;s book reveals the havoc that even the smallest atomic weapon can cause. Today, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is nothing more than a child&#65533;s cherry bomb, compared to the multi-megaton warheads that point across national boarders. And this revelation is what makes Hersey&#65533;s book so important. It gives us a taste of what is to come if we &#65533;cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.&#65533;"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is NOT fiction - unfortunately the events and the people in this book are very real. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; follows the lives of six survivors of the atomic bomb from the hours preceeding the explosion on August 6, 1945, to the decades afterwards. The survivors detailed in this book include a housewife, a German priest, two doctors, a young working woman, and a reverend. The details were superb, and I learned a lot of facts of which I was previously unaware. The story tells of the physical intensity of the bomb, the horrible, crippling symptoms experienced by the victims both at the time of the bomb and afterwards, and of the treatment experienced by the victims of the bomb. One of the things that most shocked me was the treatment of the &quot;hibakusha&quot; by their own country based on the Japanese government's reluctance to take responsibility for these victims. Everyone should read this book and educate themselves about this historical event (especially those of us who were not alive during that time period). It is sobering and frightening to think that it could certainly happen again anywhere in the world due to increased nuclear capabilites by many countries on this planet."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"First published in 1946, this simple little book recounts the experiences of six civilian inhabitants of Hiroshima who survived the atomic blast on August 6, 1945. Few residents recall hearing any sound from the explosion, just the bright flash and the shock wave. Even those who died soon after most often did so in silence. The book tells what those 6 were doing that morning, what happened when the atomic bomb exploded, and how they coped in the hours, days, weeks and months that followed. The final chapter returns 40 years later to follow up on the rest of their lives.I've heard rave and almost reverential recommendations of this book and wondered if my thoughts would be changed by reading it. The text is mostly straightforward and seemingly neutral in its judgment; it reports that most Hiroshimans did not blame the US for the bomb, they just wanted to get on with their lives as best they could. It is not until the very end that it seems to take on an agenda, and while I found the initial part of the book fascinating and compelling, the follow-up chapter was disappointing. It isn't especially graphic or horrific in its account, but does portray what ordinary Japanese experienced, and made me feel grateful that such weapons have not been used since 1945.I think this is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the topic to read. But I would urge you *not* to read with the intent to fortify your views either way - the book's focus is much too narrow for such - but to read it for the history and human experience it reports."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Albert Einstein wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt urging him to develop an atomic bomb, fearful that the Germans would be first. Einstein latter said it was the greatest mistake he ever made. Within a few short years of that letter, humans mastered the technique of obtaining a tremendous amount of energy by eliminating matter, expressed by a very familiar formula. The first demonstration of this mastery occurred in the New Mexican desert, in July, 1945, and within less than a month, an atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.Within a year of the bombing, which was instrumental event in bringing the Second World War to an end, John Hersey wrote this poignant account of six survivors, each of whom were between a mile or two from ground zero, and each in their way was lucky, or unlucky, to have survived. Hersey tells the accounts of two women: a clerk in the personnel department, and a tailor's widow; and of four men: two medical doctors, a Japanese Methodist minister and a German Catholic priest. Hersey tells their stories with a very flat affect, in that style of \\"just stating the facts,\\" and allowing the horror which occurred to these six, as well as others, speak for itself. Time and again Hersey selects the detail to bring this horror home, from the mother who held her dead baby for four days, as it was decomposing, awaiting the return of her husband, to the still alive anti-aircraft crew, whose faces had \\"melted\\" in the blinding heat. All the emergency services were eliminated or overwhelmed, and one of the two doctors above was the only one staffing the sole hospital. Supplies and exhaustion constrained him to perform only the most rudimentary first aide.Most of the book is focused on the immediate impact on these six, over the first 72 hours. But Hersey does have an informal \\"epilogue\\" section that covers their lives over the following six months, and the arrival of Allied occupation forces.Because it was the first use of nuclear weapons in war, Hiroshima receives a disproportionate share of the attention. No similar book has ever been written about Nagasaki, bombed three days latter, with almost the same number killed. Also, the Allies had deliberately fire bombed cities such as Tokyo, and Dresden with \\"conventional\\" weapons, with at least as many casualties. Does it matter if your face is melted by fire bombs, or an atomic weapon? There is a difference though, in that there are the lingering effects of radiation, which quite often includes death, that occur with the survivors of an atomic bomb attack.I've been to the A-bomb museum in Hiroshima, and consider it quite bias against the Americans, in that all causative reasons for such an attack are not mentioned. It is presented very much in the form that this was a cruel experiment, conducted at the very end of the war. Hersey's book however, I consider fair and factual. He allows the horror of war to speak for itself. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the immediate likelihood of nuclear war has been reduced, but with the increased proliferation of the bomb, coupled with on-going wars, the chance of another use of the bomb, even by accident, remains high.Hersey's account of the lives of six people at Hiroshima should be part of the core curriculum in every American high school. A solid 5-star read.(P.S. I didn't read this book in Spanish; hopefully Amazon will move the numerous reviews of this book to an English language version of the book)"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hersey tells the story of several individuals who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.What makes the book so fascinating is the very detailed, personal experiences of these people; what they were doing, what they thought when they saw the flash, what their injuries were, what they did in the minutes and hours and months after the bomb hit.The one thing I didn't like was that it was told in the 3rd person. I would have liked to have read those individuals accounts in their own words (but of course, translated).Also, because the various accounts were from people who all had some sort of connection with each other (and why were most of them ministers or doctors), I got the impression I wasn't getting a representative sample. I also would have liked to have learned more about these individuals views on the war, the bomb, Americans and the aftermath of it all.Overall, though, a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I agree with some of the comments about the one-sided-ness of this book.

I have also read Iris Chang's \\"The Rape of Nanking.\\" I've read other books that detail the atrocities of both the Japanese AND the Nazis. This book, \\"Hiroshima\\" is a unique glimpse into the lives of the residents of Hiroshima."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Journalist John Hersey's non-fiction account of the atomic bomb blast on Hiroshima, Japan, was originally published in the August 31, 1946 edition of The New Yorker magazine, before becoming a best-selling book. In four chapters, Hersey covers a year in the life of six people--five natural-born Japanese and one German national--who survived the American attack on their beloved city. Chapter One, A Noiseless Flash, begins with the detonation of the bomb, \\"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time\\" and ends moments later, shortly before the city catches on fire. The principal witnesses to the destruction are introduced: Miss Toshiko Susaki, \\"a clerk\\"; Masakazu Fujii, a doctor who works in a private hospital; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a widow with three children; Dr. Terufumi Susaki (unrelated to the clerk), who is on the staff of the Red Cross Hospital; Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a Methodist; and Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a Jesuit priest of Germany, which was an ally to Japan in World War II.The book begins without any setup other than the time, place, and central--real-life--characters. The background to the conflict is conspicuously absent, as are facts regarding political, military or geographical concerns surrounding WWII. Hersey assumes the reader has lived through the war, is current on all the pertinent details of the air- and ground-battle, so he wastes no printed space on the world leaders, generals, or military brigades in favor of devoting all of his energy to the civilians. In particular, the innocent victims of the end-game move by American president Harry Truman are who most concern the writer, and the book gathers their personal, eyes-on-the-ground experiences into a compelling narrative that encompasses not only six people, but an entire city.Each eyewitness has a distinct personality, a specific lifestyle before the blast, and a horrific story to tell of its aftermath. In the three chapters following the introductory chapter, their six individual odysseys for survival and understanding converge and overlap. The interlacing narrative structure gives the reader a full perspective of the days and months after the atomic attack on Hiroshima, with six varying viewpoints organized into one fluid tale.Hersey takes the reader through the city's \\"clouded air...giving off a thick, dreadful miasma\\" primarily through the subjective lens of those who saw it first-hand, but he doesn't limit his reporting to that narrow scope. He also offers many objectively reported facts and provides a larger perspective on the situation throughout the book, revealing details that the denizens of the devastated city were never privvy to, but which expand the reader's understanding of their closed narrative. When the reader learns that, directly following the atomic blast, sixty-five of a hundred and fifty doctors died instantly, and that the majority of the remaining M.D.s were wounded, the story takes on a heightened sense of dread that would be missing without that information. The plight of the survivors becomes even more grim for the reader at this point, and the drama of their personal journeys becomes more immediate and emotionally wrenching.The narrative voice of the author is extremely matter-of-fact, without any \\"commenting\\" on the actions or thoughts of the six people, nor any subjective commentary on those responsible for the dropping of a bomb that killed over a hundred thousand Japanese and injured thirty-seven thousand more. He lets the experiences of those who were there speak for themselves, and despite the occasional contextual bit of information, Hersey depends solely on their testimonies to tell the story.The details are often graphic, with physical descriptions of burned and bloody corpses, vomiting children, maimed and ravaged survivors, as well as drowned and bloated dead. The tone has a somberness throughout, with a sense of compassion for those who suffered this ordeal felt within the narrative. The gruesome facts are given in an unflinching manner, yet there is temperance shown by Hersey, with the focus not so much on the devastation, but on the selflessness and hope the people of Hiroshima display in the face of chaos and confusion. They suffer physical pain, emotional hardships, yet all emerge somehow more closely attached to their community and to their fellow human beings. As Hersey writes near the end of the book, \\"One thing that they (the six people) did seem to share...was a kind of elated community spirit...a pride in the way they and their fellow-survivors had stood up to a dreadful ordeal.\\" When the reader reaches the final page of this short yet powerful book, that dreadful ordeal has been illuminated, humanized, and masterfully realized by a writer whose personal agenda seems only to be the reporting of the untold truth."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a book written by a man by the name of John Hersey. Mr. Hersey was born in Tientsin, China in 1914.

It covers their lives from the day the bomb hit them until ...?What point did Mr. Hersey have in mind in writing such a book, I ask myself? What lesson is to be learned from reading such a book?When I finished reading another controversial book years ago, Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler, I asked myself the same question. I said to myself - if the lessons learned from reading that book could be condensed into one sentence what would it be? I think my conclusion satisfies both these books.

John Hersey uses imagery throughout the book. Phrases such as \\"everything flashed whiter than any white she had ever seen\\" captivate the reader and make the book interesting and enjoyable. The author also writes in a style like no other. He tells the story of six victims that survived the bombing. He tells the story from their point of view and their experiences. It not only tells of the victim's accounts of the bombing experience, it also tells of how the victims live their lives after the bombing and far after the war. Some victims suffer from radiation sicknesses, and the author tells how they live with it and how they get over it. The book often leaves you hanging skipping from person to person and it makes you want to read the book all in one sitting. The book also creates in the reader a sympathy for those victims of the bombing. As you read the book you learn and feel more and more sympathetic for these people. Overall this book is a great read, and I would recommend it for anyone who is particularly interested in World War II."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is the factual although perhaps not graphic enough account of six survivors of the first atomic bomb blast in World War II. Having read a number of books on the subject, I can say this is among the best.Hiroshima begins with a synopsis of the events of August 6, 1945. In a short explanation, it details what each of the survivors was doing the moment the bomb was dropped. The remaining chapters discuss the aftereffects of the bomb. Even the stigma of being a Hiroshima survivor limited what a person could do in life. This does not even account for the divergent health ailments that linger after a nuclear attack. The last chapter goes into depth about the life of each of the six survivors. What I found most interesting is that five of the six focused much of the remainder of their lives in religion. Having each survived many years after the bomb, these people are a testament to the power of religious faith.While the book is short, it gives readers a human perspective of the effects of the atomic bomb. The reader can not help but feel empathy for those civilians who became victims for life because of a war for which they had no personal stake."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"\\"Hiroshima\\" by John Hersey is true story about August 6, 1945 when one action would forever change the course human history.

It give the most accurate and powerful literary recording of what happens to the survivors of a nuclear attack. As a nuclear war is the most horrifying of all prospects facing humanity this book should serve as kind of cautionary lesson to us all. The lesson should be that ' Nuclear War must never happen- that no part of Mankind should ever be subject again to these horrors- and that it is the moral duty of every human being on earth and most especially of all political leaders to see that such weapons are never used again.Hershey's book is an effective document precisely because it is not ' fiction' but rather a journalistic account of what happened to real people. Let us pray to God and do everything possible that mankind will never know such horror again"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Thought-provoking quick read.

Although a bit confusing at the beginning as it introduces the six subjects in rapid succession, it held my attention reasonably well. The journalist/author does a great job in conveying the confusion, horror and lack of understanding that encompassed the event. Don't expect to draw any moral conclusions about the use of nuclear weapons from this book as it is a complicated moral issue, this book is simply a well written engrossing account of the events of the Hiroshima bomb from those who were most effected."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"A week before the bomb is dropped until 40 years later, Hersey tells the story of the human impact through 6 bomb-impacted Japanese. We learn that \\"survivor\\" is too boastful a term in Japanese culture. The 1946 classic is updated with the lige stories of the 6 individuals.Looking back, the reporting seems remarkably balanced, objective, insightful and unjudging. The negative US response at the time makes sense in light of the war and its casualties. The ongoing negative response portraying this as an apologetic work is harder to understand. Morally justified or not, the bomb had a devastating, unexpected and long-lasting negative impact on a city, a country, a second country, a culture and the world.Hersey's description of the impact is stomach twisting without being gratuitously graphic. His picture of a stoic, orderly, accepting and recovering culture is inspiring, but not over done. This book does not replace a trip to Hiroshima and a visit to the museum and gardens, but it does make the hair stand up on your neck a few times. War, culture and ethical decisions are complex. Best to understand them as deeply as possible."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"My dad lived through the time of the atomic bombing of hiroshima and told me about this 1946 book by John Hersey It show good character and self sacrifice among the japanese, just as they are showing today"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I bought the book Hiroshima and it was quite informative.The book explains through the lives of several families (who survived the blast of the Atomic Bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima) how their lives were changed forever.With their city destroyed, untold thousands died a horrible death."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Our sonds teacher made him read this.

There were two bombs.' (Isn't Hiroshima enough is my thought rejoinder.)On that date, August 6, 1945, a B-29 raid was feared. Only Hiroshima and Kyoto had been spared B-29 attacks. Hiroshima is fan-shaped. Japanese radar detects only three planes. Almost no one in Hiroshima hears any noise of a bomb. The maimed, wounded, and dying go to the Red Cross Hospital. Ultimately ten thousand people seek treatment. It resembles an invasion.Afterwards Hiroshima is a dreadful miasma. A child wants to know why it is night already. A private hospital seems to be in the river. One survivor's hair turns white two months after the explosion. The following day the President of the United States identifies the bomb as atomic. Later people come down with radiation sickness.A uranium bomb exploded at Hiroshima, and a more powerful plutonium bomb at Nagasaki. The author's narrative focuses on six Hiroshima victims, persons whose lives would never be the same. Waging total war encompasses civilian casualties. Hersey is surprised that many of the victims aren't much concerned with the ethics of the bombing.Excerpts of this superior journalistic work have made their way into American textbooks. The trend is heartening."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Haunting.There are no simple conclusions to reach, regarding the use of the atomic bombs against Japan. This is still a highly controversial and painful subject for citizens of many nations around the world, as the effects of war remain with us for so many generations afterward. The very attempt to discuss the events of Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) is like traversing a path mined everywhere by trip wires which are difficult to avoid and easily triggered.Hersey's work here recounts the experience of Hiroshima survivors, the horrors of what the people in Hiroshima lived through, on that day, a horror the world rightly continues to grieve and mourn, and to fear greatly the potential for repetition. Hersey's Hiroshima was the first to personalize the experience for Westerners, the first to tell the story to the West from the perspective of those who lived and worked in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb.Moving. Disturbing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is an excellent book that every person should read. It describes very clearly the horrors of Atomic Warfare. This book is not for the light hearted reader, it is very intense. There are many gory descriptions of the affects of radiation and severe burns, and death is everywhere on these pages. Wherever you stand on the question of weather or not America should have dropped TWO atomic bombs on Japan, you must acknowledge one thing. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were murdered by the bombs. The slaughter of innocent is never diplomatic or peaceful, no mater how you coat it.I highly recomend this book to anyone curious about what Hiroshima was like from the average Japanese citizen's point of view. Also, every person should read this great book to learn about the horrors of atomic bombs. Please, if you don't learn history, then you are doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book may be small, the writing may seem simplistic, but this account from several survivors of the first atomic bombing truly drives home the horror of what happened.

The writing is very matter-of-fact, and Hersey succeeds. With his talent, he could have very well made an elaborate drama out of Hiroshima, to make it so-called an &quot;interesting&quot; read. Instead, Hersey seems to have focused on the raw but still intimate fact of what happened, and left it with the reader to react to it, instead of spoon-feeding a &quot;proper&quot; response. As such, the book leaves an impression of being unsophisticated, and accomplishes its task because of it. This is an excellent piece."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This slender volume is to Hiroshima what &quot;Night&quot; is to the Holocaust. It doesn't explain how the bomb was made, or why it was dropped. Rather, Mr. Hersey writes about Hiroshima from the perspective of survivors, who are fairly average people. The experiences he describe are uniquely personal and, deliberately, I think, related matter-of-factly. The stories told here remind us why we should always think differently about weapons of mass destruction."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I started off reading this book for English class and then I finished it for my own sake.

As he records this, he also enters the lives of six survivors and writes about each one's personal experience during and after the bombing. It is through these survivors in which the book is centered, making it a very touching and moving novel.

The straight forward approach that Hersey used in this book helped me to get into the story. he didn't make it long and drawn out, there was always something interesting going on. Overall, Hiroshima was a very good book that was both enjoyable and eductional. This book is worth reading again."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is a very informative and eye-opening account of the dropping of first atomic bomb. It shows how six peoples lives are affected by the bomb. Hersey doesnt give his own opinions on whether or not the decision to drop the bomb was the right one; but clearly illustrates the atrocities caused by that decision. It gives insight as to what struggles the victims had to go through and the losses they faced. I liked the realism of the novel but was, at some points, too graphic. I also liked how the author gave an update at the end to follow up with each character. The book was sort of difficult to follow at the beginning because there are so many different names. Just take your time and refer to the back cover to refresh your memory of who's who. I hope you enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book was very well written, it contains bits and pieces of journalistic facts while using the lives of ordinary people to show the impact of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in a compassionate and perceptive voice. John Hersey uses facts and the recollections of those who survived to weave a truely remarkable tale of what happens when one decision changes the lives of many. This novel contains bits and pieces of people's lives before and after the atomic bomb had been dropped. Although the book may seem short, the time that you spend thinking about the book is actually quite long. This book is not a light and happy read, it is not some classic that becomes cliqued and quoted all too many times, but what it is is an admirable tale spun not by the author himself, but by the lives of those who managed to do the near impossible. This novel tells the story of those who managed to live."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The debate rages on to this day on whether or not the U.S. was justified in dropping the atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. John Hersey's &quot;Hiroshima&quot; paints a realistic picture of the bomb dropped on that city as told in a narrative style about six victims, including a priest, two doctors, a poor widow, and a young female factory worker.Some currently share the opinion that Japan was going to surrender even before the bombs were dropped. Others still believe in what this book points to in one of its sections as &quot;total war&quot; being practiced by Japan at that time, where there &quot;was no difference between civilians and soldiers&quot;. The bomb, in this case, was needed to save American lives and Japan from total destruction.This book leaves the debate to the reader as it shows what did happen to tens of thousands of people after the bomb fell on Hiroshima. Instant death, pro-longed suffering, and total destruction of property are portrayed in its pages. This book is a MUST READ for all people -- all nations. Readers can witness the human tragedy behind a nuclear solution. This book, written shortly after the war and updated, will leave all who read it shaken and praying that this event will never happen again for any reason."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"At 8:15 am on August 6, 1945 the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It detonated above a bridge, near a school. Instantly, temperatures at ground zero reached over 6000 degrees Fahrenheit. Flesh was seared from bone. People nearby were disintegrated, leaving nothing more than a shadow on the wall behind them. Unspeakable horrors were forced upon the survivors. John Hersey's Hiroshima tells their story. The author's goal in crafting this novel is to give a memorable and accurate account of the bombing of Hiroshima that elicits thoughtful responses from the reader. The material is presented in an unbiased form. The reader is never told to view the bombing in a specific nature and the author's opinion is never revealed. One does not know if the author agrees or disagrees with the decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima. The author also wants to make the reader think. The reader is invited to dwell on the moral issues of the bomb, as well as the ethics of war and issues of life and death. The reader is meant to see the survivor's as humans, not civilians or enemies. He makes the reader look at them as real people by not only telling what is going on around the person, but what emotions are going through their minds. In taking away the ability of the reader to view the subjects of the book as objects. He draws the reader into the survivor's minds making them feel what the reader feels and making them see what the reader sees. Suddenly the reader stops viewing the bombing of Hiroshima as an ending to a war and begins viewing it as a massive loss of human life. The bombing was in fact both, but many people forget that. The author does not want us to forget, and after reading this book it is impossible. In writing the book the author relies mainly on the accounts of the survivors. At times he will inject snippets of facts to tie together parts of the story and tell what else was going on at the time of the reader's account. In delivering the accounts many questions on morality and ethics are brought up. The question of the morality of the bomb is brought up many times from each survivor's point of view, but shares equal time with a meditation off the morals of war itself. A colleague of one survivor, who also experienced the bombing, remarks towards the different opinions of the survivors that \\"Some of us consider the bomb in the same category as poison gas and were against its use on a civilian population. Others were of the opinion that in total war, as carried on in Japan, there was no difference between civilians and soldiers, and that the bomb itself was an effective force tending to end the bloodshed, warning Japan to surrender and thus to avoid total destruction. It seems logical that he who supports total war in principle cannot complain of a war against civilians. The crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable, even when it serves its purpose.\\" (90) These are the main questions addressed in the text. At times the opinions of the people giving their accounts are shown, but never forced on you. It is always made clear that the opinions shown are simply the survivor's opinions, and are not shared by everyone. The story is exquisitely painted on a lush visual canvas. The reader is invited to marvel at the power of the bomb, while gawking at its horrific affects as seen through the eyes of survivors. The stories are described so vividly that it is not unusual to feel a wave of nausea after reading a passage with truly gruesome content. The book is written from a combination of an omniscient and third person viewpoint giving it a scope of epic proportions. The events are looked upon with an unerring eye of truth that neither judges nor attempts to justify. It is very well written in a style that provokes emotional responses without even attempting to. The book is a success. It is a finely crafted novel that, without warning, plunges the reader in to the horrific events of the bombing of Hiroshima. When reading it, one feels as though living a nightmare. I was captivated by the sheer brutality of the situation. In fact, the imagery, at times, is so harsh that one feels the need to stop reading and mourn the tragic loss of life. The survivors of the bomb were forced into inhuman situations, such as choosing who receives medical attention, and the reader feels morally responsible for their decisions. The book made me reflect on life itself. I would sometimes stop to contemplate on the issues that arise from the text. The author succeeds in burning the events into the reader's mind. Never will I forget the horror experienced as a result of the bomb. Not a day goes by that the images of piles of corpses or flesh sliding off a dieing body flash through my mind. The pain and suffering of the survivors is forever engraved in my memory. Though short, it is by no means an easy book to read. The situations are shocking and the gruesomeness is sometimes overwhelming. It is painful to read, yet, as hard as I tried to look away my eyes did not leave the page. I devoured each word. Anyone with the ability to read, at any level, should read this book. Sometimes a passage needs to be repeated, by all readers, to get the entire impact of what the author is revealing. The worst thing that the survivors could experience is the world forgetting what happened to them. This book does not allow one to forget. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"In my opinion, Hiroshima by John Hersey is a great book. It is a book that I believe everyone should read. John Hersey tells this tragic story from six of the survivors points-of-view, which is really interesting and caught my attention. Reading about the stories these six survivors have to tell really helped me to understand what emotional pain the people of Hiroshima experienced. Before reading this book I never really had an opinion on the bombing of Hiroshima; it never ran through my mind. After reading this book I now have an understanding of what happened in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, which I'm thankful I have. Stories of shock, helping each other, and moving on are told. We tend not to think about the people that lost their homes, family, and friends because it didn't happen to us or our country. However, it was real and did happen. John Hersey tells the surviving stories of Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terfumi Sasaki, and Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, and also in the new edition their fates forty years later. There is no better way to tell the story of Hiroshima than by the survivors of it. I enjoyed this book very much and encourage everyone who hasn't read it to do so."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"... in a silent, blinding flash of white light, one hundred thousand lives were blown off the face of the earth by the first atomic bomb ever used as a weapon of war. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; is the story of what happened when the bomb went off on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m. Six ordinary citizens were going about their day: the Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto was about to unload a cart, Miss Toshiko Sasaki was beginning her work as a secretary; Dr. Masakazu Fujii was opening his newspaper, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was perusing a Jesuit magazine, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki (no relatio to Toshiko Sasaki) was walking down the hall toward the hospital laboratory; and Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura was looking out the window, when &quot;everything flashed whiter than anything she had ever seen&quot; and the world turned into hell. From there we follow the course of these six people's lives, hour by hour, as the darkness descended while the mushroom cloud rose, and all around them was nothing but death and destruction. One reads this slender book at a single sitting, unable to put it down, and emerges shell-shocked, with a single question going around and around in one's head: &quot;Why?&quot;John Hersey's account of the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima stands as a classic of wartime reporting. He doesn't editorialize or sensationalize; he lets the six people mentioned above tell their own stories; and through them, the horror of what was unleashed on August 6. The apocalyptic destruction of lives and property was mind-blowing. And after living through the nightmare of the blast, the survivors of the bombing had to cope with the long-term effects of radiation sickness.The question of &quot;Why?&quot; still haunts us almost 60 years later. Was the bombing necessary? What better options did Truman have? The answer may be, none. A full-scale invasion of Japan, which would almost certainly have occurred if the bombing had not taken place, or if it had not been as devastatingly effective as it was, was estimated to cost a million American casualties, and probably many more Japanese casualties as well. Was it a question of committing a horrendous act in order to avoid a worse one? Probably. We've learned from history that all too often, the choice is not between good and bad, but between bad, worse, and unspeakable.The original version of &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, published the year after the war ended, left the profiles of six lives in suspension. The updated edition includes Hersey's 1985 article on the lives of the six survivors forty years later. We learn that, after suffering through so much in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the &quot;hibakusha&quot; (the Japanese term for the Hiroshima survivors) had to put up with prejudice and discrimination from non-hibakusha who shunned them because they were subject to so many illnesses. Even so, these six, along with thousands of others, managed to get on with what was left of their lives. One finishes this book with a sense almost of awe at the resilience of these six very ordinary people who could be any six people in our own country. And even as we get a sick feeling that somewhere out there, some madman would love to push the nuclear button and unleash a holocaust that would make Hiroshima look like a walk in the park, we feel a deep sense of resolve never to let anything like this happen again, anywhere, at any time."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima was written shortly after the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Journalist John Hersey traveled to Japan to record the devastation and interviewed many of the survivors, choosing six to focus on. The book begins at the precise moment the bomb exploded, taking each person in turn, setting the scene of where they were at the time and the immediate aftermath. I can't say this book is brilliantly written. There's little style and at times it becomes just a recitation of facts. But if you can put yourself in the place of the survivors, try to see what they see, feel what they feel, you realize how important it is for you to keep reading. This book isn't about entertainment, it's about understanding what the citizens of Hiroshima went through. Seeing them not only as statistics, but real people."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"On August 6, 1945 a noiseless flash spread out across the early morning sky of Hiroshima. One of the greatest diasters of World War II had just occurred. This is the story of six people of all different social classes surviving the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. With an explosive force of 12,500 tons of dynamite it completely annihilated the city of Hiroshima. This book is the stories of six survivors excatcly as they remember it with no detail left out. Although they endured the same horror they all have very different points of view about what happened on that fateful day. This book tells the stories of Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakzu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto. It conveys the message, that through the horrors of war, some good can come out of it. For instance, people joining together to help others in a time of need or distress. A book that has the ability shed light on the horrors the Japanese people faced is truly a work of art. John Hersey has written a masterpiece of literature that should and MUST be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Published in 1946, this remarkable article or book was based on interviews with survivors of the first city to be destroyed by a single weapon. John Hersey was a war correspondent during World War II. His \\"Hiroshima\\" has been rated as number one in The Top Ten Works of Journalism in the United States in the 20th Century, as determined by The New York University journalism faculty and a panel of critics that included David Brinkley and Morley Safer. \\"Hiroshima\\" took over the entire August 30, 1946 issue of \\"The New Yorker\\" and the issue sold out within hours. After reading this rather slim book, I can understand why. It relates the stories of six survivors in a very interesting and readable way. Hersey makes us feel the impact of the bomb and its horrors in a very personal way, yet he doesn't go overboard on the gore. There is a follow-up study almost 40 years later, and we visit these same characters again. Surprisingly, none of the six hated the U.S.; they understood that drastic measures were neeeded to end a war that the Japanese obsessively fought; throwing reason out the window. The book can be read in an evening, but you will want to reread it, as well."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Journalist John Hersey (1914-1993) wrote this book through interviews with six surviving Japanese civilians only months after the bomb was dropped in August of 1945. His highly readable prose is both unforgettable and compelling. Hersey arrived in Japan and wrote this narrative shortly after the war ended, before we realized the frightful cancers and birth deformities that resulted from high exposure to radiation. But we do see the horrific suffering and confusion of those who were there, some blinded, others badly burned, many with their skin peeling off in their hands. This compelling book is not for the faint-of-heart, but it illustrates the affects of the bomb on those who were there.Some readers correctly point out that Japan's army had raped and murdered its way through Asia, and that the bomb may have ultimately shortened the war and saved lives by forestalling a U.S. invasion of Japan's home islands. Still, this is a frightful and moving account seen through the eyes of those who suffered the most."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book exposes the horrors of a nuclear weapon in a way that cannot help but move you. Hersey interviewed survivors of the American nuclear attack against Hiroshima, Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. The interviews took place literally before the ashes were cool. Their story is one of tremendous suffering; the power of the weapon is amazing. Stories of people immediately vaporized, leaving behind only a shadow on a wall, eyeballs melted out of their sockets, flesh turned to liquid and people dying painful deaths days after the explosion.There are some that think a nuclear war is survivable, if that is your opinion, you should read this book. It is the most moving and disturbing description of what a nuclear war would really be like. Furthermore, it must be understood that the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima was a mere firecracker compared to the power of a hydrogen bomb."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Reading this book felt like I was transported back to August 6, 1945. The events on that day and the days following were horrific! Hersey's accounts were so vivid and well-documented that I even felt like I was experiencing the explosion first-hand, (but from six different perspectives). At times, some of the accounts were very disturbing, while others, heartbreaking. However, these accounts opened my eyes to the realities of what could happen if there should ever be a Hiroshima repeat, or worst--nuclear warfare. I definitely recommend this book, not just for the mind-blowing experience, but also for its great literature."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey has written an incredible book about a world changing event. Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima and the aftermath of what happens. Instead of telling the entire story minute-by-minute, Hersey focuses on six people living very different lives on the day of the atomic bomb blast. He puts a human face to the story of the devastation of a civilian city.Hersey's brilliance is not that the book is well written, it is, the brilliance is that he focuses on the six people and tells about what every surviving japanese citizen endured after the blast. Hersey never gives detailed accounts, but hints at the terrible pain and injuries each person recieved, which makes the entire episode more horrifying. Hersey also spends a great deal of time explaining the ambivilance of the Hiroshima citizens toward the idea of the bomb. Many of course were angry, but many more had a \\"it can't be helped\\" attitude. Hersey explains that Hiroshima was both and economic and transportation crossroads. He also explains that the Japanese government followed a \\"total war\\" philosophy and this was the price. Hersey does not condone nor criticize the dropping of the bomb.This is an execellent book and should be read by everybody. The end of the book is updated during the eighties to tell the final outcome of the six people. Each has a story that both resembles each other and yet are very different in each of their own way. For me the most surreal moment of the book was when one of the six end up on \\"This is Your Life\\" and meets the pilot of the Enola Gay. Excellent read. Highley Recommended."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"No one can adequately describe what happened in Hiroshima. There aren't words in any human language to fully explain it. But Hersey manages to convey to the reader the depth and enormity of the events on that tragic day, leaving the reader with a sense of awe and dumbfoundedness with all that transpired. This is one of those books that will transform your view of the world once you have read it. I used it as research material for my own historical novel and found it to be immensely useful, not only to garner the historical facts, but to get a better sense of the emotions that were felt on such a great scale after that event. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's poignant novel on Hiroshima is one of the best I've read. Hersey's novel is based on interviews with the survivors of the first atomic bombing, and it instantly draws you into this gritty and devastating event. This book is more than just a novel; it's an epic.Dr. Masaku Fujii ran a successful hospital for the sick and old. However as there was a rise in warnings of an American attack on Hiroshima he was unable to take on any more patients. On the day of the attack he was sitting out on his porch reading the local newspaper. Suddenly a blinding light flashed and he was sent flying through the air into a near by river like a rag doll. His story would hold the same similarity as the other survivors; that blinding light. It was like the final flashing warning for a destruction that the world had never seen.Only the accounts of real people could make this book such an unforgettable story of war, love, and the obliterations upon civilization. Dr. Masaku Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto all started their day of normally, but by the end of that day their lives would be bound together, and changed, by the events of Hiroshima. Most would lose their wives, husbands, children, jobs, lives, and a resound feeling of protection. However these five would survive this horrible feat of genocidal-fanatics on their city, and they would all tell their stories to John Hersey.Hiroshima is a true testament of survival and compassion of a nation brought to its knees by the atomic bomb. This story shines a bright, and personal, light on the events of Hiroshima: brighter than the colossal explosion caused by the bomb. This book is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, John Hersey's retelling of the events surrounding the United States' August 6, 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, gives an historical account different from those that are usually given to Americans. Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima through third person narratives of the lives of several survivors of the bombing. This is different from most Americanized stories, in which the bombing is usually viewed through the eyes of one or more Americans involved in the bombing. This is one of the positive qualities of the book, as it forces Western readers to view the bombing from the receiving end, allowing them to gain a different perspective. Before reading Hiroshima, I was like many Americans in my beliefs about the use of nuclear weapons. While I have always known that such weapons are destructive, horrible things, Hiroshima has caused me to rethink my own view on the possible future use of these weapons. I used to jokingly say, \\"Let's just nuke \`em!\\" whenever a foreign power came to arms with the United States. After reading Hiroshima and taking in the graphic depictions of victims, I would never think of seriously favoring the use of nuclear weapons. While I cannot say that I enjoyed reading about carnage and the after-effects of radiation, as a history fan and as an American, I enjoyed being given a new point of view of an event which I thought I knew a lot about.Hiroshima, while interesting and thought provoking, is not a book to be enjoyed by all people. The graphic scenes following the bombing can be physically sickening at times, even for those who think they are prepared for such violence. These scenes only help to convey the message that nuclear weapons and war in general are terrible things. Most history fans, especially those interested in World War II, might like this book for its historical importance. As a novel, the book does not serve much of an entertainment purpose. Anyone researching weapons of mass destruction, Japanese history, or World War II would definitely find this a useful book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Very good book. I also have enjoyed the audiobook.It's non fiction, so it's not for pure entertainment, but for people who really want to see the unvarnished truth of what happened."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"In America we are never shown the human side or the after affects of the Atomic Bomb. We are only told that it ended the war and saved countless American soldiers lives.This book sheds some light on the human side and the Japanese view of what happened. The fact that nearly 100,000 people had been killed or doomed in one blow and 100,000 more injured in a city of 245,000 is something to contemplate in itself. The human tragedy is explored a bit in this book. The wounds, the eybrows burned off, the eyes melted out of their sockets, skin hanging from faces and hands. Vomiting and burn patterns on bodies. It can be a bit gruesome but it is important to know the devestation that this bomb brought. The after effects of radiation poisoning and the lifelong health problems of many of the survivors are explored. The increased rates in cancer and luekemia are discussed.This is an eye opening book that tells the story of 6 different survivors. The horrors in the aftermath of the Atomic explosion. The human side, the emotions, the injuries, the recovery and rebuilding. Told through the eyes of normal everyday people. The story is engrossing.I highly recommend this book be read by many. Although I think they should read others on the subject as well to see the entire picture. This book covers the human perspective but not the political or military perspective. A very interesting read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"While some have pointed out that the author's cutting from one story to another makes it difficult to read, this book is a must read regardless.If you want to have some idea the kind of horror experienced by the victims of Hiroshima then this book is it. To my mind despite the horrific injuries sustained by the victims the thing that seems most devastating is the complete incomprehension as to what has happened to them, and what is going on. The survivors are without any infrastructure injured and totally ignorant of what they are going through.All in all a gripping account. The plain facts are laid out and they are compelling."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a very fascinating book written by John Hersey. It is basically a compilation of a variety of stories told by 6 of the survivors or &quot;hikubusha&quot; of the Atomic Bomb dropped on the Japanese city on August 6, 1945.The whole book is written in a very sadistic tone, where many of the character's stories are told on how the each received the initial impact and how they experienced the weeks after the detonation. It also includes many occasions where some of the characters interact with each other, adding to the &quot;plot&quot; of the book.Although the book has no technical &quot;ending&quot; or &quot;climax&quot;, it does contain many deep themes related to the war, such as the reasons the Americans had for using the most devastating attack in the history of warfare."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"On August 6, 1945, in a final attempt to end World War II, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The novel Hiroshima, by John Hersey, tells the story of six survivors of the bombing. The novel demonstrates that, in life there are those who suffer and drown in the pain, and those who suffer but rise to the occasion and show greatness in times of need. The author shows the reader that suffering and struggling for survival or \\"stepping up\\" in a difficult time are two human conditions that are valid both historically and today. Hersey wrote that following the explosion of the bomb, \\"They reported that 78,150 people had been killed, 13,983 were missing, and 37,425 had been injured.\\" (103) Although these statistics seem extremely daunting, this novel doesn't focus on all of the deceased, but focuses on the stories of six of the strong and lucky who survived. For example, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon, was one of the only doctors to survive the tragedy. Without the use of his own glasses, he took care of thousands of victims and didn't sleep for long periods of time so he could assist those who were injured. Similarly, Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, the pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist church, went to a park and brought water to those suffering and transported them to refuge across a river by way of a boat that Tanimoto, himself, took back and forth. His goal was to help as many people as he possibly could. Both men selflessly worked to save the lives of numerous other citizens. Similarly, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was a German priest who tried to help one of the other priests who was dying. While he helped only a single person survive, in the scheme of things, one life can truly make a difference. The other three characters, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, Miss. Toshika Sasaki, and Mrs. Hastuyo Nakamura all struggled to survive and fought through their own intense pain to survive. Mrs. Nakamura did everything possible to save herself and the lives of her children, who she loved dearly. All six characters display the will to survive and to help those in need. Even though the novel focuses primarily on six stories of people who survive, it also gives attention to those who die because they don't have the will or they are helpless and cannot survive grave injuries. Also, it is important to remember that in the case of an atomic bomb, some were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, a man named Mr. Fukai, was being helped away from the fires by Father Kleinsorge, and ran back into the disasters to die because he did not have the will and the power to survive. Also, as Dr. Sasaki was helping patients, all of those hopelessly injured, laid on the ground and just moaned Doctor! Doctor! but could not help themselves. One man was said to have been tearing down his own home because \\"it lay in the path of an air-raid-defense fire lane, when the bomb hit and wrecked it anyway. This is just the case of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence, fate may be more significant than will.Unfortunately, many people were \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\" when the bomb hit Hiroshima, which is why there were so many victims and so few survivors. The six characters who did survived may have been lucky, but they also had the overwhelming desire and will to live. The true hero is someone who rises up in a time of need. In this novel, some of the main characters definitely displayed this type of heroic behavior and were outstanding human beings because of it. One would suggest that those who do not drown in pain but rather fight through it are the ones who make a difference. Today, even though there are few many bombs being dropped, some people still exemplify the will to survive while others suffer and crumble with the pain. The novel, Hiroshima, displays these human conditions beautifully."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, a city in Japan was bombed by the United States in 1945 killing about 100,000 people and leaving many lives and homes damaged. The author of this book John Hersey wrote this book on the bombing of Hiroshima and six people who survived this horrible event. These six people are Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and the Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto. These people had to endure much pain by the loss of many people they knew and the destruction of their city. I really liked the book; it had a big impact on me by realizing that these things can happen and did. Some of the quotes that the people have said were bone chilling about the sounds they heard and the people yelling for help and struggling to survive. The United States was wrong for dropping the bomb because it killed many residents of Hiroshima. If a bomb was drooped on your city, what would you do? In this book it tells you what those six people did and what they did to survive and help others. If a bomb hit my city or town i dont know what I will do or have the courage some of the people did. I dont no if I could survive the terror it will bring. The book probably brought back memories to those six people which were probably sick and sad. The book was great and will be one of my favorites. This book will have a long lasting impact on me and would probably have an impact on you too."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"First of all, I would like to dedicate this little writing to all hibakusha, victims of the atomic bombings on both Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The most important thing I would like to say here is not making a protest like an anti-war campaigner but urging people to understand how the people of Hiroshima died manly in extraordinary serenity.How was it possible when they were dying after experiencing such a hell on earth that is beyond description?A survivor, Mr. Tanimoto wrote to his American friend just before the anniversary: gI never heard any one cried in disorder, even though they suffered in great agony. They died in silence, with no grudge, setting their teeth to bear it. All for the country!hOne of those who died after Mr. Tanimoto gave water in the first night told him: gLook, I lost my home, my family, and at last my-self bitterly injured. But, now I have gotted (sic) my mind to dedicate what I have and to complete the war for our country's sake.h gThus,h Mr. Tanimoto continues, gthey pledged to me, even women and children did the same.hMr. Tanimoto tells in his letter of a school girl and her friends who were buried under heavy fence of a temple after the explosion of the bomb. gThey could not move a bit under such a heavy fence and then smoke entered into even a crack and choked their breath.One of the girls begun to sing \`Kimi ga yo', national anthem, and others followed in chorus and died. Meanwhile one of them found a crack and struggled hard to get out.... They were just 13 years old.hMr. Tanimoto also mentioned Dr. Hiraiwa, professor of Hiroshima University of Literature and Science, who was buried by the bomb under the two storied house with his son, a student of Tokyo University.gBoth of them could not move an inch under tremendously heavy pressure. And the house already caught fire. His son said, \`Father, we can do nothing except make our mind up to consecrate our lives for the country. Let us give Banzai to our Emperor.'Then the father followed after his son, \`Tenno-heika (His Imperial Majesty the Tenno), Banzai, Banzai, Banzai!'In the result, Dr. Hiraiwa said, \`Strange to say, I felt calm and bright and peaceful spirit in my heart, when I chanted Banzai to Tenno.' Afterward his son got out and digged (sic) down and pulled out his father and thus they were saved. In thinking of their experience of that time Dr. Hiraiwa repeated;gWhat a fortunate that we are Japanese! It was my first time I ever tasted such a beautiful spirit when I decided to die for our Emperor.hgYes,h Mr. Tanimoto says, gpeople of Hiroshima died manly in the atomic bombing, believing that it was for Emperor's sake.hAs Hersey says, many hibakusha have repelled by the growing political coloration of these anti-nuclear movements such as the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and have stayed away from the mass meeting s in Peace Park on the subsequent anniversaries.Why? I think it is clear when you see that those anti-nuclea' weapon/ anti-war campaigners are often also of left-wing thoughts such as, particularly, as many comintern sympathisers that still survived in Japan put as their slogan, gAbolish the Tenno system!h, or even gKill the Tenno for the war responsibility!hIf you are a Japanese, you may instinctively know that this greligioush feelings of the Japanese towards Tenno is much more native than foreign communists have thought and has its roots in the depth of the Japanese spiritual culture itself that has been formulated for thousands of years in Japan's history. In Japanese mythology, the Japanese islands and other gods were gbornh from a couple of gods, and those first gods were the ancestor of whole Japanese.So, in other words, the Tenno household is the head family of every household of the Japanese.To prevent misunderstanding, I must say that this is not \\"elitism\\" or emphasis of the uniqueness of the Japanese like the left wingers criticise.On the contrary, it is rather \\"universality\\" of the whole world that the father of all Tenno, or, more adequately, of all Japanese, said: \\"Hakko-Ichiu\\"___ \\"Let us make the whole world one family.\\"That is, I think, one reason why the memorial of the Peace Park in Hiroshima engraved: gPlease rest in peace, for we will never make the same mistakeh, not aggressive and vengeful gRemember Hiroshima!!hTo justify these horrible gcrimes against the humanityh, two experimental and exhibitionistic atomic bombings and 60 other indiscriminate incendiary bombings on civilian population, the U.S.A. needed to brand Japan as the evil criminal country as the Nazi Germany might be.They fabricated numerous horrible crimes that never verified in the Tokyo Trial as the Dutch judge B.V.A. Roling criticized in the book gTokyo Trial and Beyondh so that the Allied Powers, especially the U.S.A. and the Soviet Russia and China, can avert their own war crimes get attention.The 7 year occupation of Japan by the Allied (the U.S.A., mainly) with a brain-washing scheme called gWar Guilt Information Programmeh effectively gdisarmedh the Japanese fighting spirit and by that Japan was so effectively and openly labeled as gFascist/Militarist/Imperialisth country that every Japanese who try to refute those accusations are branded by the whole world as a gultra-right-wing revisionisth.But, Herseyfs book made me realise that, fortunately, the Japanese spirits were never destroyed after all these persecution for half a century. It might have been expelled to a small corner of the bottom of hearts of the Japanese, but surely it has survived.I felt it in my heart. And I believe many Japanese would feel the same when they read this great book of human spirits that never be destroyed even by the most powerful weapons on Earth."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I found this book at a thrift store and thought I would like to read about Hiroshima since my son will be going to that area in April for a 2 year mission.It's just a small book so quite an easy read.The author, John Hersey, traveled to Japan right after the bomb touched down and recorded 6 survivors accounts on what happened to them and around them.Hair loss, open wounds, nausea were the least of the problems many faced. Nearly 100,000 Japanese died from the bomb that the Americans dropped on them in 1945.It was interesting to me to pay attention to my thoughts and feelings about American doing such a tragic thing to another country. It really broke my heart.Hiroshima is not a fast paced book and jumps from survivor to survivor, but a great read if you are interested in the aftermath of an atomic bomb."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I recommend Hiroshima to anyone who likes history and drama. Its an emotional, realistic account of six survivors of the Aotmic bomb, and its effect on their lives. It takes the in depth journey into that day and lets americans feel its true tragedy."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's novel is a steadfast, poignant reminder of the impact of war on civilians. By focusing on a few individuals, Hersey brings home the lingering emotional and physical impact of first atomic bombing better than any subsequent writer on the subject. To this degree his work is an important literary contribution but hardly in the broader historical context. True, Hersey does not attempt to address the ethical issues surrounding Truman's decision to use the bomb and if the author's sole purpose was to intimately engage us with the personal dimensions of the aftermath, he should be lauded. Unfortunately, his work has been usurped by willfully ignorant liberals who are only too eager to assign this book to their dubiously historical archives. As another reviewer noted, no one seems to recall that in a two day period in mid-March, 1945 more civilians were killed in an incendiary raid on Tokyo-Yokohama than in the combined atomic bombings. The point here is not to quibble over casualty rates (human life is hardly a quibbling matter!) but to soberly pose the same question to ourselves that Truman and his advisers faced, namely, what made the bombings necessary? The most succinct response I have read to this question appears in the scholarly book &quot;Truman and the Hiroshima Cult.&quot; I highly recommend it to the genuinely interested and the liberally befuddled. Consider what another reviewer has said: the Japanese were not the victims in this war and Japanese civilians were culpable. As a conservative estimate, the Japanese would have inflicted over 100,000 casualties on American forces in the first month of the Kyushu invasion. Let's stop conveniently villifying Truman and our other government leaders for once and ponder what we would have done if faced with the same enormous decision. Perhaps then we will see Hersey's book in a different, less strident, light."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"In Hiroshima, John Hersey elucidates the entirety of his journalistic work in the introductory paragraph of the piece.It starts by situating the reader in the context: \\"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning on August 6, 1945, Japanese time [...]\\" (1). The use of the word \`exact' is significant - it foreshadows the immense precision with which Hersey reports his factual account of the events that ensue. Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase \`Japanese time' emphasizes the fact that the information is presented from a Japanese perspective; Japanese cultural mores and beliefs are integrated into the text and Hersey acclimates us to this environment by employing it in the first line of the novel.He then depicts what each of six characters is in the act of doing at the moment the atomic bomb was detonated on the city of Hiroshima. This introduces what he writes from page 2 to 16 of the novel, in which he creates scenes to illuminate the lives of Mr. Tanimoto, Mrs. Nakamura, Dr. Fujii, Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki, and Miss Sasaki, respectively, at that specific moment, 8:15 a.m., August 6th, 1945.This is a cocoon of the structure of his book - these characters demarcate the transitions in the text. In the opening paragraph, the persona momentarily shifts the point of view of the narrative to each character. Throughout the novel, the persona repeats this technique to advance the plot.On page 2, there is a conscious shift from the simultaneous snapshot of each of the six characters to a broadened point of view to the hundred thousand people that were killed during the event. The final sentence of the first paragraph is integral to the book: \\"At the time, none of them knew anything.\\" The grammatical construction of this sentence is significant: \`none,' an indefinite pronoun, does not refer to a specific person. It can be either singular or plural, which furthers its obscurity. \`Anything' is another indefinite pronoun. Thus, this statement is imbued with tremendous ambiguity.Furthermore, the antecedent to the objective personal pronoun \`them' is not explicitly stated, and it can refer to the six survivors or it can allude to the one hundred thousand dead that Hersey mentions four sentences previously. This renders the sentence virtually meaningless, yet it is this lack of meaning that Hersey deliberately crafts to encapsulate the utter incomprehensibility that these people, and the population as a whole, feels regarding the issue of this event and its implications for humanity.In the course of Hiroshima, Hersey echoes this statement when he depicts a scene in which Father Kleinsorge visits Miss Sasaki in the hospital and she questions his faith. The persona states, \\"And he went on to explain all the reasons for everything\\" (83). \`All' and \`everything' are indefinite pronouns that ultimately engender a vague sentence. He is referring to abstract ideas that are beyond comprehension. By repeating his structural paradigm of ending a passage with a void statement, he ostensibly creates an analogy to the epigraphical \\"At the time, none of them knew anything.\\""},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I gave Hiroshima 4 stars. I gave it 4 stars because this book uses real characters from the experience of the bombing on Hiroshima in Japan. John Hersey actually interviews these 6 people. Which these 6 people became the main authors of Hiroshima. I also gave it 4 stars because in the book Hersey used very good details to explain what they did during the bomb was dropped."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I recently read the book Hiroshima, By John Hersey, for an L.A. book report and was in some ways very happy about the book and how it was written, and in other ways, not. The story is about the time when America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima (hence the name of the book) Japan. The Book was very informative, giving you five points of veiw, all which are true, and combined them into one whole story. This, However, made the book hard to follow. It (the book) would go for example, by telling the story of Mr. Fujii (one of the people in the book, who was a physician) And in the next paragraph, would all of the sudden start talking about Father Kleinsorge (another person in the book) who, had little to nothing to do with Mr. Fujii. This made the story somewhat hard to follow because I would become interested in one persons story, and then it would change to another person, which was sometimes frusterating. I would have personally much rather have had one ongoing story about one person (maybe two would be fine) That's just my preference. Some people may prefer many different stories. If you're reading this review and thinking, wow, sounds like he hated the book, well, i did! I learned a lot about the war with Japan, and all of that. But if I wouldn't have had to read the book, I definitly would have stopped reading after the second chapter. But who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it. If you like stories about how people help other people to survive, and stories about history, then I think you probably will enjoy this book.

It had to many point of views! BBAADD"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a book with six accounts of survivors of the Hiroshima bombing. The City of Hiroshima, Japan was bombed in World War II by the Americans. The bomb dropped, dropped on August 6, 1945, was one never seen before. It was called an atomic bomb. Besides the obvious damage of the bombings of war, it left long lasting effects like radiation, disease and other direct problems like horrible burns, which turned into Keloids, which are tough, pink pieces of skin on many of the area's residents.The perspective of this book makes the Americans the evil antagonists because they made so many people suffer for so long. The Americans had almost no feedback as far as suffering goes after they dropped this bomb. The Japanese are shown as the protagonists. It makes it look like they didn't do anything and the Americans were just bombing them, then for no reason they were forced to suffer even until today. I feel before the accounts start to be told, the author, John Hersey, should have given some background on the reasons for the bombings and World War 2.The six accounts in this book are of two doctors, Dr. Fujii and Dr. Sasaki, two religious leaders, Father Kliensorge and Reverend Tanimoto, and two women. The first woman is a personnel clerk in the East Asia tin works named Miss Toshinki Sasaki and the second, a widow named Mrs. Nakamura. The majority of the story takes place in Hiroshima but there is quite a lot of reference to Tokyo and the United States.This book goes very in depth with what the people were doing before, during and after the bomb was dropped. You really learn a lot about the character personalities through how they handled the problems after the explosion. I also learned a lot about Japanese culture through reading this book. Hiroshima shows how every aspect of life is affected when something like this happens. Almost every single building was knocked down or damaged beyond repair. Every single person in this book has to overcome many changes. The way these people handle the changes is what the book is mostly about.Towards the close of the book, the most important thing is relationships. This book is amazing because it recounts things that actually happened. People had to overcome the problems and restart their entire lives including a home, a job, a family and friends along with dealing with their state of grief and loss of family. The most amazing thing I read was when Mr. Tanimoto offered forgiveness and asked the same god to bless every member while taking part in the United States Senate.The only thing I didn't really like about this book is the way it was put together. It was a little hard to understand because what happened to all the people were put in sections. The book is set up with what all six people were doing before the bomb. The it is what all six people did immediately after the bomb and then what all six people did for the rest of their lives. It would have been much easier to read and understand if it was set up with the entire account of the first person from before the bomb until death. Then it would go to the entire account of the next person from before the bomb until death and so on, perhaps like separate short stories.This book reminds me a lot of a book titled Hatchet written by Gary Paulsen. It is about survival in the wilderness instead of society like in Hiroshima. What happens is the character in Hatchet is in a plane crash, which is an accident and he is forced to survive in whatever way possible. This is similar to Hiroshima because there is an incident, which is the bomb, and then every survivor is forced to survive any way possible. Then, finally in Hatchet there is a plane that flies overhead and rescues him just like society raised money in Hiroshima and rescued the economy and the survivors."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Though this is a very small book for what happened (156 pages) this is a great book. The book Hiroshima tells what the bomb \\"Little Boy\\" did to Hiroshima and the struggle six people had to go thru to survive. Yes, more than six people did survive, but this book highlights six regular people. One woman became a cripple because she did not get the proper medical care in time to save her leg from healing wrong. A Jesuit was reading a Jesuit magazine and turned away from the window and that saved him, a doctor was going up a staircase with blood for a blood test and his position in the staircase saved his life, almost everyone above and below him was killed. In my opinion you should read this book if you don't mind \\"graphic\\" explanation of death.I would recommend this book to people who like things having to do about World War II. I think that this book is very interesting as well as informative. The one problem with this book is that it has very \\"graphic\\" explanations of many peoples death and how they are missing limbs (such as arms, legs, breasts). I personal got a little grossed out but the descriptions of the six people surviving the \\"Little Boy\\". But the interesting thing this book points out is what happens in a bomb like the one dropped on Hiroshima. If you are close enough your eyes melt in their sockets. You can get horrible flash burns, and if people touch you your skin comes off like a glove.In conclusion, this book is a wonderful book. Yes, there is some graphic evidence and explanations in this book. Hiroshima gives wonderful information and explanations of what happens if an atom bomb was dropped as I was writing this. I know that people would be interested in this book. Even if you don't like \\"graphic\\" explanations I think that you should read this book. In my opinion people should read this book if they are into WWII things and really don't mind getting a little grossed out."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"\\"Hiroshima,\\" by John Hersey, is a compact (152 pages) but powerful book. Hersey tells the story of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and of the aftermath of this act. The subtitle on the book's title page notes that this is a new edition whose final chapter was written 40 years after the fateful blast. The copyright page further explains that an earlier version of the book was published by Knopf in 1946, and that the new edition was originally published by Knopf in 1985.Hersey's narrative focuses on the experiences of six people: (1) Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk; (2) Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician who runs a private hospital; (3) Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor's widow; (4) Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest; (5) Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon; and (6) the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a clergyman.The first four chapters follow these people and their associates immediately after the bombing, up to a year later. The final chapter follows them up into the 1980s. This is a gripping narrative, written in a sober, straightforward style that I found devastatingly effective.Hersey includes graphic and disturbing details as he discusses the horrific wounds and ailments suffered by the survivors. Particularly interesting is his description of how the bombing survivors, or \\"hibakushu,\\" were a distinct group who faced unique prejudice and challenges, and had to fight for just treatment.The \\"About the Author\\" section at the end of the book notes that author Hersey taught at Yale for two decades and is a past Chancellor of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His description of Hiroshima in the days after the bombing is a powerful portrait of a city gripped by fear and uncertainty. Also significant are the stories of the paths taken by the survivors in the decades following the blast; I was particularly intrigued by one survivor's odyssey through the United States. \\"Hiroshima\\" is noteworthy work of American literature, and a reminder of the real human cost of war."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima dutifully records the prelude and aftermath of the world's first atomic bomb attack, capturing not only the stories and perceptions of the five individuals interviewed after the attack but also the details of how both the people and the city were transformed by the bomb. The accounts of the effects of radiation and nuclear weapons were groundbreaking when they were published, as concepts such as radiation sickness were new to most of the world. This book is essential for understanding the history of warfare."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"My name is Steve and I go to St. Pius School in Lombard Illinois, and i had to read Hiroshima for a literature class. This book is a diffacult read, but it is very enjoyable. The story starts off in Hiroshima when the bomb drops. Hersey writes about six people in the town when the bomb dropped and follows what they do through the entire book. I liked the idea of starting off the book with a big event. Most books lead up to the climax, but Hersey decided to take a chance and make the climax right at the beginning. I think that the chance he took made the book very enjoyable. This book is very descriptive and Hersy is does not leave very much to the imagination. Another thing about the book is that it is sort of divided into two sections: when the bomb dropped and all of the events that followed, and fifty years later. I thought that this idea was very neat. Also what made the book even better was that all the characters were real and Hersy tracked down their lives for fifty years just to write this book. The only down-side to the book was that it was a rather challenging book. Many times I had to re-read many paragraphs. Besides that I really enjoyed the book and I hope that you will to!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"After reading this book I was forced to rexamine every thing my governemnts done that I've taken for granted was done from a moral high ground. Was I ever a fool. I might recommend another book, Arabs&amp;Israel for Beginners by Ron David for those to who the truth matters."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Pulitzer prize-winning author John Hersey, was born in Tientsin in 1914. He attended Yale and Cambridge Universities. He is also the past president of the Author's League of America and the past Chancellor of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is married and has five children and three grandchildren. In 1946, his novel HIROSHIMA was published. It is a record of the experiences of six survivors, where they were when the bomb hit, what the immediate effects were, and what the permanent effects were. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, not many could have anticipated its potential for devastation. The words of Miss Sasaki, Dr. Fujii, Mrs. Nakamura, Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki, and the Reverend Tanimoto gave a face to the statistics that filled the media and brought upon an overwhelming public response. Whether you believe the bomb made the difference in the war or that it should never have been dropped, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; is a great novel that describes the shadow of armed conflict. Hersey goes into great detail describing how quickly the bomb hit, with no warning or anything of that nature. Like, Miss Sasaki was just turning her head to speak to a fellow co-worker when she was struck out of her desk and pinned in by a bookshelf. He describes the mangled limbs and bodies, and the smells of dead carcasses. Then, to bring more shock and revulsion, he returns to bring the condition of these pitiful souls forty years later. HIROSHIMA is great for anyone who believes that \\"The Japanese had it coming\\", or that America was completely in the right to get an equivalent view of the matter. It is also great for anyone who doesn't concur with the American decision to bomb Japan. It is an exceptional novel for anyone of any age, and I vastly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"When &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was published in &quot;The... ..... &quot; magazine in 1946 this caused a great stire. The BBC read the whole book out loud on it's broadcast. You can read about this and other events that transpired in Ben Yagoda's &quot;About Town: The New Yorker and the World it Made&quot;.This book must have been the ultimate journalistic scoop of all times. It's story idea is so obvious that I wondered why no else had the idea first. Hersey traveled to Japan just one year after the end of the war and after the atomic bomb has blasted over Hiroshima. The ground must have been still radioactive. (In the book Hersey said that the ground was only 4 times normal radiation levels a few days after the explosion. So Japanese scienists allowed the citizens to remain there.)This book, like Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, is part of The New Yorker genre called &quot;non-fiction novel&quot;. They didn't really invent the technique but popularized it's style. This is journalism written in the style of a novel that relates a true tale. Well done, as in the case with both of these books, it holds your attention.I find this book well-written and obviously interesting. (No could make such a tale boring.) But I think &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;The Massacre of El Mozote&quot;, published as a long fact piece in The New Yorker are better written. This is in spite of the heavy editing by William Shawn and many rewrites by John Hersey.In the book we get to see what it was like for the people of Hiroshima to have lived under an atomic bomb blast. The scenes are quite horrible. A firestorm burns people in it's path. The bomb's flash of light etches the frozen picture of a painter on a ladder on a marble wall. A women cling to her dead baby for days on end. Men and women cry out for help buried beneath piles of concrete and timbers. 100,000 people are killed outright and 80% of the building in the city are destroyed.As Ben Yagoda says, this book put a human face on the atomic bomb. It probably did a lot to rally anti-bomb people. I for one am glad for this portrait because it makes clear and vivid what would happen to us if someone dropped such a weapon here."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"First read this when I was a kid, it had a serious impact on me in high school; really brought home the aftermath of the war. My family lost nearly everything in the Colorado wildfires in 2012, I felt a strong need to find a replacement. This book has straightforward, simple, lean written accounts from the people who experienced the bombing in Japan. The image of the women walking down the road, their skin hanging of them like the folds of their kimonos, and imprinted with the patterns of the clothes they'd been wearing...indelible."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Widely considered a masterpiece, this book was published as the entire edition of The New Yorker before it was released in book form, and it won a major poll as the most important piece of journalism in the 20th century. It is not hard to see why once you begin reading it. Hersey's piece is a careful, realistic description of what is actually involved in experiencing and surviving an atomic blast, told from the viewpoints of several real people who did just that: a young Japanese office worker, Toshiko Sasaki; a Japanese minister, Rev. Tanimoto; a German priest, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge; a successful physician, Dr. Fujii; a young surgeon, Dr. Sasaki and one or two others. None of them were involved in the war effort - they were simply going about their business one August morning in Hiroshima when their worlds were completely, and for the most part permanently, turned upside down.Hersey describes in matter-of-fact fashion scenes that I had never heard of before, that I had perhaps only caught glimpses of in the most frightening, bizarre films or nightmares. The silent, blinding flash, the sudden darkness, the strong winds, the falling particles - and later, the suffering of the dying, gathered together in hellish assemblages, and the clear-eyed observations of those fortunate enough to have survived sudden death and serious injury. They were not, in most cases, fortunate enough to avoid the ongoing miseries of radiation sickness, with its myriad symptoms and effects, and a large part of the book is spent exploring this topic.The author practices a more discreet form of nonfiction writing than one customarily sees today; he is more the invisible observer and the communicator of information than a character in the text. He seems to have a lot of respect for his subjects, and he portrays them compassionately and directly, without engaging in much criticism or analysis. We witness these people in the days after the bomb, and we learn how they were able to survive, but we are also shown the sometimes long and difficult roads they travelled back to ordinary living - and then later on (the book was updated in 1985) we see them as older people. The young doctor, after working heroically following the bomb, eventually becomes a successful older doctor, with a family and a number of interests. The German priest takes a Japanese name and develops a close relationships with one of the other survivors described in the book; she helps nurse him through his many radiation-related health problems. The young minister gets involved with the famous American activist Dr. Norman Cousins, and becomes a leader of the survivors movement, before falling out with some of his fellow hibakusha (bomb-afflicted). The young woman eventually becomes a nun, and the successful manager of a spiritual community.There were times when I was less than excited by Hershey's writing style, but I was never less than enthralled by his reportage or the great significance of the events set out in this book. \\"Hiroshima\\" is part of the curriculum of some schools, but that is not enough - it should be required reading for everyone, especially for those who think the threat of nuclear war and proliferation is something that can be easily ignored."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The author's intent in writing this book is to give an accurate report of a forgotten battle. The battle in question was of a \\"peacekeeping\\" nature and was the longest sustained firefight since Vietnam. It took place in Mogadishu, Somalia after a failed raid to capture a warlord in the way of \\"peacekeeping.\\" It happened only a few short years ago, but has already slipped from the public eye. The intent of the author is to shed new light on the battle of Mogadishu and bring it back into the public eye. He also intends to question America's military credibility and the values of the supposed \\"peacekeeping\\" missions. He intends to make the reader question the value of sending troops into areas of civil unrest strictly to establish order. What usually results is a bloody conflict taking many lives and injuring multiple people. Is it right for America to continually do this? Is it necessary? Has it done any good? Is it sheer arrogance to think that the United States can bring peace to the world? Is it futile to try? Can democracy and government be forced on to an unwilling people? Were the lives lost completely unnecessary? Did the men who died sacrifice their lives for nothing? The author's intent is not to answer these questions for us, but to make sure they are being asked. To summarize all of this, the author's intent in writing this book is to give an accurate account of modern war while bringing a forgotten battle into the public eye and provoking thoughtful inquiries into the merits of peacekeeping actions from the reader. The author goes about his task by giving an accurate account of the events before, during, and after the battle between the U.S. military and the people of Mogadishu after a failed raid to capture their leader. We are invited to view these events though various accounts of what people are experiencing. Sometimes one event is told many times, at different angles. We experience what the individuals are experiencing, both physically and mentally. If a soldier is shot we are not just told that he was shot. We are told where the bullet entered, what damage it did and where it exited along with what the person was thinking before, after and during being shot. We are drawn directly into the minds of the soldiers. We are told why they fight, how they fight, what they are thinking, who their families are, their favorite things to do at the base, their personality, their goals for the future and much more. There is an extreme amount of detail. The reader feels as though they really know and understand the people in the book. There is no main character or clear enemy. There is no good or bad side. This is an account of what happened, from all points of view, including those fighting against U.S. soldiers. Although sometimes gruesome, the violence is completely necessary. It is not glorified and it is not accepted as necessary. It is simply shown and deciding the merits of it is left to the reader. The brutality of war and it's effect on the human mind make the reader not only question the necessity of the situation, but the value of armed conflicts altogether. Along with the frequent third person individual perspectives and questioning of the morals of war is the occasional description of military life. These semi-flashbacks give the reader a greater understanding as to how and why the soldiers think and react the way they do. Before each chapter is a map or pictures that give the reader a vague idea of where the events are taking place and what things look like.. The combination of pictures, maps, flashbacks and frequently switching individual accounts takes the reader to the crowded streets of Mogadishu, where all hell is breaking loose. This can all be called an omniscient minute by minute narrative that the author uses to accomplish his task. This book is a success. It is easily read and entertaining while being factual and true to its task of war reporting. It is gripping and spellbinding and I could not put it down. I found myself easily relating to the men in the battle and their resulting emotions. The harsh imagery made me feel as though I was in the battle myself. I was drawn into the book. The author accomplishes his task of accurately explaining modern warfare and not letting us forget the events in Somalia that took place only a few years ago, yet most people do not remember. Those who read this book will always remember. I was persuaded of nothing that I did not find entirely by myself. The author never tried to persuade the reader of anything more than that the events actually happened. However, the book actually persuaded me that the conflict was unnecessary and did no good. The tribal system of Somalia was not equal to all and cannot be replaced by force. The book made me angry at the futility of the struggle and the unnecessary massive loss of life. These events did not have to happen. They did no good. The author never tried to persuade me of this, but accomplished it indirectly. What other conclusion can be drawn from the facts? This indeed was a book that needed to be written. America is not invincible and is not always right. It was a bad decision to send troops to Somalia. The men who died did not die for a good reason. Their self-sacrifice accomplished nothing. Read this book. This book makes you question which side is right. This book makes you question the morals of war. This book makes you question the arrogance of the United States of America. This book makes you turn away in disgust at the depths that humanity descends to. This book is a shocking account of a futile battle that will never be won. This book needs to be read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Although this book progressed quite slow at times (and at others, the reader was overwhelmed with seemingly meaningless facts) the writing and research obviously took Hersey time. He invested that time well, as the final product shows. This alone saves this book from a lower rating because of the slowness and overwhelming facts."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hersey, is about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened to six people before and after the explosion. Their names are Miss. Toshiko Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki and the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto. Hiroshima is a very graphic book with sickening descriptions. I think that some of these descriptions were as graphic as the ones in The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston. \\"Pus oozed out of her wound, and soon the whole pillow was covered with it.\\"(Pg.81) is just one of the many gory descriptions from Hiroshima.I thought that Hiroshima had its ups and downs. For one, the book was very confusing because there were lots of people and the story kept switching from on person to another. I found myself lost in a a sea of words at times because of this. That was the main bad facet of the book. On the other hand, I thought the book was good because when you did understand what was happening, you felt as if you were actually there because the descriptions in Hiroshima were so vivid. Also, I like the book because it showed you what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and what could happen if a nuclear war broke out. Overall, I though Hiroshima was a good book.

The story is a clear and compelling report from the lens of several victims.

The most interesting part of the book is the story of Dr. Sasaki as he tries to help the people in the overrun hospital after his normally long shift.

It is easy for the reader to recoil in horror by the total devastation of Hiroshima. It also questions one to ask why we need an atomic bomb, or atomic warfare, when things could be settled diplomatically if given a chance.

The book was written in a simple, straight-forward manner, which makes it easier to understand."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book Hiroshima, written by John Hersey, is a great book to read. The book gives a magnificent portrayal of the struggles that the people of Hiroshima went through after the bombing by the Americans during World War II. The constantly changing point of view, in each section of the five chapters, might be confusing, but it keeps the book moving at a steady pace and makes the reader want to find out what will happen next to each person. The different stories of each suvivor shows how ever person, no matteer if they were rich or poor, young or old, helped as many people as they could, no matter if they were friends or not. Also, the book gives a feeling of almost being there with the people and feeling their pain and suffering from burns, cuts, and anything else that happened to them. The book also shows the people's fear of another attack on the city by the Americans. The changing of characters adds depth to the story, by adding to the main plot. These additions help explain what happened to them during and after the dropping of the atomic bomb. The styles, way of life, and fears that people had during the late 1940's and early 1950's is also greatly displayed within the entire book. The main focus, in some cases, is not the dropping of the atomic bomb, but rather the people coming togther for one cause and dealing with the tragedy of losing loved ones and how they will rebuild there city. Each character also changesin different ways after the horrific events of World War II and the bombing. If I had to recommend a book to a person thats likes World War II history or someone that just likes to read it would definitely be this book. It would be this book cause of the time it took to write and the readability of the book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I recently read two very frightening things.The second was an article in \\"Newsweek\\" about Iran's quest to develop their own nuclear weapons.The first was this.This book is a fast-moving, concise collection of the stories of a handful of the survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. The survivors are male and female, Japanese and German, young and old, and their stories--sure to make you think twice about your next nuke joke--illustrate just how it felt, just how it was, to be THERE, of all places, when the most powerful bomb ever detonated went off above their city.Without ever becoming high-handed, preachy, overly sentimental, and without ever resorting to appealing solely to emotion, John Hershey has presented here the horrors of what happens when an atomic bomb goes off.His book is relentlessly objective, consistently pasing up opportunities to editorialize in favor of chances to tell it how it really was. He downplays the politics of the situation to focus on the physical suffering of the real, live human beings involved. He tells of those who had their eyes scorched out of their sockets by staring at the blast, of small sores on people's skin that just wouldn't go away and then flowered into grisly red blooms, of skin sliding off muscle, of radiation sickness, of children wandering orphaned and wounded. He puts a human face on the war's cold logistics without ever saying if he thinks what America did was right or wrong.He just says, in essence, \\"Regardless of why we did it, or what it accomplished, maybe there was a better way to go about it.\\" He just asks, in a way, \\"Was it worth the atomic legacy? Was it worth the fears we have today? Was it worth that article in 'Newsweek'?\\""},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This is a wonderful book that is very informal as well as interesting! Much reccommended read!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"In 1946, barely a year after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, August 6 & 9, 1945, John Hersey wrote an important little booklet about the effects of the bomb upon the lives of six Hiroshima residents who survived the blast. Updated several times over the next 40 years, Hersey follows the lives of these six. \\"Hiroshima\\" is at once a story of the moments just before and just after the tragic event, the effect of the blast upon the city and its residents, the courage, heroism and sacrifices of the survivors as they struggled to understand what had happened and their heroic rescue of other survivors. In this Hersey succeeds admirably. In the process, \\"Hiroshima\\" provides a snapshot of Japanese lifestyle and manners. Much of it written in the phraseology of the Japanese themselves, Hersey describes a lifetime of recurring medical and psychological problems. Played against the backdrop of initial resentment of Americans for dropping the bomb, Hersey also describes how the Japanese themselves came to understand the responsibility of their own military leaders in starting the war that resulted in the destruction of their city, as well as the role of religion, Japanese as well as Christianity in dealing with the humanitarian issues. \\"Hiroshima\\" is a cautionary tale of war and of man's inhumanity to man, without attempting to overly blame any single individual or group. Short, to the point, interesting, not easy to read (due to its subject), and not easy to dismiss, this small volume should be required reading for anyone interested in understanding the impact our decisions make on others, and how it effects them for the remainder of their lives. For a specifically detailed and more thorough study of the effects of the atom bomb itself, one would need to find a longer and more modern book. This books value is in its humanity, which is, after all, what the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki teach us. Highly recommended. (Note: This reviewer read the 1989 Vintage Press version. Other reviews are also found under other printings.)"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"HIroshima is an equsite book. It details 6 survivors of the Atom Bomb at the end of World War Two. The book outlines these survivors' lives and how they helped their fellow men. The story shows a great deal of humanity, and how even when all seems lost there is still hope in the world. I recomend this book for Teenagers and above due to the fact of some graphic details of the injuries resulting from the Bomb. Hersey is a great author!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This timeless classic about the first hand account of the dropping of &quot;the bomb&quot; on Hiroshima.

And even if you were alive, it is impossible to relate to the pain and suffering that residents of Hiroshima faced during and after their city was bombed. John Hersey's journalistic account takes us into the lives of 6 people who were unlucky enough to have been there. The writing is graphic, depressing, and unflinchingly honest. It will leave you stunned. And, hopefully, it will leave you wanting to do your bit to make sure nothing like it never happens again."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hershey, is a great reading experience. The tales of the six survivors of the A-Bomb weave an interesting and thrilling story of what nuclear warfare is like. The discriptions in the book are vivid and thought provoking, giving a graphic, yet accurate depiction of the bombing. I believed the book was an interesting aproach to the horrors of WWII."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's account of the aftermath of the first atomic bomb stands as a warning for all time. The vivid and sickening first person accounts should cause any reader to question whether resorting to nuclear force is ever justified. In my mind, the bombs dropped on Japan WERE justified because of Japanese war atrocities, the tremendous casualties the allies would have suffered from an invasion of the Japanese home islands and because before the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, no one knew for sure what it would do. The horror of Hiroshima and Nakasaki is partly responsible, I think, for the fact that no atomic weapons have been used in warfare since then. The images in this book will stay with you long after you've put it down."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is good book, but confusing and a dry reading. The way in which Mr. Hersey presents the actual horrors of the atomic bomb are both compelling and heart wrenching. One instance that stands out as a moment of horror, is when the heat of the bomb etches flowers and designs from the clothing of women on their skin. The only problem with this book is the way in which Mr. Hersey organizes the information. The reader follows people who are in Hiroshima on the day of the bomb, and how the bomb affects the rest of their lives. The only problem with this is Mr. Hersey drops a character, then picks him or her up again several chapters later. This forces the reader to try and remember all the details that were previously stated. Hiroshima by John Hersey is a valiant effort to retell the horrors of Hiroshima, but in the end gets too caught up in recounting the actual tales."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The times and trials of the people who survived the dropping of the bomb are vividly told in John Hersey's Hiroshima. The graphic detail, as told by the six eyewitnesses, really pulls you into Hiroshima, Japan, the day the bomb was dropped. It has amazing detail, and shows the horrors of the atomic bomb. If any person ever wants to know what the day to day life of the people in Hiroshima was before and after the dropping of the bomb, this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you just want to learn about the death and destruction of the atomic bomb dropped by the Americans, this book is very detailed. Although the book shows a lot of destruction and death, it is an easy and good read."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"this book lays it on the line - the horror of what the atomic bomb was like from the perspective of several different residents of hiroshima...who were there on august 6, 1945. it's a clear, well-written (though DRY) account of that horrible day, and if there's any book that's going to make you against nuclear weapons this is it.what shocks me is that people (some who even read this book!) still think dropping this bomb (not to mention the one on nagasaki) was worth it. granted, there can be a million arguments justifying it, about how it saved lives, and how the japanese committed horrible atrocities too, etc., but just seeing the pure horror this bomb inflicted (through the eyes of these characters) is enough to make me say &quot;no way - going to this degree of horror cannot be justified.&quot;and to all you who still want to argue that dropping this bomb had its merits...and that creating even more destructive nuclear bombs has its merits...well...well...i feel sorry for you. because horror is horror, and when it comes to weapons of mass destruction we are all innocent. no one deserves that."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"While there are many tragedies in war and innocent civilians are tortured and killed this book attempts to ignore everything except the utter destruction of the atomic bomb.The Japanese attacked the US at pearl harbor without a declaration of war. The war had been raging for 4 years. Americans were getting telegrams daily about family members killed in action.The battle for Okinawa had just been fought and there were very heavy casualties on both sides. The Japanese had declared ALL civilians were to be part of the war effort and there would be no surrender. The plans for the invasion of the Japanese mainland were underway and it was estimated that at least 1 mil americans and 4 mil japanese would be killed and wounded.The devastation of the bomb on Hiroshima was devastating. But the war lords refused to surrender despite the devastation.It was necessary to drop a second bomb on Nagasaki and even then the warlords refused to surrender. The Emperor then stepped in and declared that Japan would surrender.The book documents the effects of the bomb and the devastation well but gives a false sense of the absolute necessity of dropping the bomb to bring this horrible war to a conclusion.Remember almost every home had a family member or more in the military. People were tired of the war and wanted it over. The bomb was a blessing for both sides. The war was at last over. It is a good description of the horrors of the bomb, but doesn't put the dropping of it into context."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I'd known Paul Tibbets (pilot of the \\"Silverplate\\" B-29 ENOLA GAY and commander of the 509th CBG) for years while he was alive. I've also known Dutch Van Kirk, navigator of the \\"Silverplate\\" B-29 ENOLA GAY. This was one of the first WW2 military history (and aviation history) books I'd ever read, which happened to have been back in 1966, when I was 12. I'd never thought of it this way, but the men I knew in the 509th CBG always told me that they felt Hersey had portrayed them as militarists, rather than who they really were. Who they really were, were normal, patriotic Americans, doing whatever they could to help bring an end to all the pain and suffering of WW2."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book is very emotional, saddening and agonizing book about one of the worst chapeters in our history. This book opened my eyes to the hings that went on in Hiroshima at the time of atomic bombing. \\"hiroshima\\" tells the lives of six men and women who survived from A-bomb and concludes how the people were affected and how devastating the bombing was.If I did not read this book I would still see the A-bomb on hiroshima as just a terrible thing happened and would still only see it through the pictures in our history textbook.

Had to buy for a class, so no personal feelings about it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"\\"Hiroshima\\" first appeared in the New Yorker in 1946, only a year after the U.S. dropped two atom bombs on Japan. It's a remarkable piece of journalism: it tells the story of Hiroshima's destruction through the experiences of five ordinary Japanese and a German priest who lived through the bombing and its aftermath. The writing is spare and factual, and the author lets the horror speak for itself, without sentimentality or editorializing. It's powerful.That's why \\"Hiroshima\\" has been in print for 65 years. My junior high and high school libraries had many copies of it. That was a smart move by the librarians, who knew that young people would benefit from reading a short, thoughtful book on nuclear war. Maybe \\"Hiroshima\\" even helped to keep the peace during the Cold War, by alerting readers to the risk of nuclear annihilation. I don't know why I waited until I was 54 to read it. Better late than never.The Amazon reviewers who fault \\"Hiroshima\\" for not giving the reasons why Truman dropped the bomb are missing the point of the book. The author engages in no polemics either for or against the bombings; he does not discuss any of the military and diplomatic events surrounding the surrender of Japan. He simply reports the truth about Hiroshima and helps us visualize the human consequences of the decision to destroy it. That knowledge surely expands our imagination and improves our capacity for moral and political decision-making in the nuclear age. Or do conservative \\"patriots\\" think that we shouldn't own the consequences of our decisions?"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The same classic almost everyone has read, except the person I bought it as a gift for. I'm sure he will feel the same."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"A non-biased look at six survivors of the atomic weapon dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The book tells the story of these six survivors from the moments before the bomb, to the lives they had many years later. Probably the best and most well known first person perspective book on the subject."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book comes from the angle of the six people personally effected by the bombing of Hiroshima. I have only ever learned about this event from the view of America, as the people who dropped the bomb, so I only learned why we dropped the bomb and general statistics. This book was a great change-up and very eye-opening concerning the reality of the bombing. I would recommend this book to all readers, as it is an important event in history and this book provides the story from a survivor's perspective."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The quality was good and the service was good too on the order. This was a gift for a cancer patient and she enjoyed it immensly. Thanks."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I find it disturbing that the only nation to ever use a nuclear weapon on another is the US against Japan during WWII. In this book Hersey tells the stories of six individuals who were in Hiroshima when the bomb was dropped. He tells their stories and what they went through during this time. The book is very good, but horrifying, I've never read anything before about what actually happens when an atomic bomb is dropped, the people in this book survived but there are stories about the doctor trying to help people onto a boat only to have their skin slide off, peoples eyes just disintegrate, there are both short term and long term side effects of the radiation poisoning, a hundred thousand people instantly dead, I could go on and on. Really the whole thing sounds almost too crazy to be true, only to know that it did happen. The scariest part is the fact that this atomic bomb is relatively weak compared to the ones we have now days. I truly hope that we'll never see another atomic bomb dropped on another nation. In any case this book is great."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Reading this years ago sent shivers down my spine as I was trying to put myself in the shoes of the bomb victims. My mind just can't grasp what those people went through. Highly recommend this book. Wish I could give it more stars."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"How can anyone not be moved and affected by this book?

Breathtaking, not easy to get through, unforgettable."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Brilliant! When the A-bomb fell on Hiroshima the effects were devastating on so many levels. Hershey gives us an indepth analysis of the human toll of the atomic attack. This serves to remind us of the human sacrifice that was necessary to bring WW2 to an end and of course-the power that is locked up inside the atom. You might also enjoyAtomic Power: Necessary Evil or Virtually Uncontrollable Force that's Wrecking the Planet?which also reviews the damage done by radiation in the short term but more importantly-the curse of long term exposure to low level radiation."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"One moment from the book that caught in my memory is what happens to Mr. Tanimoto when the bomb dropped. Mr. Tanimoto and a a friend were walking to a house to drop off perishables from their church and when they arrived the bomb was dropped. Mr. Tanimoto remembered that there was a flash of light across the sky and he threw himself between two large boulders in the garden. When he raised himself from the ground he saw that the house had collapsed with his friend inside of it. He was thankful that he hadn't dived into the entryway like his unfortunate friend. He walked away from the house thinking that the bomb must have dropped right on top of it because of the destruction caused. Hiroshima is an accurate story of the tales of six survivors but it is a completely dull read. It starts to be captivating, but when Hersey changes abruptly to another character it becomes confusing and tests your memory too much."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, by John Hersey, deserves a high four for its intriguing story. The book is very interesting as it tells the story of six survivors of the bombing. His facts are realistic and his descriptions are very thorough and comprehensive. The book is very pleasing and a great read for anyone who is interested about the bombing of Hiroshima."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"One of the most compelling elements in John Hersey's Hiroshima is the great detail of the book. The descriptions make you feel as if you are there experiencing the horror of the bombing. Dr. Sasaki, a survivor of the bombing, works at a hospital and has to receive many people who suffered injuries during the days after the bombing. This is a moment that I will always remember, along with the five other stories of the survivors."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's book, Hiroshima, gives a vivid depiction of the bombing on the civilians of the Japanese city in the first use of the atomic bomb. The story is told through the perspective of six survivors of the bombing, in the time just before the bombing and how they carried on with their lives afterwards. From the descriptions of the silent, blinding light to the idea that they only survived because of specific choices they made during the day, it gives the reader a real sense of what it was like to be in the city at the time."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima demonstrates the reality and the horror in the aftermath of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This compelling story leads the reader through the story of six peope facing the tragedy of the bomb. The reality and the awareness of cruelty combine to make an excellent, well written story of some survivors of the atomic bomb. Anyone interested in World War II should read this book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"While Hiroshima was interesting, it was not as exciting or suspenseful as a fictional story might be. It was, however, a compelling story that helped give a better view into what happened on the fateful day when Hiroshima was bombed, and it did hold my interest. While it was somewhat graphic, I was at times enthusiastic to get back and read more. It was a fascinating account of the bare truth. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Much has been written and taught on the ethics of using atomic weaponry on Hiroshima as well as the justifications for doing so. Hersey covers what we WEREN'T taught...the perspectives of those most affected by the atomic bomb and the extremely detailed horrors that they experienced. This book, in and of itself, is not enough information to comprise the entire history lesson on Hiroshima. It is, however, an excellent supplement to history lessons as an account of the true effects of atomic weaponry as viewed by the people who are most qualified to tell the story...the hibakusha."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"HIROSHIMA by John Hersey was historical and educational, but I had no emotions for the situations or characters for some reason, and c'mon- that's what gets people drawn. The only situations that got me stirred up were the many gruesome ones. If you do read it, read it for pleasure. Not for a class that will force you to destroy the story's mood by writing notes. Try this book though, it DOES show the strong effects the A-bomb did and the reactions and destruction the helpless city of Hiroshima faced."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"It was a great book. It tells what actually happened on the day the bomb was dropped and it is told through the memories of six survivors. Some parts of the book were a little too vivid, but I like that part. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hershey makes you feel like you're one of the survivors. He really brings out the Nakamura's story and Dr.Saski's struggle. Thought he did not write much about Ms.Sasaki, it still came out great."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Published in 1946, this remarkable article or book was based on interviews with survivors of the first city to be destroyed by a single weapon. John Hersey was a war correspondent during World War II. His \\"Hiroshima\\" has been rated as number one in The Top Ten Works of Journalism in the United States in the 20th Century, as determined by The New York University journalism faculty and a panel of critics that included David Brinkley and Morley Safer. \\"Hiroshima\\" took over the entire August 30, 1946 issue of \\"The New Yorker\\" and the issue sold out within hours. After reading this rather slim book, I can understand why. It relates the stories of six survivors in a very interesting and readable way. Hersey makes us feel the impact of the bomb and its horrors in a very personal way, yet he doesn't go overboard on the gore. There is a follow-up study almost 40 years later, and we visit these same characters again. Surprisingly, none of the six hated the U.S.; they understood that drastic measures were neeeded to end a war that the Japanese obsessively fought; throwing reason out the window. The book can be read in an evening, but you will want to reread it, as well."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Journalist John Hersey (1914-1993) wrote this book through interviews with six surviving Japanese civilians only months after the bomb was dropped in August of 1945. His highly readable prose is both unforgettable and compelling. Hersey arrived in Japan and wrote this narrative shortly after the war ended, before we realized the frightful cancers and birth deformities that resulted from high exposure to radiation. But we do see the horrific suffering and confusion of those who were there, some blinded, others badly burned, many with their skin peeling off in their hands. This compelling book is not for the faint-of-heart, but it illustrates the affects of the bomb on those who were there.Some readers correctly point out that Japan's army had raped and murdered its way through Asia, and that the bomb may have ultimately shortened the war and saved lives by forestalling a U.S. invasion of Japan's home islands. Still, this is a frightful and moving account seen through the eyes of those who suffered the most."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This is a great book. John Hersey follows six survivors of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima, using their experiences as a microcosm for the whole event. Rarely does he stray into scientific or historical background; neither is his approach political. He writes in spare, matter-of-fact language, so he cannot be accused of sentimentality or manipulation. He simply shows us what happened. By giving us an account of the lives of ordinary Japanese ruined by the atomic bomb, Hersey takes away our ability to see them simply as \\"the enemy.\\" I think this book makes a compelling case that, even in war, some options should be off the table. And it does so without ever sounding like an editorial, or indeed, making us aware of the writer at all. \\"Hiroshima\\" is an achievement on both an ethical and literary level."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"With all the diverse happenings of World War Two only a few events have left a lasting mark on our conscience, as well as the areas at which they took place: the bombing of Pearl Harbor; American internment camps; German labor and extermination camps; the Battle of Britain; and the atomic horror, Hiroshima. These have become common World War Two lore in the United States. But with all the dry, one-sided history texts we learn from a change of vantage becomes refreshing and sometimes even necessary. This is where supplemental readings become invaluable to seeing history in a broader perspective. Books such as Hiroshima allow the reader to transcend the cold facts of history texts.John Hersey's Hiroshima is a series of detailed journalistic accounts taken from various survivors at Hiroshima. August 6th, 1945, an infamous day for many the world over, and many more in Japan and more so for the survivors of what some people believed a needless travesty. However for Miss Toshinki Sasaki, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, Mrs Hatsuyo Nakamura, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terfumi Sasaki and the Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto this day was a day of immeasurable luck against all the odds, this was the day they lived and this is a book chronicling their stories. A last minute decision to help some one move old clothes for a goodwill drive, the luck of the Irish saving a Japanese man suspended by parts of his own house, a woman struggling to free her own kids from the rubble and then clothe them, a quickly timed decision to go this way instead of that, each of these stories relating to the blinding flash of the noiseless death that each of them lived through is remarkably told by John Hersey.John Hersey's book brings to life the horrors unleashed by the atomic genie of the age in a vivid, horrific and humanly emphasizing way. It gives depth to one of the last acts of World War Two and a glimpse of how \\"Human\\" the declared enemy is. It gives us a comparative look at our neighbors in the world and how our differences are our similarities, as well as our common interests. I found this book to be of great interest and added a wealth of knowledge that allowed at least one aspect of the war to be grounded in my reality. It shows the reader an uncensored view of the life during the war and in Hiroshima at the time of and after the bombing. It gives the reader everything from daily routines and chores that the citizens were occupying themselves with, the response to the flash, the confusion of the citizens, the after affects of the fallout, the state of the ruinous city, are each described by the six individuals interviewed by John Hersey. I believe this is a great read and a written memorial to all those who lived, died and were born throughout this time-it also serves as a great warning of the power we as humans have to create, or create destruction."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Don't be fooled by the 5 stars, Hiroshima is not the best written, nor most challenging book one will ever read, in fact, in those areas this book does not even come close. However, John Hersey's promise of opening the world's eyes to the horrors of the \\"bomb\\" is fulfilled to the very last sentiment in this classic book.This book was simply a school assignment for me, I honestly can say I would not have read it otherwise. Nevertheless, after reading it I began to question my indifference towards World War II, and even more- the threat of nuclear war. Bombs like the \\"A-bomb\\" have never fallen on the USA, and that may be why most Americans don't blink at the mention of atomic warfare.For those of you who have two or three hours to spare, and are interested in the chaos that about 10 pounds of uranium and 5 pounds of radium can create, this is a succint and timeless novel (which would pass for a mass-biography) which will hopefully remain on college and high school English cirriculums for years to come."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"\\"Hiroshima\\" is about the people who experienced the destructive powers of the atomic bomb firsthand. It does not tell you whether the bomb was a necessary evil, or whether the US should have found alternative methods of victory. It only attempts to describe the lives of six people who were in Hiroshima that day, what they saw and what they did. In this book, the ethics of the bomb are not the issue, though it can be argued that it is anti-bomb or anti-war because it doesn't put the war in context. But given the scope of the book, the context isn't necessary. The bomb had consequences; to deny that is to put patriotism over humanity.There are some quirky reviewers here who mention that this is a \\"novel.\\" \\"Hiroshima\\" is not a work of fiction. John Hersey interviewed several people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the atomic bomb and survived, and this is the story of six of them. He originally meant to publish the contents serially in the New Yorker, hence the four chapters (A Noiseless Flash, The Fire, Details are Being Investigated, and Panic Grass and Feverfew) that are separated chronologically, each discussing all six people in that particular time frame. This is probably why the form of the book was confusing for some people who didn't like going from one person's story to another, and back again (though I personally found it easy to follow). Eventually it was decided that the four chapters should be published as one article, taking up most of the August 31, 1946 New Yorker magazine. The aftermath was written forty hears later and comprises almost half the book. It is a follow up on the people and is just as relevant-the bomb would have its effects long after most people began to forget.If you want to know about the bomb and how it relates to World War II, then there are many other sources out there. But &quot;Hiroshima's&quot; value lies in its portrayal of the sheer horror of the power of atomic weapons. The discussion of whether the existence and use of weapons of mass destruction can be justified might be eternally debated. But that debate must include the consequences of what can happen to human beings and the conditions in which they live. I first read this book in sixth grade, and the words \\"He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glovelike pieces\\" has never left my mind."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and insightful. I had never read any books on the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan but had been curious about it for some time. This book answers some of the questions that I had and revealed things that I had no knowledge of. The book follows the lives of five people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb dropping. It chronicles the people, places and horrors that they were witness to after the bomb had devasted there homes and lives in Hiroshima. The book was written shortly after these events took place so the stories and feelings that are related in the book are fresh and vivid. Not since Hiroshima and Nagasaki has mankind been subjected to such devastating destruction. This story should never be forgotten for fear of repeating this sad time in history."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"No matter what your views of the atomic bomb are. Whether you think Japan deserved the bomb, or Truman did it to save lives and end the war, or that the bomb was really nuclear diplomacy: you should still read this book. A tiny little book that shows the human effects of the bomb. Well written, short and to the point. This is a must read. Anyone who is interested in WWII and the bomb needs to read this book. I thank my US History since 1945 Professor, Dr. Crawly for assigning us this book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima is one of the better books I have read about the atomic bomb that brought an end to World War II. His personal account of the six hibakusha took the devastation and destruction the bomb brought to a more significant level. The stories of Miss Sasaki, Dr. Fujii, Mrs. Nakamura, Dr. Sasaki, Father Kleinsorge, and Reverend Tanimoto touched my heart---as well as many others I know. The vivid details he used made me realize that when we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we dropped pain and disaster on the hundreds of thousands of people living there. The last chapter, &quot;The Aftermath,&quot; really brought home the effects of the bombing, because even after 40 years many Japanese were still suffering from radiation sickness and other diseases. It was definitely a long, hard road to recovery these people had to travel. No matter what the history books say or what Hersey has presented in his novel, though, the bombing can be summed up with one phrase: &quot;Shikata ga-nai---it can't be helped.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"A reportage tracking and tracing the lives and experiences of six survivors of the Hiroshima atom bomb attack of 1945.From the first mysterious white flash,Hersey tells-in a detached style that make the horrors more personal and real to the reader-the bemusement of what had caused the cataclysmic destruction (a cluster bomb? Magnesium being showered down and igniting when in contact with electricity? Petrol sprayed and ignited?)the burns and wounds-Tanimoto pulling a burned woman from the river and her skin comes from her arms like gloves from a hand;not easy to forget-the strange illnesses and-finally-the rebuilding, as life goes on.In addition, Hersey visits Hiroshima 40 years on and looks at the lives his subjects led after the bomb;a struggle for understanding from a nation that regarded survivors as freaks;to try and put the whole thing into some context;to forget or-as with Kiyoshi Tanimoto-to use the horror as a warning to the world and as a focal point for peace.Tanimoto's story is perhaps the most revealing.He was-to a great extent, weather intended or not-very much exploited by the American media who took over his good idea;cynics would say certain individuals were using the moral question of the A bomb and Tanimoto's campaign for self agrandisement,and I'm one! There's also the painfully crass 'This is Your Life' appearance by Tanimoto.You wonder at the insensitivity of 'welcoming' an unsuspecting guest of such a horror with a 'countdown' to when the bomb hit Hiroshima as an introduction to the audience as to who the subject was, closely followed by, \\"And now a word from our sponsors\\" and a demo of how fantastic the sponsor's nail varnish is!This is perhaps a greater indignity to Tanimoto than the bomb itself.This is a vital piece of history, magnificently recorded.(Did Capote use this as a template for his equally brilliant 'In Cold Blood'?)I started reading this late in the evening and found myself reading late into the night to finish it-it is that good and 'unputdownable'.It is not a book you can lay to one side after a few pages and come back to-as I foolishly thought-so make a space in your day to read this entire.It will be a time you will never forget,and neither should the world."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"John Hersey's Hiroshima vividly describes the dropping of the bomb from a survivor's perspective. His description of the survivors is amazing. You can really commiserate with the people in the book because of his in depth and complex writing. The most memorable thing in Hiroshima is Dr. Fuji's determination to save as many people as he can. I gave this book three stars because although it did catch my attention, it did not hold it throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"To me, the most compelling moment in Hiroshima is when a mother of three children dug desperately to free them from the rubble after the bomb hit. Her name is Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura. She had two girls, Yaeko and Myeko, and one boy, Toshio. At the time of the blast, Mrs. Nakamura was in the kitchen cooking rice, and the children were in bed going to sleep. After all of the rubble fell on top of them, Mrs. Nakamura immediately started digging herself out of the rubble. Once out, she heard her children crying, she began to dig them out. Everyone was fine except for a few scratches. This is just one of the many stories that are told in this factual book. Hiroshima is touching, and it gets in depth about each of the six hibakusha survivors. However, it is a dull read, and it gets confusing when it skips around from person to person."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima, a novel by John Hersey takes the reader back to 1945 when the first atomic bomb was dropped. John Hersey takes the stories of six survivors of Hiroshima. In this short novel John Hersey describes what happened to these six survivors when the bomb exploded and what happened to them 40 years later. Switching from character to character with suspense hanging from every page I think that I would call this book a &quot;Page Turner.&quot; I think that it was an excellent book because of how the author makes the book both interesting and full of facts. The book not only takes you back to the day of the bombing but at the same time it helps you learn the truth and pain of Hiroshima's survivors. The book gives you a lot of facts from Hiroshima as well. Hiroshima takes you into the lives of these 6 lucky people. Throughout the book you experience the pain of these people (not as much of course). Even though the book is very descriptive and at some times very graphic I give it 5 stars. I recommend this book to everyone who has questions about what happened to people at Hiroshima."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Read in one evening - dusk till dawn.Extraordinary page-turner, captivating, heart-wrenching..."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hiroshima is a book I read when I was in 9th grade. I decided to reread this book after learning that my grandfather's brother died during the deadly atomic bomb massacre in Hiroshima on August 1945, when there was nothing but sounds of death everywhere.Until this day, my country Korea fights with Japan for various reasons starting from entertainment to history. Reading a book with full of sympathy of my country's rival Japan may not sound appropriate, since the majority dislike Japanese people and several think they deserved the sufferings from the atomic bomb attack. After all, they were the ones who invaded Korea and did unforgivable war crimes during the Second World War. However, after finishing this book...I learned that I was wrong, very wrong indeed.This book explains fully about the suffrages of the bomb from death, pain, anguish and sadness. After reading Hiroshima and my Grandfathers story of his dead brother I learned something special, Japan's pain from war was not any different to Korea's suffrage and the sadness and pain is what we all shared during war. Furthermore, I felt guilty to think that Japan deserved it, and that it is not right to blame Japan for everything.This book is a collection of interviews by John Hersey, all interviewed straight after the bomb attack. Hersey managed to interview six survivors who managed to live and was able to escape from the edge of death. The six survivors include Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, a physician, Mrs. Nakamura, widow, Father Kleinsorge, priest, Dr. Sasaki, and Mr. Tanimoto. All six interviews were unbelievable, and sounded almost like a miracle that they managed to survive through the devastating bomb. Hersey writes his interviews very emotionally and this helped me understand the survivors feelings more closely, making me emotional as well.Miss Sasaki's (Toshinki) interview was most interesting to me. Her experience during the attack was unique compared to the other survivors. What made her unique was her story of being a cripple, a hibakusha some say. Japanese called the survivors from the bomb, \`hibakusha?and this definitely was not a pleasant word to say. Miss Sasaki lost her fianc?due to this dishonorable name Hibakusha. Reading her sorrow of losing her waiting love, the letter of guilt from her fianc? and herself to live on as a Hibakusha, lead me to the peak of sadness. To get rid of her pain she decides to become a nun. She said \`More notice should be given to the causes than to the instruments of total war?and yes I fully agree with her, war is meaningless. Most of the time I felt sympathy in this interview and it was hard to stop reading.My favorite quote and a quote that I would never forget come from Miss Sasaki's interview. \`I shall not dwell on the past, I prefer not to look back and I shall keep moving forward? Many of us dwell on the past and some take it hard to accept change. I experienced it, but I too learned that it is meaningless to dwell hopelessly on the past. The only solution is to have a dream, make an aim, move forward, and end your life without regret.I really enjoyed reading this book, it helped me understand what war is like and like the New York Times said \`Everyone able to read should read it? I recommend this book to everyone studying WW2 or Japan's history. In addition, to read one's experience becoming successful under difficult conditions, which is rare to see in nowadays society.Lastly I would like to conclude that Hiroshima doesn't aim only on the suffering and consequences of the bomb brought to Japanese people, but to show what terror we have done to those innocent people and to show our emotions as a human. It is an unforgettable disaster for our humanity, and the book wants to shout that this should never happen again, in future."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This particular edition is missing the 5th chapter. My son ordered this book for a college history course and couldn't use it. We had to find a later edition that included the missing chapter."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"A classic, worth reading. Really conveys the terror and bewilderment after the bomb was dropped. Interesting study of various characters involved. Feel does not put the bombing into perspective...ultimately saved American and Japanese lives. Agree with other reviewers that may be too apologetic. At the same time makes a nice case for nuclear restraint. Easy to read in 1-2 days as was originally a magazine article."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Back during high school, I had a choice of several books to read for an AP Language class, and I ended up deciding to read Hiroshima simply because it was the least expensive. All I can say is THANK GOD! Hiroshima was one of those books that made me put away everything else around me and just sit down in my backyard and read until it was too dark to see any words. Hersey really puts you into the hearts and minds of those affected by the bombs in Japan, and the individual stories of heartbreak, triumph, and endurance were enough to make this cold-as-stone girl cry. Everyone should read this, if not just because it's marvellously written, but because it speaks a lot about human nature and how we adapt to the worst of catastrophes. How we live and die. How we can see each detail and not know what to make of it.Beautiful and entrancing stories. If you speak or read the English language, you NEED to read this."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"What can I say? This book has become a CLASSIC in it's own Time, and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book's status as a classic needs no confirmation from me. It represents the pinnacle of reporting in The New Yorker's golden years on what is arguably the single most momentous event of the twentieth century. Every generation needs to be introduced to this work, and to reread it again and again."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"The book is great. Gives a unique view into Japanese survivors of the A-Bomb. However, this edition for what ever reason, does not include the Aftermath epilogue. I needed that chapter for my class and was very upset this book did not have it."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"It wasn't the writing as much as the story."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This book held a very strong message. In telling of the lives of six people that survived the bomb, we learn not only their stories, but we also feel a bit of the enormity of the disaster the bomb at Hiroshima caused. We learn that the effects of the atomic bomb didn't end a few days after it was dropped. It ended the lives of many, and changed those of all the citizens of Hiroshima.The fact is, however, that the book was very boring and confusing. It is necesary to read a chapter two or three times to take in everthing that happened. If you are willing overcome that aspect of the novel, then you should buy this novel without delay. I wasn't able to do so. That's why I gave it three stars."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I thought that this book was hard to follow in a few areas, but that it altogether was good. It wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"What is this, the 1940's?Since it's publication there has been major additions made to the book which were not included in this publication."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"This strikes me as a strange little book and I have to admit I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. It has the feeling of a palimpsest - and, indeed, at the core is the 1946 article Hersey wrote for the New Yorker - that lost its justification in the process of being added to and updated. The last third of the book degenerates into a sort of \\"where are they now\\" that continues to follow (into the 1970s) the lives of the handful of A-bomb survivors upon whom Hersey originally focused. But the fact of the matter is that all of them went on to lead substantially normal (and not especially remarkable) lives and that none of them has anything very insightful to say about their experiences (which is only what one might naturally expect, though it does lead to curiosity about why Hersey chose to write about them). Once Hersey has described the bomb's immediate effects and the days just afterward, the drama of the book is essentially used up. The bits of political history that he includes (either before or after the bombing) are decidedly sketchy, and Hersey's social analysis of the position of the \\"explosion-affected persons\\" in Japan isn't particularly deep. Interesting considering the historical context of the original article that led to the expanded book, but it's a slight effort nonetheless. More than that, it has that unmistakable air of an \\"assigned book\\" for high-school or J-high summer reading lists--one that's supposed to carry an important lesson or moral but which is, at base, dull enough to neither offend anyone nor inspire much interest. It's a \\"read this, it will educate you\\" book that embodies all the attendant problems of the genre and has a fair amount of difficulty standing the test of time."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Great account and read!"},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"We just had to read this story for my freshman english calss. I was of course pleased with how we didn't have to read some tale jumbled with so much symbolisim that we could barely remember the main charactor, but this was definately on the other end of the spectrum. I feel that this book was poorly written. The Atom Bomb is such a delicate subject, and it did not deserve the flavorless writing which was John Hersey's style. I often found myself bored because The words in the book were simply words, not passionate writing which I expected. I did give it two stars, because now I understood what the people of Hiroshima were going through, but the style of writing which was simply fact, left me bored."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"I can't begin to imagine the horror of it. The flash burns, some with flesh pulling off. Eyes hollowed out. Fires. Thirsty but barely able to open their mouths to take in water. Vomiting. No wonder it took the United States so long to help the Jews during the holocaust that claimed so many lives. They were too busy in their own version of the American holocaust against Japan.This book mentions a second atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan. This one not in Hiroshima. It does not detail that event. Just mere mention. I was not aware of a 2nd atomic bomb being detonated in Japan. Toward the end of the book, it accounts various bomb-test sites of both atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and the testing countries. Got to wonder how much of this radiation is in our drinking water and soil, none of which was contained at the test sites I'm sure as waters do flow to other sites.\\"Hiroshima\\" follows the lives of a handful of people that survived the A-Bomb."},{"Title":"Hiroshima","review":"Hersey let the facts speak for themselves.

His other books are just as interesting (perhaps more so as this is sort of a bio, and they are stories) -- buy them all as you are able!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"By far the most realistic of the Bond books. Fleming's description of the MGB (later KGB) headquarters in Moscow's Dzherzinsky Square, where the plot to lure British agent James Bond to his death is first revealed, is reputedly based on information to which he was privy in his capacity as a WWII officer in British Naval Intelligence -- likewise the recruitment and training of the psychopathic killer Red Grant, one of the most formidable of Bond's enemies (and the only one in the films who looked for a while about to kill Bond for sure! 007 meets his match in Grant!) This is the book behind what in my opinion is the best of the Bond movies, steeped in the atmosphere of the Cold War into which the Bond series was born. 007 travels to Istanbul in pursuit of the bait, a Lektor decoder which can read top secret Soviet military and intelligence signal traffic. Another form of bait is the beautiful Tatiana Romanova, an MGB cipher clerk allegedly in love with Bond, willing to defect with the Lektor if only 007 will come and fetch her. (Fleming takes yet another jab at the Reds by choosing this name for Bond's love interest -- Romanov was the family name of the last Czar of old imperial Russia, the family doomed to extinction by the Russian revolution.) Kerim Bey adds a bit of panache, mischief and mystery as &quot;Our man in Istanbul,&quot; Head of Station T (for Turkey). A truly great and suspenseful plot!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"That the Bond movies after Connery and before Craig abandoned character development. Fleming is an absolute master at fleshing out the nuances of the of the baddies."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is a strange Bond book, in that James Bond doesn't even appear in the first half. Fleming focused on the USSR's spy service and on people who were known to work for it, which must have seemed very topical in the 1950s but today comes off as silly. Things pick up in the second half, though as with all Fleming's work, you have to learn to overlook the racism."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fully one-half of the way through \\"From Russia With Love\\", by Ian Fleming, the reader awaits the first action scene - related to the main theme of the book, the nasty spy intrigues and assassinations of the Cold War. How \\"007\\" and Fleming got their images and reputations from this book is beyond me.Yes, during the first half of the book there is a brilliantly executed build-up, a plenitude (too much perhaps?) of minute detail (especially the faces of the characters), and promises or hints of something more (hopefully some action or intrigue) to come.The classic, 1950's-1960's settings in Moscow, London & Istanbul are fun to read. Since I visited each of those cities in the very early 1960's, I was amused and pleased at the accurate depictions.As Bond and the fem fatale Tanya depart Istanbul on the Orient Express, the pace picks up, thankfully. Actually for the first 80% of the story, the hero and main character is MI5's Istanbul officer Kerim, a Turk. Up to that point, Bond is a minor character, strangely nave, notably uncertain, and only an eager, bumbling follower.For the most part, except for many oft-repeated pet phrases, it's well-written, this story. Bond improved in the last 20% of the story, becoming somewhat the \\"Bond, James Bond\\" we know from all those movies. It is possible that the movies (which we have all seen at least 4 times) gave us a truly false picture of 007?All-in-all, Bond, as a cold war spy, disappoints through almost all of the story as a mistake-prone, super nave, very gullible and ineffective officer the realm. One must endure the book for the denouement scene on the train. The final few pages are almost laughable and quite unsatisfying.I give it a weak 3.00 on Amazon's scale, if only out of respect for Fleming's body of work and as a thank you for creating the character of James Bond. But make no mistake, \\"From Russia with Love\\" is wholly disappointing."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Given their emphasis on beautiful women and violence and glamor, the books in Ian Fleming's James Bond series are naturals for Penguin's beautiful new Penguin Ink series featuring covers by accomplished and gifted tattoo artists; since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is often considered the best of the Bond books, it's probably no wonder it was chosen. One of President Kennedy's favorite novels, this, the fourth Bond novel, is one of Fleming's most cleverly constructed. For the first two-fifths of the novel Bond doesn't appear as a character at all, but becomes the object of a trap planned by some of Fleming's most loathsome and iconic villains: Kronsteen, the cold and inhuman world chess champion who also doubles as the chief planner for the Soviet anti-espionage division of SMERSH; Donovan 'Red' Grant, the physically indomitable serial killer who works as the chief executioner for SMERSH; and the sadistic head of operations and executions for SMERSH, Rosa Klebb, who seems to epitomize everything Fleming feared about feminists (her name is a pun on the famous Soviet phrase for women's rights, \\"khleb i rozy\\" or \\"bread and roses\\"). The three lay out an elaborate plan for assassinating and framing Bond for murder so as to embarrass the British MI5, and the long first section of the novel details both their cruelties and working conditions in the Soviet Union and their forcing of a beautiful MGB agent, Tatiana Romanova, into springing their trap. This is probably the best and most suspenseful section of the novel, though it barely makes into the famous 1963 film (which many consider the best of all the Bond movies) because it would have forced its star Sean Connery's entrance to have been delayed for too long.The rest of the novel is quite enjoyable and suspenseful, with Istanbul and then the Orient Express en route to Paris forming a colorful setting for the trap's deployment. James Bond is much less smug and smirking here than in the films and comes across as much more human, although his obsession with the consumption of luxury items and subtle class markers comes off perhaps less charmingly than Fleming intended (although it seems clearly a response to the end of wartime austerity). There's quite a bit of silly business with Fleming's fascination with lesbianism and with his fantasies of women's catfights, but there's also quite a lot of fascinating material about the detailing of international espionage operations that Fleming, as a former Naval Intelligence Officer, knew about firsthand. The dialogue is often ridiculous, true; but who reads James Bond novels for the dialogue? This is probably your best entry into the series and also the best single Bond novel to sample if you're only going to read one of them."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Ok, I wanted to put in my two cents here because I think there is something about this book that will upset many would-be-readers. Bond doesn't even coming into the story until like page NINETY!! The first few pages of the book are interesting, setting up the whole background of Nash, and how he got into the business. But... it just KEEPS GOING ENDLESSLY, then they start talking about Tatiana for another ten pages or so before Bond is even introduced. From a technical point of view, this is a HUGE writing mistake, and if it weren't for the huge fan base Bond already has, I don't think many people would fight through those ninety pages.Other than that, it's a great book and follows the movie extremely closely. I liked that they didn't make the part with Captain Nash and Bond as lame as the movie was. In the movie Bond KNOWS Nash put the drug into Tatiana's drink, then turns his back on Nash so they can look at the map. Stupid beyond belief, but the book handles it quite a bit better. Over all, if you like Bond, read this book, but be aware you might be skimming some pages in the beginning."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Though it ends with as sharp a period as any Ian Fleming ever made, the operative punctuation in 1957's \\"From Russia, With Love\\" is found in its very title, a comma. \\"From Russia\\" is not an end but a turning, from the lighter Bond adventures Fleming penned at the start of the series toward twistier, more complex yarns.It's also one of the most captivating of Bond stories. It opens with an image of a well-built naked man lying face-down on a rose-hedged lawn. He looks dead but is very much alive, dangerously so, as we discover. Red Grant is not only powerful, he is madly homicidal, a combination that endears him to his Soviet masters. Grant's latest assignment, part of a larger operation to embarrass the British secret service, involves the killing of one of only three Britishers who hold the dread double-0 distinction and thus is kind of Grant's opposite number: 007.\\"English spies we have captured speak highly of the man\\", one Soviet spymaster notes. \\"He is certainly much admired in his Service. He is said to be a lone wolf, but a very good-looking one.\\"To demoralize the British and reverse a string of losses, head Soviet spykiller General G. commands Bond not only be killed, but \\"killed with IGNOMINY\\". Enter Tatiana Romanova, a beautiful, mild-mannered government clerk who becomes both pawn and queen in the chess game against Bond.The build-up is great, and once Bond enters the scene, like a matador the last to enter the bullring, Fleming kicks the story into an even higher gear. Buying the cover story that Tatiana has fallen in love with him from a file photo and wants to give him a secret Russian decoder, Bond travels to Istanbul and meets Darko Karim, the British secret service's chief Turkish ally. Fleming bathes us in atmosphere, and takes us from a gypsy catfight to a nighttime assassination to a hotel-room seduction in a classic example of \\"the Fleming Sweep.\\"\\"Near the airport a dog barked excitedly at an unknown human smell,\\" Fleming writes. \\"Bond suddenly realized that he had come into the East where the guard-dog howls all night. For some reason the realization sent a pang of pleasure and excitement into his heart.\\"\\"From Russia, With Love\\" may well be Fleming at his least politically correct. Tatiana is little more than a plaything, while Darko Karim regales Bond with his un-Western notions of romancing a woman, which involves chaining her to a wall and feeding her table scraps until she falls in love with him. But this is part of \\"Russia's\\" dark charm, presenting such awful ideas so palatably in the form of Karim, one of the best characters in the 007 series with his fatalistic charm and suavity.\\"Russia\\" comes up short only in the adventure department, with Bond little more of an active player here than he was in \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" and getting a ludicrously detailed rundown of the enemy plot before his \\"liquidation\\". The ending is definitely improvable (and was in the subsequent screen adaptation, the best of all the Bond movies).I'd call the earlier \\"Casino Royale\\" and later \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" the best Bond novels, but \\"Russia\\" lays down the groundwork of the entire 007 concept with unrivaled drama and passion. It can be seen today as the moment when James Bond went from diverting pulp fiction to essential cultural touchstone."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Having read all of the 007 novels in my youth, I remembered that my two favorites were \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"From Russia with Love.\\" I also enjoyed the others but I think these two best represent what made James Bond such a dynamic character in a compelling Cold War world.In this book, James Bond doesn't even appear until page 95. Part One is spent introducing us to the Russian Secret Service and its frightening branch for torture and assassinations, SMERSH (a shortened word from the Russian phrase, \\"Death to Spies\\"). Fleming writes a short note at the beginning that most of what he writes about SMERSH, from its location in Moscow to its personnel, is \\"accurate\\" and \\"correct,\\" giving this particular novel a Michael Crichton-like feel: how much of this was true?I've ordered and received Andrew Lycett's biography of Ian Fleming just to get some more background on his life and maybe some insight into how much of the Bond novels came from real experiences!I think a big part of this book's success is that all the elements of a Bond novel are directly tied to the central plot: the \\"romantic\\" aspects of the story are just a mask for a dark and sinister operation--or are they? A beautiful woman isn't simply a damsel in distress--she's the reason for the mission itself. The story moves from Moscow to London to Istanbul and then back across Eastern Europe aboard the Orient Express. The villians are truly monstrous creations, from the grotesque Rosa Klebb to the truly evil Red Grant.So far, I'd say this is the best of the James Bond novels."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"From Russia With Love was written in 1957 and what was common knowledge back then may offend sensitive people today. Deal with it and keep on reading because this is going to be fun.All of Fleming's books were fast paced fun but Russia stands out among them. The characterizations are brilliant. The description of the vicious and dreadful woman, Rosa Klebb goes on for more than a page. By the time Flemming is finnished you KNOW this woman and you're afraid of her. Tatiana, the beautiful innocent caught in a web of lies, Kerim Bey, the tough half wild head of T branch and psychotic Irish giant, Red Grant are all beautifully brought to life. The Russian scenes are written with such tautness you'll wonder how anyone survived life in the Soviet Union with thier sanity in tact.If you're used to the Bond lite presented by Roger Moore' in his last two films or Pierce Brosnon's version, the Bond of the books will be a surprise. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"SMERSH, the special section of the KGB dedicated to eradicating Western spies, has had enough of James Bond.

Together they build a trap for Bond in Istanbul and bait it with an irresistible young woman who claims she wants to defect. Will Bond take the bait? Can he escape before the trap springs?

But, thankfully, the basic characters and plot remains the same. What is most fascinating is that Fleming has the patience not to introduce Bond until a third of the book is over.

But hey, a James Bond book is a James Bond book, so it has to have some good parts"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"So far all the reviews on this page have given this book 5 stars. I'm gonna have to break the streak and give four for a few reasons. I have read all of Raymond Bensons Bond books, and this was the first Fleming book I've read. I have to say that after all I've heard about Fleming I'm rather dissapointed. First of all, the first 100 pages were totally based on how they're gonna kill Bond. Come on! That could have been covered that in 10, and that would have been more than adequate. Second, of the Bond books I've read, this one has the least action. But, it had several strongpoints. Good character development, and it comes together in the last 50 pages. I suppose this is how Bond was meant to be. This book, despite its few weaknesses, is a must read for any Bond fan that wishes to see how Bond was meant to be. Oh, and I've just started on Doctor No. I'm 40 pages in and I'm hooked."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This book begins with the story of Donovan Grant, psychopathic killer and traitor, who defects to the Soviets. They, unlike other forces, welcome and use these types. The beginning chapters are filled with accurate background. You wonder how a newspaperman like Fleming acquired this knowledge. In Chapter 5 the Soviet High Command has decided to reach out and touch one of their enemies. Various targets are discussed until they decide on James Bond as the object of scandal and death. Destroying a hero will damage the morale of this Service. Bond must be lured to a foreign country where he will be killed and disgraced; the planners devise a scheme that meets their needs. The book shows Fleming's knowledge of Russian, learned before he reported on a Moscow spy trial in 1932.James Bond is between assignments, tending to administrative matters. The Director calls him and tells of a situation in Station T concerning a Soviet code clerk and a cipher machine. Bond will accept this gambit, but wonders if it is a trap. Kerim shows Bond the sights of Istanbul. They visit a gypsy band and observe their primitive justice. Chapter 18 has plenty of action! The attackers were told to spare Bond. Who can tell why? When Bond returns to his room he finds Tanya; she tells how she will bring the cipher machine to their compartment on the Orient Express. The next day they meet for their return to England. On the train Bond suspects there is some sort of plot connected to their travel by train. But he ignores this suspicion. When Bond find Darko Kerim dead in his train compartment he realizes something is happening. But all seems well when the train reaches Italy.Bond seems to recognize a man sent by M. Captain Nash gives the proper password and countersign. But there is something about him that doesn't ring true. Woken from sleep, Bond faces a new threat in the sleeping car. It seems almost hopeless, but Bond improvises a shield against danger. Nash's own weapon is used against him. Bond wins again, the girl and the cipher machine, and important information about Paris. Rosa Klebb is captured, her career is over. But she kicks one last time and Bond has a problem.This story shows how Fleming has improved his writing since \\"Casino Royale\\". The popular 1965 film developed more action by not strictly following the book. I think it was better that way."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Of all the Ian Fleming books I've read, none was more entertaining than this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The book starts off describing the villians in lavish detail. One almost feels as if he/she is involved in the story. The plot of the story is very believeable and the villians are convincing. When Bond does enter the story, Fleming seems to get you involved in the life of James Bond. Darko Kerim truly seems as though he knows the business of spying. I have read the book twice and I am half way through it again. A must read for any Bond fan."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Lovers of the Bond films [particularly those under 30] should take time to become familiar with the novels that inspired the best Bond films. From Russia With Love leads the pack in that regard! The 1963 film was relatively faithful to the novel and once you have read it you will see why.

And it ends with the poisoning of Bond."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is the first Bond book that I have read, and I have to say that it wasn't a very good first impression.Bond spends the majority of the book. He is talked about, and he watches the action happen around him. Towards the end of the book he finally becomes somewhat active, however he misses every clue that he is given. WHen the bad guy finally makes an appearence - after sooo much was told about him at the start of the book, his entire history - he only spends a short amount of time in the action of the book. He reveals the entire plan to Bond, and then is of course killed by Bond. Not because Bond is super cool, but because Bond is super lucky.Of course the woman, the \\"heroine\\" spends the entire book either making love to Bond or sleeping, but I never expected anything more.Overall, I'm not sure what the appeal of Bond is, but maybe as a friend suggested, I picked the worst one out of the Bond books. I find nothing wrong with formulaic spy books, but this was bad."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fabulous book, not what I was expecting. Bond films are often nauseating, bordering on carry on films at times with the cheesiness.Fleming's book version of Bond shows him as fallible, and the book doesn't even concentrate on him for any more than a third of the whole thing.So good I've just ordered four more of Fleming's books."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"FRWL IS ONE OF THE MASTERPEICES OF FLEMING.s.m.e.r.s.h. -the russian organisation headed by rosa klebb &amp; dreaded for it's methods of torture &amp; murders has BOND as it's next target.the aim is to kill two birds with one shot- kill their most hated enemy -bond - &amp; in the process, make the british secret service look scandalously adulturous. the trap is laid- a beautiful russian smersh agent out to seduce bond with the lure of the most sought after machine -the spektor-. the story dashes from russian smersh headquarters to the hq of the british secret service . the meeting place is istanbul where the suave bond meets the sexy tatiana romanov .they move in accordance with the master plan of smersh.&amp; board the orient express. the leisurely pace of the luxury train is a sharp contrtast to the fast pace of the action that takes place inside it. people from both the sides are killed and eventually after a tense encounter between bond and the chief of operations of smersh (where as evident bond is the victor) he lands in paris. here he has a rendezvous with rosa klebb herself . she is overpowered by the brains of bond and is taken prisoner with the help of the french govt.but before parting she renders bond her final gift of wrath. a kick with a hidden knife laced with poison all through the book we are kept on the edge of our seats guessing on the next move by bond &amp; the smersh. fleming's portrayal of the asexual head of assasinations is a chilling one. he convinces us of the innocence of tatiana and her vulnerability. the smersh is made to look both sinister as well as ridiculous at times ... but ther suspense remains as we wonder whether bond is the victim of the hated rosa klebb's poisonous knife...a fact that would be revealed to us in fleming's next novel.till then we could just wait and watch and hope all is well with our beloved english spy. all in all a great book to have in hand . a book definitely not to be missed. a sure treat for james bond fans."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Considered by many to the be the best James Bond 007 book of all time, From Russia With Love delivers the perfect formula for a James Bond novel. Originally, Ian Fleming's tales of 007 were not going so good, so he intended with this book to kill off James Bond once and for all. The end of this novel is quite a surprise to a first time reader.The book begins by telling of the commanding rule of SMERSH. The leader of this organization is General Grubozaboyschikov. Also working is Colonel Rosa Klebb and director of planning Kronsteen, who treats real people as if they were chess pieces. The muscle of the group is a homicidal madman, who follows orders, and is in practically perfect physical shape, Donovan \\"Red\\" Grant. These evil minds have planned the perfect way to destroy the life and reputation of James Bond. Their plan is to lure 007 with the beatiful Tatiana Romanova and a Spektor cipher decoding machine as bait. Then Grant will meet up with them eventually and kill them both. However, SMERSH will take it a step further to lie to the public that Bond and Tatiana were in an affair, and that Bond commits suicide. It's a perfect plan.Bond indeed does travel to Istanbul, believing that this girl wants to defect, and will give him the Spektor machine only if he personally helps her. 007 meets Darko Kerim, and a wonderful gypsy fight adds to the fun of the story. Bond and Tatiana travel on a train back to Europe, where he meets Red Grant and is told of the plan to kill him. An extremely bvrutal gun and fist fight breakes out between the men with 007 shooting Grant. 007 goes to Paris with Tatiana to catch Rosa Klebb in a meeting. However, Klebb releases a poison knife from her shoe and kicks 007 in the leg, before being taken away by the police. The story ends with 007 lying on the floor of the hotel room...Perhaps the finest story of Ian Fleming, filled with the excitement and adventure to give this book it's reputation as on of the best 007 novels ever!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are certainly not the mixed bag that the films are, but some are certainly better than others. From Russia with Love is, along with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, among the best.From Russia with Love starts off on a different foot than most of the other Bond novels. Bond himself doesn't appear until part two, 95 pages into the story. Until then, the story centers on the deadly operatives of SMERSH, Soviet Russia's spy-killing organization. It's this first part that sets up the main plot of the story--a Russian scheme not only to assassinate James Bond, but to do so in a way that will scandalize the English public and shame the Secret Service. One of the more famous Bond girls, young Tatiana Romanova is suckered into posing as \\"bait\\" for Bond, and unbeknownst to her, both she and Bond are set up to die at the hands of Irish psychopath Red Grant.With those pieces in place, the plot proceeds methodically from point A to point B. Fleming was never a master plotter, but that's not the point. Having all the parts set up and ready for action generates enormous suspense--when, for instance, is the serial-killing Grant going to make his inevitable and violent appearance? Even for those who have seen the film version, there's plenty here to surprise and lots of white-knuckle thriller chases, fights, bombings, and near-misses.The book does have flaws. Bond is a bit too obtuse and more of a pawn than usual, and Tania is just a bit too wide-eyed and innocent, which I suppose is the point. But the book moves so briskly from the opening setup through the building suspense and action that one hardly has time to criticize the characters--the world is moving just as fast for them.From Russia with Love is one of Fleming's best not only because of his signature pace and action, but because, in this novel, he takes the time to develop menacing villains and show us, before Bond ever steps onstage, just how dangerous they are. The androgynous Rosa Klebb and giant, moon-crazed Red Grant are well-developed and certainly among the best of Bond villains.On a final note, upon reading this novel have Doctor No, the book's immediate sequel, on hand, because Fleming's ending is so abrupt and laden with ambiguity that you'll want to jump right into the next book. This is either a weakness or a strength. I'll go with strength.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Among the many James Bond movies, From Russia With Love has always been my favorite, a feeling that I know is shared by many others. It seems fitting, as the novel upon which it is based is also one of Ian Fleming's strongest.Interestingly, in this top notch Bond novel, the British super-spy is not even mentioned until after page 50 (in my 378 page version of the book) and does not appear until page 123. Superficially, this might be a weakness, but it actually makes the book stronger, as we are introduced to a couple of the best villains in the series. Red Grant is a psychopathic killer who has defected to Russia to be allowed to murder more freely as the chief executioner of SMERSH. Even more sinister is Rosa Klebb, the top SMERSH officer who will oversee a conspiracy to kill Bond.Why kill Bond? The simple answer is to embarrass the Western Intelligence agencies. This is not to be a simple assassination, but a carefully plotted homicide designed to humiliate the British Secret Service. To lure Bond into the appropriate place, the beautiful Tatiana Romanova is recruited to pose as a defector who has fallen for Bond after seeing his picture in a file. Bond and his boss M suspect a trap, but they have no idea what it might be. In case Tatiana is sincere, however, Bond meets with her in Turkey and starts the process of bringing her west.This book does have its little problems - such as the standard villain monologue in which a bad guy explains all to Bond - but overall, this is Fleming at his best, probably because there is no grand conspiracy of destruction or conquest; instead Bond himself is at the center and the opposition is formidable. This is a must-read for Bond fans."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Let's face it, Fleming's novels are never going to be regarded as masterworks of literature. They were designed to be quick reads with often preposterous plots but almost always with unexpected flourishes of poetic writing. Of all the James Bond novels, From Russia With Love is a strong contender for best of the bunch. The narrative, unlike some of Fleming's earlier work, is tight and coherent, seldom meandering or being side-tracked. The climatic confrontaion on the train is genuinely gripping. And once Bond and Tatiana board the Orient Express, Fleming's prose takes on a graceful quality that transcends the pulp secret agent genre that his novels find themselves in.The drawback is that Fleming's negative characterisation of \\"the commies\\" just goes too far, although the effect is more comical than offensive. Simarlarly with his depictions of Turkish people which unfortunately sink to the levels of unreconstructed racism at times. However, the caricatures are so ridiculous that I found it easy to overlook them, far more so than some of the more blatant prejudices expressed in Live And Let Die and Goldfinger.As for the film, well, it's small wonder that many people consider it to be the best. It's identical to the book - and that's a good thing!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This book begins with the story of Donovan Grant, psychopathic killer and traitor, who defects to the Soviets. They, unlike other forces, welcome and use these types. The beginning chapters are filled with accurate background. You wonder how a newspaperman like Fleming acquired this knowledge. In Chapter 5 the Soviet High Command has decided to reach out and touch one of their enemies. Various targets are discussed until they decide on James Bond as the object of scandal and death. Destroying a hero will damage the morale of this Service. Bond must be lured to a foreign country where he will be killed and disgraced; the planners devise a scheme that meets their needs. The book shows Fleming's knowledge of Russian, learned before he reported on a Moscow spy trial in 1932.James Bond is between assignments, tending to administrative matters. The Director calls him and tells of a situation in Station T concerning a Soviet code clerk and a cipher machine. Bond will accept this gambit, but wonders if it is a trap. Kerim shows Bond the sights of Istanbul. They visit a gypsy band and observe their primitive justice. Chapter 18 has plenty of action! The attackers were told to spare Bond. Who can tell why? When Bond returns to his room he finds Tanya; she tells how she will bring the cipher machine to their compartment on the Orient Express. The next day they meet for their return to England. On the train Bond suspects there is some sort of plot connected to their travel by train. But he ignores this suspicion. When Bond find Darko Kerim dead in his train compartment he realizes something is happening. But all seems well when the train reaches Italy.Bond seems to recognize a man sent by M. Captain Nash gives the proper password and countersign. But there is something about him that doesn't ring true. Woken from sleep, Bond faces a new threat in the sleeping car. It seems almost hopeless, but Bond improvises a shield against danger. Nash's own weapon is used against him. Bond wins again, the girl and the cipher machine, and important information about Paris. Rosa Klebb is captured, her career is over. But she kicks one last time and Bond has a problem.This story shows how Fleming has improved his writing since \\"Casino Royale\\". The popular 1965 film developed more action by not strictly following the book. I think it was better that way."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is a great great book. Didn't want to put it down at all! The gypsy fight is good and the Orient Express scenes are great. I love the plot with SMERSH, and the relationship with Bond and Tania was fun to read and it was interesting to get into Bond's mind and see what he was thinking and the way he felt for her! This is Fleming's Greatest!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is without a shadow of a doubt the best of all the James Bond books(trust me, I've read them all!), the descriptive writing(especially in the massage scene at the beginning) which keeps us hooked, as for keeping us hooked, what a brilliant opening line:&quot;The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside the swimming pool might have been dead.&quot; Our minds just have to keep reading to find out why. Anyway, the plot is as follows: SMERSH, the so-called &quot;Soviet organ of vengeance&quot; wants just that from James Bond:VENGEANCE. The MGB(predecessors of the KGB) desperately need a victory against the West. Britain's top agent, James Bond, is seen as a suitable target. The Russian Heads of Security then appoint 3 evil geniuses: Kronsteen(the brains behind it all), the sadistic Rosa Klebb, and the sick Red Grant. Together, they conceive a brilliant, almost fool-proof plan to lure James Bond to his deth. Enter Tatiana Romanova, a beautiful, Great Garbo look-alike, Russian Corporal who has an inferiority complex. She is employed to seduce James Bond: She should move to Istanbul as a cypher clerk who claims to want to defect with the precious, sought-after Spektor decoding machine, but only if the legendary James Bond(who she claims to be in love with, just by having seen a photo, his good-looks did the rest!) comes to collect her! James Bond, of course, accepts and goes to Istanbul where he meets the Head of Station of Turkey, Darko Kerim(or Kerim Bey), who is one of the best, most likeable characters in any James Bond book. They hatch a plan for her defection, which succeeds, and then Bond and Tatiana Romanova are on the Orient Express, going back to the West. In the Orient Express, they meet a chap sent by London(by M, Bond's boss) to see them through. It turns out that this Nash, is Red Grant, the sick sadist and over here is going to kill Bond and the girl and make it look like Bond killed her because she blackmailed him saying that if he didn't marry her, she would give away a reel of film with them making love in the hotel suite(which the girl had no knowledge of!) and Bond and his Service will be disgraced! Bond seems trapped but somehow, he escapes and goes for Rosa Klebb herself! The acuuracy of this book is so great that the descriptions of SMERSH HQ and the meeting room of General Grubozaboyschikov is pretty accurate and the recruitment of agents for the MGB is also supposed to be true! This is Fleming's ultimate masterpice! Buy Dr. No as soon as you finish this, you'll be compelled to read it! 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS BOOK!!!Ian Flemming has such a flair for writing that his ultimate gentleman spy character, James Bond, doesn't appear until after the first 80 or so pages and the book NEVER falters.Extremely rich character and story plot. The maniacal villian, Red Grant, whose only objective and ultimate desire is killing. The drop dead beauty, Tania, whose job is to seduce 007. The toad like female villan, Rosa Klebb, who lives for cunning and torture. The organization, SMERSH, and their deadly plan of mayhem and destruction towards the British Secret Service.One of the best spy stories ever written, also one of the best James Bond movies translated form an Ian Flemming book.

The method of recruitment and training of MGB (later KGB) killers is reputedly quite accurate, as well as the description of MGB HQ in the very first chapter. Red Grant is probably the greatest villian in Bond literature, a formidable adversary. This is classic Bond, a tale full of realism and steeped in the Cold War atmosphere into which James Bond was born. A great plot!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Ian Fleming did a wonderful job with this book.

The plot is exhilaratingly original, both as a serious treatment of espionage as well as a tongue-in-cheek adventure. The major force of the story is the very concept of 007's mission and the hidden trap behind it. It also gives the best inner view of Bond's enemies, the only ones present in the first-third of the book,without 007 even missed. And this thriller took the Orient Express out of Agatha Christie's domain. It also gave us a wonderful film in 1963."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"&quot;From Russia with Love&quot; by Ian Flemming is one of the best James Bond thrillers ever written.

Best parts: Kronstein at chess match, Grant's history, girl in Kleb's apartment, tunnel scene with rats and periscope, gypsy camp, assasination at Marilyn Monroe's mouth, confrontation on train with Grant, final fade-out scene with Bond and Kleb.

And it does not try to sugarcoat the nature of the Main Adversary--the Soviet intelligence services. This is a hard-core Cold War story featuring 007 at his best, as a human being, not an action figure or infallible superman.Fleming's writing is a lean, spare style that I find very appealing--it stands in sharp contrast to many of the over-bloated novels of today. This story moves at a rapid pace and never fails to engage the reader. This is one that the aficionado will want to keep for periodic re-readings of a terrific and absorbing tail of Cold War intrigue.Highly recommended. RJB"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"After having been practically raised on Bond films I finally cracked open my first read of Ian Fleming and loved it. Starting in London and then traveling to Istanbul via Rome and Athens, Bond begins his quest to meet Tatiana Romonova and the coveted Spektor cipher machine. But Bond finds himself in the middle of a much larger Russian chess game where he is the target. The \\"Service's\\" Head of T (Turkey), Darko Kerim, is one of the great characters in espionage literature. He dominates the book and is described by Fleming as \\"this wonderful man who had carried the sun with him.\\"This is a great espionage entertainment and has far more atmosphere than the movie. Have fun. I recommend it."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fleming seemed to have used his first four novels (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, and Diamonds are Forever) to warm us up to the Bond character and used the same plot style for the first four novels. In From Russia, With Love, Fleming takes Bond and his writing style to a higher, more intellectual level. Fleming is masterful in setting the scenes without being too boring. Bond doesn't appear until the second part of the book (Part II-The Plan) and you hardly even notice. Another interesting note is that of the James Bond movies, From Russia, With Love the movie follows the novel pretty well, even in lesser scenes such as the gypsy fight. This, perhaps, is due to the fact that Fleming was alive only for the filming and release of Dr. No and From Russia, With Love. This book is clearly Fleming at the top of his game and an outstanding entry to the series."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This was the best Bond novel by Ian Fleming. It not only has a great plot and diabolical characters, it details a great deal about the Soviet Intelligence Operations at the time, especially the dreaded SMERSH. Yes, there was such an organization.One of the most chilling paragraphs ever written in a novel is not fiction per se, but based on a particular problem of the Soviet police state - the shortage of executioners. As Fleming notes, \\"They get tired of the work. The soul sickens of it. After ten, twenty, a hundred death rattles the human being, however sub-human he may be, acquires, perhaps by a process of osmosis with death itself, a germ of death which enters his body and eats him like a canker. Melancholy and drink take him...\\"The earliest books of John LeCarre are excellent but his later books reflect a moral ambiguity between the West and the East. Critics loved it. But there is no moral equivalence in Fleming's prose.To (help) resolve their executioner problem, the Soviets hire and train Red Grant, a sociopath who particularly enjoys killing on nights with a full moon. The book also has Rosa Klebb, a sadistic SMERSH official. Both Grant and Kleb are basically asexual. They take joy only in killing. They are two of the most evil characters in all of fiction.The plot is excellent. In too many books and movies these days, the plot is advanced by people behaving like idiots. In this novel, the British suspect, even believe, a trap is being laid by the Soviets but the bait is so tempting they have to chance it. The decision moves the plot along but it's not an idiotic decision.An excellent novel. If you like LeCarre, read this book as a counterbalance."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I'll keep it short: FRWL is the best of Flemming's Bond novels. The prose is lean and the suspense taught. Flemming's has an flair for detail but knows when to hold back. The book clocks in at a lean 180 pages or so, short by today's standards, but chock full of plot and characterization. The details of Soviet spy organization and cold war skullduggery are written by an author who saw them first hand. Although the Bond plots are outrageous, the details remain thoroughly convincing.Ironically, Bond is the least developed character, the villains getting much more attention here. Bond is a paper thin character. He excercises every morning, is fond of scalding then freezing showers, drinks a lot lot and smokes incessantly. He also brushes his \\"comma of black hair\\" out of his eyes every so often. That's about it. Yet somehow it works and worked for 13 novels.FRWL still works are a taught thriller and a cold war time capsule. If you only had to read one Bond novel, I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is generally considered to be the very best James Bond book. In this case, conventional wisdom is right. I recently re-read the book, originally published in 1957, and it was even better than I remember it being.First, the flaws: Like most Flemming novels, much of the plot is implausible. The story revolves around a scheme by the Soviets to embarrass the British Secret Service by killing James Bond in a compromising position. Perhaps it is because we live in a post-Monica Lewinski world, but this doesn't seem to be that much of a big deal. The movie version of FRWL seems to acknowledge the weakness of the reasoning behind the sequence of events that make up the story. The movie makes Bond's planned embarrassing death a secondary consequence of the villains' (this time SPECTER, not the Soviets) plot to steal the Russian decoder, which in the book is merely used as bait.Another common problem with Flemming's Bond, which is again on display, is that he is rather gullible and pretty much goes along for the ride without using his wits to solve mysteries or get out of jams. In FRWL he misses obvious clues, believes a thinly disguised enemy agent enough to hand over his gun without much of a thought, and fails to ever put \\"two and two together.\\"Despite all the flaws, FRWL is a great book. If the plot has holes, the collection of words are beautiful in themselves, from Flemming's detailed description of food and drink, to the combat scenes that really come to life in this book. The character of Bond is more interesting here than in previous books - he demonstrates a sense of humor and playfulness, shows emotion and even has moments of reflection.The series of villains, while cartoonish, are fun. The lurking presence of Red Grant is menacing. Bond's interactions with the villains forms the basis for the series of events that make the story flow. Once the silly premise is accepted, the rest of the sequence of events makes a certain amount of sense. This internal coherence (which was missing to some degree in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER) added with a fast pace makes the book hold together and never seem slow or dull.What separates FRWL from the other books, however, is that it contains some genuine surprises, including its truly unexpected ending. The ending is even more unexpected because it is explained away in DR. NO. But the ending should be read for what it is in the context of the book itself, not in the larger context of the series.Finally, one of the things I enjoy about Flemming's Bond books is that because they were written in the 1950's, they have a feel for a different world, with different values, assumptions, and cultural icons. This differentness is on full display in FRWL. While I have no illusions of the world depicted in Bond books having any resemblance to actual history, the transportation into another world is achieved more purely than could be by a contemporary author writing a period piece. I love it!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The fifth Bond book is far and away the best I've read of the series. Much of its strength comes from an excellent beginning&oacute;almost a quarter of the book passes before Bond appears. The story starts in Moscow, where the Soviet intelligence community has decided it needs to pull off a major coup in order to maintain its prestige. The SMERSH division (for those who are new to the series, or for whom it's motto of &quot;Death To Spies&quot; isn't clear enough, SMERSH is in charge of eliminating internal and external spies) is tasked with killing that perpetual thorn in the side of international communism, James Bond. All the major villains are introduced in this early section, from the psychotic ace hit man (alas, his full-moon madness is an unnecessary and silly element), to the deviant older woman who runs the operation, to the chess mastermind who plans it, and finally, the beautiful and more or less innocent honey pot who will be set in front of Bond as bait. Two of these scenes are mini-masterpieces, the very first, where the naked hit man lies by his pool and gets his massage, and then later, when the planner is met in the middle of the Moscow city championship match.Only after all the pieces are in place, does Fleming finally pull away the curtain to reveal the object of all this attention, 007. This is a brilliant technique for heightening interest in a character and building suspense (Hitchcock was the master of it), and it sets the stage beautifully. We find Bond more or less indolent, having recently broken up with Tiffany Case (his girl from Diamonds Are Forever), and growing surly with inaction. The Soviet plot lures him to Istanbul, where he is met by another vivid character, Darko Karim, who is head of British intelligence in Turkey. After minor adventures there&oacute;notable is a lurid gypsy catfight&oacute;they make contact with the female lure, and the trio steal away on the Orient Express. The rest of the story takes place on the train, as it makes the four day trip through Europe, across Greece, and through places like Llubljana, Belgrade, Trieste, Venice, and on to Paris. It's an extended cat and mouse game, as the reader waits for the Russians to spring their trap.The one complaint I would have with this otherwise gripping book is that, as in many of the Bond series, the super spy is a bumbling idiot who manages to escape death only through the most unlikely actions of his foes. As in earlier and later books, he manages to miss rather obvious clues and lets others do the heavy lifting for him, only to walk into a rather simple trap. In this instance, Fleming makes an attempt to account for this by continually noting that Bond's senses are dulled from inactivity and that he's not sharp, and so forth. This grumble aside, its a very entertaining work,and definitely the best Bond I've read. Oh yes, Fleming does commit one gaffe with Bond's history that seems a little strange. At one point, it is mentioned that Bond has never killed in cold blood; which makes no sense, because it is explicitly stated in the very first book (Casino Royale) that he did! His shooting of a Japanese spy in New York, and knifing of a Dutch double-agent are what earned him his 00 (&quot;Licensed to Kill&quot;) designation, so it's strange that here Fleming would suggest otherwise. In any event, if you only read one Bond book, make it this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The Russian counter-espionage organization known as SMERSH concocts an elaborate plot to discredit the British Secret Service. Their immediate target for blackmail and murder: James Bond.This is a classic spy novel by Ian Fleming. It is not a half-baked if well intentioned imitation. It presents Bond in his pristine form before filmmakers evolved him into a cartoon character. Ian Fleming blends the sophistication of the best English mystery writers such as Dorothy Sayers with the hard-boiled edginess of the best American detective fiction. The prose is clean, lean, and literate. Bond is an iron fist in a velvet glove. His taste in food and wine is flawless. He kills with grim determination, as needed. Snobbery is evident in his character. Bond does not tolerate fools gladly. He is fiercely loyal to his friends, of which he has very few. Darko Kerim is a brilliant exception to Bond's rule of keeping people at a distance. Darko lives a life of furious indulgence, even dissipation. Darko dreads only the Iron Crab, Ian Fleming's personal vision of the Grim Reaper. On a lighter note, delectable women are also admitted into Bond's affections. Tatiana Romanova joins the ranks of Bond \\"girls,\\" although her loyalties are questionable. Rosa Klebb is a change from Fleming's megalomaniac super-villains. She ruthlessly works behind the scenes, and does not aspire to hold the world for ransom. Klebb is also one of Fleming's most repulsive characters. She is of indeterminate sexual inclinations and disgusting personal habits. Grant, a true madman, is as cold-blooded a killer as ever presented in mystery-adventure fiction. The novel ends ambiguously. Much as Conan Doyle, Fleming considered the idea of killing his main character.Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are a mesmerizing read filled with action and suspense. I have read these books multiple times since the 1960s, and still thrill to the experience. The locales are exotic, and the major characters are more finely developed than in most mystery-adventure fiction. The Penguin editions also feature great cover art. Recommended for serious genre fans. ;-)"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The best Fleming ever. 007 is assigned to retrieve a decoding machine, the Spektor, from a girl who will defect only if 007 fetches her.

Darko Kerim is a fantastic character as Head of Station T(for Turkey). The locales, from Istanbul to the Orient Express, are all vividly described.

Until then, it was an interesting reversal, reading like a typical Bond novel, but focused on his foes including mission briefings and so forth.Once introduced to the plot, Bond basically blunders through, oblivious to anything resembling tradecraft or even common sense, and comes across as an arrogant amateur. And his admiration of Darko Kerim seems ill-placed given that the man laughingly admits to kidnapping and rape in his misspent youth. Haha, what a rake...The writing is generally lazy. Every character who encounters Tatiana has to compare her to a young Greta Garbo (including herself admiring her reflection in a mirror!). Nash constantly calls Bond \\"old man\\" until it's as tiresome to the reader as it is for 007 himself.All said, don't get me wrong. It's not a bad book, not even a bad Bond novel, but it's hardly the best in the series. The Orient Express and Turkey sequences are suitably exotic and the ending is not to be missed, so it's worth a look at least."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The very first Ian Fleming novel that I read is also, in my opinion, the best of Fleming's novels. Red Grant is by far one of the best villians in the series. The book also features one of the series' best 'sacrificial lambs', the character of Darco Kerim Bey. I absolutely loved the ending. It is not one to miss."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"'Doesn't do to get mixed up with neurotic women in this business. They hang on your gun-arm, if you know what I mean.'Wikipedia says that JFK had listed Fleming's From Russia With Love among his 10 favorite books. That might be a bit overdone, but the book really is a pleasant surprise.I was motivated to pick it up by Javier Mar&iacute;as' Your Face Tomorrow, which refers to Fleming's brief Rosa Klebb biography, mentioning the Spanish civil war history around Andreas Nin, the POUM leader who was killed by Stalin's thugs.In essence, this is a well told satirical rendering of a Russian attempt at upsetting the British secret service by killing one of their top agents. The humor is kept low key so as not to smother the suspense element, but it is there all the time. Like in a good Bond movie.I will not go so far as to claim that this is authentic Cold War history, but it is certainly well rooted in it. Fleming knew this world.It fits well with other recent and current reading of mine, like the Orwell diaries, or a biography of a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; to the US, and a German novel about Jewish refugees in Shanghai. Good for a relaxing intermission.The presence of Uncle Joe's spooks did not quite reach \`omnipresence' status, but they were a fact of life.By the time of this story, Stalin is already dead, but we are clearly in the house that he (and Beria) built."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Istambul in this book seems a no-man's-land where British and Soviet agents fight it out with no intereference from any local authority. The Turks in this book do not seem to have any security service of their own, their police is completely apathetic, and foreigners can just fight it out on Turkish soil any way they like. You need not be an expert on Turkey to know this is false. If anything, Turkey has too much of security services rather then too little, and they would certainly have taken a hand in such going-ons as this book describes. Fleming was a bit lazy to just ignore this factor, which could have made the book more interesting.Darko Kerim is a fascinating charcter, if one ignores his gross male chauvinism (of course the entire James Bond series is not excatly politicially correct). He is also a first-rate agent and runs an excellent network. But only a MADMAN would make him the HEAD of the British spy agency in Turkey. A local man, with his own agenda which is not neccesarily in accord with the diplomatic and political interest of the United Kingdom, who is at least half a criminal and gagnster, who conducts private alliances and vendettas with Soviet agents and gypsy tribes. To let such a man run completely free of supervison? Total, irresponsible madness. There should be a regular properly trained British agent on the spot, to keep a close watch on him and his family members. And since there was no such agent, what do they do? Blow up the soviet Consulate in retaliation for the detah of the partriach! British agents blow up a Soviet consulate. A ring of Turks financed and affiliated to the British Secret Service just undertake this kind of major major major interntional provocation on thier own as a private revenge, of course without any authorisation from London or bothering to let London know they were going to do it. And the story just goes over the incident for one page, notes the fact and goes on with the plot.If they Soviets had a gram of sense, they would have discarded the whole plot against James Bond, since they just got a hundred times better one handed to them on a platter. An opportunity to throughly emabarass the British Secret Service (much more than the whole carefully concotted plot could possibly have done), create a major diplomatic row between Britain and its NATO ally Turkey, a major scandal inside Britian. At the very bare minimum, Her Majesty's Government would demand M.'s head on a platter, and he would fully deserve sacking for letting these Turkish kids play with fire near the powder keg.Of course, all that would make for quite a different kind of book, more Le Carre than Fleming."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I grew up being taken to the Bond flicks by my parents. I guess that made me think that the books they were based upon were mere vehicles for screenplays. I do not remember much of this movie (except the final scene) but I can not imagine it was nearly as good as the book.I was amazed at the quality of writing. Fleming can portray bad guys as well as anyone, if not better. He built suspense from the first page and never let it diminish. Amazingly, we do not see James Bond until the book is about a third of the way through. Once we do, he is classic Bond. Fleming throws a bit of tongue-in-cheek to add to the charm of the hero.The gambit as devised by the Russians is terrific and nuanced. Bond's floundering then overcoming then....well can't give the end is classic, yet still \\"delicious\\".My one disappointment is that Bond never ordered a martini.A fun and terrific read. Fleming does spies as well as anyone, including LeCarre, but he does it with excitement and a bit of humor. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Ian Fleming's fifth James Bond novel, &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; (1957), remains one of the most popular and exciting in the series. Here we see all the attributes that made Fleming such a remarkable thriller writer--the brilliant descriptive passages, the superb characterization, the ability to inject tension and suspense into the narrative until the inevitable explosion of violence. &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; has it all, and then some.The plot is among Fleming's most ingenious. SMERSH, the Soviets' dreaded counterintelligence agency, hatches to a plot to kill Bond and humiliate the British Secret Service. Using an unwitting girl and a valuable piece of Russian hardware, the Russians lure Bond to Istanbul, setting the plot in motion. Along the way, we meet the grotesque Rosa Klebb, head of torture and murder for SMERSH, and Red Grant, SMERSH's chief executioner. Grant, in particular, is a chilling character, a bloodthirsty psychopath with a lust for killing. When Bond crosses his path, Fleming produces some of the most gripping writing of his career. Fantastic stuff.All in all, &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot; is a superb thriller, though I found the narrative rather slack during Bond's time in Istanbul. That minor quibble aside, this is a must-read for Bond fans and one of Fleming's finer accomplishments."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Good book from so many years ago. Some things written then are not too PC for these days and would be chopped by the censors, I am sure. They called it like it was back then, too bad times have changed so much.Need more of the $1.99 specials and I would buy the whole set"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"&#34;From Russia with Love&#34; is the best Bond book I have read so far and I have read through half a dozen others.This book, unlike the others, did not start slow and it did not even get to Bond until Chapter 11! Flemming seemed inspired when he wrote this one, even mentioning that the organization of SMERSH was a real Soviet counter spy organization and noting its location to match his recording of it in the book.Overall, I have enjoyed the Bond books quite a lot. They have a fascinating authenticity when it comes to the pace, action and people's thinking, while having a flair for the dramatic and, yes, romance. Also, they were written in a time just prior to our own where opinions were not steeped in modern mores and give a refreshingly different view of things. I like the Bond character and his temperament which has a nice polish to it.This book shows how much Flemming's writing skill excelled in the series."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fire & Ice'From Russia with Love' was reported to be one of President John F. Kennedy's favourite books, and with good reason. It is considered to be Ian Fleming's best Bond book, packed with vivid descriptions of characters and places and driven by an intricate plot that grips the reader from the beginning and draws them inexorably to the ending. The reason that I love this book (which is beautifully read on the '007 Reloaded' CD audio books by Toby Stevens)is that the characters are so beautifully and vividly drawn, so that, even if they are villains, I can't wait to see them back on the pages.In my view, this book ranks as literature with a capital 'L' and, if you only read one Bond book, read this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Im 21 years old and ive become a very picky reader.I've grown up watching all of the bond films and enjoying every second of it all, i love the whole bond universe.And a few months ago a professor had told me that the bond books were a fantastic read and were very much like the movies.She had also told me that her favorite book was \\"from Russia with love\\"So i decided to pick up this book a few days ago and i was in love with it.The whole setting, mood, everything about the novel was just beautifully crafted and kept me interested and hooked.I highly recommend this, for anyone!PS: i enjoyed this book so much that i couldn't turn the pages quick enough haha"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Of course I'd seen the movie before reading the book. My interest in the book was mainly to see how it held up after 55 years in print. I believe it has held up quite well. Ian Fleming's writing, while sounding very British, has a strong sense of presence and control. The spy of the 1950s doesn't have all the physical training and guns/explosives/electronics found currently in the genre, but Fleming's James Bond novels have a strong sense of story, character and detail that is frequently lost with the weaponry focus in many of today's novels. It's hard not to think of the movie as you read the novel, but the &#34;From Russia with Love&#34; film was early enough in the Bond series that is stayed relatively true to the novel and the two complimented each other. You can see Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Robert Shaw and especially Pedro Armendariz as you read the book and the character images work well. My biggest surprise in the book was how the James Bond character did not make an appearance in the book until almost a third of the way into the story."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"All my comments about the Bond books will be the same so if this reads familiar, you have read it on another of them. I read these years ago when the movies started, when Craig did Casino Royale I decided to re-read it, (Casino Royale) again, I then decided to re-read all the early ones, which I think are superior reads, but that is just me (obviously).The movie from which this book is based is considered to be the best of the early movies, without the pizazz and gadgetry of 'Goldfinger'. It should be noted also that this book was written before Dr. No which is sort of important. The opening of the movie Dr No discusses Bond getting a new gun, this was caused by an incident in the book 'From Russia...' but ignored in the movie for obvious reasons.Anyway, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Very interesting plot, and the story was well written. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the ending. I didn't like the way the author left several possibilities open for the final ending of this story. I prefer a neat finish.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and action stories."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"As I watched the last 007 movie I couldn't help but want more....quick read now I want more James Bond."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is a great book from a great seller. It arrivedquickly in great condition. My copy was almost pristine. A very clean copy, the Dust-jacket was fresh and there were no marked or bent pages. Very goodpeople to deal with."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"&#34;From Russia With Love&#34; is fun on many levels. We have the suave James Bond who the Russians have targeted for assasination, hoping it will demoralize the vaunted British Secret Service. We have the gorgeous double agent whose goal it is to trick Bond into thinking she's madly in love with him and will turn over a high tech decoder to prove it. We have the classic Fleming villian that's highly skilled with a fetish for blood. Lastly, there's the quirky KJ B handler who is spookily dangerous and may be the first female villain to sport a faint mustache..Fleming makes this a fun journey by using his first-hand knowledge of spydom based on his extensive travel and a career in Naval Intelligence. The Bond we see in &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; is a man with flaws. He's smart, skilled, stylish, loyal, but at the same time easily deceived by the lovely Tatiana Romanova and a littly sloppy in places. This makes it all the more fun. Istanbul, gypsies, a billboard with a spy getting shot coming out of Marilyn Monroe's mouth, rats in the sewers and exploding gimmicks. The book gives much more background than the movie, as only books can. Have a fun ride."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"After only reading 6 Flemming Bond Novels, this is by far one of the best. Right from the start, Flemming introduces a menace of a character (Red Grant) who plays a major part in a clever trap created by SMERSH to put Bond to his death. There is some great character development in this novel, especially the relationship between Bond and his counterpart in Turkey, Kerim Bay. There are some believable ememies and great locations. The train journey on the Orient Express is the main highlight of this book. This is a must for all Bond fans, make sure you have Dr. No ready for when you've finished this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"As 007 creaps closer to being on the big screen Ian Fleming's novels get even better. Although there is a slow first few chapters it starts to speed up when charecters like General G, Rosa Klebb, &amp; Kronsteen. The conference room is very well written (and it features references to Fleming's first four novels. Then the gypsy camp sequence - both sexy and violent - is another well written sequence as is the death of Krilencu. On the Orient express is the next good part where Bond fights Norman Nash (Red Grant) in a train cabin. Then the book closes up when James Bond fights Col. Klebb in the Paris Ritz. From London to Moscow. From Greece to Italy. From Paris to Istanbul. From Russia, with Love is Fleming's best."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Few authors pack as much action into relatively short novels as Ian Fleming does. See the &quot;007&quot; insignia and you automatically think Bond movies - but give credit where credit is due. In today's television-movie-computer age, Fleming's seemingly ancient novels go unnoticed. &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; is simply one of the most outrageously entertaining pieces of literature ever written. If you've seen all the movies, please remember the books. Read Fleming for the ultimate &quot;007&quot; experience."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fleming's Bond books are simply fun to read and this particular one is one of the better ones in the series. The stories, i.e. books, must be read with the realization that they are fiction, but also with an eye on the past. In the early and late fifties people looked at things quite differently than they do now. For better or for worse, things just were not as \\"politically correct\\" as they are in this day and age. For better or for worse, most people at that time accepted this. I do agree, having lived quite a few years in Turkey, and love the place, that Fleming quite likely did not have his \\"Turkish facts\\" quite in line. On the other hand, the author was trying to entertain with a nice wild story. He was successful in doing this with this story. Now, as when this book was first published, I read this sort of book from time to time as they relax me, they are a flight of fantasy. I like that and need that. For Bond fans, as I said, this is one of the better ones. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I am a fan of the Bond Books by Ian Flemming and From Russia With Love is a really good book. I got for a good price too. Will recommend the book and author. It downloaded pretty fast too. Not hard to read on my iPod Touch - bought it from Kindle."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I recently read three of the Bond novels and From Russia With Love was easily the best of the three; Fleming works in factual information about SMERSH (which actually existed) and the MGB (a KGB predeccesor), making this one of the least fantastic of the Bond novels. The character of Darko Kerim is great fun. And if you've seen the movie, and then read this book, you'll see why Robert Shaw was brilliantly cast as the sociopathic Grant."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I don't like giving \\"spoilers\\" I'll give general comments, it's pretty similar to the film anyway though. I like how the first half of the book concentrates on Bond's enemies, The reader gets a real inside-look at the Russian side of espionage, the loyalty of Russian spies is quite remarkable as they really consider their homeland to be like their \\"mother\\" and appreciate everything the state has provided for them. I didn't mind at all that Bond was hardly mentioned for the first hundred pages, it made for a better build up when Bond must confront the villians. The espionage is this book is more deep and involving than in the other Bond Novels. If you're going to read a few Fleming novels, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I'd recommend this book or Casino Royale if you're curious about the 007 series but don't want to read more than one or two. \\"From Russia with Love\\" showcases Ian Fleming's background in military intelligence (MI5) for the British navy during World War II. The movie stays pretty much true to the book -- except for the ending. JFK was right to praise this book. It's macabre to note that Bond novels and movies -- especially this one -- sometimes have mild anti-Communist themes and that Marxist subversives (Oswald and Sirhan) killed both Kennedys in the '60s."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is one of my favorites! Author Fleming has an interesting style all his own- he is very creative when it comes to his description of characters and gadgets. It is a little quirky and kinky in parts. That seems odd and out of place, but it is a really fun story."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This novel goes back to the world of super villain espionage. Bond's successes against SMERSH are starting to cause problems for the assassin organisation, and get them political heat from higher up. As a result, they plan to send a top guy to rid them of their 007 problem. Unfortunately for SMERSH, Bond gets a bit of help from Q-Branch.The Soviets try the beautiful double agent gambit again, but this one falls for his manly charms.The SMERSH agent finale is attempted murder on the Orient Express. No torture for Bond, but he ends up in a bad way."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"While it's a little campy, here (I mean, the SMERSH directorate is portrayed like a typical anti-Russian thriller, almost like Boris & Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle, just about) it's still a good story. Don't just kill a British spy to set back the British Secret Intelligence Service, kill him \\"with ignominy\\". Embarrass the spy and the whole service in the process, creating a scandal that will rock Britain worse than Philby, Burgess & MacLean.In the movie, SPECTRE (from Thunderball) plays both the Soviets and the British for fools and uses them as bait to each other. In the book version, Smiert Shpionam (SMERSH), the Russian assassination squad, is behind the plot to scandalize and kill James Bond, using a soviet Spektor coding machine and a lovely young Russian woman as bait. It almost works, too.The main characters are convincing, except for the Soviet agents. They're still a bit too Boris & Natasha for me. But that does NOT detract from a wonderful book, a real relic from the Cold War for which we feel nostalgia in this day of stateless actors and terrorism. I still give it five stars."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I just finished reading FRWL a 2nd time, with 10 yrs between readings. It's a nice contrast to the rambling texts that litter today's best seller lists. Again I enjoyed the crisp, tight prose; the delayed introduction of Bond's character; the villians and heroes; the \\"cultural\\" drama of the Cold War. It's truly an espionage tale \\"par excellence.\\" I concur with other 5-star reviews -- stop reading here and pick up the book!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"They couldn't write a book like this today. For example, the main character--Bond--doesn't even show up until page 123! The entire first third of the book is a detailed following of the villains plotting Bond's death. It's not until we get to the execution that we meet James Bond.Be that as it may, I found it to be an interesting change of pace, and I was never bored. There is more espionage than action, but when the fighting occurs, it is quick and brutal. Fleming can make you cringe with his viscious descriptions of down-and-dirty combat.Aside from the lengthy intro without Bond, the movie version seems to have followed the book rather closely (especially compared to some others). However, the Bond of the books is a different man than the Bond of the movies. He's fallible, and prone to getting his heart broken. This, I like. But as another reviewer mentioned, he makes some pretty serious mistakes that nearly cost him his life. It can be hard to root for him as a secret agent at times like this. Still, I do.And, at least once in each Fleming Bond novel, there seems to be something \\"inappropriate\\" by today's standards. This is half the fun of reading them. (In \\"From Russia With Love,\\" Tania asks Bond to beat her if she overeats and gets fat, and Bond readily agrees. Hilarious!)"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I am not a big spy novel reader. But, I had heard that the Bond novels were a great read. I was not disappointed. Fleming's writing style is excellent. The word that comes to my mind to describe the style is smooth. Unlike the Bond movies, the action is delayed until the middle of the book, which creates exciting tension. I think I will try some of the other Bond books and see some of the movies again."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"In From Russia with Love, Ian Fleming weaves the fifth tale of his James Bond adventures. Certainly this book is a classic, and the film was one of the best. In this tale, SMERSH decides to take out Bond permanently to make a point to the worldwide intelligence community and to divert attention from mistakes made by the Russians. To accomplish this mission, SMERSH calls on their chief assassin to do the deed. He is a memorable character, but in the end proves to be no match for Bond. The inevitable love interest comes along as Tatiana Romanova, a beautiful young Russian woman. Of course, the story would not be complete without Rosa Klebb, the head of the Department of Torture and Death for SMERSH. All of these characters, plus the memorable Turk Kerim Bey, are involved in a unforgettable ride on the Orient Express. This is a must-read James Bond adventure."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"By this time, the fifth novel, Ian Fleming has mastered the character of James Bond and the story telling that goes with. There is a lot of action in this story, but I didn't really feel it was worth five stars-more like four and a half. A couple of things kind of made the lower score for me. One reason being that Bond doesn't even show up in the novel until page 95. Don't get me wrong, the story building up to the main plot is very interesting and informative, but those who want just Bond might not care for the first ninety five pages that much.The other thing, which is a good thing, is that this novel is actually very much like the movie! All the books previous to this one are some what very different from the movie, but this is real close, a lot of the lines from the movie are in the book. It's not a big deal, but it does get a little dull knowing what is going to happen and does happen. If you have seen the movie, then you pretty much get the idea of the book. Overall, this is a really well written story and an improvement over the novel Diamonds Are Forever. It's just that it is so similar to the movie, there are really no surprises."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Fleming does a great job introducing us to all of the characters in this novel. Like the movie this novel allows us to see Bond as a secret agent, not a superman saving the world. A must read for all Bond Movie fans."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"From Russia with Love has all the elements a good spy thriller should have: exotic settings (Istanbul, the Orient Express), silenced pistols, beautiful foreign women, sex, code machines, et al. It's thicker than the other Fleming novels, but so rich in detail and description that even the most impatient reader will cruise right along. It also shows how cookie-cutter boring modern thriller writers have become. Nobody writes like Ian Fleming."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"In this novel the Soviet murder organization SMERSH sets out to disgrace and assasinate Bond. To accomplish this they use the sexy Corporal Tanya Romanov to lure Bond into a deadly trap."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Jack Kennedy was right! This is one of the best spy thrillers ever. Bond travels across grim, war torn early 50s Europe to steal a decoding device not knowing that he is a pawn in a morbid game of human chess courtesy of an elite Russian death squad. All the villians feel authentic (unlike the more comic book style villians in the later books) from the shadowy manipulators in the Soviet high command to the cold, psychopathic assasins in the field. Ignore the movie which distorts the book's plot and ruins the mood with weak attempts at humor."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Oh yes, those beautiful Russian girls and their decoders can really tie you into knots. Isn't that right Mr. James Bond?"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is one of my favorite James Bond books. I read it as a child and I recently repurchased it for the Kindle to reread it. I still own all of the original paperback books but they are so fragile that I am afraid to read them as I fear they may come unbound.I liked this book a lot because of the detailed plot by SMERSH and their plans to entrap Bond and kill him. The assassin is a master killer with a devious and detailed plan to complete his mission. I won't ruin the story for you but you probably already know it from reading the book before or watching the movie.I think that Ian Fleming was at his best writing when he wrote this book. I feel that in his mind the Bond character was fully developed as well as the hated of the Russians for Bond who always seemed to be able to thwart their devious plans with his skills. This story is solid and well written with love, romance, murder, trickery and suspense in it. I truly enjoyed this story and it is one of my favorites. If you are a James Bond and Ian Fleming fan then this is a must read for you. Even the ending is dramatic!"},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Really, a cliff hanger, that is just messed up. It's a good thing I know that Bond doesn't die, or I'd be really mad."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"The ending was rather disappointing bit bigger than that a very developed plot with quite a few hair raising, edge of your seat moments."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"Very familiar with the Bond Film, the novel does not disappoint. Gives more insight into the characters and was an enjoyable read. I will download more from this author."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"This is the second Bond novel I've read (out of order, it would seem). I enjoyed it. By today's standards it is very compact; one could finish it in a day or two. I am again struck that, unlike Bond of the movies, this Bond is more introspective, more vulnerable, and makes mistakes that have consequences. I would also guess that modern women would not be so enamored of this character, or of this novel and it's portrayal of women.I found the plot to be a little bit implausible, a little too much planning and effort on the part of the Russians to get Bond for what would probably be, in reality, a minor payoff. I also felt like there was a lot of buildup of the Kerim character for not much payoff at the end of the book. Without giving it away - it's the kind of thing that works if this were published as a serial, but less satisfying in a novel. The treatment of the Russians is interesting. They are ruthless and efficient, but you also get glimpses of a human side."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"I've read this book in my younger days, and still find the book as enjoyable today as I did back then."},{"Title":"From Russia with Love","review":"My wife is a big James Bond 007 fan, loves the movies with Daniel Craig, esp.

A little far-fetched even for bond, but still fun. Would def recommend."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Tim Severin's obsession with recreating legendary voyages, or providing working support for theories of migration, leads him to build a full-sized replica of St. Brendan's boat and follow his famous voyage. To do this he had to research the probable type of boat that Brendan used, and try to extrapolate a likely route from the very obscure 'details' in Brendan's writings.Having established that the most likely vessel was a curragh, he had to gather the raw materials and a team of experts to construct it in the traditional manner. The tale of how he gets his experts is worth the price of the book in itself! The man must have the luck of the Irish to have everything fall so neatly into place (after a discouraging start).The unravelling of fact from fiction (or our interpretation of fact as fiction...?) took many long and painful hours of studying texts and maps. Given that latitude and longitude were strangers to Brendan, only the vaguest hints of distance and direction were available to Mr. Severin. However, a plausible map of Brendan's route was cobbled together, taking prevailing winds, tides and leeway into consideration.Armed with this, and a more than serviceable boat, the bold explorers ventured forth.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by going into more detail. Suffice to say that almost everything that Brendan described is accounted for by natural phenomena - giving the lie to those academics who dismissed the voyage as a figment of a monk's fevered imagination.A very enjoyable read, with Mr Severin's usual hearty enthusiasm pulling you along with him. *****"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Not too much to add to the many positive reviews. Just that this book is multifaceted--it is a modern and historical adventure story. An archeological reflection. A wonderful geography lesson. One could jump from this book to so many further areas of exploration. Many interesting conversations generated by 1. the possibility that many people traveled Europe to America throughout the years, 2. the original manuscript of Brendan's voyage and its descriptions of fantastical events, 3. the whales and bird life that the modern and ancient adventurers encountered, 4. the faith and courage that these monks must have had to go sailing off into the wild ocean in a leather boat.Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Put these textbooks away!In these times of learning these two subjects by rote and textbooks, I have a great alternative. The Brendan Voyage is full of adventure, and fun. Yes, this book will teach history and geography. My daughter and I picked this up while studying the middle ages. We have learned so much. This book tells the story of a voyage made in the 1970s to prove that a leather boat, actually sailed from Europe to the New World before the Vikings. The original sailor was none other than Saint Brendan, and some other Irish monks.This is the story of Tim Severin and three of his friends who built, stocked and sailed this magnificent sail boat.In the middle of their struggle with huge waves, icebergs and whales, we are regaled with the deep history of Greenland, Iceland the Faroe Islands and more. My daughter and I have enjoyed every chapter and learned about an area of the world that is usually not mentioned in textbooks because they are so distant and seemingly so unimportant on the large scheme of things. Get it, you will be entranced!"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Tim Severin and his intrepid crew recreate Brendan and his fellow monks' voyage in the 6th century from Ireland to North America in a small ox-hide boat (curragh). The natural materials and traditional techniques that Brendan used are authentically utilized to make the Brendan voyage a successful historical re-creation and a thrilling sea adventure.Tim Severin is a born storyteller. As far as a historical re-creation event, this voyage has some parallels to the Kon-Tiki expedition. The reason for making the Brendan voyage was to answer the question: Did Irish monks sail across the Atlantic centuries before the Vikings?This book relates an amazing seafaring adventure. There is one scene where the sea is calm when a pod of orcas spot the Brendan (boat's name). The orca alpha bull comes full tilt at the boat, dorsal fin eight feet above the water line. The crew holds their breath as the bull whale swims under the boat, checking out this strange thing. After an eternal minute of silence, they watch the bull surface and swim back to the pod. High drama indeed.Tim Severin and his crew are the very definition of intrepid. Severin's level of enthusiasm is amazing; it is never diminished by the cold, wet, and treacherous sailing conditions. His composure as the captain of this little boat is compelling and inspirational.I would also suggest getting a copy of the hardbound edition, which unfortunately is out of print. The photos of this voyage tell every bit as much of this story as does the text.Highly recommended.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"The Brendan Voyage is the true-life story of what has been called the greatest epic voyage in modern Irish history. Author Tim Severin and his friends built a boat using only techniques and materials available in the sixth-century A.D., when St. Brendan allegedly sailed to America. The vessel consisted of forty-nine ox hides stitched together and stretched over a wooden frame, yet it was a seaworthy creation capable of withstanding storms and a puncture from pack ice during its voyage from Brandon Creek in Dingle to Newfoundland. Now in a new edition, The Brendan Voyage has been translated into twenty-seven languages, and proves that St. Brendan could have indeed reached America - though whether he actually did is a conundrum left to historians.

I purchased it at Amazon and was perfectly satisfied with the service.Tom Mason, Fredericksburg, VA"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Is this history, discovery, drama or destiny? Actually, The Brendan Voyage is all that and more! Tim Severin weaves together several gripping narratives, each as fascinating as the others. It is first and foremost an epic adventure story - the tale of an heroic band of intrepid men who brave every kind of danger to sail across the Atlantic in a tiny, handmade leather boat. It is secondly a research puzzle as Severin and his team attempt to recreate, down to the tiniest detail, sixth century technology, using only authenticated skills, techniques and materials. It is also an inspirational travelogue that overlays the seemingly fantastical accounts of St Brendan and his companions onto the actual experiences of Severin's crew to \\"prove\\" that the original journey not only happened, but did so in the way the medieval text describes. As a bonus, The Brendan Voyage is finally an uplifting tale of our common humanity, showing how ordinary people of diverse backgrounds and languages emerged at critical and unexpected moments to provide vital assistance without which the journey would never have succeeded.This is an all-encompassing book that educates, inspires and amazes. Read it!"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"This is a book that unfortunately can be read very quickly.The author sets out to prove that the journal of St.Brenden is notas always susposed,alogorical, but a very real tale.With painstaking authenticity he seeks out old timers on the west coast of Ireland who still know how to make boats from bull hide,and sets them the task of building to spec the boat of St.Brenden.The rest is as you might imagine; a voyage to America in a 6th century leather boat.Magnificient story of courage and man against the sea."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"I happen to like back stories and all the technical stuff. The author doesn't just write about the actual construction of the boat, he writes about the people who supplied him with the materials for construction and why those materials worked better than others might. Some nice descriptions of the people involved. Unforseens, like how bad grease covered cow hides smell. The learning curve of sailing this kind of vessel. In the beginning of my reading this book I found myself grumbling that the map near the front of the book didn't list a lot of locations. (I have a hardback copy that was published in 1978). I discovered that there are maps scattered through the book along with color photographs. One very unfortunate things was the tossing overboard of anything that the crew found unnecessary. 'Twas the times. I hope we've improved in our sensitivity."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"The Irish were here in the New World to greet the Vikings when they arrived.

In it Tim Severin carefully outlines the steps used to create a medieval boat from timber frame and animal skin fabric to sail from Ireland to Canada across cold and stormy seas. It is then an exciting retelling of Severin's exciting trip to prove that Brendan could have sailed to the New World as chronicled. An excellent book sure to captivate the reader."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"I found this to be a thoroughly engrossing read and I have never sailed a boat. I generally got lost when the bow, stern, aft, and other nauticals were mentioned...but I loved this book. What these men did seemed extraordinary to me. If the prep and voyage were not truly amazing, then it was Tim Severin's writing style that made it seem so.One thought continues to strike me...Would this voyage be replicable today , nearly 35 years later. The craftsmen involved in the details of the boat's construction are dying out and few are coming along in their stead. Would it even be possible to find someone to replace the harness maker who taught the crew how to stitch the leather hides together?Did this voyage take place at a propitious moment in time? And has that time passed now for all eternity?"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Tim Severin does a great job of convincing the reader that indeed St. Brendan should be credited with the first European visit to the New World more than a thousand years before Columbus.

It's really a modern epic. Inspiring!"},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"I almost put the book down while reading the first half, but stuck with it, and was rewarded in the second half. I wasn't interested in hearing about the cultures of the places where the boat crew came ashore. Actually, I wasn't interested in reading about anything but the \\"voyage\\" proper. And, in this book, you'll get info about the history of some of the places they landed and other \\"side info\\". As a result, I found the first half of the book slow and boring.Nonetheless, once they began the largest leg of the journey, and couldn't land anywhwere, the book picked up pace and held my interest. It turned out to be quite a voyage and a heck of a feat. In the end, I'm glad I read it. But, with that said, I'd have been disappointed had I paid full price for the book."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Tim Severin, joined by a small crew of hardy men, set out to test the plausibility of the legend of St. Brendan's voyage from Ireland to Newfoundland. They built and sailed their own leather curragh (a type of Irish boat design), and this is the story of both the construction and the voyage.The unique value of this book is in its equal appeal to a wide variety of readers. If you enjoy the intricacies of craftsmanship using leather, wood and grease; if you like great adventure travel; if you tire of hearing ancient legends cavalierly dismissed and would like to see one defended; if you love seafaring tales; if you love and/or trace lineage to Ireland; this book is for you. Severin is a self-effacingly enjoyable storyteller one can't help but like--and, apparently, one heck of a captain.Based upon this book I now plan to read my way through Severin's complete works. This is that rare book in which tremendous accomplishment and great storytelling have the wind on their quarter."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Here is a book about a group of adventurers who recreate an infamous journey, just to see if it is possible. St. Brendan is, in legend and myth, thought to have crossed the atlantic ocean centuries before the Vikings and Columbus. He did this in a boat made of oxen hide or LEATHER. A leather boat crossing the atlantic ocean, most researchers (and sailors) would say it is impossible and could not be done. These men recreate the voyage using technology that was available at the time. The builders of the modern-day-ship Brendan, are true to their craft. They build their craft using medival techniques and materials. In the Traditon of &quot;Kon-tiki&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot;, this book tells the story of how they built it and sailed it across the atlantic.

I had this book sitting on my &quot;to be read&quot; pile for months, then I picked it up, and, well, there went the next 3 hours....Severin has written a real page turner about his attempt to re-create the hypothetical voyage to the New World by an early Irish monk in an ox-hide boat. While Severin's success does not prove the legend, the modern story alone is worth the price of admission, and his discussion of boat-building techniques &amp; the trials and pitfalls that his team overcame make for a great book."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Did Irish monks cross the Atlantic and reach North America long before the Vikings and Columbus? After reading this book you will cetainly believe that it is plausible. According to the Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis (The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot), an ancient Latin manuscript, indeed the Irish set foot on the Promise Land long before Columbus. To prove this point Severin takes us on a voyage. But not just your weekend trip to the state park. With meticulous detail, Severin- and many others- reconstruct the same sailing craft described in the ancient text, a leather boat, and sail it to Newfoundland. The Brendan Voyage describes how this idea came to be, how the boat was ultimately constructed, and the ordeals the team faced sailing across the Atlantic ocean. Imagine yourself and three others hunkered down in a leather sail boat in between Iceland and Greenland. You have a 1/4&quot; of protection between you and the frigid water beneath. Eight foot waves and 50 mph winds are crashing around you. Your tired, cold, wet, hungry, and you desperately want to make some forward progress, but instead your losing ground. I can't do Severin's writing justice but he made me feel like I was there. I'll stop my babbling now. In a nut shell, if your looking for a great adventure story that is calculated and honest, then give this book a whirl.

In this story he builds a traditional leather boat or 'curragh' to show that monks could have sailed from Ireland to Newfoundland around the seventh century. There is an ancient book called the 'Navagatio' (one old copy is in the British Library) which St Brendan wrote about his voyages around the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought from Brendan's descriptions that he island-hopped via the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland to get to America, and Severin follows this route in a dangerous and interesting adventure taking many weeks. There is much detail on how he built the boat using only traditional methods and materials which was no mean feat in itself despite their still being used in the south-west of Ireland for fishing. The book contains colour photos of the boat's construction and of the diverse and colourful crew who sailed her. The book reminded me of the 'Kon-Tiki' book by Thor Hayerdahl. Also, the pictures are brilliant - and Tim's descriptions of the ports of call such as Iceland and the Faroes are very vivid and realistic. It's a well-written, interesting book and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Bohrer, Borah, Borer","review":"Tim Severin borrowed an account of the voyages of Brendan the Navigator, an Irish Monk from the dark ages. He was taken by the factual nature of some of the sailing directions and descriptions, and got the mad idea into his head that a group of monks sailed across the Atlantic to America hundreds of years before Columbus was born.Then he got an even madder idea, to replicate the voyage.The book intersperses an analysis of the original voyage with the trials and tribulations of recreating it. Along the way we learn a great deal of respect for the quality of the technology in the dark age period. Their skills with wood and leather. Their ability to preserve food, and the skills of sailing.The voyage itself becomes compulsive reading. And how anyone allowed a Faroese Islander to fish for Whales out of a leather boat is beyond me! Sounds incredible? It is.

As Mazur does in his text, Green spends the first 30 pages making the case for cooperative learning in general and peer instruction via concept tests in particular, as well as describing how concept tests can be implimented in the typical large lecture-hall, undergrad intro-astro classroom.Concept tests are multiple choice questions intended to be given shortly after a topic has been covered in a traditional lecture. Small groups of students (usually pairs) try to persuade each other of the correctness of their answer before their final answer is submitted to the instructor.The bulk of the book is found in the fifth chapter which consists of over 400 concept test questions.

The grade school outcast, teacher, American consumer, beggar, junkie, prostitute, wife, husband, painter, drug dealer, janitor, and sister all share the common thread that they are immersed in their roles in life whether they want to be or not, and whether they understand their lives or not. In these stories you can feel what it's like to experience someone else' reality. In the nonjudgmental portrayal of characters it is as if she puts the reader into the living, breathing body of a character to feel its beating heart and desires. The sensual text is paced with the movements of the characters-their breathing, hearts beating, and synapses firing in their brains. She takes the banality of every day life and makes it seem absurd, or dangerous, and mocks the way people embrace the ordinary, trivial things, leaving the reader to question what is really trivial and what is really absurd. The stories are divided into four groups that can barely contain them; such is the diversity of both content and style.If you read the stories in order, at the end you will find yourself in a very different place from where you started. The story I enjoyed most was \\"Cusp\\" which is a coming of age story of a girl who watches the construction of a prison from her secluded attic bedroom window. The erection of the prisonparallels her sexual growth, and just as she reaches sexual ...., the prisoners begin to arrive, when she is ready to begin exploring both her sexuality and the prison. This gutsy author lays it all out on the table for the readers to see things from new perspectives."},{"Title":"Liberty's Excess: Fictions","review":"These fictions are wicked, funny, intelligent, moving, unashamed, and original.

Pursuing the dream ricochets off the page and you are left with only desire. Old myths we've lived by tower and collapse; old rituals foam out the mouth and burn the skin, leaving scars of exhausted creeds and identities. This fiction is a luscious mouth you've been dying to kiss. And there is no languid post-sex smoke after reading these fictions: just bite marks, bruised and succulent. Just a body with a knife and words refusing to surrender. The body doesn't lie. It just gives good fiction. From the fast-food drive-thru to the Marquis de Sade, from the Texaco to Sigmund Freud, from mothers to terrorists to professors to junkies to intellectuals to vagrants to the self--these fictions writhe under the filmy membrane called America. Liberty's excess is a call out, breaking through the thin layer of tissue to let the body/landscape breathe."},{"Title":"Liberty's Excess: Fictions","review":"Exactly what Lidia Yuknavitch means to say, in Liberty's Excess, is unclear. What the reader gets is a clever amalgamation of commentaries and experiences that are &quot;Seedy but aesthetically stunning&quot;(147). Not necessarily aesthetically appealing or beautiful, but certainly stunning. As is becoming an almost necessary trend in writing literature these days, Yuknavitch taps into the basest elements of life in today's world, pressing arduously for shock value. And she delivers. What results is a beautifully written and skillfully structured collection of stories that gorge into the reader's heart or [a number of expletives can be inserted here]. Her stories make the reader ask, &quot;where the heck are the parents?&quot; and &quot;would it make a difference anyway?&quot; and &quot;is there hope?&quot;. After just a couple of stories, the reader turns furiously to the last story, in hope of finding hope. The reader is left with writings that have been &quot;lost to the script of the world; not a story at all. Storied over&quot;(171). Yuknavitch convinces the reader that her stories are what the real world is all about. Throughout Liberty's Excess, the reader begs the author, &quot;please, don't go that way... you know what's there... can't it be something else?&quot; But it can't. Yuknavitch assures that her story's direction is inevitable and, concurrently, jarring. The convictions portrayed are made all the more haunting by the fact that her stories often read more like personal essays, before twisting off into more fictional, imaginative directions. Her ideas are &quot;landmines made from potatoes&quot;(95). Yuknavitch takes real life situations, relationships, and plotlines, which inevitably explode into climactic moments (as in the girl's conversation with her brother in prison, in the story Cusp) that force the reader to question human worth. There is &quot;no difference between flesh and the molecules of dark surrounding&quot;(170); humanity, it seems, is left &quot;laughing in [its] own [excrement], drool, and smile dripping [its] face into dark&quot;(171). Being human, Yuknavitch, seems to say, is no shield or consolation against the world we live in. Instead, it contributes to the filth.And yet, by the book's ending, there is a glimmer of hope. Yuknavitch gives the following message to herself and to her readers: &quot;You are particularly skilled at telling stories, I think.&quot; Maybe it is all a story, a bad dream, a work of art. &quot;Art clings like a parasite,&quot; she proclaims. &quot;I do not want my I. I release it. I give it back to the world&quot;(177). And to the world and the reader: make of this what you wish."},{"Title":"Liberty's Excess: Fictions","review":"\\"She knew the world was filled with wonderfully abnormal stories.\\"--Lidia Yukanavitch, \\"Beauty\\"After immersion in Liberty's Excess, the reader, like one of Yuknavitch's protagonists, is completely full of these abnormal stories yet still yearns for more of her original and disturbing look at American taboos and dysfunction. Switching from first to third person point of view throughout this collection, she paints portraits of characters spread across canvasses so wide-ranged that the reader can't get unstuck from this Salvador Dali-like work of art. At one end, vague statues of liberty and capitalism get ripped apart and made specific through descriptions of a changing neighborhood and an ethnically unaccepting drive-through. On the other end, nudes gather manipulating each other and intertwine so gender is unrecognizable. In the middle is the Americana of having dessert, present-day coupling, factory work, coming-of-age stories, intimate sex, wars, crime, ex-husbands, and Hollywood. Although American culture deforms these protagonists, Yuknavitch writes them without their knowledge of these excuses. The reader semi-consciously follows these characters sometimes questioning erotic actions and other times completely understanding them. At the sentence level, it is amazing how many descriptive words fit perfectly into a concisely Yuknavitch-written sentence. By experimenting with various prose styles that sometimes swerve into prose poetry, form becomes a character to deal with in itself, all the more making the reader struggle with and focus on Yuknavitch's untold American stories."},{"Title":"Liberty's Excess: Fictions","review":"Webster's dictionary defines liberty as freedom from physical restraint, freedom from arbitrary or despotic control, the positive enjoyment of various social, political, or economic rights and privileges, and the power of choice. Excess is defined as the state or an instance of surpassing usual, proper, or specified limits. In her book, Liberty's Excess, Lydia Yuknavitch combines a number of short stories to skillfully represent what it means to take liberties to excess. Yet she is able to express herself on a multitude of levels. Primarily the stories are studies of self-awareness and discovery. Each study being told form a unique perspective and character point of view. Unfortunately, there are a couple of sections that are pretentious in language; a dictionary would most definitely be required in those instances. One story in particular, An Arresting Moment, lost it's meaning for me completely, \\"...and I say Freudian in terms of the uncanny, but one might just as easily refer to Spenserian motifs, looking, the desire to look, the nature of allegory, or Kant, in terms of the nature of the sublime.\\" I also was unclear at it's locating in the grouping of Waiting to See. More often than not, however, the stories contain urban characters that can be easily identified with. Yuknavitch's ability to shift writing styles from simple dialogue, to elaborate description is impressive. Overall I would say this is a very well done collection and would recommend it, but I think the best audience would be one where the reader possesses a good foundational knowledge of literary theory."},{"Title":"Liberty's Excess: Fictions","review":"When I was a kid, I had a dog who, when he was so inclined, would run around in circles chasing his tail. For as long as we had him, he would, apropos of nothing, begin barking and biting at it, going round and round in a frenzy, incensed and outraged that he had found it once again mysteriously creeping up on him. Yet, never running out of hope that he might one day catch it.Reading \\"Liberty's Excess\\" reminds me of that dog. Lidia Yuknavitch is a very capable and affecting writer, as the first third of this collection clearly shows. But in the latter sections of the book, it becomes abundantly clear that she has not escaped the anxiety of influence that haunts her work. She does not hesitate, like the graduate student she once was, to remind the reader of exactly who she's read in her development as a writer. Entitling a story \\"Against Interpretation\\" gives you some idea of the extent to which she feels the need to remind her readers of who informs her work.The last two thirds of the book are essentially comprised of pieces which would have been better served if they had been written as essays, or critiques. Her morbid obsession with the machinations of the body is reminiscent of the infatuation 14 year old boys have with horror movies and comics books. As if transgression could masquerade as profundity. Documenting real or imagined violations is not literature any more than cross word puzzles are substitutes for poetry. Ms. Yuknavitch has apparently heard the endless protestations of those who would posit that criticism is the new literature, and began to believe it. \\"Liberty's Excess\\" is a disappointment not because she does not know how to write, but because she does; and has apparently been distracted from doing so.If it is true that the bohemian's greatest fear is to be caught doing something pedestrian, Ms. Yuknavitch has put her fears on full display. The day she decides to abandon the sophomore conceit that to be different is necessarily to be better, will be the day she comes fully into her own as a new American voice that deserves to be heard."},{"Title":"50 Secrets Your Grocer Doesn't Want You to Know: An Insider's Guide to Stretching Your Grocery Shopping Dollars","review":"I'm a sucker for learning the inside scoop from people who have really worked inside a particular field, so I bought this book.

The truth is so simple, and yet seems so fantastic that you might hesitate to believe it. Along with E. R. Eddison, he is the best writer of fantasy that there ever was, or likely ever shall be (the same could be said of Dunsany as a short story writer in general, and must be, because we are here to tell the truth for a change). Tolkien, for example, is nothing but a pale shadow cast by the sun that is Dunsany; Lovecraft was a rather silly-seeming imitation. Once you have drunk from this well nothing else even comes close; it will almost ruin you for other writers. The question is, if he is just the deepest, saddest, funniest, most clever, most beautiful, and again excepting only Eddison the flat-out best writer of any kind the latter-day Western world has produced -- and he is, brothers and sisters, he IS -- why doesn't everyone know about it? Why has he fallen into obscurity?The reason is simple and obvious. Look around you. The world has gone mad. We have lost all connection to the real. And this great man, this Lord Dunsany, saw it, saw it before almost anyone, saw it happening all around him. And he went out and wrote stories about it, stories that are the least real things ever created on the surface -- but touch the very highest levels of reality in their deeper parts. It is just those parts that are invisible or despised in our mad world, and that is why he is hated, ignored, forgotten -- by all but a few, a few who can peer through those veils of madness. Dunsany's work is not escapism. It is literature, literature of the highest order; literature of an exponentially higher order than any of the garbage pushed down our throats by the academics and pseudointellecutal humanities majors whose task it is to maintain this madhouse of a world -- you know, the kinds of people who despise Lord of the Rings and talk themselves into believing that deviant, culture-destroying nut cases such as James Joyce are great writers.Brothers and sisters, you have found the source of that which you have so long sought. This book, all his best books, are a door into another world, a saner and better world, a world within you waiting to be discovered. Buy this book. Buy all of Dunsany's short story collections, especially the early ones. They will haunt your dreams forever and if you let them, they might even change your life, all without your noticing quite how, why, or when."},{"Title":"The Book of Wonder","review":"This is the fifth collection of ironic yet gorgeous tales to be published by Lord Dunsany. Like its four predecessors, it was accompanied by equally splendid illustrations by Sidney Sime. Sime's illustrations add to each of the books in which they appear. In this book, however, where the illustrations came first and inspired most of the fourteen stories, their omission is more than a mere inconvenience.

The sacking of Bombasharna is to be their last hurrah before retirement...\\"Miss Cubbidge and the Dragon of Romance\\" - If princesses are in short supply, sometimes a dragon might have to kidnap the daughter of a member of Parliament.\\"Probable Adventure of Three Literary Men\\" - \\"When the nomads came to El Lola they had no more songs, and the question of stealing the golden box arose in all its magnitude.\\" The legendary thief Slith, along with two assistants because of the weight of the box of poems, are chosen to make the attempt.\\"The Quest of the Queen's Tears\\" - Sylvia, Queen of the Woods, cannot love any of her suitors, but as a compromise, will consent to marry the first man who can move her to tears.\\"The Wonderful Window\\" - The mysterious window was being offered for sale in the streets of London, and its price is all you possess."},{"Title":"The Book of Wonder","review":"It can only be guessed at why this book was out of print in the US until recently.

Full of gods and goblins, royals and dragons, this is some of Dunsany's best-known work.It's a mix of all kinds of fantasy tales: a man whose interest in his imaginary land eclipses the real world; a magical window that shows amazing things; suitors try to make a cold-hearted queen cry; the story of the Gibbelins, who eat \\"nothing less good than man\\"; and of Miss Cubbins and the Dragon of Romance.Most entertaining is the tale of Chu-bu and Sheemish: idol Chu-bu is inceansed when a new idol (Sheemish) is moved into his temple. So Chu-bu and Sheemish start insulting each other. And their resulting babyish squabble has the power to level a city and destroy a civilization, and the victor doesn't exactly live on in glory....Dunsany's fantasies aren't as vibrantly realistic as J.R.R.

The authors do a fine job of laying out their philosophy and walking the reader through each step of their customer-focused sales process. This process is neither earthshaking nor mindbending. Instead, it is off-center enough to be innovative and intuitive enough to seem real, even before you implement it for yourself.Readers looking for alternatives to hard-sell, &quot;close-of-the-week&quot; approaches will consider &quot;Conceptual Selling&quot; a welcome find. The authors do a good job of including check lists, work sheets and high-level summaries of key points and processes. The result is a book you can quickly put to good use and a resource you can easily return to time and again.The only flaw in the book (the reason for four, instead of five stars) is that the writing was too often overdone and repetitive.

It appeared to be a patriot pro-faith book, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I enjoyed the book, as it laid out the message of the Declaration of Independence and the importance of faith in our culture. Forrest Church is a gifted writer. His style and prose is elegant and poetic. He started with our nation's founding and then began jumping through history with an underlying theme that our country and experiment in democracy has not been perfect, but that great leaders have drawn from the strength of our \\"American Creed\\" to continue to push forward democracy. However, the book fell short in a few areas and left me a little disappointed.My biggest problem with it were his choices of the events where the american creed was used. He tended to focus mostly on Democrat presidents and their speeches, but not the actual consequences of their policies. He spent an entire chapter on FDR and JFK each analyzing their most famous speaches (the Four Freedoms and the Ask not what your country can do for you, respectively.) Presidential speeches are hollow, meaningless, and often inconsequential. But after reading these chapters, I thought, okay, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because surely, I'm about to read about Reagan and his tireless lifelong war against communism. But then I got to the one paragraph on Ronald Reagan and here is what is said.\\"However one may view his policies, President Ronald Reagan owed much of his electoral success and his persuasiveness as a leader to the eloquence with which he reclaimed American symbols such as the flag. The country remained divided. For those to whom the American dream was a nightmare and the American Creed itself therefore abrogated, the president's flag waving was nothing more than camouflage for a bankrupt national ethicc.\\"That's when his bias really became exposed. You can't write a book that discusses individual liberty and faith have full chapters on FDR and JFK speeches and nothing on Ronald Reagan.I enjoy reading about America's flaws and strengths and know that the history of the the struggles in this country has many dimensions and angles. This book had promise but could have been much better. It was more like a fluffy poetic essay than a rich historical book. For a better book with a similar theme, I'd recommend \\"10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America\\"."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Welcome to a century-old feud between the Blackthornes and the Creeds.

I remember when i read Frontier Woman, Creighton Creed had 2 daughters, in Cowboy, it says she had raised 4 sons!This was a disappointment to me to think i was continuing to follow a family,only to discover it had been changed to in order to write Cowboy...Did i miss something?"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Once I started I couldnt put it down and finished it in one evening. All of the characters in the book were great. Since I have been around cutting horses for 20 years I enjoyed the whole book. Its especially nice when an author does research and is accurate."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I loved this book. What an amazing story. I read the book in two days, I couldn't put it down.

I doubt it will be any easier to put down."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Loved the ranch/cowboy setting. Lots of turmoil between the hero & heroine. First time reading something from this author and I really enjoyed it. Not too much descriptive language but an entertaining easy read."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I've never read a book by Joan Johnston before reading this one. I have to tell you that I ran right out and got a couple more of her books. I thought The Cowboy was wonderful. I had trouble putting it down. A great love story, one that brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"This was the first Joan Johnston book I have ever read. I have only recently started reading books in the the romance genre. I won't be picking up anymore of her books. The story line and characters were not believable. She gave too much detail about ranches,horses, and cows. She did not give enough detail about how the people were feeling. She describes the love scenes as an afterthought. The book is basically boring and poorly written. I'll stick to people like Lorraine Heath and Karen Hawkins. They know what they're doing."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I was very disappointed in Joan Johnston's 'The Cowboy, besides being too filled with uninteresting ranch and horse information, the characters were not captivating. I had to put it down as I began chapter four. I did not care if the hero or heroine got together or not. I was soured that for one there was 15 years between their loving one another, breaking up and finding each other again, the secret of their child and the fact that she had married and produced another child with her husband took all the 'romance' out of it for me right from the start. Joan has done much better before this one."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Okay, let me just say if you don't have time to read, don't even open up this book. Why, because you won't be able to put it down!!!I love Joan Johnston's books, and this one was no exception. Right from the very first page I was hooked, and every page after, right to the very last.I zipped though this book in only a few short days, and I'm not a fast reader, have three young kids, work part time, etc., otherwise I probably would have read it in one sitting. I had a very hard time doing anything after I started it, and could not stop thinking about the heart gripping characters long after I'd finished it.Now I have to run out and buy the others from this series. I can't wait to read about the other characters in the stories."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I could not figure out what motivated the heroine in this story!

Not much of a read."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"At home in Bitter Creek, Texas, their families have feuded since the Civil War. However, at the University of Texas in Austin, Trace Blackthorne and Callie Creed are lovers planning to marry. Their bliss ends when a tackle during a high school football practice by Trace's brother Owen leaves Callie's sibling Sam wheelchair bound. Trace and Callie are divided over the unfortunate incident that her family thinks was not an accident. He gives her an ultimatum, which she rejects. He vanishes for the next eleven years. Unknown to Trace, Callie is pregnant. She marries someone else who kindly helps her raise her son until he dies.Eleven years have passed since Trace has last seen Callie. When they do meet, sparks still fly between them. However, their families are squabbling worse than ever. The Creeds are facing financial ruin. Trace wants Callie and offers to save her family from economic disgrace if she marries him, but there is one secret she is still keeping from him: the existence of his eleven-year-old son.THE COWBOY is an exciting contemporary ranch romance that conveys the vast scope of talent author Joan Johnston possesses. Known for her historical romance tales, Ms. Johnston provides a warm contemporary relationship drama that takes descendants from two sets of families (the Blackthornes from the Captive Hearts Regency tales and the Creeds from the Lone Star Western romance novels) and brings them into today's ranching world. The story line is fun, but the characters make this a winning novel that needs sequels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"This review refers to \\"The Cowboy\\" by Joan Johnston....After being transported to another time and place by Joan Johnston in the Sisters of the Lone Star Triology(Frontier Woman,Comanche WomanandTexas Woman (Sisters of the Lone Star, #1)), I couldn't wait to read about their descendants in the Bitter Creek Series. The first of the series is \\"The Cowboy\\".The Creeds and the Blackthornes have been feuding for well over a century. When Callie Creed and Trace Blackthorne, fell in love,they could not even share their happiness with their families. They could only hope that someday things would get better. But things couldn't have gotten any worse. A horrible accident has fueled the fire between the families and Trace and Callie must make a choice.Their love was great, but so was Callie's devotion to her family and sense of obligation to \\"Three Oaks\\", the family ranch. There were no words Trace could use to hold onto the woman he loved.For more than a decade, Trace was not to be seen or heard from. His whereabouts were a mystery, but when another near tragedy occurs, he comes home to \\"Bitter Creek\\" and back into Callie's life once more. Things haven't changed between the families though,the hatred has built up even more,but Trace's love for Callie has never died and he will do whatever it takes to win her back, and in the process touches the lives of all those around him.Will their love be strong enough to reunite them despite all the complications?\\"The Cowboy\\", now set in modern day Texas, still has the sense of wildness and adventure that we saw in the Lone Star series.I was glad to see that sense of courage and conviction possessed by the original sisters has been passed down through the generations. The characters are strong and likeable, the story had many twists and turns,secrets and lies and some edge of your seat cliffhangers that made it a page turner. If you read any other books by Ms. Johnston, you know you are in for some passionate romance as well.In the end, you may even need a hankie or two.Immerse yourself in this great romance...and enjoy....Lauriehardcover edition:The Cowboy"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"THE COWBOY was the first book I have read from Joan Johnston and I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive at first when I first picked this book up.But after reading the first few chapters, I was definitely hooked! This book is very sensual and the chemistry between Trace and Callie were so great they were crackling. It was funny how Trace could not keep his hands to himself whenever he's close to Callie. And I especially lurve the part where Trace told Callie he loved her; I almost cried, but not before thinking that Callie is such a mule for being so stubborn. It is rare to read that a guy actually told the girl &quot;I love you&quot; first.The secondary characters in the book are also very well-written. Also the horses and cutting were described in a lot of detail, maybe a bit too much, but overall, this is not a bad romance novel. I will definitely be looking out for other books by Joan Johnston, no doubt about it!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"After reading The Texan I just knew I had to read this book. It was a wonderful read although Callie got on my last nerve she finally came to her senses before it was to late."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"i normally don't like to read but my friend told me about THE COWBOY.So I read it ,it the best book I've ever read.It has the best details,I couldn't put it down.I've also bought THE TEXAN,it's even better yet.I don't know how she will top these two with the third of the triology.great work Joan!!!!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"What a nice first book for what promises to be a series! JJ gives the Romeo and Juliet theme a contemporary Texas twist, with two families at odds and two lovers caught in the middle. The amount of hard luck sustained by the heroine's family almost broke my heart - and the relentless meanness of the hero's father was both believable and scary. I liked the amount of information woven into the narrative, about the &quot;horse trade,&quot; because it gives the story depth and roots. I liked this book and look for more to the story!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I was up until 5 AM reading this because I just had to finish. &quot;The Cowboy&quot; made me laugh, it made me cry. I was always in suspense. I couldn't wait to know what happened next. I felt as though I was there. I was feeling their emotions. I wanted what they wanted. I was so captivated."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I'm not a fan of western set romances, preferring Regency London, but I do like Joan Johnston so when I saw this at the library I picked it up anyway thinking what the hell. Lets just say that I will now be purchasing this for my own collection and eagarly awaiting the next book in the trilogy. This was a very &quot;real&quot; romance and I found it very refreshing after reading a lot of adult fairytales recently! I found this book difficult to put down and I know that these characters will stay in my mind for a long time. Thanks for such a beautiful story Joan."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"When I read some of the bad reviews about this book, I wondered if we had all read the same book. Well, I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion. Personally, I thought THE COWBOY was a great book. It was the first book I had read by Joan Johnston and frankly, I loved what I read. I can't wait to read more of her work. The hero in the book,Trace was a great character. He never gave up on the woman and family that he wanted. Even though Callie was a bit stubborn, she had a great deal of loyalty to her family. It seemed that she was willing to give up any happiness she could have had for the sake of her family. The story had a lot of depth in it in the sense that there were a lot of mysteries in it. All these revelations that were made made the story all the better. I started this book at about 3:00P.M. and finished it at 6 in the morning. I just couldn't put it down. It was definitely worth the loss of sleep. If you read it, you'll know what I'm talking about!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Wow! What can't I say about this book? The characters and plot swept me away from the very beginning and didn't let me go until I had finished. Since I have a hectic schedule there isn't much time for reading, but I made time for this one. I turned each page with joyful anticipation. I have been longing for a good Texas romance for such a long time. I related to the main character Callie. Way to go Ms. Johnston. This book is a definite winner. The story line screams sequel and/or movie. I am going to recommend this book to all of my friends and family."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"This was the first book by Joan Johnston I've read. I was not dissapointed! I usually only read historicals, but I've read this twice so far. Trace. Who could deny a character like Trace anything? Poor Callie. She had so much going on in her life.. until Trace helped find a way for her to cope with everything. I would recomend this book to anybody to read. It was a great read."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"After reading the book Cowboy I'm really excited to read more about the families. The love lost between Trace and Callie then found again made my heart go out to them. I truly loved reading about how hatred can be over come by love."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Overall I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I thought the character of Trace was great, but didn't care for the female lead, Callie. She's so 'all over the place', she almost seems schizophrenic. Some of the other characters, like her father and her son, if they were actors, you might say they were 'trying to hard'. The story's pretty good, but the characters are a bit formulaic."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I loved Trace. His male personality was well defined."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"Didn't hit my expectations. A good read but not great"},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I was sure I wouldn't like this book, but now I love Joan Johnston. I'm not a full time reader and like a good story that you don't have to read every day to remember. This one kept me reading from start to finish and now I want more of her books. I hope they are this good. Maybe the fact that I have horses and love cutting had something to do with it."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"I was very disappointed in Joan Johnston's 'The Cowboy, besides being too filled with uninteresting ranch and horse information, the characters were not captivating.

Like how things are brought up and the problem things are dealt with and how. Being disabed it's good to know others will light a spark under your butt to get you moving and functioning to be self sustaining and not have to rely on others for everything.Secrets are enough to break up a marriage but it never happened and she married another. The things that come out 11 years later-I don't know if I'd be able to forgive one for withholding the information that finally comes to the surface.Love the structure of the family and those in charge.Love and remoance was just enough to make this an enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"The Cowboy","review":"This is the first Joan Johnston book I have read. I really enjoyed the story!!!! I couldn't put the book down. I am now reading the Texan and just ordered The Loner. So far it is a great trilogy of love, romance, conflicts and loss. Great Summer reads."},{"Title":"Mexicano Political Experience in Occupied Aztlan: Struggles and Change","review":"It came in great condition even though it was a used textbook. a little watered damage but nothing that would interfere with the actual text in the book. the book itself is great to have if you're interested in Chicano history, it goes into great detail through different time periods. a must have for anyone interested in Chicano culture and history."},{"Title":"Mexicano Political Experience in Occupied Aztlan: Struggles and Change","review":"Navarro predicts that by 2015 half of California will be Brown. By 2025 half of the southwest is going to be Brown. He states that we might have to change the White House to the Brown House. This book underlynies the policital forces that prevent and have prevented Mexicans from taking polictical control."},{"Title":"Mexicano Political Experience in Occupied Aztlan: Struggles and Change","review":"Armando Navarro has written a comprehensive political history of the Mexicano in American society. It is difficult reading for some (see other reviews), yet no legitimate historian can argue with the research, the insights and the accuracy of much of what is said here. Rather than a \\"patriotic\\" or simply an \\"adversarial history\\", Navarro has written a nuanced analysis of what it has been to be Mexican in American society. While some may disagree with his recommendations, they will be hard put to find a better chronicling of this history. Navarro will rank among the best of U.S. scholars of color, and will be known for a long time as one of the most prolific and influential Chicano scholars of all time. Move over Norm Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Rudy Acuna."},{"Title":"Mexicano Political Experience in Occupied Aztlan: Struggles and Change","review":"Why is it that biggots like him are able to recite hateful, racist crap against the USA and California, yet we the poor dupes who he is rantig about are stuck paying this biggot's six-figure salary? This is what is wrong with America today. If a European-American were to even come close to making a suggestion, let alone toss out the biggotry that this creep does, that insinuates racism, they would be out on their arse.I am an American, citizen of the USA, a patriot, and my ethnic heritage is Mexican and Spanish. This racist, hate-crime committing pig gives everyone the impression that because of my ethnic heritage, I MUST have the same warped values. He adds fuel to the racist fires. He should be fired. And if all of us \\"Mexicans\\" or \\"Chicanos\\" really had such a terrible time here in the USA, then why are there so many pouring over the boarders every minute of every day? And, why does Navarro stay? Probably because this is the only country that would allow an Archie Bunker type jerk like him to make over 100,000 a year - paid for by the people he is rallying hate against!The Minutemen are outstanding citizens, who not only keep our boarders safer, they are risking their lives."},{"Title":"Mexicano Political Experience in Occupied Aztlan: Struggles and Change","review":"I am a Chicano and I am insulted by this garbage. It is not what we Mexican American really believe. The author must not be very educated. He is clearly a biggot. Is he really a professor?"},{"Title":"Jesus and the Muslim: An Exploration","review":"This fine book written by a credible scholar carefully catalogues pivotal points of discussion. Dialogue between Christianity and Islam can exist in part because so much of the Quran contains discussion of biblical characters. But how Jesus, for example, is described in Islamic literature is not consistent with the picture found in canonical biblical texts. This contrast is well presented by Cragg, and though the book is written in a somewhat pedantic \\"Oxford English\\" style, it is still quite rewarding."},{"Title":"Jesus and the Muslim: An Exploration","review":"Cragg's book is an excellent work for the student seeking greater interaction and understanding on the congruence and overlap of Jesus in Islam and Christianity. His integration of Arabic literature into his research was a great plus. However, the 300 page, small-print book contains a writing style that makes it difficult to understand and digest for the average reader. If you are into in-depth didactic study, this might be a good book for you."},{"Title":"Sport Americana Series: Team Baseball Card Checklist No. 5","review":"Obliviously a &quot;Team Baseball Card Checklist&quot; is going to be useful to those of us who are trying to collect all of the baseball cards for our favorite team. I now have less than 10 cards to go to have all of the Topps New York Yankees from the beginning of the baseball card universe and am now working on Bowman cards as well. This book covers everything out there from the old Tobacco cards to Goudey and Play Ball, Fleer and Donruss, Sportsflics and Upper Deck, and on and on. It will definitely help you know what to look for and even tells you when the front of the card has a player with Team A and the back has the player with Team B. Then you can decide if you have to have it for your collection or not.I also use this book to help me with my completed sets, because what I do with each year's Topps cards is to arrange them in the binder to reflect what happened that year starting with the World Series cards with the cards for the World Champions followed by the rest of the teams in that league/division in the order they finished. I do the same thing for the other league, putting All-Star Cards in-between and the Rookie/Update cards at the end. Of course, with all the sub-sets within a set that they have today there are other options so one of the liabilities of this book is that it does not list all the non-team cards that are with a set. To track down those you need a more traditional checklist if you are trying to put together a complete set.Be forewarned that you might find an omission or two here and there, so this book is not exactly perfect. But while I did spend one night trying to figure out what one card from the 1968 Topps set I was missing (Ray Oyler) it did let me know that #259 Sparky Lyle and #676 Danny Cater both appear as Red Sox and neither is a Yankee in the 1972 Topps set because they were traded for each other. On balance, I have found this a useful book and take it to every sports card show I attend."},{"Title":"Rabbit's Bedtime","review":"This simple and beautiful bedtime story begins with the mother rabbit tucking in her little one and asking &quot;What was good about today?&quot;. With simple text and lovely collage illustrations the rabbit's day is recalled. The little rabbit's day is a study in balance with time for work, play, music, dance, painting, time with friends and time alone, etc. At the end the question &quot;What was good about today?&quot; repeats and is answered with &quot;A lot of things I would say&quot;.My kids (ages 3 and 22 months) both love this story and insist on hearing it every night. It has sturdy carboard pages that they can turn themselves (but it is not a true board book). Our 3 year old attends a Waldorf preschool and the rabbit's day reminds me of the rhythm of her preschool day so much that I am planning on buying a copy of this book for each of her classmates. This book would make a great baby gift which I think could be enjoyed from birth to age 5 or 6."},{"Title":"Rabbit's Bedtime","review":"Little Rabbit cuddles with his dad at bedtime, reviewing, in simple rhyming verse, all the things they did today. From housework to reading to playing with friends, Rabbit's day was a pleasant one indeed. Dropping off to sleep with happy thoughts is always a good thing. Perhaps the best feature of Rabbit's Bedtime is the artful illustrations, formed of basic shapes in construction paper colors. This is a lovely little story to read to under-three's, or to serve as an early reader for somewhat older kids."},{"Title":"Rabbit's Bedtime","review":"A very sweet book. My 23 month old has this read to her at bedtime every night. She enjoys pointing out the \\"incidentals\\" mentioned in the review above--sun, bird, butterfly, etc; and offering her own interpretations of what the rabbits in each scene are doing."},{"Title":"As the Cock Crows: Reflections of a Medical Missionary to Haiti","review":"Having been tempted to write my own description of what it is like to be a missionary doctor in Haiti, I don't have to thanks to this book. Accurate vivid descriptions of Haiti as it was in 1946 and still today in 2000 fill the book. Dr. Nelson's writing details how everything is difficult in Haiti, takes longer than expected, yet gets done in God's time not his. The primitive organization of Haitian society and infrastructure is captured factually. This should be required reading for any person considering missionary work in Haiti, medical or ministerial. Haiti is a destination for service, not vacation or leisure. Don't go unless you are called. Don't stay home if you are."},{"Title":"As the Cock Crows: Reflections of a Medical Missionary to Haiti","review":"If you are interested in Haiti, specifically in medical missionary work, please read &quot;The Neglected and Abused&quot; by Bentivegna, or &quot;Song of Haiti&quot; by Barry Paris. They are wonderful.If you are interested in Haiti on a broader historical or cultural basis, please read &quot;Written in Blood&quot; by Robert Debs and &quot;The Rainy Season&quot; by Amy Wilentz. I am sure there are others, but at least I can vouch for these two.I admire that Nelson worked in Haiti, but the book just does not reflect what it should if you want to know about Haiti, its people, its conditions, and its wonder. Nelson spends too much time on his personal travel problems (about 1/3 of the book it seems) and other negatives, not nearly enough on either his missionary work or medical work, and when he does there is just no substance or development of topic. What were the reasons behind the bad roads? The poverty? Anything else medically or culturally he dealt with? Few of these are addressed, so the book reads like I did this, or this happened, with no illumination as to the whys of the situations he experienced.I read this book to learn anything I could to apply to work a group of us do every year in Haiti and felt that I came up empty.Nelson wrote a book of his experiences and opinions, but by golly, he could have spent SOME time on those people he went to serve, and surely he could have been less condescending and more understanding of the conditions and culture."},{"Title":"Understanding casino marketing","review":"This book describes the concept of Marketing, as it's practiced in casinos today, by one of the casino industry's best marketing strategists.

As other reviewers have stated the cases have been edited quite poorly, the Erie doctrine section confuses, more than it helps and the overall flow of the textbook is poor. Also the note sections, which usually serve to help students make sense of the case that was just read, are more often than not filed with unhelpful questions with no guidance on how to answer them or what the answer would be.I ended up buying the Hornbook by West and that easily became the text that I used (along with the Fed Rules book) to understand Civ Pro.I fell sorry for you if you have to use this book.*Note review is for the 6th edition."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it is pretty good for teaching the basics of civil procedure. If that's what you're planning on doing, buy with confidence. On the other hand, if you are hoping to use this as body armor or some sort of fortification you will be disappointed. I can say without reservation that this book will completely fail to stop even 9mm rounds. They went clear through. Predictably, it did even worse against 7.62 NATO rounds. To summarize this book can teach you civ pro but will be of little use in a post-apocalyptic survival scenario."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"When you first pick up the book, you feel exhilirated that you, too will be learning all about Civil Procedure. The case in the introduction is fun, but it is all down hill from there. The cases are important cases, but the editing took out parts of the opinions that should be there so you can understand the rest of the opinion (I could mention Erie, but nobody understands that on a good day either...). It is a necessary evil that we mut struggle through in our attempts at world domination...I mean our attempts to become lawyers..."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"My review will mirror many of the reviews for this edition of Yeazell's Civil Procedure: Good intros, but difficult explanations to wade through for the rest. Which is where a good Professor/TA comes in.Here are the best methods in successfully deciphering this book (and in general for law school):Before class:-Read Yeazell's intros (they set up the cases well)-Read each case then read over his notes (if any exist) and any FRCP rules/sections from the Rules supplement-Do the problems in the notes (take your best shot)-**Optional** - For the really motivated students, you can look up the cases in law reviews or de minimis for further explanations/context. I never did this, but I've heard it helps when there's confusion.-Prepare a case-brief while re-reading the case, incorporating the knowledge obtained from the notes-Review 1/2 hour before classDuring class/TA sessions:-Take detailed notes! Fill in anything you might have missed/misunderstood, and anything else you deem important (especially anything the Prof. puts on the board, or writes on projectors, or asks hypos of, or gives out handouts for)-Refer to your case-brief, and be courageous in your answer when called upon (the Socratic method is for your benefit, though it may feel like torture)-Pay attention to how Prof/TA goes over the problems and answers-Ask questions about anything you might have missedAfter class/TA sessions (directly after-wait too long, and this stuff might fly out of your brain):-Add condensed and important points into outline (which you will use as your study tool for finals)-Add answers to problems into outline-Mark up rules/sections in the FRCP Yeazell supplement pertaining to important class discussions-**Important** - Attend office hours for Professor (or TA - but not as important b/c TA not testing you) and discuss ANYTHING you might be hazy on - Students rarely go to office hours. Those that do, get the top grades. Go figure.-**Optional, but important** - Form study groups to go over class material/outlines/complain about CivPro-Review material weeklyAfter this is complete, rinse and repeat.Before finals:-Finish up outline (should be almost finished before end of classes), and read over repeatedly until you're confident with materials-Take practice exams (especially essays)-If you have time, go over practice exams with Prof/TA/study groupLaw school casebooks like Yeazell's are almost never straightforward so they require all these steps so you actively learn. If most of these steps are not taken, it will probably lead to confusion, panic, just overall bitterness from a nebulous source of education.---advice from an overachieving 1L"},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"I actually liked my Civil Procedure class, but I hated doing the reading for it because it meant I'd have to use this book. The layout is thus: You read a case, and then you are presented with a series of questions that apparently you're expected to be able to answer on your own - in effect, you have to teach yourself Civil Procedure as you read. Interspersed with the meaningless (at least to the confused 1L reader) questions are little facts and tidbits related to Civil Procedure which aren't that important, but since they're the only information in the discussion section not presented in question form, you glom onto them in the hope that knowing said facts and tidbits will help to clarify Civil Procedure for you. All in all, easily one of the worst textbooks I've ever had."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"This book is basically worthless, except as a makeshift booster seat or placeholder on a bookshelf. I read this book, then I read the Glannon E and E. There is no comparison. Glannon illuminates, and Yeazell simply asks tedious questions with no answers given. My advice would be to use Glannon as your text and only use Yeazell for the cases.Also, I should mention, don't drop out just because you find this book incomprehensible. I did fine in civ pro using mainly supplements for learning the material."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"The author who wrote this book must have had only one intention- to confuse the reader. There is nothing remotely good about this book. It is edited very poorly to the point where it makes absolutely no sense. The author hides the true meaning to the cases. If you don't have a VERY good civ pro teacher, you will have no idea what you are reading. I don't understand why someone would take the time to write over 800 pages and deliver no purpose to the text. It is so bad that if I was an incoming law student, I would probably turn down a school if I found that they used this book for their civ pro course."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"First is the review and then how I managed my study time using supplements and the FRCP. This is by far the worst text book we used during my 1L year, because after each case it has a few explanations, but typically just asks TONS of short questions W/OUT ANY answers! The purpose is to get you thinking about the topics and spend weeks figuring them out yourself. I listened to my 1st semester prof and used solely this book and the rule book (used minimally first semester). This was by far the worst advice I have ever been given, because the book will waste your precious time or make you stop reading altogether. However, there is a way to make the class interesting and gain the necessary info with minimal wasted time. Also, each semester is almost like a completely different class (one is theory and one is rules).I used various supplements for this class. Before buying all of them (like I did) I would go to your law library and look them over, use them for your class and see if they are presented in a way that works for you. If not, then buy whatever you can that is most useful and use the library's books as needed. My biggest mistake was thinking by using supplements to supplement my casebook I would learn less or get screwed up. Professors tell you whether they like supplements or not, but if you use them to prepare for class, still at least go through the cases and take NOTES from what they say, you will do far better.I will explain the books I used second semester, which is less theory and rules based. Before each class topic I readAcing Civil Procedure (Acing Law School)and then outlined the rule in my own words using the Commentary sections inA Student's Guide to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Student Guides)to fill in and flesh out the rules. I then read throughEmanuel Law Outline: Civil Procedure Yeazell (Emanual Law Outlines)skimming and highlighting the key points in this casebook and adding the extra info to my rule outlines. This made class easy because I simply noted the key comments and wording my Prof used and modified my outline accordingly. After class I quickly organized the rule outline and moved on. This may seem like a lot of time, but it was about 3 hours a week. Beware of spending too much time on the supplements and rule outline BEFORE class. Much of the material in the supplements and casebook is not covered in class and therefore a waste of time.When many spent extra time making their outlines, mine was complete and I spent an hour or two each week working through hypos and questions fromCivil Procedure: Examples & Explanations 5th editionandGlannon Guide to Civil Procedure: Student Manual. I added any issues and fact patterns I came across, to my rules outline. Before the exam I condensed my outlined rules, worked on hypos, and used the hypos we went over in class to see how Prof would work them into the exam. Overall I did not spend much time understanding the cases in their entirety . After the first week of class you should have typed down every question asked in class, because this is what the prof will ask the rest of the year. This makes it easier to skim cases and determine what is necessary and what is a complete waste of memory and time.For first semester, this was my worst class. My 1st semester Prof was not very good and I did not practice hypos and writing out answers as in 2nd semester. What I learned was to USE SUPPLEMENTS. I used them in half my classes (best grades) and not in the other half (good but worse). I managed to use Emanuel to catch up and made a great outline, but I spent far too much time with my wording in the essays. This is whereUnderstanding Civil Procedure, E&E; and Glannon Guide (multiple choice) came in. Even without multiple choice exams, these short practice questions really help hammer out the trickier parts. The hypos help you learn to quickly write out your answer. The Understanding series is GREAT for your first semester, because it more in depth and helps you understand the overall concepts better. Also, many prefer E&E; to other books for explanation, but I found it better suited for hypos.These books collectively were not necessary , but they sure helped. If you are short on cash, the best books from most helpful to least are your required casebook, FRCP Student's guide, Emanuel (if not using Yeazall, the keyed edition to your casebook if possible, if not then case briefs should work), Acing Civ Pro (AMAZING short book with great checklists to work through the rules), Glannon Guide, and then E&E; (if used for hypos, although there is a newer ed). For first semester, the Understanding book was excellent to read before anything else (do not read too heavy), because it is highly explanatory. I have found canned briefs useful from online and the various case brief books keyed to your casebook. Acing Civ Pro was the best book, but not the most needed if short on cash. See my other reviews regarding the above books mentioned. However only the first couple paragraphs will be different.Good Luck, I will try and answer any comments!"},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"This was my favorite casebook of my 1L classes. I have no complaints about it.

If you can do these, you'll be prepared for whatever issues appear on exams."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"I think my title sums it up.

There are cases after cases that are supposed to help you understand civil procedure, but there is little discussion of the law itself or about why the court decided the first case the way it did but did the polar opposite in a second, similar case. The questions that are provided after the cases are designed to help you analyze the law, but they are of little help when you have no foundation. Most people will probably need to consult at least one other source to understand civil procedure. If your law library provides a hornbook, make it your best friend. It is too late for me."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"This book is a good read. It uses a lot of anecdotes to explain otherwise intangible concepts.

Switch to another class or buy all the supplements you can that are by other authors."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"ordered the book and didnt realize that it was not new even after looking at the book. it was in perfect condition. arrived quickly. received a handwritten note and phone number if there were any problems, there was not. thanks St. Marys! do you have anymore books laying around?"},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"Description of item was accurate. My item was shipped quickly. I recommend purchasing from this vendor and plan on doing again myself."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"Note to Civ Pro professors: please don't use this book.First, Yeazell's book forces the student to guess the court's interpretation of the FRCP and and law. It does this by providing unfocused edited opinions. The opinions are so poorly edited that they become confusing. Often I found it would have been better to just leave in the entire text because the author's constant and obsessive desire to pare down the opinions using ellipses is ineffective. It just doesn't work. Yeazell might want the student to see the case from his perspective, but it's not coming through. I suggest that Yeazell just write his perspective after exposing the student to the actual, unadulterated text of the case. Yeazell is not getting his point across with the edits.Second, the structure of the casebook doesn't align with the typical 1L casebook. Specifically, the Notes and Problems sections (these are a constant thread throughout the book) rarely add clarity to the procedural topic. The Notes and Problems sections often pose hypothetical questions, which is a good idea in theory, but the questions are rarely answerable or answered. Maybe that's the point, but a 1L student doesn't need curve balls like this. If you're going to pose a question, you must give the student the tools and information to find the answer. Yeazell doesn't always do that. Further, the Notes and Problems that follow most of the cases refer to other cases that might not have been part of the assigned reading. Sometimes the Notes and Problems in one chapter allude to briefly mentioned Notes and Problems hypotheticals in another. The content is so jumbled that a 1L student will find it frustrating to understand the point.Finally, the casebook is not updated, contains too many errors (spelling, grammar, mechanical), and isn't easy to navigate. The latest edition still refers to pre-2010 Rules. The student must find an old version of the FRCP and then translate those rules to the current rules just to understand what Yeazell is talking about. The table of cases is lodged in the back of the book. Most troubling, the grammatical errors make the student question the veracity of the message. How do you know what you are reading is accurate when there are obvious grammatical errors?Overall, this was my least favored 1L casebook and I think the other reviews here and elsewhere echo that sentiment."},{"Title":"CIVIL PROCEDURE","review":"If you remotely understood the humor in my header than this book is fine for you. The truth is Civil Procedure is not exactly the stuff that made us want to be lawyers, but when we finish law school, who is going to forget Asahi, or Erie!, or World-Wide Volkswagen, or hmm... Gibbs! Yeazell has all the cases you need in here. I do think Semtek in the Erie section is odd because preclusion has not been introduced. And I think it is the odd placement, if you read the book linearly rather than jumped around, that makes some of the reviewers here hate this book. But this is one of the better books. Couple this sucker with Glannon and presto you will be screaming \\"There ain't no subject matter jurisdiction under 1331--it is all a lie!\\" In no time.

I really wanted to save the $90 and use an older edition as I am doing in torts but the books were just too different and it was not worth it.

No need to blame it on the casebook.If you are a scared pre-1L reading these reviews thinking, \\"oh crap, why did my professor have to assign the confusing Yeazell casebook,\\" don't bother. It really comes down to how good your professor is at explaining things, not the casebook. Having said this, I actually think the notes, cases, and examples are all well edited and presented clearly.Just a note, in class Professor Yeazell started on \\"The Process of Adjudication Examined\\" section, went to the end of the book, and then came back to personal/ subject matter jurisdiction section (the first section of the book) at the end of the semester.

Yes, he succesfully ran a long-only fund and made a bunch of money for his investors and himself, but please don't confuse the luck with the talent - anyone who happened to buy a dot-com stock in 1996 and happened to sell in the early 2000 would have achieved similar or better return on investment (this is not to say that he's not a talented investor, it's just his track record doesn't prove much). As far as his new economic theory - i.e., \\"it's really different this time\\" - it's a bit naive and superficial. I found a bit annoying the fact that he belittles other hedge funds, companies and investors in Silicon Valley, and even some of his own clients!"},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"in the genre of \\"liars poker\\" we have another author moaning about how hard it was on him to make a lot of money, the likes of which most of us will never see.that being said this was an easy read with a few pearls that will appeal to anyone interested in the stock market."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"\\"running money\\" by andy kessler is a must read for anyone working in wall street, curious about wall street, thinking of starting up a hedge fund, or being involved in a hedge fund. it is funny, irreverent, informational, & loaded with stories that anyone would recognize with regards to the perils & hard work associated with the money management biz."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"I wanted more antedotes about the hedge fund world and the like.

He also only lost I think 5% in 2000 and 5% in 2001 which was good considering what was going on in his stocks. So I do give him credit where credit is due there. And he did have a 55% annualized which is great. But I think his genius was in selling and realizing the game was over.In any event, I read his rambling about how technology is going to change the world, blah, blah. The whole thing sounds quaint considering what has happened. Personally I think NASDAQ will go sub 1108 over the next 9 years and all of these guys will be thoroughly discredited. It took the Nikkei over 13 years to hit its bottom and it had one rally after the initial 2.5 year drop which lasted 3 years 10 months.Was this a good book?

Not much investment strategies, but fun reading!"},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Running Money, Andy Kessler's new book, is a big disappointment. His first book, Wall Street Meat, was a witty, intelligent and perceptive description of his life as a sell-side analyst. But Running Money, which covers his time co-managing a technology hedge fund from 1996 to 2001, is a let-down. There are three reasons why this book misses the mark:First, Running Money won't give you any insights into running a hedge fund. Kessler actually ran a sort of hybrid VC fund and mutual fund. He never shorted stocks or used any other hedging mechanism, and his fund was 100% net long at all times. This doesn't mean Kessler was stupid. On the contrary, 1996 to 2000 was a period when you wanted to be 100% net long technology stocks (ideally with leverage...), and when the tech bubble burst in 2001 Kessler was smart enough to liquidate his fund. But don't look for insights into shorting stocks or managing net exposure.Second, the core discussion about investment strategy is superficial. Kessler outlines his methodology: find companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantage and lucrative business models. But there's no rigorous analysis of how that methodology really performed, since we don't know whether he outperformed his VC peers (he also invested in private deals) or the semiconductor and hardware indexes (those are where most of his investments seem to have been) on an after-fees, after-tax basis. There's no discussion about whether his methodology is approriate for today's market conditions. There's no discussion of valuation. There's no discussion of portfolio construction or risk management. And there's no analysis of the mistakes he made either. In fact, you get the feeling that Kessler's approach was uniquely suited to the bubble-inflating years - pick tech stocks with the greatest growth prospects relative to expectations, and ignore valuation. Kessler's genius was getting out in time; but that doesn't help us now.Third, much of the book is devoted to a thoroughly implausible theory of international trade. Kessler suggests that the US trade deficit is partly an illusion, created by the difficulties of tracking intellectual property exports. He ignores basic national accounting relationships such as: if consumers and government aren't saving anything but domestic investment is positive, then the shortfall must be made up by foreign capital inflows. He then argues that the US can sustain indefinite trade deficits because the return on capital is higher in the US than elsewhere, so foreigners will always want to invest in the US. This is not only unconvincing but dangerous. The twin trade and budget deficits are generating currency risks that every professional investor needs to be aware of.So what's good about it? Well, like Wall Street Meat, Running Money is a lot of fun to read. Kessler's discussions of technology investing are also interesting, if ultimately unsatisfying. And his descriptions of meetings with company managements and sell-side tech conferences are entertaining and witty, though they lack the searing character portraits of Wall Street Meat.Verdict: if you haven't read Wall Street Meat, buy that instead. If you have, and you want a fun read, go ahead and read Running Money. Just don't expect to learn much about running money."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"\\"Running Money\\" is not only a great read, it also provides a unique contemporaneous view of the \`90s investment market by a talented hedge fund manager who makes no claims to omniscience. He brings us into his struggles, doubts, and mistakes as well as his successes. He shows us how hard it really is to find great investments even in a wild bull market. This is a very different book than \\"Wall Street Meat\\". It isn't as wry but I think it offers us more substance along with a lot of fun. However, the fun comes from more sources than just humor.The book weaves three threads into the final fabric. First, there is the hedge fund narrative. The author provides us with many fun stories about his difficulties in raising money for their fund, the troubles in finding the right investments, and the natural history of his and his partner's successes and failures with the market and private investments.Among other many things, we learn that the real action at conferences is out in the hall, that it is time to leave when CFOs close the doors to their offices or conference rooms or when the sales executive is the power guy, and the travails of getting an Instinet terminal in your office so you don't have to pay a broker to do the same thing for you. We get to ride with them in their four-door office as the go to meeting after conference after meeting looking for the right investment. Usually they find things to laugh at, run from, or that are jaw droppingly dumb. However, every now and again they find things to buy. Even then, many of them are dogs. But the ones that take off end up paying for everything including their cheap office above an arts supply store.Second, we get the author's analysis of what is going on in the market and what he and Fred Kittler are trying to do with Velocity Capital. Mr. Kessler shares with us his metaphors for what he is after - in particular the waterfall and its moment of great power just before it hits the rocks. There are some serious history lessons on the development of the steam engine, railroads, and integrated circuits as vehicles for investment. When would it have been right to get in and to get out? We come to understand that the investments he is after have not just large markets, but mega markets so there are powerful factors of scale. He wants profitability to go up as prices fall towards the rocks below. He wants to see a business plan to leverage that scale. And he wants some kind of unfair competitive advantage. If a competitor can simply build what you have and be your equal, he feels you have a recipe for large losses.Third, and this seems to be the part of the book that matters most to the author, everything is pulled together to culminate in a philosophical treatise on the future of the American economy as part of the world economy and what we as a country should be focusing on. His view is that the industrial age is ending and that the future economy is based on intellectual capital. He also argues that this kind of benefit can't be measured using our present methods of balance of trade or other economic measures built for the industrial age. Whether you end up agreeing with him or not, his arguments are interesting and worth considering.A fine book that should be widely read and not just by those interested in finance. This is a fun read that also has several serious payoffs."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"\\"Running Money\\" picks up where Andy Kessler's previous book, \\"Wall Street Meat\\" (which portrays his life as a Wall Street-based semiconductor industry stock analyst and investment banker), left off. Kessler left Wall Street to run a Palo Alto-based hedge fund with one partner, raising money from wealthy individuals and groups, and investing it in latter-stage startup and public technology companies. He had the, in retrospect, incredibly fortuitous timing (as he himself admits) to open a five year fund in 1996, which forced him to liquidate the fund and lock in his profits as the tech bubble was bursting in 2001 (in fact, he disperses his last cash just days before 9/11).But Kessler's success, as he proves in the highly entertaining and also thought provoking \\"Running Money\\", is not merely the product of providential timing. His insider's view of the hedge fund industry shows how many of these funds don't even attempt to do fundamental stock analysis, but instead seek out market distortions that they can profit from (for a while, at least). Kessler, by contrast, stays true to his stock analyst roots and attempts to find great companies possessing a strong economic and technological advantage in a market about to undergo rapid growth. He struggles initially, but eventually uses an interesting combination of old world thinking (by analyzing the history of the steam power-driven Industrial Revolution) and radical new era economics (described below) to identify some winners. His story of the small niche semiconductor company he found which benefited immensely from the MP3 music piracy fad, at the same time that Napster and the record companies were losing their shirts, is a great case study for technology investing.If \\"Running Money\\" were nothing more than a series of case studies and anecdotes about the investments Kessler made, it would be a fairly lightweight book. The anecdotes are indeed amusing, especially Nick Moore's scathing trashtalking of technology companies (Moore has a humorous nickname for every technology company, e.g. \\"Scam-azon\\"). But fortunately, in the final section, Kessler ponders the deeper question of what his success means about the current economy. It is here that Kessler voices some fairly radical opinions and theories that certainly deserve to get discussed and tested.Kessler's radical opinion is that traditional economists, who are very cognizant of and worried about the trade deficit that the United States has been running since the 1970s, are not properly accounting for what truly matters in today's economy: wealth and profits. Because so much US manufacturing has moved abroad, and because the design of those products (i.e. the intellectual property) is still heavily centered in the US, the US does not receive any economic \\"credit\\" on the trade balance sheet when those designs are shipped to overseas factories. What is counted, of course, are the manufactured products that come back into this country, and that produces a large deficit. But since manufacturing is such a cutthroat business, whereas companies focused on developing intellectual property (e.g. Microsoft, Intel, pharmaceutical companies, and even Nike) command such high margins (profits) and pay their employees well, the resulting arrangement is highly beneficial to the living standard of the US. \\"We think, they sweat\\", sums up Kessler in his typical smart-alecky style. The low-priced products which flow into this country, along with the capital which finances some of our government's budget deficit, are our rewards for this mutually beneficial relationship.Needless to say, these views are highly controversial. Yet Kessler forcefully states his arguments, and also has more than a little evidence on his side. He deserves credit for formulating these views, and thereby making \\"Running Money\\" more than just a breezy rags-to-riches technology boom era story."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Andy Kessler managed a hedge fund from 1996 to 2001 that ranked among the top ten funds in history over a five-year period, in terms of overall return. His fund averaged a ~50% return per year and grew from about $20mm from launch to over $1billion upon closing (which includes additional invested capital). At one point, he turned down $1billion in Saudi Oil money because he wanted to remain faithful to his strategy and not become over extended. Just what was that strategy? Read on...Before opening a fund, Kessler spent most of his career as a research analyst in the technology sector for Morgan Stanley. That means he made lots of contacts, asked lots of questions, and wrote lots of reports containing investment recommendations. But he found it quite difficult to raise money when he started his fund. In a somewhat self-effacing tone, he remarks that he told prospective funders that his investment thesis was \\"finding companies with great long-term prospects.\\" Don't we all--seems obvious. But Kessler demonstrates a particularly deep commitment to his philosophy and an incisive intuition when in search of growth.Dot-Com Craziness and the Need for an \\"Edge\\"Kessler begins by using the story of his fund as a vehicle for relating the fun (and insanity) of the tech boom in Silicon Valley and introducing us to some of its most memorable characters. Kessler provides an account of a host of investment strategies he encountered, ranging from Clark and Doerr's grand slam with Netscape, to the currency arbitrages of the Tiger and Soros funds, to the bond trades of Long Term Capital Management, to the more loony schemes of some of his peers. One investor, for example, claimed to have found a pattern in tech conferences. He went to these conferences, noted the companies presenting to investors, observed their stocks tick up the next 1 - 2 days, then watched them correct back to their previous level the next day. He would long and short the stocks based on this pattern. Similarly, Kessler watched as investment managers interacted with company management at these conferences, gleaned extremely ambiguous insights, then placed a phone calls that resulted in notable changes in the stock price. His point--it's all about an edge. Call it information. And the average Joe and Mary on ETrade don't have a tee-ball kid's chance in hell of hitting one out of Fenway, unless they're lucky. You've got to be plugged in; you've got to know something. So what did Kessler know?Kessler's Philosophy: Steamships and MicroprocessorsKessler tells the story (and the background leading up to the boom) in parallel with the story of the industrial revolution. He compares steam power technology and its dramatic effect on power availability to the rapid development in computer technology and its effect on knowledge. For instance, he notes how exponential growth in power resources reduced the cost of most labor intensive processes and enabled a host of other key industrial technologies, while noting how the processor has doubled in speed about every 18 months (Moore's law), thus resulting in, for example, the cost of emails declining from a few dollars per email (Carter's presidential campaign), to a few cents per million emails today. Kessler refers to this concept as \\"scale,\\" and provides several other more nuanced historical comparisons to understand this concept.Putting It Into Practice: MP3s and the \\"CFO Closed Door Indicator\\"Kessler attempted to find companies that would experience a massive increase in demand as a result of some rapidly scaling phenomenon. For example, you might remember that Napster served as the catalyst for a gluttonous world exchange of mp3s in the late nineties. Investors, of course, wondered how they might monetize this deluge of downloads. Most of them avoided Napster for legal concerns, but eventually other more legitimate services went public, like MP3.com, and investors got on board. Rather than investing in these ludicrously overpriced companies, Kessler put his money in a little-known company, with no competition, producing the $2 laser diodes in CD R/W drives. As the world began burning its MP3s in order to play them on other mediums, Kessler's investment skyrocketed somewhere between 50 and 100x.To find these companies, Kessler put in some serious work. He conducted interviews tirelessly. He referred to his car as his office as he turned over \\"every rock in the valley.\\" He typically scheduled interviews with 3 to 5 companies per day. He described various subtle behaviors he became attuned to in his interviews. For example, the \\"CFO closed door indicator\\" was one favorite. If a CFO closed the door to his office or conference room, something could be inferred about the state or dynamic of the company. Maybe the CFO didn&#8217;t want fellow employees to hear the truth about their company's financial situation, or maybe they knew the truth, and he didn't want them to hear him lying to a prospective investor. Despite interviewing hundreds of companies, Kessler invested in only a few he believed would be winners, or as he called them, 5 or 10-baggers (that is, 5x or 10x expected growth).Debunking Econ 1: Intellectual Property and the U.S. Trade DeficitKessler concludes his book by merging the stories of the industrial revolution and the dot-com era in an economic analysis of the U.S. trade deficit and increasing reliance on intellectual property for growth. He asserts, in a position inconsistent with traditionally accepted economic theory, that the growing U.S. trade deficit is not necessarily detrimental to the U.S. economy. He states that U.S. companies focus on IP, ideas, and innovation and thus achieve superior margins and high growth compared to the rest of the world. The outflow of capital from the trade deficit eventually returns to the United States, he says, because of the attractiveness of U.S. companies with superior returns. This money flows into our stockmarket without the \\"bean-counting\\" economists taking note. The result?--a lower cost of capital for U.S. based companies, which means more growth, which means more wealth created for Americans as capital gains.Even if his analysis is correct, the two flaws I note are 1) foreigners own an increasingly larger stake in U.S. exchange traded securities and 2) the very notion of scale he discusses means that these countries (like China) will eventually match or overtake the United States in IP generation, achieve similar margins, and the U.S. will have neither a competitive advantage in the industrial nor the knowledge based economy. In other words, we can swim upstream for now (i.e. outsource the mundane to the rest of the world), but eventually the other fish, namely asia, will catch up. Just like we did to the European economy a century ago.What's Next?--You Guessed ItKessler's book, though it conveys the obvious in some ways, does so in an entertaining and insightful manner. He peels away the ambiguity that often clouds investor judgment and demonstrates how to focus on the essential--growth and scale. In the final pages of his book, Kessler says that he's closed his fund believing that the information cycle has past, but that he'll be back. What's the next big hit? He named a few possibilities, one of them--nanotechnology.

Plus, it's a very, very funny book. To paraphrase Jim Cramer, this is both a brain and a beach book. One of the best I've read this year about money, investing and the economy."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"For sure there's much to learn from a tech growth hedge fund with 377% gain in 1999 (the fourth best hedge fund for the year) and down only 5% in 2000 (then it closed itself as planned five years beforehand), especially when the manager of it, the author himself, seemingly had no reservation to share his experience and insights to whoever believed, in particular the section of the author's unique opinion on the growing US trade deficit, which he deemed that as no problem at all with intellectual property and margin surplus the US is running.No matter what, if you like Wall Street Meat (the author's first book of his life as an analyst), Liar's Poker, Fiasco, Pit's Bull, Confessions of a Street Addict, Trading with the Enemy..., you must not miss this one. If you had not read anyone of the above, I assure you that you had missed a lot in fun and in knowledge, and you should recover part of the opportunity cost by starting with this one, though I think reading Wall Street Meat first will put you in a better perspective similar to the author's."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"You've got to give to Andy Kessler credit, he sprinkles his writings with just enough \\"Kesslerisms\\" to keep the reader laughing, which, good or bad, makes the underlying material readable. His first offering, WALL STREET MEAT, was rife with hilarious tales. In this offering, RUNNING MONEY, Kessler takes on the ostensible task of writing about operating a hedge fund, its challenges, and rewards.Kessler offers many stories of his exploits of attempting to bootstrap this business and the trevails of raising money for hedge funds. A recurring story (theme) revolves around his \\"mentor,\\" Mr. Zed. Mr. Zed leads Kessler down the path of introspection and discovery, attempting to teach Kessler a valuable lesson with each conversation. Zed will never \\"give\\" Kessler the answer he seeks; rather, he asks questions to Kessler's questions. This type of learning is valuable, as Kessler soon discovers. In the end, Kessler's treatise regarding his culmination of learning from Mr. Zed is enlightening.Now, as I mentioned in my title, this book has the style, which if Kessler is writing, most likely will always be there. However, that said, the overall evaluation of content was borderline. While the reader may expect direction and some detail about actually running a hedge fund, Kessler devotes three chapters on the development of the steam engine (there are a few other inane chapters as well). The purpose of this allocation of chapter material is not historical in nature necessarily (although those totally clueless to the development of the steam engine will learn something), rather, it is an investment lesson. Kessler describes the economic and financial markets (as they were) at the time of this invention, and brings it current by posing the question of investment in the company (Boulton and Watt) who developed and had a 25-year patent on the first steam engine. The story RE: development was monotonous; the overriding question of investment, spot on. Still, in this reviewer's opinion, the gross departure to historical analogies detracted from the content.Kessler's discussion of scale is fascinating. He tells the story of Elantec, a company making laser diode drivers necessary to the operation of rewritable CDs/DVDs. Kessler surmises this will be huge. As he and his partner begin a series of incremental investments in Elantec between $3 to $5, Kessler awaits the pop he seeks, hopefully to the $10 level, which will \\"make his month\\" (hedge fund nomenclature). The stock languishes until one fairly insignificant advent occurs...Napster. While Napster made incredible headlines (not profits), it revolutionized the need for rewritable media,and thus, scaled the market demand from obscure need to viral levels. Net, net, Kessler sold out of Elantec at prices reaching $200 per share.In the end, RUNNING MONEY is a fascinating book and is well told by Andy Kessler. It has its dead spots, which lend to the concepts Kessler espouses, but tediously so. While the reader will desire more detail of the hedge fund industry and its inner workings, RUNNING MONEY is a solid read."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"With a tasty bite of economic history, Kessler gives us a glimpse of how much we don't know about the origin of our huge wealth. He also points out some of the flaws in our thinking (how many decades have the pundits been warning of our impending doom due to the budget and trade deficits?) and tells an engaging story about his journey through The Valley and The Bubble.

Although its obvious that running a tech oriented hedge fund in the \\"bubble years\\" of the late 90's was a different kettle of fish than running a hedge fund in normal times, Kessler's philosophic endeavors near the end of the book, discussing the advantages of American capitalism is,in and of itself, worth the price of admission. Thanks Andy."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Should be read by anyone interested in the evolution of financial markets especially in the current hedge funds era.

Kessler writes about his experience managing money for a hedge fund that he and a partner started. It is a fun and interesting read, with fascinating stories and little nuggets of investment insights.In one chapter, Kessler talks about a meeting he had with money manager William Kaye in Kowloon, Hong Kong, in early 1996. Kaye specializes in finding opportunities in the Far East. Kaye uses the analogy of the Industrial Revolution to explain to Kessler how investing in the Far East is so different from investing in America. What he says about it is applicable to emerging market investing all over the world:Investing in the United States is so advanced. There's technology and biotech and all this highly valued stuff. Around here, they are still building roads and putting in telephone wires and putting up office buildings and chemical plants and factories. It's like living in 18th- and 19th-century England and knowing ahead of time how the whole Industrial Revolution ends up.He tells Kessler, a tech investor in Silicon Valley, \\"You guys have to sit in Silicon Valley and try to figure out what the world is going to look like in 20 years. Good luck. Around here, I've seen this movie already. I get to cheat. I know how it ends.\\"Investing in emerging markets is like watching the Industrial Revolution movie all over again. Really, it's more like watching a remake with a familiar plot and familiar characters, but still unexpected twists in the story and the timing of events. But essentially, what Kaye is saying is to look to the past and see what today's developed economies went through, and then invest accordingly. Kessler writes that it's about anticipating what tomorrow's headlines will say.Review by a writer for Agora Financial, publisher of economic and financial analysis includingFinancial Reckoning Day Fallout: Surviving Today's Global Depression,The New Empire of Debt: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Financial Bubble, andI.O.U.S.A.: One Nation.

It is nice to see a professional who truly thinks out of the box on investing and economics. Anyone in the business less than 20 years should read this."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Running Money is actually two books entwined. One is a narrative of the late great dot-com boom, told from the perspective of a player at the right place and the right time (with the good sense to walk away at the right time also). The other is sort of an informal investment thesis, a collection of controversial and intriguing ideas that hang together and form an actionable set of guidelines.It's all tied together with a dry (Sahara desert dry) sense of humor and a knack for understatement that made me laugh out loud more than once. (Example: when a sarcastic friend says never buy a stock where the name is a target forecast for the price, Kessler makes a mental note: \\"avoid NetZero.\\" Another example: \\"If you buy a stock at $70 and it goes to $200, it's tough to sell, figuring it might go to $300. If you bought at $3, it's a lot easier to sell.\\")The title of the book is fairly misleading. Anyone expecting a testosterone-fueled read is bound to be disappointed. Kessler is a cerebral investor, not a hairy chested alpha-male trader, and he makes that abundantly clear (in spite of his zillion-percent-annualized return gained from flipping mp3.com, a sixty second trade worthy of any gunner's respect).The fact that Kessler's outfit is a hedge fund is largely irrelevant to the book, as he doesn't go short and doesn't get fancy. (In fact he is snickered at by niche-based peers for not doing anything particularly sexy or exotic.) And when all is said and done, his 50%+ average return shows that you don't have to trade like a banshee or be a genius / hero to make a killing. Being in the right place at the right time, and playing it to the hilt, is enough. (Of course, that's also the rub.)The stories are entertaining. Far better, the ideas are valuable. (You have to take them with a grain of salt, but that should go without saying.) I appreciated Kessler's concept of \\"waterfalls,\\" giving a mental picture of technology's promise as an investment vehicle. Pressure builds in some area of inefficiency or untapped opportunity, creating a pool of latent opportunity. Finally the barrier breaks, the waterfall bursts forth, and innovation cascades outward--first to the early adapters, then the commercial adapters, and then the general masses. As prices fall dramatically, unit volume increases far more dramatically and, hopefully, exponential profits are created in the process. Kessler highlights Microsoft as one of the greatest (and luckiest) waterfall examples of all time, thanks to the master stroke of tying software to hardware. Every box sold puts another sale in their pocket, and with someone else building the box, they maintain zero replication cost and 99% profit margins. Beautiful.Kessler also takes us on a tour of the industrial revolution, courtesy of an intellectual exercise spurred by the friendly investor and erstwhile gnome of Zurich \\"Mr. Zed.\\" After following the progress of the steam engine and the Niagara Falls opportunity in textiles, Kessler transitions from old school to new school with his \\"margin surplus\\" theory, which seeks to replace yesterday's manufacturing model with an intellectual property one.Along the way he points out how IP (intellectual property) and physical manufacturing have been effectively split up for the first time in history, allowing Intel and Microsoft to make 80-99% margins on products bundled with every Sony laptop sold, while Sony itself sees maybe 1% returns after the hassle of buying materials, paying for labor, assembling the boxes, managing inventory and shipping them out.Thus the United States gets the lion's share of pure profit through intellectual property value-add, whereas Asia (or wherever the assembly occurs) gets traditional manufacturing sized margins (5% or less) on assembly and delivery, but benefits from mass employment and economic growth. Lots o' jobs is Asia's incentive to keep the high margin / low margin deal going (at least until they finally get innovative too, and start outsourcing to North Africa or some such place).The margin surplus theory is intriguing, and goes far in explaining why our trade deficit may not be as big a deal as some suggest. If Kessler is more or less correct, then a trade deficit is a natural--and even desirable--byproduct of an investment surplus, as the world continues to invest in our high margin IP profit centers, rather than the lower margin process of assembly taking place elsewhere.The theory doesn't address a few key nitpicks though, such as the frighteningly low rate of consumer saving in the United States... or the tendency we have to spend borrowed money on \\"stuff\\" rather than putting it back into productive investment... or the propensity of government to cheerfully run spending off the rails while whistlin' Dixie.Kessler is confident that the next round of spectacular innovation is likely to occur within the same twenty mile radius as last time, but here I fear he is overly optimistic. Even if margin surplus is more right than wrong, and even if IP invalidates gaping trade deficits and old economic models (two big ifs), America still has rough waters and real challenges ahead. Just because team USA was the innovation powerhouse of the 20th century doesn't mean we can \`repeat the feat' in round 21.Edges can be dulled and edges can be lost. If innovation is going to keep saving our bacon from the deficit frying pan, someone needs to tell the politicians who are discouraging immigration (choking off our brain gain), letting trial lawyers run amok, and bleeding entrepreneurs with heightening cycles of tax and spend. With the baby boomer generation retiring and major fiscal battles ahead, this is no time to be complacent. If apathy sets in, innovation won't save us from decline... and the next big waterfalls could easily make a splash elsewhere."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"This book is a real letdown. As other reviewers noted, he wasn't running a typical hedge fund strategy. He just bought and held tech companies, either public or private. And he did this during the .com boom. He had the sense to wind down the fund before the crash. Gosh, he made a lot of money. As I think he himself says, never mistake talent for a Bull market.You don't find out much of anything about his approach, because I don't think there was much too it.The chapters jump around without much coherence. He seems to be building up to a point, leading to a big 11 page section that entirely in italics, in case you were going to miss it. We have higher margins than the developing world, so the trade deficit doesn't matter. That's it.One of the least interesting books I've read this year."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"The book would be much better without the historical technology sections. Kesler spent too much time trying to educate about history instead of telling his story. I wanted to read a book about RUNNING MONEY, managing a hedge fund, trading with big money, that sort of thing. But this book is packed with paragraphs, pages and entire chapters of historical technology information...thats great and all but it belongs in a textbook. To make it worse for me, i read his \\"How We Got Here\\" book about the history of technology and markets and the EXACT same stories were copy and pasted into \\"Running Money\\". So im reading the same non-financial/trading info twice. The pages that were about his experiences were filled with a little too much uninteresting babble.

Kessler doesn't delve into the details of running a hedge fund, but focuses instead on the big picture.

But with so many funds they have trouble getting the cash. On one of these trips the author happens to be sitting next to a gentleman he ends up calling Mr. Zed that proves to be his guiding light by supplying some of the needed cash and the question to the author on what gives their fund an edge compared to the others. You follow along as they find the niche this provides some interesting history and comparisons between the steam engine and the computer chip and how each improved the more applications they had and as they become cheaper the barriers they breakdown.If you are a computer novice as myself you may get a little lost in some of the computer jargon.

This book starts in a similar vein, with stories about his efforts to raise money for his hedge fund. Then the book seems to completely lose its focus. It turns first into a high level history of the industrial revolution in England, and then into an economics lesson. The history is circumstantial and of questionable relevance. The economics is pure poorly thought out drivel. This stuff goes on for chapter after chapter. Had I written a review after the first few chapters, I would have given the book four stars. After finishing the book, I think I'm being generous giving it two stars."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"An easy way to get a lesson in world economics. The trouble is that I'm not so sure the lesson is correct. For instance, we import a laptop computer that's made in the far east. The production of that computer is fiercely competitive, there's almost no margin in its manufacture. But Microsoft gets about $100 for the Windows software that comes with it. And the profit to Intel for making the CPU is significantly higher than the profit on manufacturing the computer. Given a choice we should be far more concerned with getting these high profit components of the computer rather than manufacturing the computer itself.OK, I agree with that. This is fine if you're a software engineer at Microsoft or a chip designer at Intel. But what if just an ordinary guy, trying to make a living, perhaps at a blue collar job? With the shipment of the manufacturing overseas, a lot of those kinds of jobs have been eliminated. Then again, look at the overall unemployment rate, it's quite low. Obviously the U.S. economy is finding some kinds of jobs for all kinds of people.In this book, Andy Kessler says that we've moved beyond industrialization into an intellectual property economy. It's a point that needs to be considered, and besides that his book is a delight to read. His comedy like reporting makes the economics lesson go down easily."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"I read a LOT of financial storybooks, and this one is nothing exceptional: the author seems more interested in historicaly references than factual tales of beating the bushes for clients and investment ideas.

What I learned (but already knew) was the history of the tech stock craze in the later 90s. But Kessler also frames this around the Industrial Revolution and the development of the steam engine. That may be the one weakness in the book as an inordinate amount of time is spent on this analogy. It works but takes a while to get there.While he doesn't go in to great depth of the investing strategy, he does go through the general philosophies of what they were looking for and examples when they were successful. And he does it in an entertaining style.What does come through is the unique partnership he had with Fred and how it worked. Particularly at the end when they recognized the money and market were just too hot and they needed to pull back. That sounds easy in hindsight but anyone who was investing or managing money at that time will tell you how difficult it is to turn investors off after the great difficulty in getting their money.Where this book really shines is pure entertainment. With the exception of the steam engine analogy, this is a fast entertaining read written in a very witty style. Kessler is a gifted writer and I wouldn't be surprised to see him move to novels eventually. This book is like a perfect college class: you get entertained but learn something also. I strongly recommend this book to investors or anyone with interest in the history of technology companies."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"'Running Money' is about the 8th book i've read onthe 'Insiders Look at Investing'. Overall,Kessler's book is the shallowest. Kessler givessummary views on his opinions. It's not deep,it's flippant.The book discusses two main topics. The first topic isKessler's retelling of a day in the life of ahedge fund partner. Kessler cofounded a hedgefund specializing in tech stocks in 1996.Of course, he did spectacular! It was the hottestarea in the biggest boom of the 20th century.Right place, right time.Kessler discusses meeting lotsof different folks. Most of these folks hedoesn't like, and he shares his ridicule.You get the feeling you're with an over-confidentteenage boy, who has this need to put everyonedown, laugh at every person, twist the wordsto make a new meaning. (He often renames companies,changing the company name with a negative twist.)This narrative of starting and running the hedgefund is the better part of the book.Not because of Kessler's asides.But because as an investor, i want toknow how these funds operate. Of course, howKessler runs his fund doesn't mean that how otherhedgies operate theirs. Kessler's first book,'Wall Street Meat' was the same narrative book.The second part of the book is Kessler's viewson Intellectual Property. The author hasconvinced himself that he's got the keys to theeconomic universe, and intellectual propertyis that key. Since Kessler believes thecurrent US economy is structured to useintellectual property, the author feels all-is-well in the US economy. Basically, he's able to pick throughSilicon Valley companies, and find the potential winners.The problem is, Kessler sees the whole worldeconomy through the lens of intellectual property.And he doesn't bother to address any problems of theUS economy that refute his argument.The author cherry-picks examples to bolster his conclusions.He writes using a 'heres-my- thinking' approach,laying out the facts that hechooses to include, and showing how hereaches his Viola! moment.The problem is, his conclusionsare way too neat and perfect. A large part of theintellectual property argument tells us that'trade deficits don't matter'. Ok. But, he nevergives us counter-arguments on why other peoplefeel they do matter. There are many books writtenwith arguments on the ill-effects of a large tradedeficit. Kessler doesn't bother including these.And when he does include other arguments, he givesus a two-dimensional clown to represent theopposing side. At the end of the book he discussesa 'Haarvaad' economics professor, who believesGhana has the highest quality of life. This'economics prof' discusses Ghana exporting their'music'. (The whole argument from the professor isludicrous, and the reader is part of Kessler'sdismissive in-crowd ridicule of the professor.)No one i know would would accept this 'professors' arguments.Yet, Kessler gives the professor to us as thereigning example of an economics professor.And then he generalizes this to show why economicsprofessors practitioners are fools.Only 'investors' know whats up.(We never get a definition for 'Investor'.I wonder what he'd call an economics professorwho invests.)This professor's economics argument are not representativeof the discussion of trade imbalances. Kesslerlikes to find a fool, and then use that to dismissthe argument. Kessler likes to think that the thousandsof masters and PhD's and professionals in economics are all wrong,and he's found the obvious answer to world economics.Kessler briefly discusses the scandals that have rockedwall street over the past few years. Herhetorically asks \\"Do we need more regulation tostop this?\\" The answer is \\"No. It's up to eachinvestor to know the industry, the company, andeven meet the management.\\" Hmmmm.My opinion is that truthful accounting should be regulated, andthose that violate truth-in-accounting should be punished.There is an interesting paragraph in the book, when Kesslerhears of the fall of LTCM. He says \\"Those guys [LTCM] were buyingbonds, and profiting off the spreads. Is that investing?\\"He gives the impression that he didn't understand that modelof hedge fund investing deeply.Kesslers' is a pure stock-pickers hedge fund,specializing in high-tech stocks. Contrast that to LTCM,which made 95% of their s profits from bonds and derivatives.Two completely different typesof investing, yet both under the SEC categorization of'Hedge Fund'.All-in- all, Kessler's book comes across as a diatribegiven by your rich neighbor at a bar-b-q, self-justifying why the system works. It works becausehe's rich. Yet, the reader is left with the feelingthat it succeeded for other reasons than just Kessler'sefforts. I've heard it said that everyone is a genius in a bull market.For a much more thorough analysis of world economies,William Bernstein's \\"The Birth ofPlenty\\" uses a mature approach of proposition andargument, with relevant, historical examples thathelp prove his points. He's even got strong, relevantcounter-arguments.For a deep look at a hedge- fund (without the insider's view),Roger Lowenstein's \\"When Genius Failed. The Fall ofLTCM\\" is excellent.For a deep look at failed investments during the 1990's boom,try Lowenstein's 'Origins of the Crash'.Kessler's book helps pull the veil from the mysterious worldof hedge fund investing, and gives some information aboutone type of hedge fund inveesting.However, it doesn't give a thorough overview of the hedge-fundbusiness, and it's a fairly one-sided, single-company narrative.Kessler generalizes from a narrow set of situations.Kesslers' opinions of how world economics works doesn'tfit in with the narrow amount of supporting detail he gives."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"While classified here as a business & investing book, this could also be considered a new look at global economics.

Definitely a worthwhile read for just about anyone, investors or simply the curious."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Mr Kessler has shared his thoughtful analysis of the creation and spread of wealth in an easy to read format. He writes in simple terms, and thus simply communicates some concepts that are truly deep and thoughtful.He does not feel the need to demonstrate his intelligence (already well proven by his track record in technology as well as investing) to the reader, as many do, and thus communicates effectively.This is one of my favorite books of all time. A literal \\"page turner\\" analyzing and explaining such normally boring topics as wealth creation and investment strategies, with an emphasis on the digital revolution of the late '90's, and suggestions on lessons learned from this time period to aide in 21st century investing.Great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"Running Money was a fun and insightful read. Kessler's story telling is packaged in a witty and intriguing fashion that cuts the fat out and makes the pages breeze by. It provides nuggets of education and information about what it takes to be a successful investor/money manager.It wasn't quite the in-depth behind the scenes look into running a hedge fund that I was expecting. But I think most of that is due to Kessler's investment style. Instead of being one of the overflow of scalping hedgies, he actually did more homework via visits to conferences and companies than you would typically expect. His fund wasn't a big trader.As a result he didn't invest in every idea that came down the pike or the latest and hottest craze. No his approach was more novel, find a monster market, do your homework and discover the one or two key companies that will be a rainmaker in that market. With that simple approach he and his partner Fred Kittler were able to rack up a 55% annualize return from 1996-2001.Kessler was using a road map or blue print developed from knowledge of the industrial revolution. It is hard to make learning about the industrial revolution interesting but Andy has done it. He transferred the knowledge gained to the level where it has a modern day purpose for investing in the technology revolution.The book is both educational and entertaining in regards to making money and being a smarter investor. Pick it up."},{"Title":"Running Money : Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score","review":"An excellent book, easy to read, detailing the development of the computer in the eyes of an investor.

Cartoonist Jim Toomey presents the earliest incarnations of his immensely funny sea-dwelling goofballs, and I am loving every little page of it.Sherman tries his fin at being a rapper, the Loch Ness Monster makes a cameo at a stamp machine, Sherman learns where he is on the speed dial of love, Hawthorne gets antenna extensions (yes, we see this storyline later in the strip, but it's different and still funny here), and Fillmore makes another doomed attempt at finding his soulmate.There are some differences between these strips and the later ones. Hawthorne has long eyestalks and almost invisible mouth, there's more emphasis on secondary fishie characters, and some even take place (\\"Calvin & Hobbes-like\\") in a classroom with a forbidding teacher. The artwork is a bit rougher, the humor a little more scattered.

In this very well written book, Schuller distills his fifty years of building, bridging, and ministering down to the truths of daily living.Imagine having an opportunity to sit with a very wise person for a day or two...One who is willing to openly share his personal knowledge about the stuff of life - who and what is most important, how to face and overcome the struggles, how to achieve authentic happiness, and when the race is nearly done, how you can look back with satisfaction that you became what God wanted you to be.Robert H. Schuller is no ordinary elder statesman. While labeled a televangelist, Dr. Schuller is not just a televangelist. He has a broad mix of experiences that set him apart from his peers and others with his years. While a preacher and a very good one, he went against the grain of his own denomination by focusing not on sin but on HOPE. His entire ministry has been dedicated to helping all of us to \\"become what God wants us to be,\\" the essence of his \\"Possibility Thinking.\\"He gained great wisdom while pioneering (an entrepreneurs' entrepreneur)the creation of a mega-Church , the Crystal Cathedral; pioneering an international outreach via TV; and creating innovative ministries to heal and help many of those who are hurting or are in need.His influence here and abroad is readily apparent when one looks at the creation and expansion of other Churches who have adopted his \\"Mission\\" approach in reaching those who are seeking. The work of Rev. Bill Hybels, Willowcreek Church, (near Chicago), and Rev. Rick Warren (A Purpose Driven Life), Saddleback Church, (Orange County), are just two of Dr. Schuller's many students who bear witness to the fruit that has fallen from the Schuller tree.In \\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow,\\" Dr. Schuller, with great personal stories and anecdotes, discusses the power of optimism; the importance of determining one's mission; choosing the values that are most important; living with a \\"right\\" conscience; measuring tomorrow's risks and rewards; communicating with honesty and clarity; understanding life's contradictions and one's assumptions: and the overall importance in believing for grand tomorrow.This is Dr. Schuller's finest book yet! While it is an easy read, it is one that you will want read slowly and savor. It is full of golden nuggets of wisdom gained over his 50 years as a committed minister, entrepreneur, healer, and possibility thinker. Dr. Schuller has been fully committed to helping each of us be all that God has enabled us to be. His underlying life philosophy comes through loud and clear. This is a book many will enjoy. Many will keep this next to their bed stand for years, and many will provide this as a gift in helping others become what God wants them to be!"},{"Title":"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow : Living God's Dream for Your Life","review":"This is not Schuler's best book. I am fan of his weekly show, \\"The Hour of Power\\" and while his previous books have been outstanding, it's because most of them have dispensed practical advice and positive attitudes to his readers. As you can see if you watch his show, though, he seems to be getting a little more \\"loony\\" with age, for lack of a better term, and \\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow\\" continues on that path. This is less his typical style of writing and more a pat on the back for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of his ministry, which don't get me wrong is well-deserved, and also an extension of his autobiography of a few years back, \\"My Journey\\". A little too much \\"rah-rah-sis-koombah\\" for my liking in this book. But it's Schuller, so if you like him, I recommend it still. Just don't expect anything new."},{"Title":"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow : Living God's Dream for Your Life","review":"Robert Schuller has ever been my inspirational role model and all his books are greater wisdom. Another author Paul Coelho comes to my mind apart from Harold Kushner,Deepak Chopra, Robin Sharma, Osho,etc whose book collection I cherish the most. However, Robert Schuller's books are great guiding light and stand a class apart in spiritual training. Robert schuller speaks the wisdom of living - Motivating, Inspiring and changing Attitudes for a better Positive living lifestyle. This book of RS reflects the most positive flow of thinking 'Be what you are, what god what you to be'. Rob shares his wisdom and power of positive thinking to be optimistic. With great personal stories and anecdotes, likewise his other books, this one has a fine line down the read that speaks of wise advice 'Don't throw away tomorrow - Live the dreams'. Among his best reads I like are:Tough Times Never Last, Tough People Do!Life is Fair but God is goodTough Minded Faith for Tender HeartsThe (Be) Happy AttitudesSuccess is never Ending, Failure is never finalIt's going to be me, It's upto me.Though my best choice pick is Tough minded Faith for tender hearts, this one is an exceptional book as it really has the insight to think ahead to future and turn dreams to reality. I've read all his books and they are best in my library. I also make it a point to gift to the people I like and feel I wish to share Rob's wisdom.

I love hearing about how God provided when he moved to California with $500 and a dream. Of particular interest in this book is the discussion of the scientific study of intuition. He tells us...\\"scientists are now beginning to recognize the existence and importance to our overall health of 'spirit.'\\" He uses the term \\"theosomatic\\" to describe that we're body, mind, and spirit. This contrasts with the \\"somatic\\" approach that looks at body and \\"psychosomatic\\" that views body and mind.Dr. Schuller has a chapter on contractions. He explains how we're faced with realities that seem to be in conflict with each other. He concludes that section that talking about the ultimate contraction, i.e., life and death. \\"I put my trust in one person, Jesus Christ, who combines this ultimate contradiction through His resurrection. Jesus is in the land of the living--heaven. Every one of us can think of somebody very precious to us who has left the land of the dying and is now in the land of the living.

Keynes is easily the most recognizable name in 20th century economics, followed somewhat closely by John Kenneth Galbraith and Milton Friedman.In the book's preface, Skidelsky claims he was the first biographer to attempt to go into detail about Keynes' hitherto undiscussed homosexual relationships. The most notable and emotionally involved of these affairs occured with painter and fellow Bloomsbury member Duncan Grant. Skidelsky confirms that Keynes also slept with Bloomsbury biographer Lytton Strachey. Several corresponding letters between Keynes and Strachey not only confirm this, but a subsequent sexual rivalry over the affections of Grant. G.E. Moore's 'Principia Ethica' unquestionably wrought out a strong influence on Keynes and Strachey's radical sexual attitudes after they had read it. Some unfastidious anti-Keynesians have tried to tie in Keynes' early predispositions to homosexuality (he later in life married a Russian Ballet dancer named Lydia Lopokova) with his rejection of the gold standard. This probably isn't a valid argument, given the level of abstraction Keynes' mind reached at an early age to develop and entertain such unorthadox methods.Keynesian economics has been repudiated by many laissez-faire proponents over the past two decades. The most well reasoned of these critiques have come from Friedman and Robert Lucas; who have each received Nobel Prizes for their work. Notwithstanding, both pale in comparison with the impact Keynesianism has had on post-WW2 macroeconomics.Whether or not you're an unyeilding Keynesian or a free market capitalist, you'll find it impossible not to marvel at this remarkable biography of a remarkable man. Keynes should be included at the top of anyone's list of the 20th century's most important intellectuals."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"Somebody, probably in The Economist, once wondered why Keynes had not achieved the cult status of a Freud or Einstein. This book will just let those people inclined to wonder so sink even deeper in contempt for posterity, cause Keynes had it all, the intellectual power, the social brilliance (and a decidedly wicked private life in the Bloomsbury circles), and the conscience of a mission to be accomplished, quite simply to save civilisation...Skidelsky's talent as a biographer is beyond praise."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"John Maynard Keynes' life faithfully portrayed by Robert Skidelsky, is a life of a man grown up amidst the intelectual aristocracy of his time, which coincided with the beginning of the downfall of the Victorian age and was to culminate in the First World War. His father John Neville Keynes was a famous economist of his time and had many other intelectual atributes which he didn't want to put up to test in the academic arena, despite a lot of incentives by the famous economist Alfred Marshall, the most proeminent thinker of the neo-classics school of thought. Neville Keynes was determined instead to follow closely and have influence upon the professional careers of his most inteligent son. To anyone who whished to compare this situation to the education the philosopher James Mill gave to his son John Stuart Mill, I would warn he/she to be cautious cause the result is very much different than could be foresaw.What the book shows is the fascinating formative years of one of the most influential men of all times, who had a strong appetite for getting all the knowledge he could get and who didn't hide behind his geniality. Quite to the contrary, Keynes was up for everything he could grab, be it different sexual male partners, a lot of trips to Italy and a lot of academic prizes, estimulated by the spirit of competion his father tried to assert on him, at the end to no avail. Also, the pace of his intelectual output is outstanding, being Keynes almost always pushed to the limit to do a lot of different things at the same time.Some crude aspects of Keynes sexual life are also all there via the transcriptions of the many letters he exchanged with his male lovers and friends of the many different intelectual cycles he was part of.His education at the noblest institutions in England (Eton and Cambridge)where he got the opportunity to intermingle with the likes of Bertrand Russell, Virginia Wolf, Whitehead and the philosopher Moore, the latter certainly the most fundamental influence he had in these formative years, provided the social and intelectual backgrounds needed to awake the geniality of the most brilliant economist of the last century."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"Hopes betrayed is an exceptionally well researched and insightful book. The author goes into detail, and confirms previously unspoken truths about Keynes early life. It pays particular attention to Keynes homosexuality, such as his long held affections for Duncan Grant, and also his relationships, coiteries, and philosophies. Personally I found the chapters deailing Keynes' influence in the war most interesting.Although the book goes into ample detail, it is a little dry, and possibly lacks a little life. One sometimes feels as if there are a few too many quotes, names and places. This somewhat detracts from the interest of the book.However, overall anyone who is curious as to what made father of modern economics ought to read this book."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"This profoundly researched and uncensored (sexually speaking) biography gives us a fascinating look into a highly privileged group of people in England when the British Empire was at its zenith. Half (sic) of the world's trade was financed by British credits in 1914.It pictures the education of young Keynes, groomed by his parents for the highest civil duties, his acceptance in the exclusive Cambridge Apostles Circle (a main discussion point was Higher Sodomy) and his membership of the, in all aspects, anarchic Bloomsbury group. It shows without restaint Keynes' (homo)sexual awakening and his conventional (based on the Gold Standard) beginnings as an economist.In the meantime, this book reveals the functioning of the British elitist School system (Eton, Cambridge) as well as the 'moral' environment of this period: the death of God and the birth of mass democracy.Prof. Skidelsky's book contains a wealth of information on e.g. the conservative reasoning behind the Gold Standard, Utilitarianism or Moore's essentialistic, but influential, ethic system.He shows us Keynes as a fundamental nationalist: 'it is better to have Englishmen running the world than foreigners'.But nothwithstanding his exhausting efforts, he saw Britain and mainland Europe sinking under the war debts and being taken over by the US as world power, which was effectively controlled by one man, J.P. Morgan.He attacked severely the Versailles Treaty but was devastated that politicians preferred suicidal short-time revenge and election success rather than long-time beneficial solutions.This book is sometimes too detailed with extensive letter excerpts. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"This book is an excellent choice for a potential reader who is searching for a general overview of Keynes's early life.Like Moggridge's one volume study,Skidelsky's first volume(of three)has many interesting anecdotes and discussions of Keynes's interactions and involvement with a wide range of people.Unfortunately,Skidelsky drops the ball when he tries to evaluate the technical and intellectual contributions that Keynes made to applied probability,statistics and decision science in the period from 1904 to 1920. Keynes finally published his pathbreaking work in 1921 in his A Treatise on Probability(TP).A specialist can only come to the conclusion that Keynes made no breakthroughs in his TP after reading Skidelsky's bare bones treatment.This is most likely due to the fact that Skidelsky is a historian who has no training in the fields of mathematics, probability and statistics.It is true that Skidelsky limits his discussion of the TP in his first volume because he wanted to make an extended discussion of it in the second volume.Unfortunately,the treatment of the TP in volume II is badly marred by a number of mathematical errors.The interested potential book buyer is advised to read my review of volume II.Skidelsky fails to mention anywhere in Volume I that Keynes is the founder of the interval estimate approach to probability.In general,excluding the cases of symmetry and series or sequences composed of homogeneous frequency data,it takes two numbers,not one,to correctly specify an estimate of probability.A probability estimate is thus made up of a lower bound and an upper bound.Further,Keynes specified a clearcut approximation method based on the original work of George Boole in chapters 15 and 17 of the TP.The reader should note that all of this material is present in Keynes's 1907 and 1909 fellowship theses that he submitted to Cambridge University.Also present in these theses is an index created to measure the weight of the evidence,w.Keynes used different terms to describe weight,such as value,before settling for the term weight in the final published 1921 version.w measure the completeness of the relevant, potential evidence upon which a decision maker is going to base an estimate of probability.w is defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,i.e.,0&lt;=w&lt;=1.Finally,Skidelsky ignores Keynes's conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.Keynes presented this coefficient in both the 1907 thesis and the 1909 thesis ,which was accepted.This coefficient is the first time in history that a decision rule incorporated nonlinear probability preferences, as well as the weight of the evidence ,or what D.Ellsberg later called the ambiguity of the evidence in a 1961 Quarterly Journal of Economics article."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes: Volume 1: Hopes Betrayed 1883-1920","review":"I dont undastand vut I am suppost 2 doooooo. Vut iz rong?????"},{"Title":"Error, Misuse, Failure: Object Lessons From The English Renaissance","review":"Is there a better book on early modern things than Julian Yates' brilliant study? There's been a lot of work on Renaissance objects recently, but none approaches the theoretical sophistication and engaging weirdness of Yates' discussion of how early modern objects that were meant to be invisible - miniature paintings, \\"privies\\" or toilets, papist relics - drew attention to themselves by not doing what they were intended to do. In this, Yates anticipates but also surpasses Sara Ahmed's recent account of \\"failed objects.\\" Yates' approach to things, like Jonathan Gill Harris' in his recent book Untimely Matter in the Time of Shakespeare, also has express affinities with the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour: early modern culture, in his analysis, comprises extraordinarily unpredictable, dynamic networks of human and non-human actors. One of the joys of this book is its refreshingly quirky style, but it goes well beyond the whimsical \\"aren't early modern things wonderfully strange\\" stance of so much work in the field. Among other things, Yates implicitly asks us to question the prim orthodoxies of a strain of Marxist criticism that views any attribution of agency to objects as an impermissible category confusion typical of capitalist commodity fetishism. This book should be read by any grad student who wants to understand how Renaissance studies can be theoretically complex yet enormous fun."},{"Title":"Linear Estimation","review":"Kailath, Sayed, and Hassibi do an excellent job of explaining what is a fairly complicated subject. This book is best-suited for scholars who desire a deep understanding of estimation theory. Engineers who want to quickly understand how to implement a Kalman Filter might be better off buying Adaptive Filter Theory by Simon Haykin.The first chapter provides a good overview of the book, although it makes the most sense once the subject matter of the rest of the book has been digested a bit. A consistent framework emphasizing innovations (or the new information which appears at any iteration) is used throughout the book, and both continuous and discrete-time techniques for stochastic estimation are given nearly equal treatment, although the real-world engineer is likely to be interested in the latter.Professor Kailath's articulate nature and knack for the clever anecdote or one-liner shines throughout the book, making it, while very mathematical in nature, quite readable for the motivated student."},{"Title":"Linear Estimation","review":"This is one of the best engineering textbooks I have read, period. Although the subject matter is not for the faint-hearted, the authors' attention to pedagogical details shine throughout (repetition is the key to learning). The Kalman filter is introduced naturally as a consequence of a general framework for obtaining the best linear estimator of a random variable given others (earlier observations), and the geometric intuition is stressed repeatedly.No important issue is omitted, including a very complete treatment of numerical issues and fast algorithms. My only gripe is with the assumption that all model parameters are KNOWN; in other words, the important aspect system identification (parameter estimation, learning, or whatever you call it in your field) is left to other textbooks.Moreover, and no minor accomplishment, is the amazingly small number of typographical errors (at least up to where I have read so far; a bit over half the book), which is remarkable given the dense mathematical contents.All in all, I would give it 6 stars if possible. Everything is there: it transmits a deep intuition for the matter, a places it in its historical context through interesting and amusing notes; it leaves the reader fulfilled but not overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Linear Estimation","review":"This is an excellent text that covers estimation theory from a modern point of view. It will be especially interesting to anyone with a graduate degree in physics because Kailath, et al derive the theory of linear estimation from a point of view very similar to that of modern quantum mechanics - they even use similar bra/ket notation!Basic and advanced statistical mathematics is somewhat an implied prerequisite for understanding this text. From what I have seen, I honestly find nothing negative to critique - its probably one of the best technical textbooks I have in my large library."},{"Title":"Linear Estimation","review":"I came to this book with a need to become familiar with Kalman filters. I've read the first two chapters so far with great pleasure. Professor Kailath develops the material beautifully; his profound mastery of the field is evident in every paragraph. The material is concentrated, but is presented in a highly readable compelling style. The reader is expected to be comfortable with the basics of linear systems theory, probability, and matrix analysis, although extensive appendices provide the necessary background."},{"Title":"A Christmas Spirit","review":"A very inspiration book.

Author Stevens has provided a succinct overview of the philosphy of Aikido. What is at least as impressive is how he ties in religious and philosophical threads from many other traditions, eastern and western, ancient and modern, in a way which sets Aikido's spirituality in a wonderfully broad and rich context. He does this in a way which is not at all forced or contrived, but truly sensible and resonant. A work of this philosophical and religious depth is a real find at any price.Personally, I found this book very moving and thought-provoking, and a great help in my spiritual search.

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"Waiting for the Moon was an enchanting story by Ms. Hannah.

Ms. Hannah reminds us that even where love is concerned, the right choice must be made, not necessarily the choice you want to make with your heart. Her female characters are strong and her story lines make the reader wish our lives were even half as romantic. I'm eagerly awaiting more books by Ms. Hannah."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"Waiting For The Moon is another tearjerker from Kristin Hannah in which the reader becomes totally absorbed into the characters and the story.

Wonderful love story without all of the mush and gush!!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"Often I get tired of the perfect hero and the divine heroine. Kristin Hannah's characters come alive because they are so flawed, fragile and fascinating! This wonderful book grabbed my attention from the first chapter when Selena attempts suicide and all the quirky turn of events leading up to the final chapter. The book slowed down somewhat in the middle, but continue reading because the pace picks up again and keeps you engrossed to the final page. Selenas battered soul comes alive when she falls in love with Ian, the physician who saves her....but, he has demons of the heart he has to struggle with before learning from her what love is. Their fight for love is so intense and heartfelt you'll feel that no two people ever loved more deeply then Selena &amp; Ian."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"After reading \\"Magic Hour\\" I ran out and bought every book by Kristin Hannah at the used bookstore I could lay my hands on. I absolutely loved \\"Magic Hour\\". However, \\"Waiting for the Moon\\" was a bit of a disappointment - it was obviously written when the author was younger and less experienced as a writer. The plot was good - a great premise for a story, I thought - but the writing itself shouted \\"novice\\" and the dialogue was cheesy and quite unbelievable in parts. The characters have a hard time staying \\"in character\\", but I was willing to overlook what I consider a blatant flaw because the story itself was so engaging."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"I have enjoyed many of Kristin's novels. This one is beautifully written. The characters come alive and make the reader laugh and cry all at once. It is a discovery for Ian and Selena and the residents at the Doctor's mansion/asylum. They discover who they are and were and who they should be. This is a definate read for all of Kristin's readers."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"This book reminded me of Judith McNaught's \\"Until You\\", with the anmesia theme, just not as good. I just didn't feel for the characters. The baby talk with Serena got on my nerves. I guess you just need to be in the mood for this kind of story."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"Couldn't put this book down. Ian has to be one of my all-time favorite romantic characters: Tortured, flawed, alternatingly obsessive and despairing/hopeful and ardent - the only aspect of his character which I found disappointing was that he was likened to a blond Adonis (he should have been as dark and mysterious, like his tortured soul!)Ian, a once successful doctor, developed a sort of \\"sixth sense\\" after an accident, which caused him to experience often upsetting visual images when touching his patients. Unable to cope with this so-called \\"gift,\\" coupled with the fact that he is labeled a \\"mad doctor\\" and shunned by the community, he shuts himself away in Lethe, a sort of mini-mental institution, his mother being among the residents. Here Ian closes himself off physically and emotionally...until the day Selena, a \\"Jane Doe\\" nearly dead from an unsuccessful suicide attempt, is brought to his door. Selena first revives Ian's passion for medicine, then his ability to feel and to love.I was disappointed that Ian never got any words/images when touching Selena which would have revealed something of her past life - didn't feel it was satisfactorily explained as to why he didn't. I also would have liked to have seen some sort of happiness or peace for Johann in the end.Though peripheral characters sometimes clutter a story, I found the residents of Lethe intriguing.The whole Shaker Bretheren bit with Elliot was rather anticlimatic - and I felt that Ian and Selena fell into bed with one another a little too easily. Overall, though, I found myself struggling to put the book down."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"I loved all of it. ..the way Selena saw the world after the accident was amazing.

Not only do we have a historical romance but one that is socially-conscious as are most of Hannah's superb books. Here, we learn the meaning of accepting people with differences and challenges, the merit of any family for merging regarding distinctions. A wonderful novel, a page turner, a romance that is not disgusting or typical."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"I love Kristin Hannah books. This one was set in a time when not alot was known about medicine and people where put in institutions when they didn't know what was really wrong with them. Hannah connects medicine with family and comes up with a good book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"I am a huge Hannah fan and have read all of her recent books over the past year. I was not familiar with her until a year ago so now I am going back and reading her older stuff. I was NOT impressed with this book at all. It takes place in the 1800's and frankly is boring. All of her other books have kept me so captivated that I would read every spare minute I got; this one took me 2 months to get through because I just didn't have the motivation to read it and I finished 2 other books in the meantime."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"This book was very well written and sucked you into the story.It made you stop and think about life and how much better it would be if we all found good out of everything that happens to us each day and not live in the past.

This one is very sweet and wonderfully romantic. However, the reason for the three stars ~~ the first three-fourths of the book was drawn out and the last quarter of the book felt like it was rushed and incomplete. This book left more questions unanswered than answered. It's a very sweet romance and I enjoyed it.This one begins with a mysterious woman jumping off the cliffs in front of a boatman's eyes. He rescues her and brings her to the local asylum for the insane. Dr. Ian Carrick, a famous has-been doctor, tries to rescue her for his selfish purposes. And there's all the other characters in the book that makes up a wonderful medley of family members for Selena who wakes up unable to remember who she was. She struggles to learn how to talk, dress and live life again ~~ she brings wonder and joy to that dark house and to the brooding doctor's heart.If you're looking for a lovely romance ~~ this book fits the bill. It is enjoyable and wonderful ~~ perfect for those lazy summer days.8-11-06"},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"Waiting for the Moon is like waiting for grass to grow. The plot centers around a sexy beautiful young woman who is infantilized by a head injury. Naturally there is a handsome narcissist doctor who is obsessed with recreating helpless, childlike Salena into an image to suit his fantasy. Under the confused speech and little girt innocence...there beats the heart and sexuality of a woman.............UGH! I didn't think they wrote books like this anymore. The story is replete with obvious cliche's designed to highten sexual tension...why there is even a ripped bodice in there somewhere!

I found this to be unbelievable."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"This book was a real epiphany for me. Selena tries to commit suicide but wakes from the attempt with a severe head injury that leaves her with amnesia. Without a past, she struggles to recover and finds each day a joy with the curiosity and eagerness of a child to re-learn about her world. This made me wonder how much of our past drags us down with its disappointments, resentments, and pain that we cannot let go. If we could forgive and release the past completely would it be unable to muffle the joys we could find in each new day? This story challenged me to try to experience Selena's methods without bashing my brains on a rock!I loved all the diverse characters in Selena's new world and was touched by the love story between her and Ian. Ms. Hannah aptly demonstrates the truth that love is the most healing medicine of all. It is only after Selena and Ian come together that the story fell apart for me. I found it completely out of character that Selena would accept so readily where she was next led.When Selena woke she was very adamant about not accepting rules in her new life that did not make sense to her. Refusing to wear a restricting corset, wearing pants (gasp!) to play in the sea, refusing to eat meat of a dead animal. Would she then quietly accept the old and soul killing rules of her previous life again? I don't think so. It would have been more in character for her to bring healing and a fresh breath of air to that world as well. I was disappointed that she was so willing to let her old life crush her once more. If it hadn't been for a turn of fate it looked like she was just going to let the gifts she had been given slip out of her hands. That was not the Selena we had grown to love. Of course Hannah is going to give us a happy ending, but I would have been more satisfied if Selena had earned it with more of the joyous rebellion she had shown us during her recovery. Despite that flaw it is a story that will linger long in my memory."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Moon","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book. Even when I was half way through with it, I still had trouble keeping on. I kept trudging through it because once I spend any amount of time reading a book, I have to finish it no matter how painful it is.It was very slow, but I just kept believing that the ending would make it worth the effort.

As Selena improved physically & mentally, her joy and love of life became the defining factor in everyone's lives around her. She was downright infectious!

It is supposed to be the first Fansler novel, yet none of the characters are properly introduced. Kate's final analysis of the murder is tenuous and based on nothing.

But even Kate's character couldn't transcend this dullish plot and improbable ending (I mean, after all, how do you get a man you have only met a couple of times to take off his clothes and show you the scar on his spine?). And to base the conclusion of a novel on that artifice is neither believable or satisfying in a logical sense."},{"Title":"In the last analysis (Avon Classic Crime Collection)","review":"This is really strange.

If I had read this book first, I probably would not be inclined to continue with this series. I felt like I was just dropped into the middle of a cast of characters without being properly introduced to them and what their roles are (history, etc.). The one thing that seems to be consistent is Cross' habit of long sentences infused with prepositional phrases and lots of words like however, therefore, etc. I realize the protagonist is an English professor, and I don't have any problem understanding the sentences, but I find myself getting impatient having to wade through all that excess just to get to the point of a sentence.

And it is a *supplement*, not exactly a complete book in its own right. Not that there's anything wrong with that: Ms. Becker is a very different, very individual voice among the others who knew Sylvia, very much her own person-another writer, another mother, not a genius, but definitely a friend-and frankly, the sort of friend Plath desperately needed, and one we'd all be well-off to be able to turn to in despair, as Sylvia famously(well, it's famous *now*)did in the last days of her life. Some of the observations here, never repeated anywhere else, are indeed \\"haunting\\": the wearying task of sitting up all night with an emotionally disturbed girlfriend, at wit's end about exactly what to do; the unsettling visit of Becker to Plath's apartment to fetch neccessary items, finding the place eerily clean and apparently empty of children's clothes(Plath had two toddlers); the abrupt changes in Plath's moods, the memory of Sylvia, dressed to the nines, about to go out on the next-to-last evening of her life for a mysterious \\"date\\"(with her husband? with another suitor? We'll never know)stopping at the door to smile down at her baby son and tell him warmly, \\"I love you\\"-these are the sorts of observations that could come firsthand from only an intimate, if not a longterm friend. The memories regarding Ted Hughes' behaviour after Plath's suicide are something else again-quite a shock, and also quite believeable. You won't find much of that elswhere, either.The thing about Plath memoirs and writings is that all of them seem to offer little pieces of the massive puzzle that was the poet and the woman. This is one more small piece that I'm very grateful was published."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"A measured and moving account of Sylvia Plath's final hours, as well as a keen portrait of Ted Hughes's egotism and denial. Jillian Becker proves herself a loyal yet honest friend, even though her relationship with Plath was brief. I've already read this slim book twice. I find it haunting."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"Best line: \\"Just as kindness is inadequate, and beauty hard to bear, happiness itself can be intolerable.\\"In Jillian Becker's Giving Up, she revisits the last moments she spent with her friend, Sylvia Plath. Her memories are solid at times and shaky at others, but she is quick to note when she doesn't recall an event in detail. Giving Up is only 73 pages and I read it in under an hour. Still, Becker's words resonate with the time and thought it took her to get to a point where she can write about her friend from the perspective of someone who shared her last moments. Becker mentions other Plath biographers who asked her to tell them her story, but apparently none did it to her satisfaction or with the degree of accuracy she felt was necessary, causing her to write this little book. As someone who is fascinated with the legend that Sylvia Plath's life and death has become, this book was fulfilling and full of useful information. However, it's not a novel, and Becker's views are definitely skewed to paint Ted Hughes as the bad guy in their marriage as well as the ultimate cause of Plath's untimely death (not a new notion, by any means, but I haven't seen it written before with such malice). That being said, I did think this book was worthwhile for anyone who likes Sylvia Plath and is fascinated by the mystery surrounding her life and death."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"I've read plenty of books about the late Sylvia Plath and her tumultuous relationship with poet Ted Hughes. This book may not be a necessity to my library, but I don't regret having bought it. Becker provides some interesting, insightful remarks on Plath's last days. She paints a dead-on portrait of the despair and emotional trauma Plath was suffering during their last meeting. One line in particular that stands out is when Becker remarks on Plath's priorities being off-kilter, claiming that she was a writer first and a mother next. As harsh as it struck me at first, it actually helped me to realize that Becker is not only writing from a sentimental standpoint, but from the \\"one who has been left behind\\" perspective as well. She makes no apologies. Did Sylvia commit suicide because she was confident her death would make her a legend? It would seem that she did possess such confidence. Becker seems to think so as well. But this isn't the overriding message of the book. Jillian Becker misses her friend, a woman who never laughed in her company but reached out to her in the end. Neither held on tight enough."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I do find most reviewers glean the wrong thing from this book. Jillian Becker KNEW Sylvia Plath, knew her personally-- went to her home, gathered her belongings, allowed Plath to stay in her home, she even took care of Plath's children when Sylvia could not find the will to do so herself.Another thing people misunderstand is the notion of suicide. If you are looking for the answer to WHY..the big WHY she \\"did it\\" then you have very little understanding of Sylvia herself, depression, and suicide. This book is not going to tie up any loose ends or give anyone anything they didn't have before--that's not what it's supposed to do...It's a way of filling in the gaps; where the previous biographers, journalists, reporters, only knew the Plath they saw, spoke to, -- that which was reflected in her poetry -- no one really knew her like a good old friend, a friend that Jillian Becker was.Beware: Becker is very honest, which is a good thing but some may not view it as such.The book is very short, and rightfully so. Only a small amount of time (I believe it's 3 days or so) is covered here, and that's perfect. The back cover of the book contains a review from \\"The Independent\\" (London) which puts it perfectly: \\"Jillian Becker fits in more good sense and compassion on the subject of Sylvia Plath than books ten times as long.\\""},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"This story, though interesting and yes, haunting is largely a self-serving product from an admitted poet wannabe, whom, I feel, hoped that by being associated with Sylvia Plath, some of Plath's genius would rub off on her. They were only \\"friends\\" for a very short time, and I sensed jealousy in her words regarding Plath's writing, although admittedly she did take care of her when Plath had no one else and reached out in desperation. For that she should be admired, for depression is an ugly THING that will suck the life out of the sufferer and all those around them. I just question her motives in her relationship with Plath (how did they meet? How did they bond? etc.), and in writing this book. I hear \\"LOOK AT ME!\\" loud and clear. The whole chapter regarding Hughes'perceived anti-semitism?? I understand that the author is Jewish, but how is that dissection and her offense to it relevant to Plath's story? Plath wasn't an anti-semite. THAT most of all was self-serving.(\\"I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY! LISTEN TO ME!\\") It's the author's story and experience, and I get it but not much of the information contained in this very small book about a very short and who knows how close relationship is information that is not covered in the plethora of Plath biographies and such. It fulfills the morbid curiosity and I admit that is why I read it, but Sylvia Plath was SO much more than the way she died, and her death was largely all this author knew of her. I don't feel that Becker had anything of consequence to say that other biographers haven't already said on the subject. This, the world could have done without, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"One of the most fascinating aspects of Plath's literary and personal mythology is the need for so many others to give voice and interpretation to a highly educated, highly vocal woman who muted herself. Becker joins the ranks of numerous scholars and critics by putting in her analysis as a friend and admirer of Sylvia. Still, I fail to see how Becker delivered much of worth.Do we really need this book? No. Did I get it because of my morbid fascination with the lost last days that Hughes relegated to assumption because he burned her final diary entries? Yes. Am I satisfied? By no means.I agree with several other reviewers who stated this could have better had it been relegated to essay or article format. The book is quite short, especially on the final days of Sylvia Plath's life. It is skimmed over so quickly, with little recollection of actual events that the reader is left with the haunting mood Plath left Becker with on that final night. After these several inadequate pages, Becker explains her thoughts on the funeral (something I had never read about). And then we are taken through a long redundant explanation of how no one could help Sylvia, and Hughes should assume his responsibility for what happened.Becker brings in a couple of Hughes and Plath's poems to aid her in explaining how she came to some of her conclusions about their relationship. And then Becker delves into which of the two was an anti-Semite(?!). She ends the book with how ironic it was that the feminist movement appropriated Plath as the eternal victim of male aggression and oppression, when in fact Becker thought of her as happy in her feminine roles (she does contradict this point in the text). One interesting line was how Sylvia did not like her name pronounced to rhyme with \\"math,\\" it should have been pronounced \\"Plaath.\\"Maybe I expected too much from such a slim volume. But I think Becker mislead her readers as well. I recommend this only for fans of Sylvia Plath that must read it all--regardless of how good/bad, positive/negative a book may be. Read Sylvia Plath's poetry and prose for a truly rewarding read, her own words serve her best."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"The fact that this book is small and doesn't answer a lot of the basic background questions as to how they knew each other or who Jillian Becker is is part of the appeal. It's about Sylvia's last days on earth, not a history lesson of who is who and how they got wherever. I really enjoyed how this was written. Very detached, observant, detailed. Even the descriptions of the food Jillian made for Sylvia and her kids were unexpectedly interesting. We may not learn from this book the big Why but that isn't the goal. We all know how it ends. No one for sure can say exactly what it was that pushed her over the edge. We get a glimpse through an open window into her last days and it is on the one hand, fascinating and on the other, terribly sad. If this book had been 300 pages, it never would have worked. There's already too much writing about Sylvia's life. This works so well because it covers three days. The darkest three days of her life."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"What happened with this book? As other reviewers have noted, it is very slight -- less than 100 pages, almost pocket-book size.The author never tells us exactly how she first became acquainted with Sylvia Plath and her husband Ted Hughes, and it would have been interesting to know how this striking and charismatic literary couple impressed her.There's no context for her own part in the story -- what was Becker doing at that time? Had she begun to write professionally? She mentions giving up the notion of writing poetry when humbled by her reading of the work Plath showed her, but doesn't tell us much about her own ambitions, milieu or activities. Becker's husband Gerry plays an important role in the narrative, helping to take care of Plath, even driving her home on the night of her suicide, but we aren't told whether he too was a writer, artist or other brand of intellectual, nor whether the Beckers stayed married nor if he is even still living.There is some unforgettable new material in Becker's account of the gathering in a pub after Plath's burial, which puts Ted Hughes in a bad light -- interesting, considering the recent rehabilitation of his reputation vis-a-vis Plath in Diane Middlebrook's &quot;Her Husband&quot; and Elaine Feinstein's biography of Hughes.Unfortunately, Becker probably waited too long to tell her own version of the last events of Plath's life. Too often, she'll say that she doesn't remember what they talked about on some occasion -- honest, but frustrating.When I finished the book, I started paging through it again, as if I thought I would find the rest of the story this time. Becker could have given us an authoritative glimpse of the young creative people she and Plath lived among in the London of that time -- &quot;a string of luminaries about to be switched on&quot; is her nice phrase for them -- but she seems to have been in a hurry to get the bare facts down and to move on.She writes that she was moved to write the memoir because some of Plath's biographers had interviewed her, then used little or nothing of what she had to tell them. Where is all that misundertood or unused material? I felt that Giving Up had the potential to be a better, fuller book, but something -- time, guilt or disinclination to the memoir genre -- got in the author's way."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"This is a very short book about the last days of Sylvia Plath, an American poet who committed suicide in London in 1963 while suffering severe depression.Jillian Becker and her husband, Gerry, were the last people Sylvia had contact with the days before taking her own life.I found the story very moving but the author could have made more of it and provide a deeper exploration both of their friendship and Sylvia's depressive illness.Most of the book sounds like a rant from someone who was probably quite a new and superficial friend but who seems to hold a grudge against Sylvia because they didn't get the attention they deserved after her suicide. It's sounds a bit like \\"Everybody got a bit of the celebrity pie, I deserve mine too!\\". At one point, the author says she felt \\"humiliated by Sylvia's disdain\\" when referring to the fact that Sylvia died without leaving a note to her and her husband. If someone is so depressed so as to take their own life, they should be forgiven for not writing thank you notes or goodbye notes to everyone they know.The author admits to having felt \\"envious\\" of Sylvia's poetry and the whole tone of the book makes you wonder if there was a real friendship between the two. I don't see a lot of empathy coming from the author. She goes off a tangent when she criticises Hughes's poem Dreamers for being anti Semitic, and later Sylvia for comparing her suffering to that of Holocaust victims. She might have a point, but it sounds as if the book is more about her own issues and defending her own Jewishness than about Sylvia's tragic final days.The author also puts too much emphasis on the fact that she cooked lovely meals for Sylvia and took care of her and her children for a few days as if to force the audience to give her credits for her actions. I know it must be extremely hard to look after a depressive friend, especially when you have a family yourself, but a true friend makes no fuss about it and just gets on with it. Least of all write a book years later to tell the world she's still expecting recognition for it.The book left me a sour taste in my mouth. Sylvia was a very sensitive person, who most of her life felt quite like an outsider, hence her comparing herself with Jewish people. She was extremely lonely and desperate in the last days of her life with two small children to look after in a foreign country. I cannot imagine anything sadder than that. Becker's book doesn't pay tribute to their friendship or the times spent together; it's just the diatribe of someone involved in petty gossip and small jealousies, someone who has a huge chip their shoulder because she didn't get her fair share of fame in the Sylvia-Hughes saga. Her story is a vivid illustration of how alienating life must have felt for Sylvia at the time, and that even those who took care of her in her darkest times seemed to be expecting deep down something in return."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"In Jillian Becker's brief (thirty-minute read) book about her friendship with the famous poet Sylvia Plath, she recounts her final days in a straightforward, brutally honest manner. Her motivation in publishing her side of the story is to tell her side of the story and set the record straight, since information she has provided to multiple sources on the topic has been largely ignored, and sometimes, suppressed. The tiny volume is a mere 73 pages short, containing only six chapters: The Last Days [those that Plath and children spent in the company of the author and her family immediately preceding her death], Remembered Conversations [things they talked about regarding poetry and Plath's ex-husband, poet Ted Hughes, who abandoned his family for another woman], The Funeral [the event and post-funeral dinner conversation], Afterward [Plath's post-death fame and information Becker provided to biographers], Slightly Filthy [Becker debunks certain portions of Hughes's poem Dreamers regarding Assia's ancestry and discusses his and Plath's poetry as relates to Judaism, anti-Semitism and the Holocaust], and Myth [Plath's feelings on feminism].About the various players in the life (and death) of Sylvia Plath, Becker has plenty to say. Of the woman Hughes left Plath for, Assia Wevill (who also committed suicide, and murdered her daughter who was fathered by Hughes), Becker writes that she was (p 11) \\"vain and shallow.\\" Hughes gets the royal treatment. He was, she claims, (p 23) \\"[s]elf-absorbed\\" and (p 72) \\"faithless and brutal as a Nazi.\\" After the post-funeral meal he proclaimed about Plath, (p 44), \`\\"Everybody hated her,\\"' of suicide, (p 46) \\"It was in her, you see...\\" Lastly, of his contention that (p 64) \\"his poetry is curative\\" Becker opines, (p 64, 65) \\"Hughes's self-exoneration is not merely pretentious twaddle, it is blasphemy...\\"Jillian Becker's memoir on \\"the last days of Sylvia Plath\\" is a telling tribute of a true friend to a woman whose actions forever affected her. Great companion read: The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"Becker helped Plath during the last days of her life. She provided a place to stay and helped with the care of her children. She tells the story of Plath's last few days from the point- of- view of a sympathetic friend. She is critical of Ted Hughes who she blames for the abandonment of Plath. According to Becker Plath was totally broken by this abandonment and could not get herself together.This is a very sad tale."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"This is a short, but very fulfilling look into Sylvia Plath's last days as told by her friend Jillian Becker. It is brutally honest; Becker even speaks of how it became a burden to take care of Sylvia in her last days. It paints a heartbreaking, forward picture of the troubled author's last days. As for why she killed herself, look no further than Plath's hauntingly beautiful poetry and semi-autobiographical The Bell Jar. Long having battled depression, her husband Ted Hughes' infidelities finally pushed her over the edge. Some have also speculated that the combination of medication she was on may have led to suicidal thoughts.Heart-breaking and informative, this is a compassionate look in Plath's last days that any fan will appreciate.And if you really want to despise Ted Hughes, check out the biography of his mistress, Assia Wevill who took her own life for reasons (ironically) not so different than Sylvia's. It is a wonderful biography. It can be found here:Lover of Unreason: Assia Wevill, Sylvia Plath's Rival and Ted Hughes' Doomed Love"},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"Thank goodness Jillian Becker was there for Sylvia Plath the last days of her life--because it appears nobody else was. Becker was a true friend and I appreciate that.But...\\"Giving Up\\" really had no substance or depth. I was wondering why Becker wrote a book about her experience with Plath-rather than a short essay or college paper. This would have been quite acceptable--but paying $14.95 for a book that makes Plath out to be the victim of her adulteress husband is absurd and shallow. Plath was far from shallow and had her demons long before Ted Hughes entered in.\\"Giving Up\\" is only 73 pages--and I am thankful for that. Although some parts were interesting, a short essay would have been sufficient and way enough information for one to handle."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews, I feel I must voice my own (favorable) opinion.The criticisms mentioned most: how did the author know Plath? (suspecting ulterior motives = $$$ and last grab at fame) why did she write this book forty years later? she barely knew her anyway! what's with the large section on the question of anti-Semitism?While reading the book, I had a skeptic's eyebrow constantly raised and I completely agree that these criticisms came to my mind many times.But the more I read, the more difficult it was to find fault with the author, and eventually, my inner cynic let go.Once I did, I found this memoir to be a very intimate, touching, and honest portrait of Plath. So why should you read a memoir written by a friend who knew her so briefly?I can say with complete sincerity that many of my best friendships bloomed rapidly. I have had friendships last only a few months (typically terminated by moves) and these friends know me--who I was during that time--better than anyone.And my goodness! Had she known Plath for only four days, I think her credentials are sufficient, for those days were the last of Plath's life. Morbid? Perhaps. But for those of us interested in Plath's life, though, what greater statement has she made? Becker is a lovely writer and an observant friend.We must remember that as much as we wish it, \\"Giving Up\\" is Becker's memoir, not Plath's. And she is defensive about, well, the things that many of us have criticized: who is she to have been the last of Plath's friends to see her alive? Could she have helped? That question will be an essential part of any survivor's story. Even forty years later, she needs to remind herself as well as us that she could not have saved her friend's life.A large part of her story, too, was her Jewishness. That was clearly an important aspect of THEIR friendship, the lens through which Becker saw and understood both Plath and Hughes. I found this section to be surprisingly valuable and if I had to choose between the anti-Semitism stuff and a story of how the friends met, I would go with the former. It proved to be a much more important factor in their relationship than, say, the name of whoever held the party where Becker and Plath were introduced.Finally, why would Becker write, publish, and earn money from this story? And why forty years later? I believe her when she says that she wants to write it down before she forgets. I sincerely doubt that this is her last grab at fame and fortune--why on Earth would she wait FORTY years, until she was, what, in her seventies? to attempt such a ploy?A book like this requires a certain amount of trust. Trust that Becker finds her story worthwhile and thinks that others would find it worthwhile as well. We must quiet that cynic. Of course, this was simply MY reading, but I hope that others may (unlike I) begin with a more generous outlook and if the writing rings false, make judgments after the book is closed."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"In which a recent acquaintance of Sylvia Plath's attempts to comfort and protect the poet from herself during her last horrible days on this earth.There is much that is scalding and unnecessary in this thin little book. It repeats so much of what we already know -- perhaps from Becker herself -- and is flawed by the author's insistent need to defend herself against (whose?) assumption that she should or could have &quot;done something&quot; to protect Plath from her compulsive need to kill herself. Well, maybe she could have or should have, but she didn't, as didn't many who knew her far better than Becker did, so there's really no need for all the justifications.The lack of insight displayed here suggests that while Becker might have been stung by real or imagined criticism, she has done little in the last 40 years to understand the hopeless circumstances in which she found herself.The fact that she barely knew Planth, but found it necessary to blather about it 40 years later, makes me wonder if there isn't a wee bit of the &quot;cashing in&quot; afoot on the part of the author.Read the day after finishing Middlebrook's marvelous book on this subject, &quot;Her Husband,&quot; I found it a total waste of paper."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"I just finished this book and was suprised at the brevity. I expected more from a &quot;memoir,&quot; and was disappointed that it lacked depth. I have read a great deal on Sylvia Plath and this book did not tell me much that I did not already know. I did, however, like the personal spin Becker put on her encounters with Plath and Ted Hughes. The writing is very accessible and personable without excess sentimentality, which I do appreciate. However, I found the narrative overall to be lacking in punch and wonder why it took Becker so long to come out with her version of the last days. Could she be riding the coat tails of the renewed Plath interest surrounding the upcoming release of Sylvia &amp; Ted (the film)?"},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"This little book helps put Sylvia Plath's final days into more perspective.No matter what the author's motive, I still find any information about Plath to be helpful in understanding both her depression and more importantly, her work.Since I dislike wordy reviews fraught with naught, I shall only say, it's a great read and adds depth to the complicated person who was Sylvia Plath."},{"Title":"Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia Plath","review":"I'm afraid a lot of the reviewers, save one, have got completely the wrong end of the stick about this book. Mrs. Becker wrote this 40 years later because Ted Hughes had just died and that made it a lot easier to share her feelings. Secondly, Mrs. Becker was a great friend of Sylvia's but thie book is not a poignant, maudlin story but an account true to what is to happen. If you are the kind of person that is looking for a soppy, emotional story then a short account of Sylvia Plath's final days is not the right book for you.

Ummmmmm Good!"},{"Title":"Marcus: The Autobiography of Marcus Allen (Marcus)","review":"This is not your typical Professional Jock Worship book, primarily because (1) very little of the narrative is taken up with descriptions of individual games or plays, (2) Carlton Stowers is an excellent writer who portrays Marcus well, and (3) Marcus himself is an intelligent and thoughtful person who has had a fascinating life to date.The real heroes of this book are Marcus' parents, Harold (Red) and Gwen Allen, who put the necessary time and effort into providing their children with the integrity that has made Marcus successful.This is a book of contrasts and conflicts, the first of which are with Al Davis, owner of the Oakland Raiders. Marcus despises Al and is candid in describing his reasons. Anyone who is not familiar with Al Davis might think Marcus is exaggerating, but those who are familiar with him will find the criticism reasonable, if not understated. Corroboration for his descriptions of Al's eccentricities may be found in \\"Slick: The Silver and Black Life of Al Davis\\" by Mark Ribowsky [ISBN: 0-02-602500-0], a highly entertaining biography that is now out of print but may be available through a used-book service.The other interesting contrast is that between Marcus and his friend O.J. Simpson. As Marcus described Nicole Simpson's death and the subsequent murder trial, I kept asking how these two men, similar in so many ways, could have ended up so differently. As I said at the outset, the real heroes of the book are Marcus' parents."},{"Title":"Marcus: The Autobiography of Marcus Allen (Marcus)","review":"I really enjoyed this well written summary of Marcus Allen's life and his extraordinary career in football. If you are at all interested in football, this book would be a great choice. He starts from the beginning telling us about his family and his hometown. He then describes his life as a high school football player. He goes on to talk about the transitions he had to make on the field from defensive back to quarterback and then to running back later on in his career. Marcus really goes in to depth when he describes his years at U.S.C and the heisman trophy. He emphasizes his dedication towards his health and the team. Marcus says in the book that playing backup to Charles White helped him more because he got to see greatness right before his eyes in Charles. Charles describes the felling of being drafted to the Oakland Raiders. Marcus shows his dislike towards the teams manager Al Davis and describes conflicts between the two. Marcus goes into great detail of the games and the situations that occur off the field on both the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs. It is very interesting to see the relationship between Marcus Allen and Mr. and Mrs.OJ Simpson. He talks about the OJ trial and how he handled it."},{"Title":"Marcus: The Autobiography of Marcus Allen (Marcus)","review":"After reading this book, I was amazed at the things that went on between Al Davis and Marcus. How Marcus stayed in Los Angeles that long amazes me. This book covers Marcus' life before football, during high school, at USC and the heisman, and being drafted by the Raiders and then ending up at Kansas City. Marcus talks about the O.J. fiasco and how it changed his life. This book is excellent for any football fan and shines light on the dark side of being a Raider."},{"Title":"Marcus: The Autobiography of Marcus Allen (Marcus)","review":"I bought this book for one purpose only: to get Marcus Allen's response to the charges levied against him by Faye Resnick. Readers may recall that Resnick in her book \\"Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted,\\" accused Allen of having had an ongoing affair with O.J.'s wife Nicole, and indeed that he had been at her condo on the day of her murder. Chapter 9 of Resnick's book entitled \\"A BETTER MODEL OJ\\" gives graphic details of a torrid affair between Nicole and Marcus. The details all have the ring of truth and are difficult to dismiss. It appears, if Resnick can be believed, that Nicole was quite smitten by Marcus.Since in the concluding chapter of this book Allen \\"ducks\\" the issue entirely with a blanket denial of all allegations, as far as I am concerned the issue of what Marcus's role was remains open and unresolved. And while Resnick may not be the most reliable person - she seems too much of an infantile \\"groupie,\\" a reputed drug user, a general gossip and generally an insecure socialite -- her allegations cannot all be dismissed out of hand. They do have a certain symmetry to them; a certain logic, and certainly are coherent enough to be believed, no matter what is her reputation.The logic lies in the fact that none of her allegations seem the least bit out of line for two rich attractive pro football stars who were buddies fiercely competing in the field of womanizing. And while her simulated conversations with Nicole cannot be verified, most of the other details, including some of the most intimates ones, CAN be verified. Witnesses such as AC Cowling can confirm or deny many of them. I would very much like to see the O.J defense team's investigative file on Marcus' movements on the day of the murder? Has anyone written a book about this stuff yet?Although Marcus' defense here has been to hide behind his lawyer's advice (presumably because he would be damned no matter how he responded) it still would have increased Marcus' credibility immensely had he discussed beyond mere platitudes his and O.J.\\"s relationship during the days leading up to the murder. The fact of the matter is that O.J's defense team seemed convinced that Marcus played a role in aggravating the situation leading up to Nicole's murder. F. Lee Bailey was so convinced of Marcus' involvement that he sought a subpoena for Marcus' testimony. And although it was granted and then dismissed by the Judge, his denial does not clear up the matter one bit, but indeed further muddies the water.Now that O.J. is again safely behind bars, I wonder why no one has pursued this matter?

Good book for many people who want to learn simple basic things about information-gathering on the 'net.. but as net has evolved to the stage where it is nowadays, many of us have used it for so long that many things on the book are pretty obvious to a common net-user. The words 'business research' might be a little bit misleading.Ok, I am an information professional myself, but when thinking from a casual point of view; the book could drop out some of its most obvious points (on occasion, it feels like it's almost teaching you how to actually use a browser!).. the book would be lots more useful if there would be more actual tips &amp; tricks how to find the information you need fast, instead of teaching things that are featured in many other books as well. I think that there are some parts that many people who buy this book will just skip, because they are so basic.To put it together: The book has the overall feeling of assumption that the reader hasn't never even seen a search engine before; that makes this book a lot less useful than it could be.Ok, this IS very good reading (in addition to any other good Internet-related books as well) for people who are not very comfortable with browsing the net in general.

It is really more of a thriller. Victoria Jones, an indifferent London typist loses her job in a typing pool for impersonating her boss's wife and meets a charming young man in a park. Only, he is about to leave for Baghdad. Parting is such sweet sorrow! Not so, thinks Victoria. Undeterred by this obstacle to romance, the resourceful Londoner secures a job paying her passage out East. There she becomes embroiled in international espionage, is forced to flee people who are out to kill her, and finds herself working on an archeological dig. Christie writes in a mature and witty style. The descriptions of post WWII Baghdad and Basrah are fascinating, as are the fully-fleshed (for Christie) cast of characters. Does Victoria ultimately find love? Yes, but not where she expects it. A thoroughly absorbing read for any Christie fan. For another exotic A.C., check outMurder On the Orient Express (The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection)"},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"In this 1951 novel -- which is perhaps more relevant today than in its own time -- Christie shows her remarkable talent for spinning a web of characters that, ultimately, entangles and engulfs the reader like none other of her 80 odd titles. This book offers a relatively flawless plot and an intriguing set of characters that are really just side dishes to the staggering atmosphere the reader takes from this book's pages. By the story's end you smell, see, feel, and hear every molecule that the characters experience -- and it's more than you might wish! The story is deep and complicated, and the characters are numerous, but the outcome is really nothing short of intoxicating. This is a dark horse that is very much a must-read for its eerily prophetic 1950s look into the Middle-East, which seems rather more potent in the early twenty-first century given what our world has faced as recent. The vast aroma of the Middle East never seemed so invigorating as when you are on the loose with one of the many elite members of the slow-to-start but increasingly fast-paced plot. Breathtaking description, enough to guide the reader but little enough to let you imagine on your own, sets you down running into a maze of panic and frenzy. I believe this is Christie at her best! Which is not something one should say lightly."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Agatha Christie appears to be harkening back to her earlier &quot;young girl as adventuress&quot; theme in this novel which centers around Victoria Jones, a protagonist who specializes in mimicry and lies. The combination gets her in endless trouble.The story begins when she meets an attractive young man named Edward in FitzJames Gardens one afternoon. They have an immediate bonding, but Edward is scheduled to leave very soon for Baghdad in connection with his job with a cultural arts group called The Olive Branch. Not one to be easily discouraged, Victoria sets about finding a position that will allow her to follow Edward to Baghdad. Her search for him in this colorful city involves her with many suspicious characters, a badly wounded man who dies in her hotel room, and a great look at an archaeological dig, a particular specialty of Mrs. Christie's.It is all wildly incredible, definitely improbable, but still an entertaining work with many likeable and well-drawn characters."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"With all that's going on in Baghdad today, this book provides much more than just a great Agatha Christie read, it provides insights into what Baghdad was like in the 1950's.The plot basically revolves around a young lady who follows her love interest from england to Baghdad. While she is there, she gets caught up in an underground network of people out to destroy the world forever.Interesting imagery and descriptions of Baghdad, the Tigris, and Basrah which are kind of sad when you look at all the violence that has happened in that region since then (Iran/Iraq war, first gulf war, second gulf war).I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I first read this book several years ago and have subsequently revisited it many times, not so much for the story which is inconsistent at best, but for the great atmosphere. In her real life, Christie had traveled extensively in the Middle East with her archeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan and her knowledge of this region enables her to paint a fascinating portrait of Baghdad. She also successfully captures a real sense of evil that has to be defeated at all costs that makes the story gripping. But the actual plot is pretty implausible - world domination from some remote area of the world? I looked up my atlas and still couldn't identify which part of the world she meant! Also, isn't it a little unrealistic that an untrained Englishwoman could just blunder her way to success when skilled spies failed? Still, I would recommend the book just for its amazing ambience and not focus so much on the story."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"The more mystery books I read, the more I realize just how incredible Christie was at what she did.This mystery centers around, not so much a murder, but the plot of a political overthrow (Is the overthrow a good thing? Or a bad thing? And even, does it exist?). Our protagonist, Victoria, finds herself suddenly placed in the middle of it all, and must decide just how involved she wants to be.\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" has an intriguing blend of all sorts of mystery points: murder, mistaken identity, spies, lies, and even a bit of romance.I think what really won me over was the detailed and diverse cast of characters, headed by the smart and clever Victoria, who has a fantastic imagination, and an ability to create elaborate lies and stories, but whom fails to tell convincing *true* stories. Victoria isn't really \\"book smart\\" and she's not entirely \\"street smart\\" but she's clever and has a wonderful ability to never give up, and an optimistic heart that makes her a pleasure to follow through the pages.Not every chapter is devoted to Victoria's perspective, however, and in the beginning we have several chapters from several points of view. This could have been frustrating and annoying, but for some reason I did not find it so and was instantly drawn in and hooked to each of the mini-stories (if you do find it tiresome, I highly suggest you give the book at least 5 chapters or so, until you settle into the main plot).This book isn't overly gruesome or graphic, and while there *may* have been a few points I'd have liked better clarification on, overall I thought the mystery was explained nicely and neatly.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"When i read this book first, i thought \\"well, that was an average to good Christie, nothing extra special...\\" but now i've re-read it, i am forced to change my opinion!This is an excellent book. Its exciting and tense, there are twists aplenty, which keep the material fresh and interesting. It's packed full of interesting and enigmatic characters. Sir Rupert Crofton Lee, Carmichael, Dakin, etc, all of whom we dont see a great deal of, but we are left wanting to know a lot more about them. A sure sign of good characters and characterisation.The plot is intriguing, and you are never entirely sure of what is going on, who is who, what is what, etc, up until the final pages, then it all becomes clear.The setting is great...the sweltering heat and dustiness of Baghdad is an excellent setting for this type of story (indeed, any type of story) and really adds to the atmosphere.Victoria Jones is a likeable lead character, human and quirky. (Sometimes annoying?) But in the end, you care for what happens to her.The backing cast of characters is large, but great. And overall, the freshness of this story, the excitement and intrigue contained within its pages, all adds up to make this a very different, but very high class Christie read."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I always felt that Agatha Christie was not at her best when delving into the (for her, fantasy) world of spies, government secrets & espionage. When she does, the results seem more Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. I really don't know why she did it because the results were like THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD.Christie does manage to squeeze by with her very practical knowledege learned from being on real archaeological digs in the Middle East with her second husband. She shows a real appreciation of the people, culture & daily life.If you are a dedicated Christie fan, you're probably going to want to read all her mysteries--including this one. If you're just curious about the Agatha Christie Phenomena, I'd pass on this one."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"You mention Agatha Christie and you may say \\"period\\" and \\"dated\\" where I may say entertaining and inventive. THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD strays a bit outside Christie's patented cerebral whodunits in that it's an espionage thriller, more along the lines of THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT and THE SECRET ADVERSARY. Here, we meet another of Dame Agatha's clever young heroines harboring a romantic yen for adventure.The impending Middle East summit among the leaders of the world's true super powers has the British secret service in a frenzy. A whisper floats regarding a bid for world domination by a sinister organization and an intent to derail the summit talks. The key is British agent Henry Carmichael who is coming to Baghdad with insurmountable proof of this devilish plot. Unknown assassins await him at every turn. Bad cess to him, then, for not being the protagonist of the book.That role falls to the unwitting Victoria Jones, an inexpert typist - but with a facility for telling elaborate lies - who'd rather while away the work hours doing impressions of the boss's wife. Sacked for such, Victoria sits near penniless in the park and chances upon a good-looking young stranger, with the ensuing discourse leaving Victoria charmed and in love. When the handsome gent remarks that he's soon off to Baghdad, Victoria determines to follow, never mind the lack of funds or her dim prospects or dearth of influential contacts. Being kind-hearted, during my initial impression of Victoria Jones, I elected to regard her as \\"indefatigable,\\" although \\"staggeringly naive\\" may also be applicable. What's undeniable is that Christie writes her heroine as very likable. I even relished the character quirk which allows Victoria to spin off outrageous falsehoods, and yet, when it comes to narrating true stories, she has trouble being convincing.In dusty, exotic Baghdad, Victoria Jones pursues romance and finds it from an unexpected source. But when a dying spy stumbles into her hotel room one night and gasps out the cryptic words \\"Lucifer...Basrah...Lefarge...\\" Victoria is straightaway drawn into a world of shadowy intrigue. And this is where her remarkable knack for stretching truths comes in so very handy. Agatha Christie imbues her heroine with quick wits and a wonderful sense of optimism and a terrific \\"I'll see this thru\\" pluckiness, assets that just may be enough to see her through. And the amateur detecting Victoria does engage in would make Hercule Poirot himself proud. Although, the \\"Lucifer\\" clue that Veronica pieces together is a bit of a stretch.THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD, more a thriller than a mystery, has a pace that speeds along. A strength of the book is that Christie has taken time to flesh out her colorful supporting characters, something she sometimes neglects to do. Her immersive descriptions of a post-world war Baghdad and Basrah plant you directly into the scenes, elbow to elbow with the adventurous Victoria. I absolutely recommend THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD, a wonderfully written tale of espionage and escapism, of a villain that ambushed me, and of a hopelessly optimistic heroine who, it turns out, has the brains and the heart to make good on that optimism. Somewhere along the way, Victoria Jones - pursuing love, working her angles, propelling the plot - manages to help save the day. Maybe the world. Not bad for a lousy typist."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Since I'm finding the reviews for Kindle to be somewhat haphazard I'm trying to segregate the Kindle reviews from the reviews of the books themselves:From a non-Kindle perspective this is my favorite Agatha Christie story, and it loses nothing in translation.

Different - yes, but bad? No! I'm not about to spoil the terrific, tension-mounting plot, but the mystery (all of her books are mysteries; this one is no different in that respect) involves spies, both good and bad, leakage, intrigue...no shocking murders in quiet English towns here, folks.Our leading lady is Victoria Jones, shorthand typist and incorrigible liar, her &quot;fertile brain&quot; is ever-ready for cooking up believable stories and she can twist &quot;little indiarubber face&quot; into a remarkable imitation of any person. It's refreshing that she's not pretty; so many heroines have that as well as wit and kindness! Her habit of telling lies draws her into an incredible web of adventure, romance (well, not really...) and danger.

There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now?

They are smitten. Edward, however, must leave for Baghdad the next day. Impetuously, Victoria decides to find a way to Baghdad herself. While there, she becomes embroiled in murder and international intrigue. What message was the spy trying to pass along before he bled to death in front of Victoria? What's behind the pollyanna-ish front of the organization employing Edward and Victoria? Most importantly, will all the people able to make a difference end up dead before the world is doomed?A nicely paced departure from Ms. Christie's usual work. Instead of a sitting room filled with a dead body and a half-dozen suspicious potential heirs, we're given mysterious organizations, exotic locales and, of course, no dearth of bodies. This book is, perhaps, most admirable for breaking Ms. Christie's tendencies. However, it is also a quick and interesting read in that fun-loving mid-century British spy fiction genre. Something of an amateur James Bond without the technological fetish - so don't expect everything to be entirely plausible. Ms. Christie's fans will want to be quite aware that, while there is some mystery, this novel is more a garish spy novel than a proper locked room conundrum."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Although Agatha Christie is best known for the mystery stories that star either Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, there are several books that feature neither of these detectives and instead concentrate on one-off protagonists that range from amateur sleuths to young adventurers. In most cases (at least the ones that I've read) the protagonists are swept up - sometimes against their will - into adventures that read like spy thrillers, filled with danger, espionage and plots for world-domination! There are twenty-three of these types of Christie books altogether (discounting the Tommy and Tuppence novels), so if you like \\"They Came to Baghdad\\", there's plenty where that came from!In this case, young Victoria Jones has found herself between jobs once again, thanks an untimely impersonation of her boss. Whilst indulging in a bout of self-pity in the local park, she meets a young man named Edward and the two find themselves quite taken with each other. On an impulse, Victoria decides to follow Edward to Baghdad and soon finds herself caught up in a mystery when a British spy stumbles into her room and dies on her bed (yikes!) Political forces from around the world are converging on Baghdad, and Victoria ends up being key to the events that will shape history.It would be wrong to give away too much of the twisty plot, suffice to say there's a dodgy cultural-diversity group, a surreal kidnapping and escape into the desert, some wonderful descriptions of an archeological dig and some of the best characterization that Christie has to offer. As an author who is often critised for being too heavy on plot (to the detriment of other aspects of storytelling), Christie fills \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" with a host of intriguing characters, none of whom are who they appear to be - not even Victoria herself, as well as beautiful descriptions of Iraq in the 1950s, both on a political and geographical scale.This is only to be expected considering that Christie spent many months in Iraq - her husband was an archeologist, and Christie obviously picked up on the wonderment to be found in archeology, as when Victoria has an epiphany over an uncovered bowl. It's a surprisingly beautiful passage that holds within it the themes of the novel: the importance of the domestic sphere and the sanctity of the ordinary life over the lofty ideals of political and revolutionary circles.Victoria is a great protagonist: spunky, determined, funny and with an inner sense of right and wrong that gives her the moral strength to make the right decisions when it becomes clear what her role is in the extraordinary situation she finds herself in. I'm far from having read all of Agatha Christie's books, so it may be pre-emptive to say this, but I predict that when I get to my final Christie mystery, \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" will rank up there as one of my favourites."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I thought this book was extremely entertaining (although I had a bit of trouble keeping up with all the twists and turns)and somewhat in the style of &quot;Passenger to Frankfurt,&quot; albeit not quite. Whereas &quot;Passenger to Frankfurt&quot; had the same basic theme of a someone with an oversize ego trying to rule the world, I'd say that Sir Stafford Nye is just a little more...stable than Victoria Jones, in whom I see just a hint of young Tuppence. &quot;They came to Baghdad&quot; also manages to be more lighthearted for just this reason. It also gives us a glimpse of the Middle East, and especially Iraq, before Saddam and friends. Anyway, read the book, and if you disagree with anything I said please don't tell anyone."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This was one of those books that keeps you up, constantly drags you on. I would not say it was the very best of her books, merely because of the improbability of most of the events. Such as, who would exchange polite conversation with someone and then decide you've fallen in love? And even more improbable, who would chase that near stranger halfway around the world?This is precisely what happens in They Came to Baghdad. They only other thing I should mention is that once arriving in Baghdad, the heroine sets her foot in a whole lot of danger...and starts to wonder who is on her side and who is her enemy. The best part is when she finds a dying man in her hotel room bed...don't worry, I'm not giving anything away. Do try it, though."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Mysteries usually keep you sitting on the edge, wondering who the guilty person is. In this case, I sat on the edge, wondering what I would find around the next corner in this magical and exotic place called Iraq. Reading this book, I actually forgot what horrors were going on in this enchanted land, and while I was mentally in that land, I found myself wanting to come back again, not just to meet the characters in \\"They Came to Baghdad\\", but to see the old hotels, the tea rooms, the Tigris as it flowed to meet the Euphrates. I no longer cared whether the main characters loved each other or simply wanted to take advantage of each other.If you like mysteries, I think you'll like this one. If not, I think you'll appreciate just being there in Baghdad prior to the horrors we see on nightly news. Either way, it's worth the small price of the book, or a trip to your library."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This 1951 novel is highly reminiscent of some of Christie's earlier works like THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT or the Tommy and Tuppence adventures as well as similiarities to the later PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT. None of Christie's usual detectives like Poirot or Miss Marple appear, nor does it follow her usual 'cozy' formula.The story opens with Victoria Jones finding herself once again between jobs. It seems that Victoria is not very good at her job of shorthand/typist but what she lacks in clerical skills she makes up for in her skill at lying. While sitting in the park considering her options she meets a charming young man who is just perfect except that he is leaving for Baghdad shortly. Victoria soon decides that this young man is the one for her at sets out to follow him to Iraq. She overcomes the obstacles of lack of funds and not knowing her young man's last name but soon finds herself involved in a vast international conspiracy.As always with a Christie book the clues are all fairly laid out for the reader to follow but there are many twists and surprises along the way to keep the reader entertained.This adventure has much in common with Elizabeth Peters works, lots of action, improbable situations and more than a touch of romance."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This is an interesting story, entertaining to read. It is mildly exciting. I enjoyed the somewhat flawed heroine and the setting."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Most of the Agatha Christie stories I've read are murder mysteries. Someone gets killed early in the story and then the race is on to see if our heroes can gather the clues and unmask the villain.\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" is more like a James Bond spy thriller. Great events are happening. The reader knows a little but we're larger in the dark at first. Very few people are exactly as they seem. It is about a third of the way through the book before someone dies.This is a fun book. As always Agatha Christie does a great job building characters, providing enough clues that the reader knows some of what is going on, but we don't have the whole story so there is suspense on just what is going on and will the villains be unmasked.If you enjoy Agatha Christie and are willing to try something other than the typical murder mystery, give this book a try."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"One of Christie's spy stories. A couple of unsuspecting individuals get entangled in a dangerous game of international intrigue. Some elements of this reminds me of her other spy story \\"Destination Unknown\\", but this one is more down to earth and more believable. As usual with Christie, you spend the whole time guessing who's to trust and who are the bad guys. All the clues are in front of you, but you will be surprised over and over. Fascinating."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I have tended to avoid most of Christie's post-World War II novels. Partly because as she grew older her skills began to fade. Several of her last books are really pretty perfunctory. Mainly, though, I think Christie belongs to the pre-1945 world when the Empire was still intact and high tax rates and changed social attitudes had not yet taken their toll on the British upper classes, who are the focus of most of her books. So, I picked up a copy of this book, first published in 1951, without great expectations ... and was in for a terrific surprise. While I would rank this book below her true masterpieces, such as \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" or \\"The A.B.C. Murders,\\" I found it to be one of her most entertaining books.Christie spent some time in the Middle East with her archeologist husband and mined the setting for several earlier books, mostly featuring Hercule Poirot. This book is unusual both in not featuring one of her series detectives and in being a spy thriller rather than a murder mystery. It takes the form of a \\"North by Northwest\\" style thriller with an innocent person being swept up in a tale of international intrigue. The setting of Iraq must have seemed exotic and unfamiliar to readers in the U.S. and U.K. in 1951. Unfortunately, events of the last decade have made Baghdad, Basra, Kirkuk, and some of the other cities mentioned all too familiar. It's rather ironic to have the Iraq of those days described as well-policed and perfectly safe for a young Englishwoman to travel through alone.Although I very much enjoyed the book, it has a few weaknesses. Both the British intelligence service and its opponents seem fantastically well-organized and effective. Much more so than any real world spy service -- although this is a failing the book shares with most spy thrillers. in addition, key plot developments are telegraphed in a way that even I was able to pick up and I tend to be pretty weak in solving mysteries.In summary, while this book is far from the typical Christie, I think most of her fans, as well as fans of period spy thrillers, will find it very entertaining.One last point: I like these new Harper reprints. Although paperbacks, they can be read easily without breaking the binding and they should hold up to rereading. A word of warning, though, the blurb on the back cover gives away a plot point that doesn't occur until more than half way through the book!"},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Agatha Christie's immaculate stories make her a master of suspense and mystery. They Came to Baghdad is different from other Agatha Christie's other books - it's more of a thriller than a mystery. I have not read much of spy novels, just Alex Rider series and that does not come anywhere near Christie's ingenious plots. They Came To Baghdad does not have any high-tech machines or a gripping fight scenes, yet it is a book that the readers will find riveting and electrifying. The strong point of this book is the flawless story telling.For Victoria, the day has not started out well. She has been sacked from her job and does not have much cash to make up for her livelihood. That afternoon in the park, while pondering upon the unpleasant aspects of seeking a new job, she meets Edward. Just one meeting is enough for Victoria to fall head-over-heels for the dashing and polite Edward. Her luck unfortunately seems to have abandoned her as she finds out that he has to leave for Baghdad the very next day. Headstrong Victoria decides to follow the man she has fallen in love with to Baghdad, knowing only his first name and the firm he works in. However, once in Baghdad Victoria becomes embroiled in an international conspiracy when a dying man entrusts her with a message whose meaning she has no clue about. As her life is threatened and a plan to kidnap her is hatched by her rival for Edward's affections, Victoria finds herself getting more on her plate than she had asked for.They Came To Baghdad takes the reader through a roller coaster ride with its suspense, mystery, murder and conspiracy. The book does not centre on just Victoria, it has many characters popping up in almost each new chapter. Sometimes it becomes a bit difficult to keep track of all the different characters and to remember who the bad guy is and who the good one is. Nevertheless each character and the sub plots lead us back to the impetuous Victoria Jones. She may be mediocre in her chosen profession of a short hand typist but she is an excellent actress. Though many would call her a talented liar, she will just say that she is better at making things up than stating the plain truth. This gift of making up rather far-flung yet strangely believable lies do get her to Baghdad; nevertheless these lies come at a great price. At first, Victoria comes across as an airheaded woman who does not stop to think twice before making a rash decision. She has no control over what she says in public; this aspect of her nature makes her a magnet for trouble in Baghdad. She may have been silly following a man half way across the world whom she met for just a few hours and only whose first name is known to her, but it is her sharp perception and intuitive nature that comes in handy once she finds herself trapped in a conspiracy that threatens to topple the world peace. Victoria's plucky and dauntless nature makes her character hard not to adore.An exotic location, a mysterious message by a man who has been stabbed, an international conspiracy that threatens to start another world-war --They Came To Baghdad has everything you would want in a fast-paced thriller/mystery.Quotes:Victoria at any other moment would have been enchanted--nylon stockings having been usually beyond the reach of her purse. At the moment, however, hard cash was what she was hoping for. Mrs. Clipp, however, had been far too delicate to think of giving her a five dinar note. Victoria wished heartily that she had been quite so delicate.Victoria(an orphan) had just opened her mouth to explain how the plight of a mother at this moment suffering a major operation had so demoralized her that she had completely become light-headed, and how her small salary was all that the aforesaid mother had to depend upon, when, taking an opening glance at Mr. Greenholtz's unwholesome gace, she shut her mouth and changed her mind.She heard this time. With difficulty, great difficulty, the young man said two words. Whether she had heard them correctly or not Victoria did not know. They seemed to her quite nonsensical and without meaning.

It is really more of a thriller. Victoria Jones, an indifferent London typist loses her job in a typing pool for impersonating her boss's wife and meets a charming young man in a park. Only, he is about to leave for Baghdad. Parting is such sweet sorrow! Not so, thinks Victoria. Undeterred by this obstacle to romance, the resourceful Londoner secures a job paying her passage out East. There she becomes embroiled in international espionage, is forced to flee people who are out to kill her, and finds herself working on an archeological dig. Christie writes in a mature and witty style. The descriptions of post WWII Baghdad and Basrah are fascinating, as are the fully-fleshed (for Christie) cast of characters.

This reader could also be astonished by the quality of the descriptions of Baghdad and his surroundings written by an author not particularly well-known by his propensity to write long pages of description.

However, that is not to say that this book was bad. It has plenty of humor(something that's hard to find in books where people get killed), and an amazing heroine. It is, though, farflung and a bit confusing."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"In a theme similar to some of her other works, namely the Big Four, the Secret Adversary, Destination Unknown and Seven Dials Mystery, Agatha Christie moved away from familiar settings of a murder/crime investigation within a confined setting to the global stage for an international conspiracy that sought to manipulate the 2 world powers in 1950. Such conspiracies were the favourite of writers like Robert Ludlum, fleshed out with all the dirt, cynicism and playing hardball, gratuouis sex and violence and profanity liberally sprinkled.Fortunately, or unfortunately, Christie's descriptions tend to be milder, child-like (or childish if you prefer) even. Bringing out a theme which she used a few times in other similar novels, the writer sought to try her hand into the realm of grand-scale conspiracy, extensive penetration of government officers by spies, huge amount of money movement camouflaged in indescripherable financial transaction, and missing scientists brought to a secret remote base far from civilisation.The readers were treated to a prologue scene where a couple of British agents were worried about a conference among the Great Powers to be conducted in Baghdad soon. Their man who had on a rumour gone off in pursuit of evidence of the conspiracy was on the way back but the path is hindered by people who sought to silence him and the evidence at all costs.The scene officially opened with Victoria Jones, orphaned, typical working girl in a London office whose only escape from her dreary existence was inventing juicy tales, the type of juiciness that could only come from the subject being related to familiar characters, such as her boss. Thus when her boss returned early unexpectedly, Victoria Jones found herself shortly munching her lunch in FitzJames Garden, considering her externally imposed career revision.Not the type of girl to let such things depress her, Victoria Jones found herself attracted to a man sitting nearby. Boldly introducing herself to him, Edward charmed her by the simplistic way he reflected on life, universe and everything, probably very much like what Wodehouse's Bertram Wooster would say in candid guiless moments. After Edward took a snapshot of her before rushing off back to his boss, letting out that he was bound for Baghdad the following day, it took Victoria Jones all of a minute or so before deciding she too would go to Baghdad, with her exchequer being of a respectable sum of five pounds, or so.With the kind of serendipitous encounters that could only happen in the movies & PG Wodehouse, Victoria Jones made her way Baghdad, a comfortable trip, legal and all without stowing away like rats on a ship, and with just a bit of the madcap hare-brained (yet undeniably successful) schemes that PG Wodehouse put his poor heroines through. Victoria had to through becoming several different people before arriving in the Middle East and finding Edward. The encounters she had in her journey would serve to provide her with the information later she would need when she found herself involved in the BIG conspiracy.For a change, her first involvement was not due to any of her doing. A man simply got into her room, begged for sanctuary like the room was the Church of Notre Dame in Paris, then most inconsiderately, died. A nearby British agent quickly assisted her through the crisis, and Victoria Jones found herself off in search for clues at the Olive Branch, a literary society where Edward was employed.The mystery deepened when Victoria Jones was kidnapped at the arrangement of a colleague who was just as besotted with Edward. Though she was just an amateur blundering in the dark, Victoria showed herself no less resourceful by escaping, taking on more identities before returning to the Baghdad.Readers can't help but admire her quick-thinking and acting skills when she finally discovered that the truth was ...For its merits, readers would have to consider this book as being about Victoria Jones and how she handled herself through sticky situations, instead of viewing this as a mystery or a thriller."},{"Title":"They Came To Bagdad (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This is a pretty good book all the way around. The first part features Victoria, who, on chance meeting the man of her dreams, designs to follow him half-way around the world.

Also, don't miss out on the mid-20th century depiction of the Arab lands. I highly recommend this novel to fans of Agatha Christie, or even fans of the TV show Alias (correlations between Victoria and Sydney abound)!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Hirsen gives a series of great examples of the hypocrisy of the Hollywood personas. How they live their lives is so different from the drivel that comes out of their mouths. The book is a funny, delightful read!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"I also saw Mr. Hirsen on C-SPAN (Book TV) and found his comments very cogent and timely.Additionally, I found this book very enlightening."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"This book explains so much - so many things that always were nagging at the back of my mind. It definitely puts things into perspective as far as the extreme left leanings that are now so evident in the liberal media, etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is curious about the trends we are seeing today - you will be shocked, then angry at the way the American people are being used, duped and manipulated."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Hirsen has captured and enlightened upon a segment of Hollywood that most have not been aware of or have not dared to speak upon. I found his book to put to &quot;light&quot; many hidden truths of the power behind the media and has given me great insight into the propaganda so many of us have been deceived by. I highly recommend this book to any who choose to hear the &quot;rest of the story&quot; on what is really going on behind the silver screen."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"The basic premise of this book is that most of those in Hollywood are way left in their politics. I think this is pretty obvious, but there is some great background in here on where and why this may have originated.For example, some in Hollywood have a history of supporting communism, made famous in the \\"blacklist\\" era, and this view is even more prevalent today. The book gives dozens of accounts of one-sided support and glorification of Castro. This is actually quite odd considering Castro has a long tradition of placing homosexuals in prison, based on mere suspicion or rumor. When the various stars are pledging their devotion to Castro, do they have any idea what Castro's response to AIDS has been? (Page 75)This is typical of how Hollywood stars often are hypocritical in their pet causes. Whether it is slamming the President for not attending the Earth Summit and then of course failing to show themselves (Page 103), or wearing fur after being outspoken against it, the duplicity is actually quite hilarious, however this pales in comparison to some of the quotes about PETA.Michael J. Fox, former advisor to the Humane Society, wrote a book called \\"Inhumane Society: The American Way of Exploiting Animals\\", and in it he states \\"The life of an ant and that of my child should be granted equal consideration\\". (Page 123). Um, okay...rright. The many examples of these kinds of absurd statements abound. There is also considerable space documenting the \\"intolerance\\" of Hollywood towards any beliefs that do not align with the far left.However, the author spent a whole chapter on smoking. I have to honestly say that I didn't get the point. Was he speaking out against smoking censorship? Why? Does he support smoking? This section was unclear. The other concern I had was the way in which Bono and others were depicted for their support for the poor and other causes. These sections were also not very clear. It seems that much good is done by some of these people, and that needs to be acknowledged. So, minus one star for that.Overall, it is a very interesting book. I thought the research and history in the beginning sections was fascinating. Towards the end the book gets a bit shrill, but overall the point regarding the politics of the Hollywood \\"caste\\" system, and the hypocrisy of the intolerance towards anyone conservative, republican or Christian is of course shameful. The book is written well, easy to read, and the topics are presented in a logical format. Overall, the book suffers a bit from being what it is speaking out against - being too one-sided."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"anecdotal in style, this book is hilarious. although the subject matter is considered serious by some, the author had alot of tongue in cheek when he assembled the stories included in this book. this one is very entertaining and hirsen takes no prisoners. his treatment of the subject, as noted above, is humorous but he does drive home some serious points as well, essentially asking the question: why do poorly educated, ill informed celebrities capture the attention of the american public when political issues are discussed? i suppose the concept of &quot;hero worship&quot; comes to mind when seeking an answer to this question. anyway, don't expect too much from this book. it is entertaining and, hopefully for some, enlightening. i enjoyed it, although i hoped it would go a little further in explaining why such a huge portion of our hollywood icons are left wing extremists. i've always sought an answer to that question. the author attempts to answer this question early on, but through satire, not taking the matter too seriously. he hints that the real reason lies with guilt, proposing that celebs follow the party of the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; out of guilt because they have aquired wealth and stature with limited skill, limited education and limited justification for doing so."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Very funny and truthful book about celebrities' passion for leftist, hypocritical behavior. While stars champion homelessness and other &quot;poor&quot; issues, they live like royalty. While claiming to defend the &quot;little people&quot; they demand free designer clothes, cut ahead in airport lines, and turn their noses up at fans. You won't believe some of the excesses and wastes of these idiots. In the 80s they yelled about Reagan's years of greed, yet they now won't be seen without thousand-dollar purses on their arms. Some of these morons straddle the line between idiocy and hatred for America."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Don't expect ET, Extra, Access or those so called &quot;Info-tainment&quot; shows to talk about this book. Hirsen combines the right mix, along with edgy humor ala Bill McCuddy of Fox News. If they do, expect the liberals who run the media to rail him just like the reviewers who belittle this book!This should be a part of a college media studies or politics program. Those who do filmmaking or entertainment may want to avoid this unless they're willing to be patriots like Irving Berlin."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Well written.

He is one of the wittiest of persons I have met, and can't wait to see where he goes next in his literary career. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Hollywood. The home of swimming pools and movie stars, of silicone and botox, of power lunches and big money deals. It's a warm, sunny place inhabited by the nicest people you would ever want to meet. Everybody is a friend in Tinseltown, always willing to lend a helping hand to his or her fellow man (or woman) with no expectation of a favor in return. I get the warm and fuzzies just thinking about how wonderful life must be in Southern California, how much better a place like Los Angeles is than boring old Nebraska, Wyoming, Minnesota, or virtually any other lame place in the country. Heck, the people who live in Hollywood, the people we see on television every day in movies and television shows, are obviously a cut above the rest of us. How can this not be so? All you need to do is spend a few hours a day with the television set and you rapidly learn these glamorous creatures are more beautiful, smarter, savvier, and more fashionable than the yucks who live in fly over country. Moreover, celebrities possess a greater capacity for truly caring about humanity than the rest of us do. Media stars care so much about the travails of life that they don't hesitate to use their money and influence to instruct us in the finer arts of raising children, waging war, and a host of other bread and butter issues the general populace knows nothing about. Every day when I wake up the first thing I do is thank my lucky stars I have such dedicated souls looking after my life.Yeah right.I wrote the above introduction when I reviewed \\"Hollywood, Interrupted,\\" a scathing indictment of all that is wrong about the alien life forms living in Tinseltown. I feel confident using this same introduction for James Hirsen's \\"Tales From the Left Coast\\" since the book is similar in content and tone. In these pages you will read about celebrity nonsense concerning the environment, war, tobacco, political correctness, and their unabashed support for communist governments. In short, \\"Tales From the Left Coast\\" basically covers ground we're all far too familiar with at this point. Still, it's worth reading for reinforcement value and the author's sarcastic humor. In fact, let's call Hirsen's book \\"Celebrity Crackpots 101\\" because this read would serve as an excellent primer for those as yet unaccustomed to the sheer insanity (and inanity) of the Hollywood \\"elites.\\" These people are nuts.I appreciate how Hirsen begins his book. He casts his eye all the way back to the bad old days of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist purges. The Red Scare of the 1950s wasn't just about good old Joe and his dogged pursuit of Lenin lovers in the government; the feds also investigated communist influence in Hollywood. And guess what? They discovered that La La Land harbored more than a few card-carrying members of the Red Menace. When these stooges refused to testify in front of Congress, off to jail they went. The studios, afraid of government interference, placed these people on a blacklist that prevented many of them from working for years afterwards. Most of us know all about the blacklist because Hollywood releases a tear soaked movie about this \\"persecution\\" every few years in case we forget. While I think McCarthy and a few of his minions--especially Roy Cohn--went too far in their investigations, Hirsen appropriately points out that not only were there communists operating in Hollywood, they routinely greenlighted scripts that promoted an anti-American viewpoint. And they did it behind the scenes in particularly disingenuous ways.Flash forward fifty or so years to the present day. Now we've got celebrities taking trips to Cuba for one-on-one raps with their man Castro, pushing questionable eco-scientific pap on the public (Meryl Streep and alar, anyone?), and creating their own blacklist to keep conservatives out of the movie making business. This last point receives a lot of attention from Hirsen. He reveals how conservative celebrities, production personnel, and even studio executives must maintain a low profile if they wish to work in show business. The few who openly profess their views, like Tom Selleck or Patricia Heaton, can expect to take abuse from their co-workers. It's far easier for right-leaning individuals who happen to work in the industry to just go with the flow and keep their mouths shut. If you think there is something sinister about that, something downright anti-American about this need for self-censorship, \\"Tales From the Left Coast\\" is the book for you.I'll wrap up with a few comments about the humor in the book. Hirsen never passes on an opportunity to take shots at idiots like Michael Moore, Robert Redford, Martin Sheen, Mike Farrell, Madonna, and the other blithering idiots who couldn't articulate an informed opinion if their lives depended on it. He starts the book with a list of seventeen reasons why Hollywood leans left (funny), and ends with an \\"awards show\\" for the biggest kooks in the biz (also funny). In the main body of the book, the author will write out a statement made by or about a celebrity then follow up with a pithy comment. More than a few of these are laugh out loud funny, but some of Hirsen's quips fall flat or left me mystified. What's the connection between Sheryl Crow and Xena the Warrior Princess? I missed that reference. Anyway, kick back, pile up a few Scientology pamphlets, and prepare to laugh and shake your head at the weird antics of the Hollywood in-crowd. I wonder if Versace makes tin foil hats?"},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"I thought this book was excellent. Very good reporting on the true beliefs of these celebrities, and their undoubtable angst for the government that leads us.Don't pay attention to the angry reviewer who brings David Brock(!?) into his argument. Brock's self-obsessed writings (...an ex-conservative) are as narcisistic as the celebrities described in &quot;Tales from the Left Coast&quot;. I just hope one day these people realize that this earth revolves around the sun...not them."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"First of all, the editing of the Kindle edition is atrocious. Repeat paragraphs and sentences, all jumbled up - extremely annoying and difficult to follow.Get past that - good luck - and you get a rather banal \\"expose\\" of a bunch of stuff you already knew. I suppose it's possible that you live in a vacuum and weren't aware that Hollyweirds are decidedly hard Left, not to mention mostly ignorant. But if you've followed politics at all, you'll learn nothing new in this book, nor is it even presented in an entertaining manner. James Hirsen's attempts at humor are embarrassing and his phrasing comes off as pompous and stiff. It's easy to poke fun at celebrities - the jokes pretty much write themselves - but Hirsen manages to make it sound like your Great Uncle Ernie relaying his exploits in WWII.I anticipated liking this book. So much so that I didn't even get the Kindle sample first, I just bought it. So there's my lesson, because even from the first chapter it was filled with typographical errors and stilted language."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"James Hirsen's \\"Tales of the Left Coast\\" is a witty, insightful, and fluid book. It is one of the best reads out there that dares to point unapologetically at Hollywood\`s contradictory, albeit incoherent, love affair with Communism, Socialism, and hedonism. The Hollywood leftists would run the opposite direction of Communism and Socialism faster than you could say Adam Smith, if only they were slightly familiar with these economical and political methods of governing. If ANYONE in Hollywood really stood for fairness and equality, they would never support the debunked Communism or its dearth byproduct.It is clear by reading Hirsen\`s book that those who follow with adulation and reverence the teachings of Communism and some unreasonable social causes, are simply not versed in their realities, implementation and usefulness (or perhaps - \\"uselessness\\")It is a red flag to any society, when social causes are \`shopped' for by pretentious \`elite' who is fundamentally unlearned and who obtain most of their knowledge from sound bites and flippant rhetoric in order to perk up or revive a flailing career. Moreover, it is simply tragic when they are able to influence the tone or political trend of the country by manipulating celebrity-struck fans who do their bidding at the poles.Hirsen brings forth Hollywood's absurd political stances in an intelligent, funny and factual style."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"This might be a funny book to 10-year-olds, or to people who haven't noticed that movie stars can't hwlp but open their mouths and sy something politically irrelevant and ill-thought out whenever there's a microphone around, or to someone who hasn't lived and worked in politics on the left coast, and knows too much to sleep well at night.The bulleted points about \\"You might be a closet conservative if you...\\" some 15 pages in was as far as I could manage. During those 15 pages, I found not one supportable fact. You get the feeling reading the book that the guy just sat down & wrote it one night.We already know most Hollywood & liberal types barely got out of high school, few went to college and I'd bet there isn't a single one of them who majored in public policy or administration. (Al Gore got a D and C+ in his two college science courses.)If you're looking for a book that'll make you think, keep looking."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Can we all agree that it is intellectually dishonest to give a negative review to a book that one has not read? If this describes you, did it ever occur to you what it means to assault something you know nothing about or to attempt to censor something one hasn't ever read? Isn't it like hating someone you've never meet?Freedom of speech gives Mr. Hirsen the right to tell these stories, if true. It also gives us the right to laugh at the hypocrisy of those who think they are better and smarter than we are, just because they may have a talent. It also gives those who have substantive counter arguments the right to voice them.I hope to see substantive comments and not just ad hominen."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"As a reader of Hirsen's columns at Newsmax.com, I am pleased to see his new book out. I found it highly informative, and funny as well. Too often Hollywood types get away with the most ridiculous rants, and Hirsen does a good job of exposing them. For another great spoof of Hollywood, from a fictional category, check out 'Hollywood! Must Be Destroyed' by D. Schroder. It is another funny expose of outrageous leftwing types in Hollywood."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"I read Hirsen's book while a teacher in West LA who lived with an angry, left wing, out of work actor. Say what you want about some of the dull parts and cheap shots, this book needed to be written, and Hirsen is a vital man in Hollywood for doing so. These people are not only mostly ignorant schmucks, but arrogant and preachy at the same time. Good combination? They live wonderful lives of privilege, but find time to castigate America and capitalism at every turn, voting for the party of failure and demeaning those (policemen, military) whose yearly salaries are less than one pair of their shoes. They are the WORST of civilization, and any negative attention---rather than fawning and jealousy---is welcome."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"The writer is no Ann Coulter. He mostly retells well-known anecdotes about show-business liberals without adding much inside background. Has a puerile and snide writing style that reminds me alot of Maureen Dowd. The first chapter on the liberal show business establishment's animosity against conservative colleagues was the only one to hold my interest. Fitting to his juvenile style, that chapter is titled &quot;Baa Baa Blacklist&quot;.The book starts out with an intro chapter titled &quot;Why Hollywood Leans Left&quot;. In it, the author gives a Dave Letterman-type listing of 17 reasons, the first of which is &quot;The San Andreas Fault has caused the continental plate located under Hollywood to buckle left.&quot;. The second one is &quot;Extraterrestrials have bombarded the West Coast area with brain-wave projections that are capable of turning minds into macaroni and cheeses&quot;. And another 15 reasons just as clever.Right after the introduction, a chapter titled &quot;You Know You're a Closet Conservative...&quot; where he takes on Jeff Foxworthy brand humor. Later on, a chapter of &quot;The Left Coast's Greatest Hits&quot;, matching song titles to celebrities, such as &quot;Shop Around-Winona Ryder&quot; and &quot;Both Sides Now-Ann Heche&quot;. He has a 20-page chapter on the 60's discussing Woodstock, movies like &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, and frankly, I don't know what point the writer was trying to make in this chapter.The majority of the good stuff, what little there is outside the blacklist chapter, can be found in the blurbs and excerpts used to promote the book.I expected better."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"I really thought I'd love this book, but I was disappointed. I agree with Hirsen's general ideas and love reading him on NewsMax, but this book is a bit slipshod and he's not very funny. I'm afraid Dr. Hirsen just isn't that great a writer. And the material has such potential - he could have really lampooned these people and made it entertaining, but instead it sounds like he just knocked out a first draft and they went ahead and published it &quot;as is.&quot; Some creative research and more critical thinking could have made this a killer but alas, it's not. Also has some dumb errors, like misspelling the venerable PR Firm Rogers and Cowan as Rogers and Kowan! Just disappointing."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Ladies and gentlemen James Hirsen ( political commentator and frequent guest on Fox News ) and those Far-Right madcaps over at the untra-conservative website Newsmax have a breaking news story. After months of exhaustive research and tireless effort the story, incredible as it may seem, simply put is....HOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF LIBERALS WHO HATE OUR COUNTRY! Wow I had no idea! Yes, sad but true, the folks over on the 'left coast' ( the boys at Newsmax must have been up at night thinking up that pun ) are out to ruin our country with their liberal/leftist leanings and shove Marxism down this country's collective throats. Yes, that elitist ( a favorite word when describing Liberals in this country ) bunch of know-it-alls from California who actually have the temerity to voice their opinions...especially when it doesn't agree with our current Presidents strategy. The nerve! Fortunately, for the small cost of this book, Newsmax and Mr. Hirsen will be more then happy to enlighten you as to this ongoing crisis and help in your search for the 'right' path.Imagine my shock and dismay to read how so many of this country's favorite entertainers are, no doubt at this very moment, plotting to overthrow our very way of life by frequenting those trendy Rodeo Dr. restaurants ( all the while drinking French mineral water! ) and spouting liberal thoughts such as the right to free speech. Yes, they're all here in \\" Tales From the Left Coast \\"....beginning with Uber-Liberal Barbra Streisand ( Conservatives favorite whipping girl ), Susan Sarandon and hubby Tim Robbins ( two Hollywood malcontents who Conservatives wish would just shut-up and stick to films ) and of course those perennial Conservative favorites.... Bill and Hillary! Those wacky Democrats who Conservatives just love to hate. ( one would have thought be now that all these vitrolic feelings may have subsided but those loonies on the Right just can't get enough of our ex-President and Mrs. Clinton ) Yes, according to \\"Tales From the Left Coast \\" those Hollywood liberals ( and the liberal media too, of course ) are responsible for much thats wrong in this God-fearing country and they need to be taken to task for their own good. I mean, free speech is only good as long as we all agree with whatever those fun-loving Conservatives may have us believe. Right?Well, after having the veil lifted from my eyes I am going to proceed to bone up on my Conservative mantra by listening to Rush and Sean Hannity and of course the Rights favorite mini-skirted pit-bull Ann Coulter. And of course throw out my library of Babs cd's! ( that really hurt but I can't take any chances of being re-indoctrianted to the Left ).

His &quot;analysis&quot; and I use the term very loosely could be likened to &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot; - as in all conservatives in Hollywood good, all liberals bad. To borrow an old quote, this man probably never saw a belt he didn't hit under. Throw in some good ad hominem attacks on Barbarba Sreisand and make the audience go wild!Everyone in this republic has a right to speak and sometimes to speak out. The lastest attack mode conservatives ( Laura Ingram ) are using is &quot;what qualifiactions do they ( Hollywood types ) have in political science or geopolitics that gives them the right to speak out?&quot;The answer is of course, none.

It used to be that people of this sort made their living in the alleys near adult bookstores. While some of us are clothed in useful ideas and the ability to aspire to higher things, this author is clothed in thigh high white boots and a micro mini. This is a \\"Hello Sailor\\" kind of book.The fact that books like this gain any kind of an audience is endemic of the cultural decline of a once great nation. Like willing sheep the populace follow their various Judas Goats into one killing yard after another. If you are too stupid to divine otherwise, you deserve what you get in the end. Enjoy the ride, it's all downhill from here."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Hollywood stars like Rob Reiner, Susan Sarandon, Alec Bladwin, Julia Roberts, Jane Fonda, Sean Penn, Martin Sheen, and others can be counted on for many things. We know that, sooner or later, we will see them in a movie production or making a television appearance. We also know that, sooner or later, we will hear them voicing their concerns about any number of political issues. And we know that, more often than not, the political side they take will have a distinctly left- leaning direction.This book takes a close look at the entertainers that make the Hollywood world go round and it discusses the background and the different events over the past 50 plus years that have led to the present \\"liberal\\" Hollywood mindset. Communist infiltration into the American way of life back during the McCarthy era, the Vietnam War, and other events were decisive in shaping Hollywood politics. These liberal views have precipitated over the years to more and more generations of Hollywood entertainers. They are shared by a large majority of Hollywood folk, in proportions that do not reflect the population as a whole.The Hollywood elite can often be counted on to voice some wild opinions, and author James Hirsen presents some of them in this book. Quotes like Chevy Chase's comment that \\"Cuba has proven that socialism can work\\" and Sean Penn's nutty statement that he would like to \\"trade news personality Bill O'Reilly for Osama Bin Laden\\" are just a sample of some of the crazy things that have come out of the mouths of our beloved movie making friends in La La land.I like the way Hirsen keeps this book on an entertaining and humorous level. He doesn't hit below the belt, like some other political writers are prone to doing. Rather, he keeps things lightened up and funny as he shows how biased the members of Hollywood often are in their collectivist political mindset. They almost always favor a government- intervention position (except for issues like abortion and a few others) and they often cozy up with authoritarian- type individuals, like Fidel Castro and others.The dry humor contained in this book and the one- sidedness makes it the type that many readers will scorn. However, I think it's an entertaining read for people of all political stripes and colors. Hollywood stars are entitled to their own opinions, but what some of them say and do will surprise many readers. Hirsen includes lots of amusing quotes and stories about the bigwigs in Hollywood and others in the entertainment industry, enough to have readers simultaneously rolling their eyes and shaking their heads as they read some of the outrageousness that comes out of Tinseltown."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Some years ago I remember a distinguished actor of the old school- I don't remember who, specifically- said that actors come in two varieties: Those who see it as a craft, and those who see it as a calling. The first group approach it lke any other craft, something to be honed through work and study. The second group see it as a gift bestowed on them by chance and practiced through intuition, and this view tends to extend to other aspects of the world as well. Not having ever had to work or think to attain their lofty position, they tend to approach everything intuitively.And so the people of Hollywood judge the word the way they judge each other- by appearance and other superficial measures. How else to explain Sean Penn presenting hiumself as an international diplomat- and the news media actually taking him seriously? JFK is still considered a saint in Hollywood, more for his boyish good looks than for anything else. Bill Clinton was a hero for his purported support of gays, even as he abandoned them when it came time to take a stand. Noam Chomsky is worshipped by people in show business who've never read a single book on economics or politics because he makes the right kind of overarching judgements.Hirsen is a bit strident at times, but overall this is still a fun read- until you realize how much influence Hollywood has on the decisions people make. Then it's just a little tragic, too."},{"Title":"Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics","review":"Being an avid book collector and reader, I couldn't rate Dr. Hirsen's book a 5 for obvious reasons... but it's still one of the funniest, wittiest, most ironic books to come out in ages!

Everyone who is interested in what their ... movie ticket is funding should read this book because it might give them pause at the movie theatres... when we all stop to realize that some of the celebrities we've been supporting all these years truly hate America in ways most of us \\"Star Spangled Banner\\"-singing Americans could never fathom!

Of course not. Not at all. I believe &quot;life educations, experience education, social education, travel education&quot; is by far more relevant for personal growth and perception. In fact the classroom often is detrimental to a 'political' education.

For example, he claims that Bono wants to raise our taxes. As a U2 fan he never said this. He also stated that he's rich and doesn't pay taxes in on his money in Ireland which makes him a hypocrite. ???? So you have to be poor in order to help people in Africa with AIDS.

Such a book would be interesting and enlightening. Tales from the Left Coast is neither.Even if we ignore the simplistic writing and clumsy editing, the book is disappointing because it is merely a catalogue of positions and sillinesses taken by some celebrities. The point of this escapes me. I, and I suspect most Americans agree, am not particularly impressed by political statements, be they left or right, made by movie and television stars. Most of them are reasonably attractive people with at least some talent, and if I am pleased with them I watch their movies and programs.

Uniquely helpful it is; unbiased it is not.The idea and organization behind Gregg's compilation of the major interpretational views on Revelation, in running commentary style, is extraordinarily helpful. I use it as a text in teaching Exposition of Revelation. He makes a commendable effort to be even-handed. However, his decision to try to hide his own view (amillennial early-date preterism, which I figured out from the book alone before I ever found out anything about him) in the interest of objectivity backfires and, more seriously, misleads. To the attentive and informed reader, subtle evidences of his bias leak out regularly (e.g., of all the authorities he cites by name, the only one preceded by \\"Dr.\\" is postmillennial preterist Kenneth Gentry). The most serious examples occur in how he defends one view or describes another (see examples below). That is why the claim to be objective is so potentially misleading, especially for the inattentive or less-informed. I do not question his sincerity; but his modus operandi is seriously flawed. The reader would be much better served if Gregg were up-front about his own views; that would either force him to be more consistently and genuinely objective or make his subjectivity more transparent.Examples of Bias. (In the interest of full disclosure, let the reader know that my views are most consistent with dispensational futurism; so that is admittedly the focus of my critique. However, it is also the view that Gregg, as a former dispensational futurist, is clearly most inclined to undermine. My concern is not that Gregg does not share my view, but that through inaccuracy or editorialization he too frequently biases the reader against a view which he claims to represent accurately and objectively. A few examples follow.) (1) His selection and use of futurist resources. He regularly cites Hal Lindsey, whose book hardly qualifies as a serious commentary and whose opinions are not representative of most futurist interpreters. At the same time, commentaries such as the sober and scholarly 2-volume exegetical commentary by Robert Thomas (which predates Gregg's publication by 2-5 years) are completely ignored. (2) His insistence on the apocalyptic nature of Revelation (not at all a closed discussion), dismissal of the testimony of Ireneus, insistence that Revelation is recapitulative and non-chronological, and suggestion that defining \\"quickly\\" as \\"soon\\" is \\"more honoring to Christ\\" (pp. 10-26) are plainly pro-preterist and hardly inspire confidence that he is approaching and presenting the issues objectively. (3) His implication that what motivates futurism is \\"a strong psychological appeal ... to have a divinely inspired channel of insight into the future\\" (pp. 41-42) is insulting to what is merely the consistent application of the same characteristically literal hermeneutic applied by non-futurists to the rest of the Bible. (4) The notion that his chosen definition of tachus and related terms as \\"shortly\\" or \\"soon\\" requires redefinition by futurists is ignorant of the lexical and exegetical data; in many passages the same term is often translated (and sometimes can only mean) \\"quickly\\" or \\"suddenly\\" rather than \\"soon.\\" (5) His Special Note on 1:7 is patently preterist and makes no attempt to be objective with the data. (6) His assertion that \\"the dispensationalist\\" believes that Jews and Gentiles saved during the Tribulation \\"will forever have an inferior status to that of the church\\" (135-36) is not only seriously antiquated but also misrepresentative of a multitude of dispensationalists. (7) The inclusion of Roman Catholic, cultic, and holiness views in the futurist interpretation of 12:1-6 (255) is odd, unnecessary, and smacks of poisoning the well. (8) He misrepresents futurists on 12:6 when he claims that \\"Many (including Walvoord, Ryrie, Lindsey), with no stated scriptural reason, identify the place that [the persecuted Israelite remnant] will take refuge as the city of Petra\\" (259). As a dispensationalist, I do not know or care what Lindsey says, but Gregg has subtly misrepresented Walvoord and Ryrie, neither of whom \\"identify the place ... as Petra\\" but who instead merely report that \\"some have felt that the reference here is to some specific place such as Petra\\" (Walvoord; Ryrie's remark is nearly identical). Gregg follows this misrepresentation with an editorial endnote quipping that Israel's persecutors could easily track down the Jews if they just read the commentaries. Humor aside, such misrepresentations and editorializations belie the claim to objectivity.Many more examples could be cited. The point is simply that Gregg's presentation is not the objective presentation of all the views of Revelation that he claims and that many believe it to be. To be the uniquely superb reference work that it could be, Gregg needs to (a) remove the pretension of objectivity and include a frank statement acknowledging his own hermeneutical posture so that readers can analyze not only other views but his presentation of them, (b) comb back through his presentations to check their fairness and accuracy, and (c) delete frivolous representatives (like Lindsey) and incorporate previously omitted serious, scholarly representatives (like Thomas). That would take a lot of time and work. In the mean time, be aware that Gregg's book is not a completely impartial, disinterested, unprejudiced guide to eschatology."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This is a great book to read along with the book of Revelation.

Side by side columns present all views one portion of scripture at a time. Well researched, full rich text, and very little bias, if any. Just a great book."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"While I had previously read Revelation, I could not have given anyone even the most basic explanation of anything recorded there. After reading this book, it is not too hyperbolic to say my view of all scripture has changed. Prior to reading the book by Mr Gregg, Revelation meant nothing to me--I just didn't get it. It was as if I would get to the end of Jude and say, \\"there's one more book but I don't know what the point is.\\" Having only caught snippets of comments from others who claimed that Revelation described Blackhawk helicopters, fights over Mideast oil, or CNN, I erroneously thought that Revelation was too esoteric for me even too attempt to decipher--nothing could be further from the truth. Mr Gregg's book ties together the Old and New Testament to reveal a symmetry I had not seen before and allows the reader to compare various interpretations of Revelation in light of scripture. Now when I read Genesis, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Matthew, 2 Peter (you get my point), I do so knowing how all scripture fits together in God's plan. Not that I now fully comprehend everything in Revelation, rather a fog has been lifted and I see how God has consistently throughout scripture called His children and Revelation provides the conclusion. For whatever reason, I was not able to put that together for myself before reading this book.Don't let your knowledge of Revelation be based on others' opinions. Mr Gregg's book makes Revelation very approachable for even a blue-collar guy like me."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"As a person raised in the era of \\"Thief In The Night\\" showings at local churches and the ubiquity of \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" paperback, I learned a great deal about what the book of Revelation means, and far less about what it actually says. I had actually avoided it until recently, simply because I was growing in my adult faith on the basis of very practical understandings of less cryptic New Testament books. Revelation seemed bizarre and tangential by comparison.This commentary has proven to be a good antidote, and I'm using it to lay a broad foundation of understanding before coming to my own conclusions through additional study. I'm a regular listener to Mr. Gregg's radio show (via podcast), so I know some of his own views (he has many that I agree with, and several that I absolutely do not agree with, which I'm sure would be just fine with him). I am satisfied that this commentary is largely without bias. He presents the good, the bad and the ugly (and quite a bit of the absurd) from a variety of sources, and I'm really enjoying it."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Gregg's fair and unbiased analysis of four dominant paradigms regarding the book of Revelation will serve as an invaluable guide to all those who are seeking to better understand this complex book. A must have for amateur scholars of the New Testament."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"A must have reference for every serious student of eschatology and the book of Revelation in particular. Do not presume to have even a rudimentary grasp of the subject without the content of this commentary."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"I was browsing Revelation commentaries on Amazon when I came across this unique volume. I had been aware of the four primary views of eschatology: Historicism, Preterism, Futurism, and Allegorical (which this book refers to as \\"Spiritual\\"). However, I had never come across a book that presented all four views in the same work the way that this one does. My curiosity piqued, I decided to buy it. Overall, I must say it was an interesting read. Steve Gregg has made an admirable attempt at presenting an unbiased, overview of each of the four major schools of interpretation. He put in a lot of time, reading a great amount of commentaries, in completing this work. I admire him for that.That being said, there are some misgivings I have with the book. First, as one or two reviews have mentioned, the author does seem to have a slant towards the Preterist view which comes out a little from time to time. I don't fault him for this, because it's difficult to hide one's subjectivity completely, but I wouldn't say the book is %100 unbiased.Second, while the author does endeavor to give varying interpretations within each view, one may still feel that their particular position is not as well represented as it could have been. I noticed that one past reviewer gave several examples of how he believed his view (Futurism) was misrepresented. I am a Historicist and a Seventh-day Adventist (this shouldn't be TOO surprising since the Seventh-day Adventist church is the only organized body of Christians which continues to uphold the Historicist view). And, while I think the way Gregg handled this view makes for a good start, it is nowhere near complete. For one thing, he mainly draws from expositors from the nineteenth century or earlier (Albert Barnes, E.B. Elliot, Matthew Henry, Adam Clarke, etc.). While it's true that these were great scholars who wrote admirable commentaries for their time, the Historicist approach has really evolved a lot since this time.I feel that excluding Adventist commentators from this volume (with the exception of two or three references) was a mistake. In order to see how Historicism has come to be in our modern time, some of these more modern commentators really should have been included. Including them would not, of course, have been an indicator that he subscribes to our view. It would have merely completed the picture. For this reason, he gets some things wrong. Here are a few examples:1. Gregg states, \\"Futurists, like historicists, often understand Revelation to be chronologically continuous\\" (p. 40.). Though he is speaking of Futurism, he implies that Historicists see Revelation as being a chronological book. While this is true of some Historicists, such as Barnes, many modern Historicists view the book as being cyclical. For instance, we believe that the seven churches, the seven seals, and the seven trumpets are three parallel timelines that stretch from the first advent of Christ down to the second advent. I can't think of any modern Historicists off the top of my head who still view Revelation as written in chronological order.2. Later on he states, \\"As in the sixth trumpet, he [Barnes] believed that the Euphrates (v. 12) points to the Turkish power. In this identification, he represents the views of all historicists\\" (pp. 376, 378). Granted this was mostly true at one time, but things have changed. Most modern expositors believe simply that the drying up of the Euphrates represents the withdrawing of Spiritual Babylon's support (see Revelation 17:15 where the waters upon which the harlot sits represents peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. The drying up of the river, then, symbolizes the withdrawing of the support of the people. See also verse 16). Thus, it is a perfect parallel for when the literal river was turned aside, thus withdrawing its support and protection from literal Babylon and making the way for Cyrus, the king of the east, to come and conquer it. This was also the view of some older Historicists, such as Joseph Lathrop, who said:\\"the symbolical Babylon, or the Babylon of the Apocalypse, is the Romish spiritual Empire. The symbolical Euphrates, here mentioned is a source of wealth, strength, and safety, to that empire. To dry up this Euphrates, is to diminish, or destroy, that source of wealth, strength, and safety.\\"-Joseph Lathrop, A Sermon on the Dangers of the Times, p. 8. Cited in The Prophetic Faith of our Fathers by LeRoy Froom, vol. 3., p. 237.One modern Historicist scholar actually refutes the notion that the river Euphrates in the sixth plague symbolizes its geographical location:\\"Those who insist that the 'Euphrates' represents only the people who live in the actual geographic location of the Euphrates, are bound to follow the same interpretation with 'Babylon,' 'Israel,' 'Mount Zion,' etc. Such fail, however, to grasp the Christ-centered nature of the biblical antitype. The gospel of Jesus Christ releases us from the restrictions of ethnic and geographic literalism for the messianic era.\\"-Hans K. LaRondelle, \\"Armageddon: Sixth and Seventh Plagues,\\" Symposium on Revelation, bk II., p. 386.In conclusion, though I would correct these and some other minor mistakes that I found, I still found Gregg's \\"Four Views\\" Revelation Commentary to be a solid work overall. I've been studying eschatology for a while and I still picked up on several gems of truth I hadn't thought of before, some of which were presented by expositors who hold different views than I do. For those who are interested in learning more about the book of Revelation, this is a good place to start. Especially for those who are only familiar with the Futurist/Dispensationalist view of prophecy. But, for those who want to be deep students of prophecy, you won't want to end here, as this book only gives a glimpse of what these four views have to offer. For those who would be interested in seeing how the Historicist view of prophecy has evolved since the mid-nineteenth century, some books I would recommend reading are Daniel and the Revelation by Uriah Smith, the God Cares set by C.M. Maxwell, and Secrets of Revelation by Jacques Doukhan."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This book has been amazing so far I've only read the first three chapters though.

He is fair in his presentation, easy to read, and helpful in his own comments. The presentation of the various views in parallel columns is helpful in understanding the approach of each view. I highly recommend the book to those seeking to understand how various people interpret Revelation and to gain a better understanding of the writing themselves."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"The best way to test our own ideas and theories is to compare them as honestly as we can with the Word of God and with the ideas and theories of others. It is in our best interest to have iron sharpen iron. When we stretch ourselves and earnestly seek to understand what others believe, we are heading in the right direction. Having an understanding of what our brothers believe can also promote trust and peace between us. When we seek peace we are sewing to our spirit. This book is an excellent tool to help us understand not only the facts about what others think, but also many of the why's.Even though I have been studying eschatology for quite a few years now, I find that I am still quite a novice when it comes to theories outside of my own particular area of expertise. The book serves to help fill that gap in my general knowledge. For one thing, I just now learned that there is a controversy as to the dating of the book. And even though I am not persuaded in this instance to change my stance, the mere fact that there is a controversy, would make one of my previous review comments sound very ignorant. (Don't worry, when you find it, just click the &quot;no' button - I would too now.)While it may be almost impossible to be completely objective in writing this kind of book, the author does a fine job of it. No matter what your particular view is, you owe it to yourself to find out what other godly men and women think. The book is fair and makes no attacks on any individuals or position, which, in my book, is the mark of a good writer. To me, attitude has a lot to do with whether I like a book or not.The book is dedicated to Chuck Smith, pastor of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, California, with whom I also have had a chance to study. It becomes apparent that the author does not maintain the same view as Pastor Smith, but at the same time he shows respect and admiration for a truly fine brother. I, on the other hand, do not hold the same exact view as either of them, but I still regard the book as a valuable resource. Just as their particular view of this &quot;peripheral&quot; theology really has no bearing on what kind of Christians they are, so too, our own personal biases should not come to bear on whether or not this is a good book - it just is."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"REVELATION: FOUR VIEWS: A PARALLEL COMMENTARY by Steve Gregg was a blessing in my study of the Book of Revelation. He has presented four major views of the interpretation of Revelation: (1) Historicist, (2) Preterist, (3) Futurist, and (4) Spiritual. He has covered each group's beliefs in a format that sets them out side by side in four columns on the two page spread. This makes it very easy to compare. Every verse in Revelation (usually a group of verses at a time) is explained in the light of the four different views.I found myself picking and choosing from mainly the Futurist and Spiritual, with a little Historicist thrown in. But to have a comprehensive study, all views must be presented. Gregg has done this, and he has done it in a very complete and easy to understand way.His information on who speaks for a particular school of thought is excellent. It provided me with an abundant list of authors for parallel reading.I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to understand the Book of Revelation and to gain insight into the different beliefs held on the subject."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This innovative book lets you read several different views of Revelation by placing them side by side. In most cases, you get Dispensational, Historicist, Amillennial and Postmillennial points of view. But in some places [such as the letters to the 7 churches] a different aproach is needed, and is given.Often people are totally unaware there is more than one view, and this is where books like Gregg's are so helpful. If they make you less certain, this can only be a good thing, where things are not as clear as some would like to make out.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"If you want a thorough study of the major views of Revelation, there is no finer book on the subject. If you want a commentary on Revelation, this is not it.For commentary, (teens or new Christians), check J. Parks's work:\\"Dragons, Grasshoppers, & Frogs!\\". It is super-simple, very Christ-centered, and very practical.If you want an in-depth commentary, check out Revelation by John Walvoord.This work however is the culmination of scholarly research, and is organized in such a way that as you read (or teach) through Revelation, you will readily know the four major viewpoints.The viewpoints are presented fairly and without bias. This is simply the one book you cannot be without if you are studying an objective discussion on the views of Revelation."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"The author walks the reader through a comprehensive -- but easy to understand -- review of the book of Revelation. It was very rewarding to read about the different ways scholars have interpreted this book through the ages. The introduction and historical background chapters were just fascinating. This book made me wonder how any scholar or pastor could in good conscience present only one interpretation of this book as the absolute truth."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"I grew up only hearing of a pretrib, midtrib or posttrib rapture. Not realizing that my eschatology didn't exist (as a belief structure) prior to the 1830s.The first sections of the book give a good history of the interpretive options.The second section discussed chapters 1-3, which don't have much to debate.The 3rd and 4th sections divide the page into columns, each column giving the commentary from a perspective.Historicist, Preterist, Futurist, Idealist (chapters 4-19)Amil, Postmil, Premil (chapters 20 ff)I've learned a lot."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"While a book as symbolic and mysterious is bound to generate diverse secondary literature, this one is the one I would recommend, in part because it acknowledges the diversity. The book is literally divided into four columns across every page, with four different viewpoints on each passage of the biblical text.Gregg presents four alternate views of Revelation, the Historicist (a less common view today, that Revelation prophecies events throughout history from then to now), the Preterist (who believes the symbolic images of Revelation apply to actual events of the first century, particularly around the fall of the Jerusalem Temple in 70AD), the Futurist (who believes the events of Revelation will literally play themselves out in the future), and the Spiritual Idealist (who does not believe the events of Revelation correspond to actual historical events). Even within such categories, there will still be an obviously wide swath, and Gregg does service to them by quoting a wide range of commentators in each of the four categories.This is not so technical a commentary as Mounce's, and as a consequence may not lend itself so much to scholarly work. However, it is very practical for the preacher and very readable for any serious student of the Bible. Gregg does a great job of giving the reader options from which to decide.The one viewpoint which might have been more throroughly explored would be the fulfillment of the imagery in first century events not restricted solely to 66-70AD. He only touches on the eruption of Vesuvius and never even mentions the threat of the Parthian Empire, both of which were assuredly on John's mind. Nonetheless, for as much as an author could get into one commentary, Gregg includes the right stuff.James W. Miller is the author ofGod Scent"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This is a great commentary on the book Revelation. I wish I had this book when I first started reading the book of Revelation. It gives you the 4 views of Revelation from the position of the Church. Preterism , Futurism, Historcism amd Idealism. Most Christians when learning about the end times for the first time, today never get the views to choose for themselves. I was taught futurism ( Pre-Trib) by most of the churches I went to. Steven Gregg did a great job on showing the views. Also Steven Gregg doesn't show his view in the book, which is a blessing. (Even I know his view, but I not going to say anything) Great job Steve."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"You MUST have a copy of this book! Gregg gives a clear and complete understanding of each of the predominant interpretations of Biblical prophesy in a simple and easy to use format! You will want to read each section, and will no doubt use this as a handy reference! Gregg manages to keep his personal bias out of the descriptions, and fairly presents each argument clearly so that one can gain a complete understanding of each. You may not be able to choose among the different views, but you will have a thorough grasp of each to help guide you as you search other sources. Though at this writing I can't say I have chosen to ascribe to either of those views, I have grown much as a result of my exposure to this excellent work! Thank you Steve Gregg for helping me grow in my faith!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"If you begin with the premise that Revelation is inspired scripture, and wish to understand or choose from the four primary interpretations, then you won't find a better book out there than this one. This was definitely a favorite during my research. Dare I say so myself: if you couple my book, which takes a historical look at Revelation and does not presume it's inspired, with this book, which details the various ways believers read Revelation, you'll get a well-rounded picture.Gregg goes verse-by-verse through Revelation and, with four columns side-by-side, describes how proponents of the four interpretive methods read the scripture. These four types are as follows:The Historicist approach sees Revelation as surveying the entire church history, from Christ through today and beyond. Events described in Revelation reach fulfillment gradually, through the centuries.The Preterist approach assumes fulfillment in the first century, and usually assumes an early writing of Revelation (before the war of 70 AD.) Revelation prophecies this \\"war to end of wars\\" in which Jerusalem is overrun and the Temple destroyed. This is closest to my own treatment, though a better label for my perspective would be contemporary-historical.The Futurist approach awaits fulfillment in the future. This needs no further introduction; among today's Christians, this is by far the most popular interpretation, though it wasn't necessarily so throughout Christian history.The Spiritual approach is Gregg's label for those who do not look for a literal interpretation, but rather see spiritual lessons and principles in the symbolism that runs rampant through this mysterious scripture.All four interpretations are illuminating, and many readers, upon completion of this study, conclude that Revelation must be a complex combination of the above. Certainly, Revelation is revealed to be a book of deep meaning, seldom contemplated in its entirety by most Christians."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Four most popular perspectives of the apocalypse is expressed, formulated and presented here in crystal clear exposition. Steve Gregg has not merely copied the works of others. He has extracted the essence of teaching from the most eminent authorities of each school, verse by verse and has arranged them in such a flow of order giving the reader an immediate comparison, helping to discern which school has stronger and logical scriptural support (foundation). The minor differences among the most highly acclaimed teachers of any one particular school is laid out in a flow, clearly showing that God's revelation to humanity is progressive with time as man strives harder (hungers and thirsts) to understand God's mind clearer than what has been revealed. This book is a must to all those who are serious about grasping the book of Revelation. It is edifying, electric and grasps your soul. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"In the introduction, the author points out his reason for putting together a book like this was that he couldn't find such a book that compared the major views of Revelation.I will say that he has done a wonderful job compiling his information into one volume that is easy to read and to reference.Throughout most of the book the author presents a passage of Revelation then lists (usually) four views on the meaning of that passage. The format is such that comparison of any number of views for any particular passage is very easy. If a reader only wanted to focus on one view in particular for a passage or for the entire book, doing so would be easy with Gregg's layout.There are also summaries of large sections (usually multiple chapters) at the beginning and at the end of the sections to help give the reader a more clear understanding of how each view treats that particular section.The author doesn't just rely on just one source for each of the views and even goes so far as to point out differences between some commentators who say they hold the same view for Revelation. I thought that the views were presented in a very objective and unbiased manner.This book makes a great study guide of Revelation, but could also serve as an occasional reference guide, since it is laid out so well.In summary, this is a wonderful book that will not only appeal to the more serious student of Revelation, but to anyone who even has a casual interest in what Revelation means.***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"I've owned this book for many years, and have had the pleasure of meeting Steve.

This allows the reader to make a detailed study and come to his own conclusion based on the best possible argument.

All the arguments are well defined and polished and are presented in a very digestible format.The side by side comparo's are close to what the \\"harmony of the gospels\\" is like. Very nice.

Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Gregg has done so much work in putting this together. Instead of reading and digging into multiple commentaries for many viewpoints, they are all here in one volume. This is particularly helpful in the older and less popular viewpoints of the spiritualist/idealist and historicist. (It is easy to find viewpoints on the preterist and futurists)My only caution with the book is that eschatology cannot be understood simply by studying Revelation. You must study many of the Old Testament passages, particularly in Genesis, Psalms, Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Zechariah. Gregg's book does not adequately deal with these with respect to the 4 views thoroughout. Otherwise, a great book!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This is a tremendously helpful tool. It gives balanced commentary in parallel columns from four viewpoints. Most '4 views' books on the book of Revelation compare and contrast dispensational premil., histoirc premil, amil and postmil views. Gregg sees these 4 categories as a helpful 'x-axis' on eschatology. But the 'y-axis' is formed by 4 other categories. If predeictive prophecy is seen as a hourglass from the vantage point of the early 21st century: there is 1. preterist (hourglass full on bottom, empty on top), 2. futurist (full on top, empty on bottom); 3. historicist (half on top, half bottom), and 4. spiritual (full on top and bottom!).SOme combinations are impossible (dispensational premil is always futurist; postmil is never futurist). SO there are 12 boxes possible. For example, the Reformers were historicist and amil. Augustine: spiritual and amil. Kuyper: futurist and amil. 7th Day Adventists: historicist and historic premil. Tim LaHaye: futurist and dispensational premil. etc. etc.The book looks at that less commonly understood 'y-axis' at least for the bulk of Revelation: chapters 3-19.Beefy, well-packaged and balanced (i never determined the author's personal view!)."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"If you are looking for a book that will give you good information on every verse, through every different major viewpoint.

This is unfortunate since this view is not the dominant view among Premillennialists, and many of the interpretations attributed to Premillennialists are limited to this errant view.Overall, not a bad book and it is interesting to see what the other views are. But be careful when reading."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"In this parallel commentary, Gregg provides an invaluable tool for Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants alike. He is diligent in providing the most articulate case possible for each of the four major interpretive traditions regarding the Revelation to St. John. He presents each tradition's best thoughts on each passage. The tool is useful precisely because it does not make straw men out of any of the traditions, and because it does not pigeon hole interpretations by denomination. In doing so, Gregg recognizes that there are variations within denomination, and that interpretations also transcend denominational divisions. Moreover, he fairly presents the in survey form the depth of scholarship that has developed each approach."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"In 2002, as the pastor of a small southern Baptist church in Texas, I began a study on Sunday evenings going through the book of Revelation verse by verse. Like many other Christians at the time, I had been swept away by the Left Behind series of books and I did not realize at the time that there were other ways of looking at the book of Revelation. If I did know of any, I certainly did not think they were orthodox. As any teacher knows, the best way to become familiar with a subject is to teach it because in preparing to teach there comes a much deeper knowledge of the material. It is also the best way to have your beliefs challenged. I didn't get too far into teaching the book of Revelation when I began to see that there were serious problems with the way I understood eschatology. I put off the Sunday evening study of Revelation until I was able to study the matter more fully.It was around that time that I purchased a copy of Revelation: Four Views. Although this was not the first resource that exposed me to different views of eschatology, it has certainly been the most comprehensive. It does not appear that Gregg produced this book to further his own view, but to produce an accurate depiction of each of the four predominant views of Revelation. The format for this book is very easy to follow. A portion of the book of Revelation is displayed (a few verses at a time) and then, in parallel format, Gregg summarizes how each of the four views interpret that passage. He does this by using quotes from recognized scholars so as to properly present each view. The parallel format allows the reader to compare the views to determine which one best corresponds with scripture. Far too many believers are under the impression, as I once was, that there is only one way to view the end times. This book not only shows that there are other ways of viewing things relating to the end times, but it will also challenge people to critically analyze their own view to make sure it is true to Scripture. I wholeheartedly give Revelation: Four Views five out of five stars.For more of my reviews and other articles, go to eccentricbiblescholar.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"The book is in great shape.

It's been particularly helpful in order to understand where people are coming from who have a different approach to mine.Another benefit from this book has been that it invites people who see me reading it to beging thinking about why they believe what they believe about Revelation and by extension the entire Bible.

This book is not meant to provide specific and detailed facts about every single phrase in Revelation, but it does exactly what the author intended: compare the style and general foundations of each school of interpretation (historicist, preterist, futurist, spiritualist/idealist). The main idea of each interpretation is captured in the author's comments on every section of each chapter. One great feature I did not realize until I received the book was the comparison between premillennialism, postmillennialism, and amillennialism on chapter 20, which is necessary to explain the 3 ways of interpreting the millennium.This is the perfect intro to Revelation because it is unbiased and all 4 views are presented equally. Once you read this book you can then decide which interpretation you would like to pursue for further in-depth study by choosing a commentary devoted to that specific interpretation. (Yes, to truly understand and then apply Revelation you must persevere.)Be sure to read the author's own review below for more info!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This is a terrific book! The author has researched a vast array of commentaries and commentators on the book of Revelation and given us a summary of four different ways of interpreting the book, straight from the mouths of proponents of the various views.It is obvious that in such a work he cannot be exhaustive. Furthermore, he doesn't really try to prove any one position but simply tries to let the advocates of the various positions state their views.As a pastor I find this book valuable. Although I obviously have more time to study the bible than most I don't have all the time in the world. I don't have the time to wade through a dozen or more commentaries in preparing to teach on the book of Revelation. However, I have the responsibility to teach accurately and to fairly represent different views which are found within Christendom.This is where the book shows its greatest strength. Full time scholars will wade through all of the commentaries, but pastors and bible teachers whose time is more limited can turn to this book as a reference on the differing views.One of the things you will find is that there are four broad categories of approach to the book of Revelation - the historicist, preterist, futurist and idealist. And you will also find that within those categories there are differing angles which are taken on particular passages. This could be discouraging to some because it may make you come away thinking that the task of understanding the book of Revelation is hopeless.On the other hand, maybe God has a purpose in this confusion. I believe it was Pascal who said something along the lines of this - God did not give us the bible to tickle our intellects but to tranform our our lives. I probably butchered the quote, but the point is that maybe God gave us Revelation in the form it is in to help us understand His greatness and our smallness. Maybe the book of Revelation has received so many different interpretations because God doesn't want us to figure it out or become experts, He wants to humble us and reduce us to awe and wonder at His power which is so richly displayed in the book of Revelation.All of this is not to say that we can or should be agnostic when it comes to interpreting the book of Revelation. I have a definite opinion on the book and am prepared to argue it. However, this book has tempered my argumentative spirit. It has helped me to see where those I disagree with are coming from and shown me where those opponents have pointed out legitimate weaknesses in my own position. Most importantly though, it helps me embrace those brothers I disagree with as we eagerly await the return of Christ."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Hi. Thanks for reading these reviews (and thanks to those who wrote them). I am the author of \\"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary.\\" Because of the nature of the book, I have always been listed as the \\"editor\\" (rather than \\"author\\") though no other hand but my own was involved in the writing of the book. The decision to call me \\"editor\\" instead of \\"author\\" was made by Thomas Nelson Publishers (with my approval, of course), rather late in the process of preparing for publication. Their rationale for using this title was their concern that a man without schoarly credentials (like me) might not be taken seriously as the \\"author\\" of a commentary, whereas readers might lower the bar a bit in assessing the appropriate qualifications for an \\"editor.\\"I noticed that (at the time of this writing--which might not be the case in the future), on this Amazon page, while I am referred to as the editor of the book (nothing wrong with that), that \\"Dr. Howard F. Vos\\" is listed as its author. Since I don't know the venerable Dr. Vos (I have a book of his on church history, and have found it very useful), and since he would be the first to admit, I am sure, that he had nothing to do with the writing of \\"Revelation: Four Views...\\", I am perplexed at how the authorship of the book came to be attributed to him at this website. You will find no reference to him on the pages of the book under consideration, because he had nothing to do with it. I do not point that out in order to avoid his getting credit for any virtues the work may possess, but more to absolve him of responsibility for anything in the book that he might regard as a defect. Since I come to this website but rarely, I cannot say how long this misprint has been here (it has not always been).This mislabeling also could easily mislead customers who are looking for a book by me, because I am a radio talk show host and international speaker. If people familiar with me come to Amazon.com looking for a book by my name, they may not realize that this is it, if they read that Dr. Vos is the author. I have attempted (and think I have managed) to notify the people at Amazon about this, so, if it gets corrected, this notice will just make me look kind of dumb (It wouldn't be the first time that has happened, of course!).I give the book four stars. I think the book is pretty good, for many of the reasons that other reviewers have mentioned. Twelve years after its publication, it certainly remains the only book of its type. Whether another man might have done a better job on such a project, we may never know. It fills a niche that no one, apparently, thought needed to be filled before I did, and I can't see why any author would wish to expend the necessary energies, simply to \\"reinvent the wheel\\" (unless, of course, the existing design of the wheel is unserviceable), simply in order to unnecessarily fill a void that is no longer empty. I know I wouldn't have!Thomas Nelson has since approached me, asking me to write similar books on Daniel and Ezekiel. I declined. It can't be done. Unlike the Book of Revelation, a good portion of these books is occupied with historical narratives, for which it would be impossible to find more than one serious interpretation. Then again, when one comes to the prophetic portions of these books, there simply are not four discreet views, taken by commentators. There usually are two views--perhaps three, in some cases. I bring such things out in my recorded lectures on these books, but could never format a complete commentary on even two views of these books (at least I am not clever enough to figure out how to do so).While I don't necessarily see the same defects in \\"Revelation: Four Views\\" that some reviewers have mentioned, I am painfully aware of other defects--worse ones than have been mentioned by any other reviewers.One grievous defect is that the footnotes for the introductory material, in the final product, somehow got jostled and misnumbered. This would never be discovered by a reader, in all likelihood, but an author referenced in the notes might be alarmed to read that a comment made by a different person has been attributed to him, or that his wit and eloquence have been credited to another man. Of course, I didn't notice this defect until the book was in print, and I have always (in my own mind) blamed the mistake on typesetters. It is easy to put the onus for such embarrassments upon faceless drones whose real identities can never be brought to light.Another defect (more obvious to any informed reader) is that I made a very foolish choice among various options when selecting a title for the fourth view of Revelation. I do mention, in the introductory material, that this view is difficult to label, and has been known by a variety of names, but the one I chose to place at the head of the fourth column of each comparative page was very ill-chosen. Thus the word \\"Spiritual\\" appears as the name of the fourth view, where the much more appropriate label \\"Idealist\\" should have been!In a sense, the term \\"spiritual\\" may mislead people to think that this is the view that does all the \\"spiritualizing,\\" while the other three stick more to a \\"literal\\" approach. This is not at all the case, nor is it the impression I intended to convey by the use of that term. What I was intending to communicate was the idea that this view sees the book as teaching spiritual lessons, rather than predicting historical events. However, even here, \\"Idealist\\" would have been much better--partly because it is the more-or-less \\"conventional\\" or \\"standard\\" label for the viewpoint, but also because the concepts depicted in the visions of Revelation, in this view, are not all \\"spiritual\\" concepts at all, but are \\"ideals\\" or \\"transcendent concepts.\\" My bad. Look for a change in this, if there is ever a second edition. If you currently use the book as a teaching aid, please note this change--for your sake and that of your students.Another weakness of the book (which would be remedied in a second edition) is that it does not include consideration of some fairly recent, and important, books on Revelation, which one would wish to include in such a volume. The omission of any mention of Beale's important commentary on Revelation (NIGCT) is a defect--but one for which I will accept no blame, since Beale's book was published two years after mine. On the other hand, I alone am to be blamed for not having been familiar with Richard Bauckham's \\"The Theology of the Book of Revelation,\\" which was published four years before my book (I was made aware, too late, of Bauckham's book. Hank Hanegraaff brought it to my attention).I might mention also that another book with a very similar title to mine (\\"Four Views of Revelation\\") was published by Zondervan the year following the publication of \\"Revelation: Four Views.\\" I would imagine that this development may occasion some confusion of identity, among some. Readers who have not seen hard copies of either book, and are trying to decide between them will notice that Zondervan's book (edited by C. Marvin Pate), is a paperback, half the length, and considerably less expensive than my book. What may not be as obvious without one's actually opening the two books is that the similarity of the titles is pretty much the only similarity that exists between the two books. Pate has given us a useful book on Revelation--but it is useful in a different way. His includes chapters and responses from four authors, defending four views (two of the four are futurists, and there is no historicist--an editorial decision easily justified by the fewness of historicists today, and the variety of viewpoints within futurist camps). Thus it is another in what has become a justly popular genre of Christian literature that can be called \\"four-views books\\"--a genre created by Professor Robert Clouse, who himself edited four such volumes on as many Christian topics (war, eschatology, economics and the ordination of women). I have about 22 such books, on as many topics (by various publishers and editors) on my shelf, and most of them (including Pate's book) are more than worth the price of owning them.It is a sign of Dr. Clouse's humility and graciousness that he, though recovering from a heart transplant at the time, actively encouraged me in this project and deigned to write the foreword to my book. \\"Revelation: Four Views\\" is not, however, a book of the \\"four-views\\" genre created by Dr. Clouse. It is a reference work; a verse-by-verse interpretive commentary (actually, four such commentaries, arranged in parallel columns) on the text of the Book of Revelation. Fifty other commentaries were read or consulted in the process of writing.While writing, I limited myself to the reading of the commentaries of only one view at a time (I saw no sense in courting premature dementia!). Though I had already reached my present conclusions about the Book of Revelation before commencing the project, I actually sought to tentatively convince myself of each view serially, before writing the complete commentary for that view, and then I would do the same for the next view, etc.Some reviewers have said that they are still not sure of my own view on Revelation (that would have to mean that they have never heard my lectures on the book). It was actually my design, in writing, to conceal my own leanings throughout, and to be personally convinced (so far as was possible) of each view as I wrote it. My own view, by the way, does not conform to any of the four all the way through Revelation, but draws from at least two of them. It was fairly easy for me to write as if totally objective because my personal commitment in ministry (my philosophy of education) is that students will be much better served by me, as an educator, if they learn to think for themselves (though they ultimately reach conclusions different from mine), than if they simply \\"borrow\\" views at second-hand from any teacher (including me). I have never been able to conceive of any reason why \\"attaining agreement with Steve Gregg\\" should be viewed as anyone's goal as a student, nor mine as an educator!As some of the reviewers have noted, there is a website (for \\"The Narrow Path\\") where hundreds of my lectures (including those on Revelation) can be downloaded, as mp3 files, without charge. My daily radio broadcast can also be heard on-line, as well as in certain radio markets.Thanks for checking out my book!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"I did not think it could be done. How could anyone write, presenting varying views that are opposed to each other and remain unbiased? Steve Gregg has done just that.I became a Christian reading a famous book about revelation written from the dispensational perspective. I became so well versed in this view that I could teach the book of Revelation without notes. After attending a Bible College that was exclusively dispensational, a pastor who embraced the historic premillennial view challenged me to learn about other views on the subject. I resisted, like the know-it-all 26 year old I was at the time, but I did follow my pastor's advice and began reading.I have since evolved through historic premillennialism and am now a humble amillennialist. (I say humble because I know that better men than me have differing opinions on eschatology.)When I read Steve Gregg's masterpiece, I was stunned to see that he faithfully and charitably presented an unbiased look at the varying views of Revelation. THIS IS A MUST READ for any and all students of eschatology-especially those who are unread in views other than their own. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"This is an easy-to-read, clearly articulated description of the main lines of interpretation on this book, presented in parallel format, so you can check one perspective with another right on the same page. As such, this book's main strength is also its main weakness. It offers very clear, unbiased descriptions of the Historicist, Preterist, Futurist, and Spiritual/Idealist views of Rev. 1-19, as well as Premillennial, Postmillenial and Amillennial interpretations of Rev. 20. Thus you get a very well-written description of each view (whereas in many other commentaries on Rev., it is difficult to know exactly which approach the author is taking, what implications that approach has on the rest of the book, or what other interpretive options exist.)What you DON'T get here is an interaction between the views (as in Pate's \\"Four Views\\" book); this commentary doesn't point out the strengths or weaknesses that have traditionally been associated with each viewpoint. After reading it, you will understand the differing viewpoints much better, but you won't be much closer to making a good, informed decision yourself, on which approach you think is stronger.In short, this is an excellent supplementary commentary to have, in addition to another comentary that actually takes a stance on some of the issues. This is definitely a commentary worth having, but get Aune's or Beale's commentaries (for example) in addition for some top-flight research that focuses on drawing conclusions rather than summarizing options."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"It appears that this is the only work that Gregg has written. While initially I wondered why this is so, I then considered the effort this must have entailed. Gregg's treatment of each of the four positions is balanced and helpful. The method he chooses, rather than simply explaining each of the views, is to simply quote scholars who hold the respective views. When there is room for debate within a particular view, he lays out as many interpretations as is reasonably necessary to understand the position fully. Furthermore, he does not have an agenda in this commentary, he simply provides the arguments (as well as pointing out weaknesses) for each of the positions. This is such a great tool because I can simply turn to the passage and understand each of the four predominant interpretations (as well as variations within those four interpretations).While I try to avoid giving out five stars on these reviews, simply to avoid conveying the appearance of perfection, I cannot find a reason not to give 5 stars. This commentary of Revelation is perhaps the only one out there that does the following: 1) gives great arguments for all major positions 2) quotes from a wide variety of the leading proponents of each the positions, 3) avoids bias or random conjecture of his own which would blemish the work 4) leaves a reader with a balanced perspective from which to make his own decision on how to interpret Revelation.Because any student of eschatology should embrace understanding the objections to his own position, as well as the arguments for others, this book is a must have. For those who have not studied Revelation at all, or are perhaps overly entrenched into a particular view, this book will bring balance. I highly recommend such an outstading work."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"The author, as many have pointed out, is well-balanced in his presentation of the major views. He presents them from the adherents' perspective without unnecessary commentary. Since the 4 views are broad categories, variations among proponents are pointed out when necessary. I do believe the author has been successful in his efforts to provide the reader with a framework in which to make up their own mind. Though Gregg provides commentary and points out weaknesses; he doesn't reach (or preach) any conclusions.In my own experience, I avoided study of the more esoteric Bible books, but Four Views did an excellent job of making Revelation approachable without dumbing down the subject. When reading Four Views, one can see where all (or most) interpretations share common ground thereby providing the reader a basis to understanding the imagery. From there, one can work up to a more detailed espousal of a doctrine or (in my case) hybrid of doctrines. Gregg provides a strong enough framework of the four interpretive approaches for a detailed study of eschatology without being dense. I personally started to reread the book and create flashcards to map out the various passages and interpretations. You don't NEED to, but as I said, the book provides a solid framework for further studies.The lay reader will be interested to note that many of the great Church luminaries such as Luther, Finney, Calvin, Wesley, Augustine, Origen, Hus, Spurgeon, Edwards, and others did not share our prevailing modern view. For the narrow dogmatist, maybe that fact alone will encourage them to explore other views.My only complaint is that the binding on the book isn't the best. The book receives heavy use, as well as sharing among friends but won't hold up well to constant, ongoing treatment. That's a shame since most readers will read it thoroughly flipping around frequently and use it as a reference once completed. Don't let this stop you from buying it though. If you are interested in beginning Revelation study, this is the best place I've encountered."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"After acquiring 40-50 books on Revelation for helping me prepare an \\"advanced\\" study, at the conclusion of the study I got rid of all of the books except 5. Gregg's 4 View Parallel Commentary was one of them. It is exquisite.It completely out classes Pate's book (Four Views on the Book of Revelation) and the Broadman Press book (Revelation: Three Viewpoints) Pate's book is MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE and it is the book that I recommended to my class, but only due to cost.\\"The Introduction\\" alone in Gregg's book is definately worth the price of the book.The way to best judge if a \\"comparison\\" book has been well done is to hear positive comments from each side represented concerning their position. I have heard nothing but good words concerning Gregg's book, regardless of what view taken by the person commenting. Premillennialists, Postmillennialists and Amillennialists alike sing the praises of this book. Whether a Preterist, Futurist, Spirtualist or Historist, I believe that you will feel fairly represented. Steve Gregg has done a real service to those beginning to dig deep in Revelation.I will draw attention to one \\"weakness\\". In the Preterist world there are 2 very different groups. 1- believes that the focus of Revelation is the Desctuction of Jerusalem, 2- believes that the focus of Revelation is the Fall of the Roman Empire. Since Gregg couldn't really use both views to represent the Preterist position, he had to choose one or the other and he chose #1. Just be aware that not all Preterists believe that Revelation is focused on the Destruction of Jerusalem.If you don't have Gregg's book and you are either in the beginning stages of doing a deep study of Revelation or about to do a \\"re-examination study\\" of Revelation, then BUY THIS BOOK! You will be blessed. God bless. Mike"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Gregg's book is amazingly objective. I figured his bias would show up sooner or later. But he does a good job at presenting four different approaches to the book of Revelation. His suggestions for how to read the book were also quite helpful."},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"If you could only buy one book On Revelation, this would be it. I have about 30 titles and this one is the best. It is so even handed that I am still not sure what the author's views are. The formatting of the book allows a quick understanding of the 4 major ways of interpreting Revelation. For example, if you want to know what the Mark of the Beast -666- is all about you go to the commentary and read the section on 666 in each column and in a very short time frame you have everything you need at a preliminary level, and most of us on this subject will never get past that level!Positive Dennis"},{"Title":"Revelation: Four Views: A Parallel Commentary","review":"Everyone I've ever talked to that has studied the book of Revelation has only looked at 1 perspective and usually doesn't even know that other potentially viable interpretations exist. Don't be one of those people! Gregg's book does a great job of giving you an overview of all major interpretations of Revelation on a verse-by-verse basis in an easy to read side-by-side column format. He also includes a good introduction, and very helpful section outlines and concluding summaries. And also worth noting is that Gregg treats all positions faily. I didn't detect any favortism on Gregg's part at all.Because there is such a vast amount of different material out there on Revelation, Gregg must necessarily leave things out. This comparative study, however, is a much-needed addition to the study of Revelation. In conjunction with this book I suggest delving into more detailed theologies or commentaries to get a fuller understanding of the text. Gregg also includes a fine list of commentaries and their biases. (I might also suggest Richard Bauckham's theology or either of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza's commentaries.)Gregg's work should be an important part of your study of Revelation because it will force you to examine your presuppostions coming into this book, and even your own previously unchallenged interpretations. Don't sell yourself short! If you're going to do a responsible study of Revelation examine all takes before coming to your own conclusion, and don't just buy the first thing you see on TV or hear in church. This climactic last book of the Bible deserves it!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"4.5 starsI enjoyed the movie when it came out so I thought the book would be worth checking out, and indeed it is. Not just for the many very interesting tales of a life none of us could ever lead, even if we wanted to (computers now make most of these crimes impossible), but because Abagnale is in fact an amazingly engaging writer.There's a co-author here, but you can tell the phrasing is mostly Frank's; his inner con man can't ever let up, even decades after the crimes. You can tell how easily he must have charmed the dames, as he's got a bon mot for every situation. He's also winningly self-deprecating, and despite knowing how clever he truly is (he did fool many nations' worth of cops for five years, after all), he rarely comes off as a bad guy.Buuut, there are more than few moments where you have to wince at his lack of scruples. Ripping off Pan Am and a ton of banks is relatively victimless (just ask Lloyd Blankfein...oh right, he ripped off millions of American families...and still hasn't done one day in jail!). But when Frank sticks his father with that first heavy credit card bill, I just felt so bad for his Dad. And was so impressed with the old man's unperturbed understanding of it all. The apple doesn't fall far!Yet this is the tale of a crook, after all, so one can't expect to love the anti-hero much. That he's so easy to identify with is his main victory here. And truly, his time in the Perpignan jail hole would have done most of us in, no doubt. That's the hardest part to stomach. The compassion of the Swedes, on the other hand, makes you just want to hug them all (and makes me proud of my Swedish heritage). There's no doubting one thing, though: Frank Abagnale must have been a seriously charming guy back in the day. The ladies sure loved him!I liked DiCaprio in the movie, but now see that a bigger guy who looked ten years older than he really is, instead of ten years younger like Leo, would have been a much better choice. The movie's still worth seeing, in any case, yet I would certainly recommend reading the book first. It's a better piece of work, and Abagnale's own voice adds the authenticity that explains it all. Between his very literate way of explaining his choices, using many humorous and apt historic touchstones, and his crazily bald effrontery in pulling all these scams off so easily, there's a whole lot of food for thought and laughter here.One of the best true crime stories I've encountered, Catch Me If You Can is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book, and story, is too amazing, too unbelievable, to be true.

It is unbelievable how he faked an FAA license; a law degree from Harvard and enough bad checks to keep him in permanent retirement.If Frank's jetsetting life-style is too much to believe, then you will have a great time reading of his jail escapes by 1.) fishing himself down an airplane toilet and 2.) just simply walking out of prison after convincing guards he was undercover.This story is just to unbelievable not to read!

You'll find yourself rooting for a crook, but that's the fun of it. His career as an expert to prevent fraud, in addition to the book, movie and play, must all add up to a nice hefty heist.

While the movie is fun and does justice to the story, it is such a unique and compelling read I think it is wholly superior when read before watched. Of course, I saw the movie years before without even knowing beforehand that it is a true story of criminal genius.Frank Abignale Jr. was a PanAm airline pilot, attorney, pediatrician, university professor, and millionaire all before he turned 21. What's truly astounding is the seeming ease with which he was able to accomplish all this. Bravado and nerves of steel go a long way--but research and observation carried the day for Frank and his many aliases.There is no overriding message to the story. Thieves get caught. The author (and central character) was probably the best young thief in modern history. Had he been more prudent, he could have retired at 20 to an anonymous Caribbean or Pacific island with luxurious comfort. Instead, the character seemed addicted to the thrill. Payoffs were stashed in a dozen or more spots all over the world. He logged over a million air miles. Countless women and front-line bank and hotel employees were duped by Abignale's charms.

Some of his stories are hilarious, ridiculous, and sometimes hard to believe he pulled it off with such ease. The confidence he had to swindle authorities all over the world, as well as the ladies he encountered just add to the story.

It's not an amazing true story as the blurbs proclaim.Don't reach for this book if you want to read a true-to-fact autobiography. 'Catch me if you can' is a ghostwritten, highly embellished in style and content, largely implausible narrative that diverts from what probably really happened as much as the Spielberg movie diverts from the book. In words of Abagnale himself:'I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography. This is one of the reasons that from the very beginning, I insisted the publisher put a disclaimer in the book and tapes.'I have yet to find this disclaimer in my copy. I like fiction and don't mind reading it as long as the author (or the publisher) doesn't try to sell it as a true story. Reading 'Catch me if you can' I had an increasing feeling that I was being conned. I swallowed all the tall tales of his forgeries, swindles and impersonations hook line and sinker, but the devil, as usual, is in details.Funnily my suspicions were aroused only when I found out he was fluent in French despite the fact that a few pages earlier he used an interpreter to communicate in that language.The description of his incarceration in a French hellhole of a prison is unbelievable to the point of ridiculous, but still the time is extended from 6 months he purportedly served to about one year.Then he's rescued by a Swedish policewoman Jan Lundstr&ouml;m. Fine. I understand that all names in the book have been changed but Jan is a male name in Sweden. At this point I couldn't suspend my disbelief any longer and I put the book down unfinished.A few words about the style of writing. It's about as overdone as the facts it's supposed to desribe and nearly unreadable."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I had seen the movie before reading this book, so I knew the basic story. I was glad to see though,that Mr. Abagnale went right to the good stuff without trying to justify or explain himself. It was interesting that his first con was his father, charging thousands of dollars on a loaned gas card for phony repairs and pocketing the cash, and how seemingly quickly and easily his father forgave him.His cons were amazing in their audacity and intelligence. Frank has a very sharp mind, but it soon became apparent that his greatest asset was his charisma. Everyone instantly liked this handsome and personable young man and just wanted to believe his claims. Had he been twice as smart, but half as charming, I doubt he could have pulled off everything he did.It was easy to enjoy reading about his ripping off of large companies(Pan-Am particularly),hotels and banks, but it became less fun when he began stealing directly from everyday people. Once,lurking around a bank where he had just opened an account, he noticed people often did not put their account number on their deposit slips. Being the enterprising young man that he was, he swiped a few dozen slips and wrote HIS account number in. He then replaced the slips. When he checked his account later, he had over forty thousand dollars in his balance. He made a withdrawal and got out of Dodge.Another such incident took place in Boston. Amazingly, on the same day he more or less conned his way out of jail, hours before the FBI arrived for him, he decided to rob a bank. Not with a gun, but with a sack and a uniform. He bought a authentic security guard uniform from the supplier, obtained a holster and (fake) gun, went to the bank, put a sign over the night deposit reading; Out of Order,Please Leave Deposit with Officer, and stood in front of it with a sack. He got over sixty thousand dollars deposited in his bag.This is the one that really got me. He said this money was in small bills, so it's not rich businessmen he's stealing from, it's people who need the money, for rent,food,gas, and their children. And here he is smiling in their faces, patting himself on the back for being clever.This did catch up to him,however. He eventually was caught in Montpellier,France. He had pulled numerous scams in France and the rest of Europe(all over Earth,actually) and thought to retire. I doubt his retirement would have lasted,but he is caught when one of the innumerable stewardesses he had dallied with recognized him and turned him in.The penal system in France at that time seems to have been incomprehensibly barbaric. It was so unbelievable that I did some research on the subject to confirm it. I won't go into it here, but Frank spent a very unpleasant six months jailed in France. He was then transferred to the country club prisons of Sweden. The contrast was mind-numbing as to how two countries had such a radically different approach to incarceration. Anyway, this consideration was wasted on Frank. After his term in Sweden he was due to go to Italy, where the prisons were just as bad as in France,if not worse. The Swedish officials asked the American Embassy to revoke his passport,so he could be deported to the US instead.This led to perhaps his most daring escape. When the plane hit the runway, Frank was in the restroom, pulling out the toilet and shimmying out the bottom of the plane. He ran off the tarmac unnoticed and used the twenty American dollars a kind female Swedish officer had given him for snacks to take a cab out of there.Once caught in France though, Frank's luck had seemingly run out. He was recaptured,but escaped again. Very cleverly, but he just couldn't evade the authorities forever.This is where the book ends,rather abruptly. A epilogue where it tells how he was eventually caught for good, served five years in an American penitentiary, and was let out with the understanding that he would henceforth use his powers for good would have been appreciated.In closing, this book was highly entertaining and you can probably finish it in one day. Don't believe everything you read though. Because I wouldn't doubt that Frank is still pulling a scam of some sort. I hope he didn't make any money off the movie or new editions of this book, but he probably did. Crime can still pay for Frank Abagnale."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"So many people already expressed their praises of the book, and there is no need to repeat them. I have some questions after reading this book.1. In the subsequent several decades as a family man living on this side of the law, how did he control the urge to impost and con? Did he get lengthy psychiatric counselling or is his wife a counseller? Though he was very lovable for a limited time, he still exhibited many characteristics of a borderline personality traits making it difficult for him to function in a 'stay put' life style. How did he overcome his shortcomings?2. Would he ever write a sequel to tell us how he settled down, what he thinks of women after he married his wife, what prices he still pays and how he treated his personality problems?

I could not believe how lucky he got; how easily he was able to slip in and out of identities. A great novel. One of the amazing things is the fact that it took over twenty years for the film to be made. An interesting story and a fast read. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I thought this inside look into the life of a former con man was entertaining and outrageous. Disguised as a Pan Am pilot, Frank W. Abagnale -- a.k.a., Frank Williams, Frank Adams and Robert Conrad -- conned, forged and duped his way to the position as one of the most notorious scam artists in the country. And the amazing part is that he had achieved the aforementioned status before his twenty-first birthday! Abagnale retells his criminal excursions with sharp wit, precise details and unmistakable arrogance. I assume that all scam artists feel a sense of superiority knowing that they have duped the FBI, and Abagnale is no exception. This is a fun and quick read that should not be missed. I look forward to watching the film version of this gem..."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Honest - that's an ironic word to describe a book written by a con artist, but that's the first word that comes to mind when I read Frank's novel.It's entertaining, it's exciting, and yet, it's educational as well. I also found myself feeling sympathy for him as well, despite his being a criminal.

Then I have to remind myself that this did happen, and this person is famous because of it.The author really does a great job explaining everything from his actions to the thoughts of those around him, especially since he is the main character in this story. He makes it very clear and hardly confusing. I enjoyed reading it because of the detail involved in letting the reader create an image of the events taking place in their own mind. It is written exactly like it is, without creating extra detail that might not be relevant to the plot.I was really drawn to the story the entire time I was reading it, and at no time was I bored or uninterested, but it kept me turning pages and wanting to know what happens next. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good, true story filled with detail and adventures that leaves you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This was the greatest book I have ever read in my life!

After reading &quot;Catch Me If You Can,&quot; I found myself talking about this book incessantly. The writer takes the reader on a adventurous foray into the mind of a criminal genius...I began to hope that he would escape capture as I wanted this book to never end.The one thing that stayed with me upon completion was that the book covered such a short portion of his life... he was 15 when his life of conning people (or should I say &quot;banks&quot;)began and inhis early twenties when he was (successfully) captured. I wanted to know more about his life after being released from jail and joining the FBI's Financial Crime Unit. The book was thoroughly enjoyable and a great read for anyone!I particularly liked the descriptions of the planning of each &quot;caper&quot; and I found myself laughing outloud at hissheer luck in not getting caught. Unfortunately, I was amazed and astonished at how easy it was for him to don a pilot's uniform to get aboard a plane, construct a forged ID, work as a pediatrician and college professor.

While not a how-to guide to running a professional con, this autobiography reads almost like a fiction story. Frank Abagnale's life story could not have been any better crafted for a novel.

The first chapter may have started a little slow but once the stage has been set, the action doesn't stop. I had previously owned this book a few years ago and when I was looking to re-read it, I couldn't find it. I ended up purchasing another and it was worth it. Very enjoyable!

As hi-tech drifters go, Frank Abagnale has few peers. I'm just alittle disappointed in a glaring mistake. On page 45, we go along with him on his first ever deadhead trip, to Miami as it turns out. It's clearly stated that he arranged right there at the Eastern airlines desk, that first 'jump'. However, only ten pages [and 2 years of scams] later, he mentions the deadhead trip that nearly proved his undoing. It was on National Airlines; a flight from New Orleans to Miami. Frank marks this flight in nostalgic terms--saying how, here he was 'again' on a 'National' flight to Miami, deadheading, his very first 'jump' having been on National Airlines. If Eastern arranged him on a carrier [for that first trip two years previous] OTHER than Eastern, that wasn't made clear. I assume it was Eastern he first flew...why the glaring mistake??I only mention this detail 'cos I care about the veracity of the other subsequent details!Great book, Frank, And I can't wait for the film.

It was his way of survival on this earth."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I found Catch me if you can by Frank W. Abagnale not funny as much as it was amusing to read. The book depicts the life of a thief in a way that allows the readers to think that being a criminal is not a crime, but rather it's just a temporary fun. This book seems so unrealistic that while reading the book, I kept asking myself the genre of the novel. Difficult tests like passing the bar exam and flying a plane that people study tremendously to pass seem so easy and almost made it seem like education was unnecessary. Frank W. Abagnale passed the bar exam, became a teacher, and became a medical practitioner all with a high school education. This book mocks the people who overachieve by trying too hard.Catch me if you can is a casual, easy reading book that will cause the readers to begin thinking about living the life of Frank W. Abagnale, which should never be tried since lot has changed since the sixties.Anyone who wishes to be a crook, this will be a guideline to anyone who wants to be a crook and a taste of reality for all those overachievers.This man is truly a hero to all criminals in the world."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"In reading this book, it is almost unbelievable to think that these events actually took place.Frank W. Abagnale is a high school drop out whose parent's divorce affected him deeply. As a result, he set off on a crime spree that is astounding by any measure.Over the course of a few years he cashed millions of dollars in bad checks in every state in the US and in 26 countries while posing as an airline pilot (even taking the controls once), a doctor (working at a hospital for a year), and a lawyer(working at the Attorney Generals office). AND the most unbelievable part is that this all happened BEFORE HE TURNED 22!!Mr. Abagnale's schemes are nothing new, but his approach is what made him successful. He confidence and unthinkable brazenness made him a cult figure among con-men.Read this book now! It is an easy read and you probably can finish it in a few hours. Then, stay tuned for the movie with Leo DiCaprio playing Mr. Abagnale and Steven Speilberg directing. It is sure to be a good one!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a flat and ultimately boring tale - incidentally, devoid of &quot;fun,&quot; despite its subtitle - that promises much more than it delivers. Abagnale's compulsive lying, the felonies it engendered, and the numerous women he met but never really seems to have known begs the question, &quot;How did he get that way?&quot; One would hope that the author would have wondered, too. One might assume that there was some terrible deficit somewhere in his early life. Unfortunately there is no introspection in this story, and no self-awareness, either.An autobiographical portrayal that, finally, allows the reader to think of Austin Powers as a deep, sensitive, and complex man. In addition, it's an unintentional catalogue, whether factual or not, of just how much a reasonably clever, ambitious, well-spoken, well-dressed middle-class white American male, intending to do harm, could get away with - albeit before Interpol. Depressing stuff."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Abagnale's a swindler, all right. If you paid good money to buy this book, he's swindled you out of it.Times and dates don't add up, for one thing. He contradicts himself, for another. It's readily apparent that this guy writes fiction, and even THAT'S not particularly readable.Watch paint dry instead."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"When you start reading Frank W. Abagnale's thrilling autobiography, it is hard to believe the events actually happened. But indeed they did. Typically, an autobiography will contain many slow narratives that are rather dull.Abagnale is anything but dull. Born with an IQ clearly higher than the average man, he always was focused on getting around the rules--first, with his dad's credit card. It is clear that the beginning stages of his life of crime started when he was able to successfully get away with small infractions such as these. Later, Abagnale would resort to check fraud, and due to the lax restrictions on checks, get away with it. An ample lesson to banks and security experts: always try to think of every possible scenario because someone will exploit the situation.The fact that he was able to get onto airlines, without paying, and sit in the cockpit is a sign that there have been many loopholes in our national airline security for quite some time. Now, Abagnale is no terrorist, but as the book explains, this still does not excuse the airlines for allowing mistakes of this sort to go through. It shows the incompetence of our bureacracies and that little has been done since this book has come off the press.Even more ironic, and perhaps most damning to professors in our \\"higher learning\\" institutions, is that he was able to be a professor and gain wide recognition from the students. This is an indication that our professors really don't have any special expertise and merely read and paraprase what they are told. This is a damaging book to all those in authority--it a sign that one single individual, with a mission, is able to exploit the weakneseses out of our collective incompetence and stupidity. Yet, of course there is a consequence for the individual who engangse in these acts.The French apparently have lousy prison systems, a surprise considering their typical weak image. Perhaps that is just hypocritical of our \\"friends\\" the French. But, I knew that Sweden's prison system had to be pretty much like a hotel. Look at the country: considering that Sweden is one large welfare state, it made sense that it would extend to the prison suite, too.There was a lot of thought placed into this book. When reading it, you can almost feel the FBI agents running to finally catch Abagnale. . . and when they do, it's quite ironic how they let him get away--yet again.I am glad, however, that Abagnale is a productive member of our society and is providing security information to private companies and the federal government. It takes a person who had lived such a life to help us solve today's incredible crimes.Michael Gordon"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A decent read but not long enough or detailed enough. It would have been nice to have had a pic of the guy during the period just so the reader could envision him and seek out the flaws. Frank is personable because he takes bold actions in performing his scams- (while the rest of us think about them but don't carry them out).I am always in awe of con men because they pick up on things readily visible to them, but not so apparent to the average Frank. They take these very simple observations and build up some ingenious plan that works for them (for a while anyway), in order to get money, trips around the world, and lots of chicks without a clue. Just about anyone associated with a con man-in-action ends up looking in the mirror and discovering just how stupid and gullible they are or were.Of course, to get the most out of this book, follow up with The Art of the Steal, just to glimpse simple things we all overlook. Cons and fraud, like the prophecies in the bible, they are hard to see in current or future actions, but are plain as day when looking back. So don't get too riled up when you get involved with one- just use it as experience"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I really liked the movie, and when i heard he wrote a book i wanted to read it. I would have rated a 5, but at some parts he continues on too much. Overall, if you liked the movie, your gonna like this book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"There's enough chauvinism in Frank Abagnale's criminal memoir to make you think it has to be true, because no editor would let that fly in a work of fiction. Abagnale is quick to admit that his primary motivation for getting into the check-scamming business (which began as a small time bit of credit-card fraud) was getting tail. But if life is unfair to women in this book, it's just as unfair to criminals, business-people, and ultimately to Frank Abagnale.In fact, \\"life's not fair\\" is a recurring theme, provided that you accept \\"unfairness\\" as equal parts favorable and unfavorable. Abagnale's early escapades are fueled as much by unbelievably good luck as they are by his unflappable charm, bravado, and guile. While his primary scam involved being a pilot who didn't have to fly, he also stumbled into three legitimate jobs--albiet on false credentials--first as a doctor who didn't have to practice medicine, then as a lawyer who didn't have to practice law, and finally as a professor who DID have to teach, but who didn't have to know the material especially well. But his fortune would soon change, as at the end of his five year crime spree, he couldn't hole up anywhere in the US or Europe without being recognized. Then his luck gets even worse.Abagnale's recounting of his nightmarish stint in a French prison almost redeemed the nonchalance of his playboy lawlessness. And make no mistake, this is a book of self-aggrandizement. Despite that, it is a highly addictive read--Abagnale is as charming on paper as he must have been in person. You can't help but smile at some of the stunts he gets away with, although I was mortified at his tenure as a pediatrician (that may just be the new father in me). Still, for all the womanizing and bamboozling, CMIYC is the story of a dumb kid who was too smart for his own good, who started a scam as a lark but found himself painted into a corner with no way out but to keep going before he finally hit bottom. While his antics are infuriating, you still want to cheer him on.A note on the Kindle edition: it's a tad overpriced, given its length. Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Loved the movie. the book is so much more detailed as to how smart thi skid is--simply amazing. And to think, that these days, a majority of theft deterents on checks, and american money--are invented by him."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I just finished reading Catch Me If You Can: The True Story of a Real Fake written by Frank W. Abagnale with Stan Redding and let me tell you, it is a wild ride that you will not want to stop reading about. This is the true story of Frank Abagnale and how he posed as a PanAm airline co-pilot, pediatrician, lawyer, and a college professor to \\"paper\\" the world with bad checks and making a small fortune of over 2 million dollars. He went by several alias for each escapade and was always one step ahead of law-enforcement. Abagnale writes this story from his point of view with a fun and witty tale that allows you to feel as if you are there with him running his scams.Abagnale explains how he learned the art of \\"paper hanging\\" and the way he was able to impersonate a PanAm co-pilot so well. He was even able to \\"hire\\" a group of college girls to travel Europe with him doing a photo shoot for PanAm PR where they were to be flight attendants showing the new PanAm. Abagnale also portrayed a pediatrician on leave during a cool down period from his co-pilot escapades. During this time, fate dropped a real pediatrician into his life and he eventually found himself working the night shift at the hospital as a resident supervisor. He maintained this charade until he realized the danger he was putting those around him in so he left, moving on to other situations as they became available. The other two major roles he played was a Sociology professor at a college in Utah and he also passed the bar exam (with false credentials of course) to work in the Attorney General's office.Abagnale was captured in France while things cooled down and put into the infamous Perpignan French prison for 6-months where he nearly died from the treatment he received. There were a huge line of countries waiting to get their hands on Abagnale for his \\"paper hanging\\" around the world but Sweden was the next country to get him. The prison system in Sweden was a luxury stay for Abagnale but he was set to be extradited to the United States next and he knew he could not go to prison there either. His on-the-run escapes are ingenious and his ability to become another person are what makes this a page turner from the beginning to the end.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a great story that brings you into the author's world to share in his experience. Abagnale is now a consultant advising companies and governments on check fraud as well as embezzlement and document forgery. His life is a great example of being able to take what was wrong in your life and turning it to help others while making an honest living."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I read Catch Me If You Can on audiobook because it was narrated by Barry Whitener, who gave the greatest oral performance I have ever heard in A Confederacy of Dunces. Whitener's affected, playful narration lends the requisite sense of farce to Frank Abagnale's constant posturing as credentialed professionals (doctor, professor, pilot, etc.). Whitener also capably plays the accents of French and Swedish authorities.As for the book itself, it moves very fast, and it is laugh-out-loud funny. This guy had people eating out of his palm not a minute after introducing himself. Nobody could escape his charm. For example, while posing as a security guard to rob a bank, he is accosted by two police officers, and he solicits their help in helping load the loot into his car! That is just one of many examples of Abagnale's preternatural self-confidence and social genius.The comedy is balanced by Abagnale's apparent desire to settle down. He can't, though, because he's addicted to conning people, and he's pursued by authorities if he runs his scams for too long in one place. The 6 awful months he spent in a French prison was a surprise. The audiobook ends suddenly with him breaking out of an American prison by pretending to be an undercover prison inspector. Yes, you read that right.I only wish the audiobook included more of his post-criminal career."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Excellent book.

I have no idea. One thing that I do know to be true is that this guy can SPIN A YARN. What a fun read. Does he exaggerate? Yes, probably. Does he use sexist language? Sometimes, but I'll admit that I giggle when a guy calls me \\"babe,\\" so who am I to judge this author? Does he outright lie? Maybe, but who can tell? If you're looking for a fun read and you enjoyed watching the movie, go ahead and get this book. If he did make it all up, then I'm pretty impressed with his nuttiness. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"As to the writing: it's reasonably well-written, though the constant use of cute alliterative phrases wears. But at the end I wondered, how much of this is true?Wikipedia doesn't have a definitive answer:\\"The authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits were questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that 'Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.'\\"In 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part 'I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.'\\"So I recommend the reader enjoy the story as historical fiction. Even if half his exploits in the book are true, it's still an astonishing tale of the expert con. More importantly to me, I can see how in everyday life--in the workplace, politicians, etc--the confidant talker always gets ahead of the shyer guy or gal who actually knows what the heck is going on. The USA at this time suffers from a crisis of leadership at all levels in all arenas, as we the people rush to follow the smooth talkers, ignoring the quiet facts."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"No doubt Abagnale's bold schemes are intriguing but he spends way too much time emphasizing his sexual conquests. Other than that Abagnale spins an amusing tale. Although it starts to get repetitive after a while (write bad checks and run). However, the final fifty pages are compelling leading into the conclusion."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Author Frank W. Abagnale was a crook, thief, liar and a con artist. He made counterfit checks, money and several personalities. Eventually, he was caught, served time and has made ammends. This is a great story - it is funny, exciting, and you can't help but root for the bad guy. Part of what makes this so amazing is how young he was when all of this happened. Faking being a pilot? Doctor? Lawyer? He does all of that and more.It's easy, fast reading. Perfect for a day at the beach. The movie was also excellent and very faithful to the book. It's hard to make a criminal appealing, but this book succeeds. My kids introduced it to me - they had to read it for a High School class, they both liked it as well.This book is a classic case of \\"you can't make that up\\" no one would believe it. Since it's true, it is all the more entertaining. Highly recommended for those who like capers, crime stories, bad guys turned good with a little spice and humor tossed it, borrow the book, see the movie, you can't go wrong with either."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not believe any of it. How could a 16 year old pull off all these scams posing successfully as an airline pilot, lawyer, doctor, and FBI agent. Only in Hollywood! I had to read the book to uncover the truth. To my amazement, almost nothing in the movie was dramatized. Frank Abagnale did it all. And, this even includes the acrobatic escape from a commercial plane as it lands.The book depicts a far richer story than the movie. At the start, the family situation is more complex. The scams are more intricate. The career path is more extraordinary. The movie skipped over interesting jobs, including a stint as a college sociology teacher.Also amazing is that this teenager acquired far more knowledge about the meaning of every single digit on a personal check than any banker I know. And, I know, having been engaged in banking and finance for over two decades.Frank's character development make the whole story more likely. Frank was not your regular 16 year old dude. At 16, he could easily pass for a fit 25 year old. He was 6 feet tall, 170 pounds. He also acquired quite a real world education by hanging out with his Dad. His Dad exposed him to political, business, and social circles that teenagers do not know. Thus, Frank Abagnale, being a keen observer, learned quickly how adults behave among themselves.Frank was also strikingly handsome, and confident. So, the story includes many romantic interludes. This aspect of life is described most tastefully. There is nothing graphic here. And, it does not detract from the story. To the contrary, women were a key element in this scammer's education. They were often insiders to the professions he attempted to fake.There are a lot of close calls, where you feel Abagnale's cover is going to peel off for good. But, invariably he recovers elegantly from what appears like desperate situations.In the last part of the book things finally go south. But, it is still fascinating. You learn about the awful prison standards and jail terms in France and Italy. You also find out how Sweden treats their own incarcerated people so much better.In the Afterword & Q & A section, you are relieved that everything turned out well for this likable Robin hood like figure. He now leads a very successful life as a corporate consultant on fraud, happily married with kids. Hard to believe but true."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"One can't help but be impressed by Frank Abagnale's resourcefulness at such a tender age. At the age of sixteen he manages to forge a pilot's license and \\"deadhead\\" his way around the country bouncing checks. He also passes himself off as an pediatrician, a college professor, and an assistant district attorney. The last is probably his most impressive exploit, as he passes the bar exam (on his third try) with only two years of high school.After years of exploiting the gullibility of bank tellers and airline clerks, Abagnale is finally captured in France, where he spends six hellacious months in a Devil's Island of a prison. He is then transferred to a Swedish prison, a one hundred and eighty degrees difference, more like a college dorm than a prison. He could've spent the rest of his life being handed from one European penal system to another, some of them vying for brutality with France, but he is saved by a Swedish judge who extradites him to the U.S. Back home, he escapes from apprehension at the airport and from prison later, embarrassing the F.B.I. and his nemesis agent O'Reilly. But, by then, just about every law enforcement official in America is on the lookout for him. He is ultimately captured and does four years jail time, only to emerge once more smelling like a rose. After a few years bouncing around doing such scut work as managing a grocery store and a pizza joint, he convinces a bank manager to let him give a lecture to his employees on how to spot a \\"paperhanger.\\" From there, he's referred to another bank and another and so on. These days he teaches at the F.B.I Academy.There is a brief question and answer section at the end of the book in which Abagnale decries the leniency of our American penal system; surprisingly, he prefers the French method, which reminded me a lot of the dungeons in THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO. Also, don't expect to see much of Agent O'Reilly. This is a first person account for the most part, with only an occasional reference to the F.B.I. agent's dogged determination."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is Frank Abagnale's account of his life as a con man. His book is thrilling, incredible, and true. When he was 16, Frank's parents separated and he ran away to New York City. Frank, armed with supreme confidence, charm, and intelligence, successfully posed as an airline pilot, attorney (he even passed the bar!), a physician, and a college professor, while living the good life with millions of dollars he got from passing bad checks in over 20 countries; and all of this before he was twenty-one years of age.Frank's wild exploits are told in a humerous, quick-paced style that is very readable. The joy he found in living the high life and romancing countless ladies around the world is matched by the the utter despair he faced in a brutal French prison where he was entombed in solitary confinement for months.It's clear that Frank knew he was doing wrong, but was so addicted to the high he got from conning that he didn't want to stop. Frank is now a respected authority on counterfeiting and, in fact, teaches at the FBI Academy. This is a very exciting book!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Saw (and bought) the movie then had to find out what was true and what were Hollywood embellishments... so I quickly ordered the book.I was absolutely amazed that the real story of Mr. Abagnale's &quot;escapades&quot; were even more cleaver and brazen than in the movie. To think that this kid was able to convince people that he was a pilot for a major airline, a pediatrician, a lawyer (who actually passed the BAR exam without ever taking even one course in law school!), and a college professor... not to mention the most prolific bum check artist that ever lived!!!You can read many reviews here that condemn Mr. Abagnale's actions and feel that he glamorizes theft and deception. But even young Abagnale had a sense of morality, albeit a bit skewed. He would not allow himself to swindle the common man or take money from anyone who could not afford the hit.Upon maturity (and after doing some hard time) he found that he could use his talents and knowledge to help educate and protect the very same companies and institutions from being defrauded by other would-be &quot;Frank Abagnales&quot;. There is little doubt that his expertise in this area and his willingness to share his knowledge with them has saved these companies billions of dollars. So if you really think about it, the banks and corporations that he conned actually just paid into a scholarship fund for someone who, down the road, went to work for them! Alas, poor Pan Am paid the bulk of his tuition.This is a brilliant, brilliant book...I simply could not put it down. It is very well written and extremely entertaining. It is simply incredible that this is not a work of fiction... everything can be verified. The best book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I used to have a copy of the original 1980 edition of Abagnale's book, and lost a good friend several years ago when he skipped town with it. I've been waiting for the re-release anxiously.You might expect it to be hard to root for someone with multiple felony convictions to get away with it. In fact, Abagnale's story is so interesting and so funny that you can't help but like him. This is reinforced by the fact that he seems to have so much fun with it himself, often playing up a role more than he strictly needs to, with hilarious results.This book is terrific. There are no slack moments, no dull episodes, and some of them are outstanding (the time when he poses as a pediatrician and has to feign medical knowledge is perhaps the funniest thing I've ever read, followed closely by his attempt to pass himself off as an assistant attorney general). The fact that Abagnale has come clean and now works on the right side of the law is just one more reason to buy and read this tremendous book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I'm conflicted. I saw the movie before reading this book. Having seen the movie, I find objectivity impossible.Frank Abagnale tells of his adventures living the life of James Bond without the killing, using his wits and charm to get what he wants. It is romanticized, but plausible.Do I advise you to read the book first so as to avoid the skew of injecting Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio? You know the successful movie. It is hard not to hear DiCaprio's voice while reading Frank's dialogue. Because the movie has such skilled actors and good editing, it comes across tightly and exciting.Do I instead advise you to watch the movie first because it will be easier to imagine the details of check fraud production? The book is not well-edited, and suffers from mediocre writing, and any help moving it along will help.The book is less fun than the movie. There is much more to absorb, more details to consider, and more of Abagnale in the story. His ego plays heavily into the text, and this gets old. His story does not end with this book, but additional chapters haven't been included.How true is it all? Who can say? Some of it is verifiable, but Abagnale was, in many cases, the only one there. He fabricated so much of his existence, knowing when it is the truth and when it is storytelling is impossible. To enjoy the book, the reader must take the author at his word.The parental drive Frank wants from Carl feels less evident, missing the sensitive looks and words as played in the movie by Hanks and DiCaprio.In reading other 'how I lived as a criminal' books by cons like Jack 'Murph the Surf' Murphy, I have had to remember writing skill isn't why they are authors. It is proficiency in thievery, conning, or some other great misdeed. The movie fooled me into believing this book would be different. However, just like Murphy, Abagnale is a man whose life is redeemed. The book doesn't cover this.There is something oddly heroic about a guy who has managed to fool a lot of people just by pretending. While applauding Abagnale's crimes are wrong, his ingenuity is amazing. He was good enough for the government to cut a deal with him. That's Tom Sawyer with more pluck and style. We wish were that smart and suave. This creates morality layers, but a book worth reading and thinking about.Read \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" then see the movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"What I find entertaining about stories of con-men are the cleverness or detail in their frauds. Abagnale's scams are all the same--passing bad checks. He occasionally does something a little clever--his printing of checks, his social engineering, his narrow escapes, and his escapade with the UofA coeds--but for the most part it's the same routine, over and over. I was hoping to see some more variety. Kevin Mitnick's book _The Art of Deception_ is more entertaining than this, as well as having much more practical value. I also recommend the David Mamet film _House of Games_, _The Spanish Prisoner_, and the books on con games by Victor Santoro, Chuck Whitlock, and M. Allen Henderson over this one."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Highly entertaining--I read this one in one gulp. What Frank Abagnale, aka Frank Williams, Frank Adams (etc.) managed to pull off in a short time was nothing short of amazing. Forgery, counterfeiting, impersonating a pilot, doctor AND lawyer, and even a bank heist, thrown in for good measure. I swear that while I was reading the book, I could have been easily convinced to quit my legal job and run a few scams. It isn't so much the lifestyle that draws you in--expensive clothes, money lying around--it's that you really want to be that clever. The money was always incidental to him; he would get his thrills by outsmarting people. You get vicarious thrills reading about it.The book does have its sobering moments, such as his description of serving time in a French jail. Another negative: his incredible arrogance, especially in his dealings with, and depictions of, women--it was overkill to keep referring to his (over-)active libido and reminding us that he had women in every port that he used without thought to their feelings. My impression was that he was (or is) unrepentent about using them, as if he thought they were complicit in his deception by their ignorance.Nonetheless, a hilarious, fast-paced, morally ambiguous tale that will leave you rooting for a not-so-bad guy and wondering: Could I really do that?"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"After watching and loving the movie, I absolutely had to read the book! I knew the book was written 20+ years ago, and is a true crime/memoir, so I had to know -- was everything in the movie true or were parts added to give it that Hollywood excitement? The tricks and scams pulled in the movie were so unbelieveable. So imagine my surprise...Frank Abagnale, Jr. is most likely the smartest, most brilliant con man that ever lived. How he duped as many people as he did is beyond me. But he did it -- over and over and over again. It all begins when Frank's father gives him his first car at age 16 and all the female attention he receives as a result. Spending money on the ladies is his new hobby and forging checks and pulling scams is how he does it. And from that point on, the journey only gets more twisted and wild.It is quite obvious throughout the pages of this book that Frank is rather pleased with himself and all he's gotten away with. Catch Me If You Can is truly a fun book to read, especially knowing that it is all true despite its high &quot;unbelieveability&quot; quotient. Frank Abagnale Jr. was one heck of a gutsy kid, and the ride on which readers are taken is full of surprises and mouth-gaping astonishment. A real whirlwind of a read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I bought this book for the subway ride, but I've had to restrain myself from reading it on lunch breaks and at night.

Sure, author Frank Abagnale isn't afraid to blow his own horn or relate his prowess with women, but as he says on the opening page, &quot;Modesty isn't one of my virtues...virtue isn't one of my virtues.&quot; My husband read this in two sittings, and then proceeded to talk about it for an entire week - so I read it, too. It's full of wit, thrills, and shenanigans that you just can't believe Frank thought up or pulled off - but he did. My only regret? That the book didn't add any postscript - how he went from being a 21 year old criminal to the man he is today.

FOR YOUR TESTIMONIAL OF TRAVEL AND INTRIGUE, I LOVE IT!!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank W. Abagnale was an audacious New York teenager, who netted several million dollars and prison terms in several countries, from his unbelievable fraudulent lifestyle in the 1960's. Abagnale impersonated a lawyer, doctor, pilot, and a college professor, while traveling the world writing bad checks. This book was first published in the 1980's after Johnny Carson told Frank that he should write a book. The story became a movie last year and the book has been re-released.I recommend this book highly. True it is a bit dated and not particularly well written, but the stories will mesmerize you. I read it almost without stopping. There is a lot more and less to this story than the movie shows. The time in the French prison under inhumane conditions is a riveting read which never made it to the movie. After being captured in France, Abagnale was imprisoned in Perpignan for six months, without the benefit of a bed, clothing, or a toilet. Upon his release, he was extradited to Sweden, found guilty there and spent another six months in prison, albeit more like a country club. Then a Swedish judge finds a loophole in the law to allow Abagnale to return to face charges in the US, rather than spending the next 20 years in a succession of European courts and prisons. Criminals should learn to hideout in countries where they have committed no crimes, especially ones without extradition treaties with the US.The movie also took a lot of liberty with other events, mostly to build up the Tom Hanks character, but none of that really mattered. The real issue with the movie (and to a lesser extent, the book) was that it does not bring out Abagnale's motivation. Abagnale claims that he was suffering from raging hormones and pursued his travels and theft to meet exotic women. This is clearly one reason, but it is also clear that he enjoys the risk and the danger. At times, some of the risk-taking seems crazy, like attending a party in the same neighborhood of a previous victime and impersonating an FBI agent to take possession of a bad check. One almost thinks he wanted to get caught.Abagnale spends just the right amount of ink on his exploits. One doesnot need to know every nuance of banking in the 1960's, but the explanation of the unique \\"routing number\\" scam he developed is interesting."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"We've got a con man telling us all the amazing things he did before he was old enough to drink- passing as a pilot, a college professor, passing the bar exam without ever finishing high school, living off bad checks and not missing his family for the several years he was off in Europe swindling everyone he could there. What are we to believe? I don't know any sixteen year olds with the wherewithal to keep a pile successful exploits like this secret.I'd really be interested in knowing if French prisons (were/are) really like this. Abagnale claims he spend 6 months in complete and utter darkness, naked, sleeping on a stone floor, using a bucket for waste that was only emptied every month or so.Who knows? I haven't seen the movie, and maybe it's a good one. But is it true? I have no idea. This is a con man, after all.

He went right back to scamming people. I know he is supposed to be some sort of Anti-Hero, but that just doesn't work for me. He comes across more as an arrogant jerk than an anti-hero. I just could not bring myself to root for him in anyway. The only reason I finished the book is because I was on a long flight, and had nothing else to read.

It just felt like he was a very insecure person, he needed to reiterate time and again how tall he was, how handsome he was, and how much he scored. But, he was a criminal, and most criminals are insecure. The movie I give 5 stars, it is very different from the book.

But, as the author reveals in an interview at the end of the book, the film is not completely accurate and is \\"Hollywoodized\\" in certain scenes.

It is a great first person account of the con artist. It also re-teaches an old lesson. Audacity is almost always taken for authority.Abagnale learned at a very young age that honest people do not usually expect to be taken advantage of by someone who is dressed well and is articulate. He used his good looks and air of confidence to do things that seem and should be impossible.Catch me if you can is a book that is very difficult to put down.

As I read this book, I could not help but notice little things that created some doubt as to whether I was reading fiction, or non-fiction. Either way, it was an interesting read.However, as someone quite familiar with imposters, law enforcement and the Air Lines. (Sounds like I'm making this up too!) First of all, pilots speak pilot speak. It doesn't take me long to figure out when a private pilot is given to exageration. Or when someone claims to be a former military pilot, and the the questions arise; what branch, what class, etc. In a nation of 300,000+, commercial and military pilots are a small fraternity. Smaller than Doctors, lawyers or college profs. Perhaps not as small as sucessful writers.Although I was never an airline pilot, due to my professional duties, I have sat on the jump seat a number of times. Pilots do not like strangers sitting in the jump seat. That is where the FAA,company check pilots and relatively few others ride. As someone who has sat in the jump seat, questions begin to fly by the crew as they attempt to determine the status of the person in the jump seat. Pilots are generally as a class heads up individuals. I found it highly unlikely that a young non-pilot could learn all that he would need to know by just asking or reading about flying. But then again, spotting fakes was part of my job, and I found them practing medine, law and even elected officials who were wanted by the law somewhere.While it is true that in my 40 years of flying, no FAA examiner ever asked to see my license, my credibility as a pilot, by other pilots was often tested. Pilots are a proud lot, who love having all the ratings available. From pivate pilot to Airline Transport, and in the miltary instructor and test pilot. In order to fly for the airlines, there are too few schools, Embry Riddle being one, and only a few thousand pilots are trained by the military each year.If only the author had mentioned Fred Demara. He was a real fake. Tony Curtis played him in a movie made in the 50's. Did Abagnal get the idea from him?"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released).While not as flowing as the movie, the story told in this book seems much more realistic and true too life, containing many of Abagnale's earlier mistakes & lessons we don't get to see in the movie. On the other hand, many parts of it do seem to be missing - such as why Air France would take such an interest in catching Frank, even though the airlines he was cheating seemed to be mostly American based?This is an interesting read as a background to the movie, and to those who would like to learn what had inspired many of the movie's major storylines."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale can teach us a lot about human nature.this book is quite interesting.but one never really understands what made abagnale tick."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank W. Abagnale's true crime/memoir book tells the story of a lost time when people were more trusting, and airlines that actually first-class. Abagnale bilked various banks out of about 2.5 million dollars in his crime career, told basically unapologitically by the man himself. It is interesting to see how the young man gets himself out the various jams he gets in, but the reader also winces because he feels that Abagnale wrecklessly disregards the consequences of impersonating pilots or doctors, and it is felt that Abagnale is lucky that no one died from his crimes. It's ok, but it's quite forgetable"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"\\"Catch Me If You Can\\" is a surprisingly depressing tale. Due to the relative popularity of the movie, many know the plot: A young high school dropout, Frank Abagnale, far \\"older\\", wiser and street smart than his years impersonates a pilot of the dearly departed Pan American Airways. An expert, self -taught identity forger and con man par excellence he uses his fake Pan Am ID as a base to cash millions of dollars in phony checks. He goes on to impersonate a phony pediatrician, fake college professor and pseudo lawyer. I may have left a phony profession out. Whatever it was, Mr. Abegnale is a fraud. If he were a happy go lucky fellow or at least an average but desperate nice guy, a reader could route for or identify with him. But since almost no one has his absurdly high level of cunning and conning, what is there to identify with? He came across as a miserable, unhappy guy, always one step ahead of the law. In the interests of never revealing an ending, all this reviewer can report is that Abegnale is fingered in France by a former flight attendant. Does he repay his debt to several societies around the world? Read \\"CMIYC\\" and find out but not on this recommendation. Some guys are just too slick and too quick and too cool for their own good. The main character of \\"CMIYC\\" is one of them."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I'm old enough to remember this story from when it came around for the first time, about a bazillion years ago.

This guy, obviously loaded with charm, guts, and savy aplenty, was probably the biggest swindler and impersonater the world has ever known. He passed himself off as a doctor, a pilot, a professor, and a lawyer, all on the basis of a glib tongue, a demeanor that inspired trust, and a 10th grade education!Now totally reformed and earning a great living helping to catch people such as he used to be, he's still as charming as ever.Talk about a con artist.

We humans certainly are perverse creatures. Everybody hates being swindled, but at the same time we seem to love a good tale of grift. I don't know if this is a pack of lies or the honest-to-God truth, but it's a great read either way. There are numerous technical details that require familiarity, so if Abagnale made up the story, he sure did his homework. And if he didn't make it up, wow, what brass you-know-whats.Unlike a few reviewers, I liked everything about the book: the swagger, the dry humor, the dated, slightly un-P.C. language, the technical tidbits, and, of course, the outrageous chutzpah. The cocky attitude fits the story perfectly. After all, this is a kid who grew up in the Bronx during the 1950s, not David Niven.But I am curious how I'm going to like Leonardo DiCaprio in the role.

No, truly, read this book\\"-Tom HanksNo one said it better than acclaimed actor Tom Hanks. Catch Me If You Can is one of the most entertaining books of the twentieth century. Never before have I read a book where I laughed so hard. Abagnale successfully mixes comedy with action to hook the reader from beginning to end.The book starts with Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., a 16 year old boy in a pretty well off family. However, his mother leaves his father and takes the kids with her. Franks feels sorry for his lonely father, so he moves in with him. Within a few months, Frank has already stole $3,400 from different gas stations. As soon as he \\"earns\\" enough money, Frank moves out and enters the real world.The rest of the book deals with Frank's (or \\"Robert's\\") hilarious stints as a pilot, lawyer, doctor, FBI agent, and college professor. What makes the book even funnier, is the amount of money he steals and the people he encounters.I read this book as often as possible and never get bored of it. The only problem with the book is towards the end, which gets kind of depressing. However, overall, this is the greatest book I have ever read and hope that Abagnale's other book is just as good."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"The idea of an ex con artist telling his story intrigued me...until about the 3rd page. This guy is an imposter in every sense of the word, and his biggest con is getting people to spend money on this book. (There's going to be a movie??? Even worse). I erroneously expected there to be even a light undertone of remorse, now that he has supposedly been rehabilitated and makes his money &quot;legitimately&quot;. Abagnale comes across as a sociopath with no discernible conscience regarding his past actions.His stories ARE fascinating, not because of his cleverness, but because of his audacity. This is what enables him to get away with his cons. But I found them difficult reading, because his egomaniacal personality gets in the way. This is a guy that refers to women as &quot;broads&quot; and &quot;foxes&quot;. Every thing he says and does results in people melting in his hands like butter, and smiling broadly at the opportunity. Equally astonishing is his persistent bragging that he never took advantage of individuals, only banks and corporations.I won't go so far as to tell you not to read this book, most people will find his stories, if not him, amusing.

However, I felt that the book ended prematurely. It would have felt more complete had he described some of what happened after the supposed end of the book. How did he change?

Unlike recent cameos of a winsome actress caught shoplifting or of a Hollywood \\"bagel-baby\\" producer caught forging the signature of a granite-jawed actor on a personal check, the reader of Catch Me if You Can is treated to snapshots of the protagonist - a high-school dropout - passing a southern state's bar examination and appointed an assistant attorney general, awarded a license to practice medicine in the state of Georgia, hired as a university professor of sociology in Utah, handed the controls of a 707, hiring coeds to model Pan Am uniforms throughout Europe.

Her brassiere was too small.\\" But the escape artist's \\"luck\\" also has a dark side: arrested and thrown into a dungeon in Perpignan, France; fed only bread, gruel, and water; never permitted to bathe, shave, or attend to other personal hygiene; harassed by sadistic guards; and left to rot for six months, he is finally extradited to humane Sweden suffering from severe malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and double pneumonia. After recovering for six months, he is saved from extradition to Italy and then Spain, in whose barbaric prisons he faces certain death, by a compassionate judge who orders him deported to the U.S., whence, once he has served an additional four years' sentence, as an American citizen he cannot be extradited, and where he is ultimately rehabilitated and redeemed into a productive, married member of society who specializes in the detection and prevention of fraud."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I realize it was a different world in the 1960's &amp; 1970's, but some of Mr. Abagnale's alleged exploits are, frankly, beyond the realm of credibility.

I knew the outline of Abagnale's story prior to reading, but found the narrative impressive and highly entertaining nonetheless. At the young age of 15, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from his New York home and begins a career of conning, forging, and impersonating. His fake identities include airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and professor, all of which he pulls off in a creative and humorous fashion. Among the descriptions of his various adventures, we learn about Abagnale's insecurities of being a teenager and are reminded of his actual age, an aspect that is easily forgotten amidst his sophisticated escapades. Abagnale also clearly documents throughout the novel his use of women as his only \`vice', as he exercises the same charm and charisma used in his cons as he does in winning over many females. With his eventual capture following many national and international endeavors, his expertise is put to good use. In the book follow-up, we learn that Abagnale spends his time after prison lecturing American companies about fraud protection and teaching at the FBI academy about check fraud.This book can seem lengthy in explanation during some parts and can be occasionally hard to follow. The good definitely outweighs the bad in Catch Me If You Can, however, as Abagnale illustrates an exceptional picture of his life using an honest and detailed writing technique. You can't help but fall for the bad guy in this novel, which I recommend to anyone who is up for an adventurous read!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Check this out. Great for a flight."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"After seeing the film, I decided to read the book. It is really great! As a 15-year-old, Frank Abagnale identified and then proceeded to exploit financial and business systems with huge security chasms. And he did it all by principally relying on people's superficiality and innate trust in the reality of appearances.Time and time again, Abagnale duped banks, airlines, and law enforcement authorities, both in the US and internationally. In the short time from his 15th birthday to his early 20's Abagnale had successfully and repeatedly posed as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and a college professor. In that time, he also managed to seduce a small army of women. Shortly said, he led the kind of glamorous and dangerous outlaw existence that many of us dream of but don't dare to pursue.Abagnale's writing style is direct, vivid, and action-oriented. It is a delight to read his book. (I read the book in just two days.) This is a great - even if illicit - modern adventure story, full of excitement, romance, intrigue, sadness, and fun. I highly recommend this book! (Too bad we'll never hear the stories of even more successful criminals who never got caught!)"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale's story is amazing! Saw the movie and just had to read the book, both were great. If you like this story you will also want to check out The Great Impostor, about another impersonator named Walter DeMara, whose story was made into a movie starring Tony Curtis around 1960 (I wonder if it inspired young Abagnale?) Somehow you can't help but like both of these guys even though what they did was wrong. I was so caught up in the book version of Abagnale's story that its abrupt ending was quite a shock, I wanted to read about his final apprehension, how much time he served, how he came to work for the FBI (even though I'd already seen the movie, it doesn't follow the book in every detail). However, from other peoples' reviews I realize there may be an updated version of the book with some additional Q & A, comments, or an epilogue that is missing from the copy I have. The part where Abagnale describes his experience in French prison, and the fact that it was apparently standard operating procedure for any prisoner in the French prison system in the late 1960's, hopefully not now? is horrble but just gives me another reason to detest France. One thing I loved from the movie was the relationship between Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks' characters and DeCaprio's character, and that they are still friends today is neat, I wish that was also gone into more at the end of the book. I think the film did an excellent job of highlighting or introducing certain aspects that were not really obvious or not there in the book, such as what uniforms and job titles meant to Abagnale, the loneliness he must have felt being out of touch with his family, his desire to 'get it all back' for his dad, his calling O'Relly (Hanks) when the holidays rolled around, his revisiting the family home at Christmas, and the way all three actors gave so much to their parts. There is someting really touching about Walken's gracefully dancing with his wife, Hanks expense account and sandwiches lifestyle (patiently sitting in the laundromat while Abagnale is jet-setting around the world), and DiCaprio's longing as he gazes at the pilot uniform in the store window."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"As a light, trip-through-the-tulips novel, Catch Me could hardly be more entertaining. Settings are great, the chases engaging, and the outcomes outrageous. As a truly informative document, though, this novel leaves a little to be desired. Heavy concentration is on forgeries, a blatantly, overtly illegal act. Much of the other activities described also fall into that category: the airline pilot, the lawyer, the college prof., etc.What America must face is the fact of modern day cons becoming more and more \\"legal.\\" Yes, this trend is proceeding at an alarming pace, making it necessary for everyone among us to be better informed of these developments. For pure education on the subject of schemes, scams, and frauds, as practiced, present-day, Les Henderson's Crimes of Persuasion is second to none.Highly recommended for all \\"fine print\\" detectives, who want to nail down the specifics of how so many cons are carried out."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A highly entertaining and amusing book about a very crafty fellow. Curl up with this book on a rainy Sunday afternoon and enjoy Abagnale's wit and exploits. The revelation about French prisons is shocking. Did anybody say that France is a developed country??? The contrast with the Swedish prison system could not be greater. If you are going to commit a crime in Europe, go north (avoid the Mediterranean countries).

I found the first 60 pages or so a little slow because they were almost identical to the movie (and the DVD documentary) and then things really take off. The book ends abruptly and then finishes Franks story in about 3 more pages with an Afterward. I mean, after reading that whole book and reading this entertaining story I felt a little [cheated]to hurry up and end the book like that. I'm sure there'a a reason but people that go through the effort of reading this should feel [cheated] espcially with a[money amount]price tag. The other reason I gave this only three stars is that the reading is quite easy.

The time he served in a French prison as opposed to his later adventures in Sweden - you can't miss those.Overall, although I certainly disapprove of many of the things Mr. Abagnale did in his life, his account if captivating, and humble in a way.

I hoped that the book would be even better. I was not disappointed. I started reading and was surprised how different his life was from how the movie portrayed it. His family life, his attitude, and his style is so different. One of the best parts of the books is how it is written from his perspective and you feel like you are right there with him as he is making all of he cons.I felt the book did a fair job (From what I understand it's not truly written by Abagnale, but rather someone who used his notes, but I may be wrong) There are times when you are happy for him, when you want him to get caught, and when you just plain feel sorry that this was the life he chose to live. Regardless of how you feel about crime, understanding why he felt he wasn't hurting anyone is a great insight into how people thought about what they were doing.I'd recommend this book to anyone who liked the movie. The movie streamlines and simplifies what are truly some pretty amazing things.It's less than $12 for the Kindle and I'd read it again at least once a year."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can by Frank Abagnale was a thrilling listen as you joined Frank on his exploitive adventures and his daring escapades.

If you liked the movie, you'll love the book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is an excellent novel. For me, the fact that it's a non-fiction tale made it all the more engaging. It's easy to read countless fiction books and, when things are getting interesting or horrifying, you can say \\"it's all make-believe.\\" With this book, you must remind yourself that this really happened. Abagnale really pulled this stuff off at such a young age.The plot seems to be one that most people are familiar with so I won't go into it much, but I will say that it is one of those books where you want the bad guy to succeed at everything he does. This is a solid five-star read and I read it in less than a day. It has stuck with me ever since, especially some of the author's descriptions of foreign prison life, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys lots of words which form a long story. If you are on this site, you should qualify."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"At times hilarious, and at times an edge-of-your-seat page-turner, \\"Catch me if you can\\" is the true story of Frank Abignale, the world's greatest con man.This book was around for decades before the Leo DiCaprio flick. And, as great (and loyal to the book) as that movie was, the book is really more enticing. There are moments in the book that are left out of the movie, for time reasons and what not. But, mostly, the book is fun because it's written by Abignale himself, and his voice is great.Be forewarned, there's a bit too much in the beginning about his parents and childhood; stuff that could have easily been left out and serves no real purpose. But it's a very funny and, at times thrilling, read. The things this guy got away with will leave you shaking your head and laughing the entire time."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I suggest seeing the movie first and then reading this book. The movie and book are very different and the author did even more amazing things that the movie didn't have time to cover. This true story allows the reader to live the vicarious life of a complete scoundrel--and he gets away with it! Sort of. For a while. Now the author has settled down, is in a long-term stable marriage with 4 children. It really is a can't-put-it-down page-turner. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"You don't normally think of true crime books as being funny, as well as entertaining. But this is not your average true crime book, and Frank Abagnale was not your average criminal. I kept thinking that if this kid (most of his crimes were committed while he was still in his teens) had used his ample smarts toward something more societally productive, then he could have made his fortunes legally and avoided the jail stints, including his horrifying 6 months in a French prison. Luckily, he has since turned his life around and is using his expertise on criminal activity toward the betterment of society. You go, Frank!\\""},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I enjoyed the book because of my background in psychology and the criminal mind has never ceased to amaze me. Here you have a man who has played the role of everything from a pilot and pediatrician to a lawyer and sociology teacher. What a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive, and deceive he has! He has swindled, conned and scammed his way to the tune of 2.5 million dollars! Abagnale, by his own admission admits modesty was not one of his virtues. After the reading the book the reader may be thoroughly covinced this man had few, if any, easily recognized virtues. Remorse was certainly not one of them. However, similar in personality to Ted Bundy, who was the typical nice guy next door and a mass murderer, Abagnale was certainly not what he portrayed. His lack of remorse, tells me he has a cunning and calculating mind capable of almost anything. He may have been a high school drop-out but nonetheless a mastermind of deceit, and there can be a very fine line between the mind of a genius and insanity.While the book made for interesting reading, the end was disappointing. It seemed to end in mid-air as if half the story was missing. For this reason, the book lost a star in the rating. Do not let this discourage you from reading the book, it still makes a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Definitely the best true crime book I ever read. Probably because this book is written in the first person by the con artist himself - Frank Abagnale. It is truly an amazing story. His writing come across as very honest, regretful in some places, and not in others. By the end of this book you may find this person one of the most intriguing you ever came across. You will not hate him because of his crimes, but just be left in amazement of the life he has lead."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Some of the brightest minds in the world are criminal---an odd paradox that actually makes sense once you step out of the obvious ethical issues. The first kind of criminal, the common thug, is brutal, violent, classless and often easily caught. The second, the misguided mastermind, is brilliant, creative,committed and nearly impossible to catch. Frank W. Abagnale, Jr. was the epitome of the latter. Frank Abagnale ran away from home when he was sixteen and became very quickly disillusioned by his insatiable appetite for the opposite sex and the lack of opportunities offered to a high school dropout to afford such an expensive addiction. His temporary solution of bouncing checks soon became a one-man international check writing industry. Along the way he was able to pull off some extraordinary feats of genius. He cashed two and one-half million dollars in fraudulent checks in every state and twenty-six foreign countries over a five-year period. Between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one, he successfully posed as a pilot, an assistant attorney general, a college professor and a pediatrician. Apprehended by the French police when he was twenty-one years old, he served time in the French, Swedish and United States of America prison systems. After five years, he was released on the condition that he would help the United States government without remuneration. This is one of the best books I have read. It is an easy read, but full of fun and information. It's a keeper that you will want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"My comments on the title.'Catch Me If You Can,' swallowed my emotions whole. I ached from laughing. I cried. I felt outraged even. Following my own experiences of interviewing prisoners incarcerated in an middle eastern hell hole - compared to Frank Abagnales' barbaric treatment in Perpignan, France, these cockroach infested holding cells were a breeze by comparison. The book should be made compulsory reading for all 2nd level college students. Frank's hilarious escapades left me slackjawed. No one single literary work assaulted my emotions as did 'Catch Me If You Can.'

Very interesting, hard to put down"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a fun and enjoyable read and is easily as good as many current novels. If you like the movie the book will be even more interesting because it goes into detail about Abagnale's exploits. In fact, in many ways the book is actually more interesting than the movie.For example, many movie viewers couldn't figure out how Abagnale escaped an airplane via the bathroom toilet. This actually happened and is described in the book. Abagnale also describes in far more detail the extent to which he researched how to look and act like a real airline pilot. It's mind boggling how much effort he was willing to put into it.Despite how fun it is to read, &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot; has one huge glaring flaw: the ending.We know that Abagnale has worked with the banking industry for many years now in helping them improve their security. What we don't really know, at least from him directly, is how he went from being a swindler to being a high paid consultant. On a psychological level this is the meat of the story. OK, he had a ball being a fake pilot, doctor and lawyer. But what did he learn? Anything? This is where the book falls into the definition of fluff. Because we have no meaning, no explanation, all we're left with are outrageous exploits and escapades.All of this begs the question: Did Abagnale actually learn anything? Or is all of this just a further continuation of the con he started as a kid? I don't know either way. It's too bad because Abagnale likely has a few things to teach us - especially at-risk youth who tend to think they're invincible. Unfortunately, the message Abagnale seems to be giving us is that you CAN get away with it. While that's certainly true (just look at ENRON!), it doesn't help that the author shows so little remorse or an explanation of how he changed."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a great book. In the eighties, when this came out in paperback, I purchased it and read it in less than a week. I looked for my old copy, couldn't find it and then recently purchased a hard cover copy of this book again. It is the same enjoyable read it was in the eighties. For those looking for an enjoyable read, this book is it. The movie pales in comparison to the actual book, since many of the most humorous stories are left out of the movie. One example is the bank deposit box being broken, and please deposit your money with the fake security guard. What a laugh. This should have been put in the movie.Abagnale is a true con and this book is so well written. For a true adventure story that flows smooth, this is a great book. I recommend this book--Five plus stars."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale's story certainly is a fascinating one and although many events can be backed up by the FBI, bank officials, etc., I kept smelling a rat while reading this book. Abagnale admits himself that he could charm just about anyone and I couldn't help thinking there was A LOT of embellishment in this story - possibly even situations that never actually happened - after all - this book WAS written by a con man! One example that comes to mind is when he talks about being in a French prison and sees a strange-looking person with waist length hair he didn't recognize: it turns out he was looking in a mirror. Well, no one grows hair that fast in six months...There are many more situations that will have you wondering about their truth. Still, one assumes the general story is true but don't believe EVERYTHING you read in this book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"...and there was nothing wrong with the film!Although the film was only \`inspired by' the book, perhaps 30% of the book is in the film. With one or two notable exceptions (the relationship between FBI and Abagnale, and Franks con of fellow schoolmates, which is not in the book, and the ending of the film) I found the book to be far more fascinating than the film.From his first con of his father, through his career as paperhanger, cheque swindler and con man, Frank Abagnale at 17 was at the time the youngest of his breed ever. Here he describes how he was able to take advantage of banks, airlines (one of his most successful scams as a co-pilot allowed him to travel throughout the USA and then the rest of the world), hospitals, universities... almost any institution one might care to name. Frank scammed them all, with charm, flair and ingenuity. He was caught occasionally, and if he couldn't talk his way out of it, he could usually escape (not from the French, and he didn't even try with the Swedes). Far from being a hardened criminal, Frank essentially did this to fund adventures with women, much like any teen might want to do. Frank's sheer out and out daring, his intelligence, his ability to lie at the drop of a hat and unrepentantly, and the unorthodox nature of his crimes make for compelling reading. The book does end a little up in the air, but this is resolved by an Afterword.A charming and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Review of this book should not be about approving what Abagnale did. He admits himself being a criminal. If you are offended by such behaviour, please by all means avoid his book. On the other hand, if you are looking for a superb story of someone who has guts, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"All books should be like this, the fact that it's actually true makes it an even better book. Congrats on pulling off such a great scam!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Over the years I've read this book three times and enjoyed it immensely each time. After the first reading I loaned it to a friend who read only a few pages before quitting in disgust. Abagnale certainly does come across as arrogant and boastful. A couple of years ago I searched online bookstores to buy the book and read it again, and I realized that Abagnale may have been a victim himself. Since he was not a writer, his publisher gave the writing assignment to someone named Stan Redding. (A search of Amazon's database shows no other books credited to Redding.) Maybe Abagnale is/was as obnoxious as the book made him seem, but there is also a strong possibility that Redding decided to give him that persona in the book. Read the book and enjoy it for what it is, without judging Abagnale's personality."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"An amazing book which is a good read time and time again. The story of Frank's life on the run is funny, exciting, and full of unexpected twists. Mr. Abagnale writes with a lightness and humor found rarely in today's literature. His unique writing style enhances what could possibly be the greatest true-crime adventure saga of all time. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is carefully crafted into a number of coherent chapters. Within each are a number of stories that flow together smoothly. Mr. Abagnale's story is told, for the most part, chronologically. The tension and excitement build and build to end in an almost unbelieveable twist. This book is a fabulous read. I reccomend it to all."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"If this was fiction, you would find the book interesting.

But something is different in this rerelease. I remember the story ending further along than it did in this version. Also, during each rerelease, there was an update on what Frank was up to. I admit that it is possible that I may be confusing this book for another...but I don't think so.Regardless, this version is still a great read and it was facinating to reread a book whose main character pretty much helped me embrace the larcenous soul that I am. However, I use that side of me for self-preservation..not for victimization. His cunning can be adopted to protect yourself from the cleverest of cons. I wish I could have written the movie script. because with all due respect to the screenwriter, I would do an infinitely better job. But best of luck to the folks making the movie.

He did the crime, and he did the time, and then he turned around to make the world a better place!

Plus, there is a perfect element of heart and soul in his story - a broken home, a delusional kid, an intelligent thief, a horrible experience, etc. I had originally bought this because it has been picked up by a movie studio, and Leo DiCaprio has agreed to play the lead. It has a great movie feel to it.

The book was written well in a genre easy to read2. It is fun to learn about the amazing things that Frank Aagnale, one of his names he had in his lifetime did.(2) weak points of &quot;Catch me if you can&quot;1. To many flashbacks2.

Wish I had good rememberance of that Univ of South Carolina mention somewhere connected with this con-author that Mr Abagnale was once invited to speak at the school but declined. Seems, allegedly, someone there had the goods on him as to veracity of the accounts depicted in book. If not actually scared off, Abagnale is likely a 60's-era con whose exploits and other would hardly pass in todays 2000-era technology. Somehow he must have the gift of gab and front a speaker's bureau to yadda yadda in front of unsuspecting groups which likely wouldn't have the mentality to question Abagnale on anything. Abagnale's laugh is that his con is still on!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale may have committed these crimes but there are too many organizations out there to stop him. The American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE); the Forensic Documents Examiners; The Banking Security Corporation, etc. Faking documents for the Bar Association --- Can he really pass their tests without a high school diploma? That takes the cake and makes me really wonder if he did all these things. Watch out world: do your homework when you want to hire a lawyer.Stiffer sentences worldwide should have been enforced; after-all, PanAm was in international airline and they would have had all the hours he was in the air with them...I have no respect for this crook."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I found Frank W. Abagnale's Catch Me If You Can a book, which kept the reader truly involved. While reading the novel I never wanted to put it down. Abagnale spares no details about his escapades growing up as a teenager during the 60's. He recounts the story of how he went from a high school dropout to the world's most daring con man. Nothing was held back in the description of each plan and how he pulled of the hundreds of robberies. If anyone is interested in passing fake checks they created, this is the book to read. Abagnale goes into detail explaining what each number on a check stands for. All of this information made me wonder if I could pass fake checks I made. It was this thought which led me to this surprise that he was allowed to print all of this information. More enjoyable then the explanations of how to pass fake checks was the descriptions of each encounter between Abagnale and authority. I found it amazing he was able to get past security guards and security systems. Perhaps what I enjoyed most was the fast-pace at which the novel moved. I felt as though I just begun when I reached the last page. In only 277 pages Abagnale held the jobs of a pilot for more than one airline, worked as a lawyer in an office and courtroom, worked in a hospital as a doctor, and taught at a college out west. It is truly amazing what he managed to accomplish without a high school degree. I wish I knew I could do that so I didn't need to finish high school. Maybe he has the right idea. In conclusion, Frank Abagnale accomplished tons by dong very little. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in an amusing story, especially someone hoping to become a criminal anytime soon."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I was the Chairman of the Lecture Comittee of the Student Union of University of SC in 1982.

We asked our area Police to run a &quot;rap sheet&quot; on him. Absolutly nothing showed up on it. According to their records he had never been arrested, served time or had a warrant out for his arrest. On the day of his speech we asked him to sign a simple statement that what he was about to say was true. He refused, cancelled the booking and all other dates booked through colleges.

One thing is clear to me: Abagnale wrote this by himself. The movie is a *much* more enjoyable way to experience the story (there are some differences in the narratives, but I'm in this for entertainment, not research).

My thoughts were that anyone that could get away with such cons must be an interesting read.I spent $15 for the paperback version and feel that I was totally conned. I know that I am in the minority but after reading this book I despised Frank Abagnale and hate myself for spending $15 on his latest con: selling fiction as non-fiction.What really bothers me is how the author and ghost writer have no boundaries of staying close to the truth. A movie, I understand, needs to be captivating because it brings you to fantansy land. The book, well I expect the book to be more in tune with reality.This book is simply Frank Abagnale bragging about how great Frank Abagnale is. Do I believe that he passed bad checks? Yes. But everything else in the book is someone's imagination gone wild to sell books and movie rights.Don't waste your money on this book but if you just have to read it I'll give it to you for free because I see no purpose in saving rubbish."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"reading the book. it reminds me that kids who does not understand \\"accountability\\"this is happening everywhere and still now. parents should be more observant about whether their kids are being accountable to their action. otherwise, they may turns out wrong like frank."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"chris rock.This book was wonderful.

Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds.However, I thought the book was not especially well written. Abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion. I also felt somewhat deprived with the novel's ending. Frank Abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms, but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story. I would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right.All in all, I would recommend this book as an easy weekend read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"At least 12 years ago after hearing Mr. Abagnale's exploits discussed on the radio, I read this book. I've repeatedly encouraged others to read this audacious autobiography. Suffice it to say, the long-awaited movie with DiCaprio and Hanks didn't begin to depict Mr. Abagnale's insanely uninhabited early life. It's unlikely the most illustrious writer of fiction could create such hilarious hijinks and unnerving escapades. Mr. Abagnale's many off-the-cuff impersonations and miraculous escapes were astounding, especially for someone too young to vote!Read the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is a quick read and pretty amazing that this guy was able to do what he did.

Abagnale."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"If you liked the movie version of this semi-autographical breeze of a read, you certainly will enjoy Frank Abagnale Jr's madcap recap of a scant few years of his life starting when he was barely sixteen. Endowed at an early age with a power physique and an attitude to match, Frank has no difficulty in getting people, especially \\"foxy\\" women to believe that he is ten years older. He blames his short life of crime on a perpetual case of spring fever-where ample loads of cash are needed to fuel this heavenly fire. A modern day P.T. Barnum, Frank gives his audience what they crave, cashing bogus checks that he becomes more adept at making as time goes on, while embarking on a spree of impersonations that range from doctor, lawyer, airplane co-pilot to university professor. Even with the full knowledge that crime doesn't pay, the reader cannot help but cheer Frank on as he \\"dead-heads\\" his way across the country and eventually around the world. As his descriptions of his stay in a French prison makes you wonder if any of this free-loading was worthwhile, we commiserate with his dread of being prosecuted by every country in Europe and are pleased when he finally serves his time in the US and actually escapes. Unlike the movie, the book devotes little time to the FBI agent who shares the cinematic spotlight or to the actual dynamics of Frank's family life. In fact, only in the book's afterward is Abagnale's actual present day career of check-fraud expert even mentioned.Recommended to all those who want to shake their heads in wonder at teenaged audacity."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; never fails to keep the reader's attention from beggining to end. It amazes me how Mr. Abagnale was able to mascarade as a pilot, professor, doctor, FBI agent, and a whole slew of other professions without ever being caught.As Mr. Abagnale writes on his web site, this book is not intended to be a biography but a fictionalized account. Thus, some of the details may have been altered and some of the plot may have been dramatized. I would have liked to have known exactly which parts of the book were true and which are fictionalized. But nonetheless, I would highly reccomend reading this fast-paced, exciting book!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I'll admit it. I never would have read this book if it was not for the movie that came out last year. I still haven't seen the movie but decided that perhaps the book would be interesting since it was written by the subject of the movie. I didn't learn until the end of the book (in a Q&amp;A section with the author) that this was written in 1980. Abagnale has a very easy going style and it almost feels like he is right there next to you telling you this wild story of his youth.Catch Me If You Can is an interesting, exciting, fast paced novel that is a pure joy to read. I don't know if I can put it better than that. This was a book that I simply did not want to put down and I flew through the book. The plot of the memoir is the criminal career of Frank Abagnale (he has since paid his debt to society and now works to prevent exactly the sort of crime that he once committed). Frank Abagnale was a con man. He began his career at a young age (15) conning gas station attendants to give him cash when he pays with his father's credit card. The leads to Frank leaving home, moving to New York City and trying to begin an honest life. Unfortunately, Frank's one main vice is women, and to be with women he needs to have more money than a 16 year old high school dropout can earn. So he begins to con.Frank's primary method of conning was passing bad checks. However, he found that it is easier to make the con if he is a member of a well respected profession. Frank researches every role that he plays so that he will be as convincing as humanly possible without actually having to do that job. In some cases, he was able to con so well that he was paid for it and he didn't have to forge checks. The professions that Frank had impersonated were: Pilot, Doctor (he was paid to be on staff but not actually have to practice for nearly a year), Lawyer (he managed to pass the bar on his third try and worked as a laywer despite having no background in law), and a Professor (he taught two summer courses). The reason everything worked so well was that Frank is an extremely smart man and nobody expected this sort of con.As was expected (and as Frank expected), he was eventually caught (and escaped, and was caught again), and part of the book dealt with Frank's ride through the prison systems (France and Sweden play prominent roles).I can't say enough good things about this book. It was so interesting to read and I would recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"A fast read -- perfect for taking on a plane or suffering through a waiting room. I got immersed in the details of Abagnale's cons. He's not your basic criminal: few \\"paper-hangers\\" learn the intricacies of the Federal Reserve system and the complex workings of a major international airline. It was like watching someone solve a giant puzzle.As he says, he was young and it was all a big game to him when he began. As he grew older he realized more of what he was doing, but he had gotten accustomed to the roller coaster ride. And although he did bilk institutions out of a lot of money, he more than repaid his debt by serving as a security consultant. I wish the US Government would heed his advice, presented in an appendix, on dealing with terrorists."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This incredible story is fast paced, well written, and exciting. Despite the fact that this person's activities were totally illegal, he still managed to make the reader feel captivated by him."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. For non-fiction fans, this book is a &quot;Must Read&quot;. The book proves that truth is stranger, and more interesting that fiction. Frank Abagnale is one of the most interesting characters that I have ever read about. His life of deception is truly amazing. He impersonates a commercial airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and more with amazing results. His intelligence and creative thinking keep him one step ahead of the law for years, while he lives the life of a successful professional when, in reality, he is not yet out of his teens. His ability to outwit others is hilarious and scary at the same time. I'm happy that Frank is now a letigitimate financial success and I can't wait to see the new movie based on the book. The movie is scheduled to come out in December, 2001."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"The story pulls you in immediately and moves right along, but you soon become aware that you are actively spending time and money to listen to a liar. This makes you feel like his current sucker. The decsription of banking procedures at that time are interesting, but by the end of the book the complete lack of either introspection or interst in another human being make it all just a long-winded boast. It left me wanting to read an account of the same material written by someone else."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Every time I visit Logan airport in Boston I think of his prank of &quot;Out of Order&quot; on bank night deposit sign and the two state cops who actually help him load the deposits from bank customers into his vehicle--which he drives away scot free--the cops never the wiser! Even in the 1990's I have asked the airport paper &quot;Air Travel Journal&quot; to print this one story. They aparently refuse out of direct control of the Mass Port Authority it seems. Many facets of deceit, trickery and simple ways to con. Doubtful much of what went on in this book could occur today--given computer age we live in. All the best to the author."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"When I first read this book back in 1986 I couldn't put it down. After that I've read it three times, and it's always very entertaining. Mr. Abagnale goes in detail about how he deviced every fraud and also demonstrates in the process that he has an ability for understanding and manipulating human nature, like a biologist looking over mice in a maze. Though many of the things he did then can't be done now because of new security measures established by banks, the fact that he was able to do it is amazing. The movie based on this book by Spielberg is more \\"happy con man\\" than the book was because in the book you can sense that it wasn't all fun and girls, but Abagnale constantly had the stress of being caught in the back of his mind, pulsating like an aneurism about to burst. And there's a chapter in the book about his ordeal in an Italian prison which was very painful for him, mentally and physically. A must read."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I've seen the movie and read the book and I enjoyed both. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the con man of the title being pursued by Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. The book is a true story about a 16 year old New York runaway who leads the FBI and other law enforcement on a 5 year globe trotting escapade of bouncing check, forged payroll checks and life in the fast lane. The author impersonated a Pan American pilot, a pediatric doctor, and an attorney among others. He did this mostly as a teenager who dropped out of high school. Obviously he is not your average drop out, but an intelligent and scheming confidence man. He was more that just a two-bit paper hanger, as he developed techniques using the Federal Routing identification number that had not been used before. After being caught and imprisoned in France, Sweden and United States, Frank Abagnale used his expertise and talents to improve the check banking system, help catch other criminals, work with the FBI, and start his own secure documents corporation. In the back of the book is a question and answer section with the author where he reveals that the movie is 80% accurate. Obvious you can not put a book covering 5 years into a 2+hour movie so some events were altered, and of course some events in the book were omitted from the movie. I give this book my highest recommendation as a fun and enjoyable read. I myself enjoyed all that much more knowing that this is a true story, written by the actual perpetrator, of his exploits as mostly a teenager. Adults as well as teenagers will like this book. This is a an easy read and a fun book to read, I hope you enjoy it as much as me. I'm also planning to read the author's other book, \\"The Art of the Steal\\".Older reades will see some similarities in the true book/movie, \\"The Great Imposter\\" which starred Tony Curtis."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I first read this book about three years ago and I recommend to every serious reader and/or scholar that I come in contact with. This is simply an amazing book that will keep you up all night reading, wanting to find out what happens next.This is the true story of Frank Abagnale. He's a teenager in the 60's and this book relives his advetures living a disguised life as a Pan Am pilot. He flies around the world for free, eats at scrumptios restaurants, stays at luxurious hotels, and dates beautiful, older women. All for free. He cons his way around the world and into hearts and into milions of dollars, all while playing tag with an american FBI agent that is in hot pursuit.This guy actually held a Pan Am contest for future stewardesses.......and he didn't even work for Pan Am. Unlike a lot of memoir reading that is informational, this book is not a dry read...it's easy and enjoyable!!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"The premise of this book was exciting from the beginning. A master thief tells of his exploits and details his devilish deads. But Frank Abagnale was not an ordinary thief. He didnt break windows and steal the family silverware. Rather he targeted airlines, banks, and hotels out of millions over his illustrious criminal career. The kicker is that he was a teenage high school dropout while he was doing it.Abagnale quit high school to become a self taught man. The problem is that he taught himself to become the ultimate con man. He flawlessly learned the airline business to pose as a pilot. He brushed up on his law and passed the California bar exam to briefly collect a paycheck with the D.A.'s office. He even posed as a pediatrician. His strong suit though was the passing of bogus checks. He started by bouncing on his own account and graduated to bilking Pan Am and others out of thousands of dollars in phony pay roll checks.Abagnale gives a quick reading book. It falls short of a five star affair in some minor but noticeable ways. First Mr. Abagnale toots his own horn a little too much. I expected this when he was relaying his criminal enterprise, but when he constantly alluded to his sexual exploits it became a little annoying. There was also an awkward ending to deal with. The book was good enough that you wanted more detail on how his life of crime came to an end and how he started a good guy life with the FBI.However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall effect of the book. This is a must read for not only the true crime fan but also for those that work in the airline, bank, and hotel industries. A solid four star book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You CanIn the autobiography of Frank Abagnale's life, \\"Catch Me if You Can\\", Frank is on the run from twelve European governments and the United States' FBI. Over the course of his criminal exploits across the world, he falls in love with numerous woman and swindles checks worth over $2.5 million. He disguises himself as a doctor, lawyer, college professor and an airplane pilot. This is a story about overcoming difficulties and making something out of nothing. Frank now works for the FBI preventing the same thing he did for more than 5 years. Justice is always served for those that need correcting. Everyone that loves non-stop criminal stories will love this book because there are twists at every turn. However, the end of the story is a cliffhanger which may be a drawback for some. For everyone else though, this book engages one as to how such a master plan could be pulled off by a single teenage boy."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I bought this book very recently, several years after the movie was released. I thought the movie was fantastic, and the book is even better! While he spent most of his criminal career as a \\"paperhanger\\" (passing around fraudulent cheques), there are many interesting anecdotes and cons to read about that weren't in the movie. Mr. Abagnale's father is a little different from the character in the movie though. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish and enjoyed the details of his life that were omitted from- or glossed over during the movie (such as his time in prison). Some reviewers complained about Abagnale's obsession with women throughout the book (and his career), as he frequently mentions the attractive women he met during his travels. I think it helps explain how he begun his career as a conman and didn't find it detracted from the book at all. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I found this book way better then the movie.

And while seeing the movie first does mean that some of the surprises in the book are no longer surprises, you realize just how amazing and rich Mr. Abagnale's experiences really were. Things that are minor parts of the movie are fleshed out here, and some things that were altogether absent are truly amazing tales. His experiences in prison towards the end of the book are especially vivid.The second thought I had on reading this book was &quot;Frank Abagnale is astoundingly, astoundingly intelligent.&quot; You realize that for this man to pull off wehat he did, even iuf he was eventually caught, reflects a great deal of street smarts and quick thinking. But more than that, the man has a phenomenal memory and in general is very intelligent, passing the bar exam without going to law school being a great example of this. His intelligence and wit comes through in the writing style, and is supremely evident from some of his experiences.Overall, while this man was a crook, and has since paid his debt to society, the story that this book tells is one of fun and adventure with a relatively light-hearted and easy-going feeling. Yes, Mr. Abagnale had some bad experiences, and yes his prison experiences border on gruesome, but as you can tell from reading the dust jacket, the tale ends relatively happily and over all he has learned his lessons. Read this book and you will enjoy it, wish you could do what he did, maybe even be inspired by it...though I wouldn't recommend following in his footsteps. A great and fast read, overall, that is well-told and well-written."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I saw Frank Abagnale at a conference in 1997. After listening to him speak for three hours to a group of Accountants, I knew just about every way a person could fake a check... and get away with it.He began by explaining that there is no real punishment for money crimes, most get off with light sentances in minimum security prisons or no sentances at all. And it is so EASY to fake a check. I was most impressed by his confident attitude and matter of fact approach. He has spent a lifetime in the study of check fraud (and other frauds) and has come full circle. The purpose of his life now: to teach others how to protect themselves from getting conned.I love this guy... and I loved his book! It's a real roller coaster ride that takes you through his life as a young man... where he basically just made up whatever life he wanted to live. Not only did he have courage beyond the extraordinary, but he had exceptional luck in many cases. A deadly combination to those in his path.I think what I liked most about this story is the fact that in spite of his breaking the law... there is a great lesson in it. You can accomplish anything you want in life if you have high confidence and a strong character (and a little luck).Get this book and read it. You will not be disappointed. (note: it is quite different from the movie and in my opinion, much better.)"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"What he did may be illegal but it sure is fun to read. I am sure most readers will take a certain pleasure in how Abagnale managed to \\"con\\" millions of dollars from \\"institutional\\" America. His story of the Pan AM Flight Crew he organized and took to Europe is fascinating. While his charm played a major role in his ability to deceive so many people he also showed great creativity and intelligence in his understanding of the banking industry. His description of being jailed in France should be heeded by anyone looking to learn something from this book. The book has enough great scenes to insure that the upcoming movie should be a huge hit."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book was absolutely the most interesting and humorous book I have read in a long time!

I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It's fasicnating being in the mind of this conman, reading how little simple things got him over $2.5 million!! It makes me laugh when I see how he did these things so easily."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book covers many things that the movie left out. For example, you learn why if you are going to commit crimes around the world, you might not want to commit any in France. (Their prison system is ROUGH.)Perhaps if Mr. Abagnale hadn't compulsively committed crimes even when he had plenty of money, he wouldn't have nearly died in a French jail.There is also a great interview at the end of the book where Mr. Abagnale discusses how to fight the war on terrorism among other things."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I gave it 4 stars only because I reserve 5-star ratings for books I could not have lived without reading, so to speak. But it is a fascinating account, and if you like knowing that it's a big world out there with people doing interesting things, you'll probably enjoy this book. Abagnale is obviously intelligent and likes to have fun -- an infectious combination. I'm interested now in reading his follow-up,The Art of the Steal: How to Protect Yourself and Your Business from Fraud, America's #1 Crime. I suspect his advice will be more helpful than the dispirited, obfuscating \\"instructions\\" of the credit reporting agencies!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with).

These guys (the book was written &quot;with Stan Redding&quot;) are incredibly talented, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy more books written by either of them."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"The only negative criticism I have about this book is that it is so absorbing I just couldn't put it down until I was through. Yes, I mean literally. And because of it I had to postpone a project I was working on at the time.This book is written in a first person narrative and is presumably a true crime memoir. Sometimes the stories are so unbelievable that I must confess I was questioning if all was true. However, the book is so good and enjoyable that at the end I don't even care if the stories are 100% true or not.Then character, Frank with numerous aliases, is so lovable that you start feeling you want to invite him for a drink - at least I did. He is a con man, granted, but he is one of those that still care about the ethics of the scams he is perpetrating. Furthermore the author has a really good sense of humor and even if he wrote the text in the first person you never get a feeling that he brags about how smart he is.The book starts off with a scam (sorry, no details - I don't want to spoil the surprise) that leaves you wanting for more. Then the author takes you back a few years into his childhood. There is a short section that I considered a bit slow (as he is describing his childhood). But this passage is literally only a few pages long and then the book really picks up.At one point he gets caught and ends up in prison. By then Frank really becomes your friend and you really feel bad about the way they treated him in one of the prisons.Bottom line, if you like a good adventure story read this book."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Incredible story.

The same can be said for Frank Abagnale as he sensed everything that could happen as he perfected his crimes of passing bad checks and imposing as a pilot, doctor and lawyer. I'm surprised he got away as much as he did and was able to con as many people as he did.It's a great read, very fast and yeah, you fantasize yourself in his shoes. At least I did. One thing the book didn't touch on was how he got to his current occupation. I know the book was written in 1980 and re-released in 2000 but it would have been nice if we got an aftemath so to speak. I guess his latest book, The Art of the Steal will tell us more.

However, I am not an advocate of peopleglorifying crime or the criminal. For a good look at theeffect of criminals and their crimes on the average citizens, I would recommend reading A Reason To Live: The True Story ofOne Woman's Love, Courage and Determination To Survive.

At times it's difficult to remember that it's true. I thought the ending of the book was perfect (some people didn't). Also, some people complained about the crimes he commited. This book is all about a man committing crimes, so if you don't like to read about that, don't buy it. Otherwise his story is well told and an interesting account of deception."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I would have given this book 4 stars IF the ending had been more informative. It seemed to just 'cut' right to the end leaving out a lot of needed detail such as why Frank Abagnale decided to switch over to good guy. The book was brilliant though. I couldn't believe the things he got away with. From being a check cashing pilot WITH a crew to a doctor with (thank God), an excellent nurse to help him, every page of the book had you wondering if he would be caught. Then living a year in a dirty, filty Italian jail with no clothes and a smelly bucket that was cleaned out twice a year which he used for bodily function, it was very graphic. In the end, I didn't want Frank to be caught even though he was a con artist. From teaching us how he conned the bank by changing the numbers on deposit slips to flying a plane for free, this man was honest in his book and taught me a thing or two. I would recommend everyone read this book just to see what actually is going on outside in the REAL world."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book is a really quick read. You will be excitedly turning the pages in disbelief. Frank Abagnale has done some the most unthinkable things and what's so incredible is how easily he does them. If it weren't true I'd think the writer was going a little overboard."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"The book purports to be the escapades of a mid-1960s con man. The biggest con is getting anyone to pay good money or to spend good time reading it. I spent 10 cents for the book at a yard sale and took it to the beach for a light read -- and I was ripped off. The awful writing and ridiculously outdated sexual phrasing made this one of the most painful reads I've had in a long time.Is the book true? I have no idea -- and it doesn't matter. The author is so thoroughly dislikeable and pompous that you just don't care.It's not often that I'd tell someone to see the movie rather than read the book. But this is one of those times."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"In most cases of book turned movie, the book far outweighs the level of excellence than the movie. In this case, however, the book pales in comparison to the movie. This can be attributed to many things. The most glaringly obvious reason is Mr. Abagnale's sex addiction. While a biography should illustrate what the subjects attitude and personality is, this book went as far as to mention women and sex every other page. By the third page I understood Mr. Abagnale's love and enjoyment of women and by the fourth I was already sick of it. This blantant redundancy certainly detracted from the book as it would in any book. The other issue I had with the book is his unapologetic disregard for authority, laws, and the human race. We are supposed to praise this guy and talk about how great he is? How is that possible when he put so many lives in danger and stole millions of dollars that could have been put to social programs and other venues. I had a tough time cheering for him on the sidelines simply because I do not agree with his mindset. Another problem is that by the 120th page, the book just gets boring. I had a tough time caring at all midway through the book. While it does pick up towards the end. The middle of the book just seems to be the same thing only in a different place. I may be acting overly critical, but someone needs to be since all the other reviews have deemed Mr. Abaganale a hero. Not quite, but he certainly did live an amazing and eventful life. It's not a bad read, just not a great one, which is what I expected."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"Catch Me If You Can is supposedly a true story about a very talented teenage con-man who posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and college professor, and passed millions of dollars in bad checks before his capture by the French police. Regardless of the highly questionable morality of the protagonist, there is no denying that Frank W. Abagnale's escapades are quite amusing and at times downright hilarious. The book is an ideal quick read, and will even teach you some interesting stuff about paperhanging along the way [but it's too late to try to imitate Frank, as he is now in charge of catching aspiring con men].However, the story has its flaws and is indeed one of the rare cases when the film surpasses the original book. Incidentially, the film, also titled Catch Me If You Can, was directed by Spielberg, starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, and was very entertaining - highly recommended.But anyway, back to the book. The most irritating thing about it is that even though Abagnale was clearly a very intelligent guy, as he was able to pass the bar exam [on his third try] with only 2 weeks of preparation, he clearly lacks talent as a novelist. His prose is often embarassingly childish, and he revels in lame jokes and terrible, overextended metaphors and similies.Additionally, the tone of the book often becomes quite smug and boastful, especially regarding his abilities to charm women, which is particularly annoying. Naturally, some of the blame has to rest with the co-author as well. Nevertheless, from someone as allegedly intelligent as Frank, it is reasonable to expect better.Overall, however, this book is still a fun ride, and is perfect for a long trip [airplane flight, perhaps?] or other dull situation. As for the story itself, it is quiet unbelievable [and given the author's background, it is easy to doubt its veracity]...but seems to be factual. Enjoy the book - shortcomings aside, it is entertaining and will have you cheering for Frank to get away with his audacious schemes."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This guy's writing is embarassing at times. His ghost writer -- or his ghost writer's editor -- ought to be able to do a little better than this. Perhaps they were deliberately shooting for the lowest common denominator for marketing reasons.It's nonetheless well worth reading. The narrator's exploits show you what remarkable feats you can pull off if you have enough brains, powers of observation, and chutzpah. He eases into different roles, posing as a practitioner of various professions, and in some cases even acquits himself so respectably that one wonders who the frauds are -- the &quot;real&quot; credentialed professionals or the impostor."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I heard him speak to 500 agents at an insurance convention about 10 years ago. He talked - bragged - about his allegedly true adventures. During the few days left of the convention I was able to ask the majority of agents (my customers) their honest opinion of Abignale's claims. Most men have a built-in BS detector and unanimously, theirs went off within the first few minutes. They laughed him off as an ego-maniacle con artist. I'm sure this is a compliment to Abignale.Here's an example of his shoddy attempts at showmanship:When his BS stage performance was finished, he attempted a Grand Finale by reaching into his jacket pocket and pulling out a red handkerchief - which turned out to be a pair of women's bikini panties. \\"Proof\\" of course, of his close acquaintenships with airline stewardesses from his \\"pilot days\\".A few days later, I made the mistake of wasting my money on his paperback. Comparing the stories he told on stage to theversions in his book, there were so many inconsistencies, I threw the book away.I later found out that one of my good friends - young and attractive - knew him personally. She insisted that everything he said was true and how could I doubt him, especially since he went straight and is now working on the right side of the law? To me, her defense highlighted his talent at scamming the gullibles who need to believe they're as beautiful as he tells them they are.Regardless of how much they claim to be reformed - does a professional liar EVER tell the truth?"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I'm sorry. I'd like to join the chorus of people lauding this book. I started it fully expecting to enjoy it as a fast and fun read. Fast it was, but fun? Only for awhile.Mr. Abagnale's first few cons were amusing and interesting to read while he worked out how to worm his way into places he had no right to be and acquire money that wasn't his. He clearly was born with a good brain in his head and a train load of chutzpah. The overall tone of the writing was light, jovial, almost sprightly. I thought that was something of an accomplishment considering he was publicly confessing to thievery, not usually a light-hearted topic. I was curious to see where the story would go.But after reading a few chapters, especially as his scams began to get more elaborate, irritation set in. As yet another con unfolded I couldn't shake the feeling of &quot;been there, done that&quot;. The story was going nowhere, the tone was unchanging. Each anecdote was yet another recipe card blithely describing &quot;how I pulled this off&quot;. I felt like someone forced to watch the same film loop over and over. Even worse, I became increasingly offended at his non-stop misuse of his own talents. The lengths that this man went to plan and execute his scams were truly phenomenal. Applied to ANY legitimate business, his skills would have guaranteed him success and wealth. But no, he applied remarkable intelligence, imagination, boldness, drive, persistence, planning, people-handling skills, and self-confidence to.... an illusion... over and over and over again. What a waste of god-given talent. The book's cocktail-party breeziness about it all only offended me more.It didn't help that every other person in the story is treated as just a convenient money-dispensing robot. I began to despise Frank Abagnale. By midway through the book I didn't care enough to read the elaborate details of his cons and was skimming, waiting for the moment he would be caught. When he was finally caught and imprisoned in a ghastly French prison, I didn't give two figs what happened to him one way or another. By now, of course, he was starting to admit he felt remorse and was tired of his go-nowhere life. The tone of the book changed and other people were actually recognized as fellow humans. Too late. I finished it quickly, only to know how it ended.I give this book two stars because the writing is competent, because it occasionally amuses, and because what he manages to pull off is quite remarkable and has to be read to be believed. But it quickly lost its sense of fun for me. I know mine is a minority opinion, but I guess I just can't find too much enjoyment in reading about a young man's self-destruction.Take this book out from the library or borrow it from a friend, but I can't recommend you buy it."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I don't know how much poetic license came into play. But regardless, it's a terrific tale. I'm just glad he's now on the right side of the law...we hope."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book relates the exploits of the young Frank Abagnale, Jr., master con-artist. When Abagnale's parents split up in the early 1960s, Frank went to live with his father. He was a teenager who was addicted to girls, and found that he needed greater and greater sums to gain their company. To get a little extra money, he hatched his first scheme to score a little extra cash with his father's credit card. This started him down the slippery slope, and before long, he moved on to passing bad checks, creating counterfeit checks, soon adopting entirely new identities and personae to assist in his paper-passing schemes. The list of aliases and assumed positions is mind-boggling, ranging from pilot to pediatrician to professor. What makes his story even more remarkable is that he was able to pass off each of these assumed identities successfully, even though he was in reality still a teenager. This book details how he was able to do so, from interviewing real pilots, to learning the lingo of the trade, forging transcripts, studying technical dictionaries in broom closets when confronted on the job with terms he did not know, to cramming for and eventually passing the Bar in Georgia (at the age of 19, as a highschool dropout!). Abagnale was certainly no slouch, and could have gone far in any field he chose to apply himself to.Abagnale's capers become bolder and more unbelievable with every page, giving the story both suspense and comic relief at times. The book doesn't leave readers with the message that crime pays, however. Abagnale describes his foreign prison experiences in great and gruesome detail. He also relates how he eventually ended up working for the FBI, having been fired from job after job in the civilian sector after employers found out he was an ex-convict. Thanks to the efforts of the reformed Abagnale at educating bankers and clerks, kids today would have a far more difficult time pulling off the capers that he did. But now, we have the Internet. . ."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"In most cases of book turned movie, the book far outweighs the level of excellence than the movie. In this case, however, the book pales in comparison to the movie. This can be attributed to many things. The most glaringly obvious reason is Mr. Abagnale's sex addiction. While a biography should illustrate what the subjects attitude and personality is, this book went as far as to mention women and sex every other page. By the third page I understood Mr. Abagnale's love and enjoyment of women and by the fourth I was already sick of it. This blantant redundancy certainly detracted from the book as it would in any book. The other issue I had with the book is his unapologetic disregard for authority, laws, and the human race. We are supposed to praise this guy and talk about how great he is? How is that possible when he put so many lives in danger and stole millions of dollars that could have been put to social programs and other venues. I had a tough time cheering for him on the sidelines simply because I do not agree with his mindset. Another problem is that by the 120th page, the book just gets boring. I had a tough time caring at all midway through the book. While it does pick up towards the end. The middle of the book just seems to be the same thing only in a different place. I may be acting overly critical, but someone needs to be since all the other reviews have deemed Mr. Abaganale a hero. Not quite, but he certainly did live an amazing and eventful life. It's not a bad read, just not a great one, which is what I expected."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This book is certainly one of the most unique stories you will ever read! As much as I cannot back the moral, the characteristic of the story though is superb, shocking, exiting, breathtaking and very well written. I listened to a radio interview with Frank, and I must say he sounds exactly as the character in the book! He is very sharp, humorous and well spoken. No wonder why the FBI decided to keep such a brain rather than letting it rot in a cell."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is the autobiography of master con man, Frank Abagnale. By the time he was 20, he had traveled all over the world; stolen millions of dollars; passed himself off as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, a lawyer, and a sociology professor. Abagnale invented modern fraud and now he works at defunking it.This book was an excellent read. It was quick, entertaining, informative, and slightly fascinating. The author does seem like a chauvinistic pig at the beginning of the book, but keep in mind he was describing himself as he was: a sixteen year old boy who had no ethic and moral system to adhere.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have been recommending it to many of my friends.

His most noted accomplishment was that, he who didn't take any laws course, passed a state attorney licence exam in Georgia in three tries in the span of 6 month to become a rightful professional to practice laws!!!(...)the book is well written, the author is utmostly outspoken and honest about his criminal activities in the book (... modesty is not my virtue, and at that time, virtue was not one of my virtues...)You will like this book if you are not prejudice to Frank, or disgusted in his scams, this book will grab readers by the neck, put them in a chair and have them read the book cover to cover in one or two seatings in exchange of good laughes and marvels."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This was my third time in 20 years to read &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. It has always been an entertaining, hilarious and exciting book. As a 30-year veteran federal agent, I have heard Mr. Abagnale lecture at the FBI Academy many times. In the book he is a very flamboyant and boastful character, but in person he is a very articulate individual and extremely knowledgeable in his field. Abagnale and his escapades have been the discussion of many agents over the last 30 years. Today, he is highly respected for who he is and not who he was in the book.

It also details the time he spent in foreign prisons after capture. The TRUE LIFE experiences of this &quot;con artist&quot; far exceed any stories you've read or heard before.

Over the course of five years, he had a large number of different identities. He posed as an airplane pilot, lawyer, sociology professor, and pediatrician. The measures that Frank Abagnale went through to obtain these jobs are amazing. One example of this is how he faked a Harvard transcript. The story starts out with Frank making simple cons at age sixteen. Soon he runs away and starts making complex cons ranging from faking identities to creating large amounts of fake checks. The book is truly enjoyable because of all of the fascinating stories and narrow escapes.I certainly agree with other reviews stating that the book is truly better than the movie adaptation. A reason being the book is completely told by Frank Abagnale himself; nothing was changed about the story. In the movie there are slight differences. One example of this is how Frank actually had three siblings whereas in the movie he was an only child. The book was more enjoyable because of the detail of the events. I also disagree with some reviews stating that the book is boring. This book explains the life of a great con-artist and many amazing events throughout Frank Abagnale's life. It is in no way boring; it is extremely interesting to learn about Frank's life.Frank Abagnale wrote this book to inform people about his adventure and does a great job. I can't get over how enjoyable this book was to read because of all of the amazing cons and impersonations that took place and it all actually happened. There are practically no slow or boring parts of the story. The reader will enjoy the book from start to finish.Overall, the book is a great and interesting read that many fiction and nonfiction readers will enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I really love this movie.

Frank Abagnale is such an intelligent con man.The only thing that I did not like about the book was the end. I was disappointed.

He took advantage of loopholes and people's greed. If he wore a different label, let's say, \\"secret agent\\" or \\"bank executive\\", we would never condemn him but rather envy him; instead, we call him criminal.

It's about a young man named Frank Abagnale who had a rough time growing up. As he got older he had some trouble finding a job, he then resorts to being a con-artist. At first the starts out as a pilot because at the time pilots were highly respected people. This was just a start, Frank Abagnale became a millionaire just from conning. The way he does it is interesting and captivating he didn't just stop at a pilot, he went on to con people as a doctor, lawyer, and many more. Before Abagnale was twenty-five he had forged over $2 million in checks. After jumping from country to country Abagnail was finally caught after making millions on just cons. Oddly enough Abagnail now is working for the FBI identifying forded checks.

I had seen the movie, so I sort of knew what to expect with the book. But I didn't remember the extent to which Frank Abagnale stole money. He wrote hundreds of bad checks that totaled a huge amount of money. Certainly his cleverness did contribute to his success as a con man, but it seems to me the thing that separated him from other would-be con men was his sheer brazenness. He did outrageous things and got away with them! For a while at least.Frank's adventures and escapades made for an exciting read. It was a fun book, written in a breezy, informal style. Sometimes, though the style was irritatingly informal. The cliches and trite figures of speech just became too much and detracted from the narrative. Mr. Stan Redding is responsible for that. His job as a ghost (or whatever you call it) writer is to keep the 'personality's' writing up to snuff. And he certainly didn't do that. Grr.Frank definitely would not have been successful at his conning today, at least in the way he pulled off his scams. Most of his check fraud relied on the slowness of the US post and the fact that banks actually mailed checks around to other banks. In this electronic age, none of his antics would fly. However, surely a clever (and unscrupulous) guy like Frank could find a way to cheat banks and corporations in modern times.The prison conditions he faced in France when he was finally caught were shocking. I couldn' t help wondering how France felt about having that revealed in the book!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I'll start by saying I saw the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, about 18 months before I read this book. The movie was an entertaining cat and mouse game between a con man and an FBI agent. This is basically Frank Abagnale, the con man, telling us all how he did it.Abagnale is clearly a very talented and smart individual, and yes, you start to root for him, even though he's doing things that are wrong and harmful. It's entertaining to read, and Abagnale's \\"accomplishments\\" during his fraudulent crime spree are quite impressive.Still, I was a little disappointed with Abagnale's self examination, which was rather perfunctory, and the descriptions of all the frauds start to get a little numbing after a while. I bought this book for some light reading after reading a couple of particularly difficult and dense books. It's certainly entertaining, but some readers will be left yearning for a little more analysis into the author's character and actions."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"This is the true story of one of the greatest con men in history.

Ingenious, sometimes complicated but oftentimes shockingly simple scams allowed this teenager to live like a rock star without a high school degree.

As always they had a limited supply of products, usually shipped over from stores such as Wal-Mart with surplus inventories, etc. Not quite sure. Anyway, needless to say the film was coming out in a few weeks over in the US, and a few months in the UK, so I thought it'd be fun to read the book and see how it fared.It's not the most well-written book in the world. Chances are Stan Redding, who co-wrote the novel with Frank Abagnale, Jr., did most of the typing, and Mr. Abagnale most of the story telling itself. No matter, this is a rather fascinating true tale - something you have to read to believe.Thought the (very good and faithful) movie was a stretch? Check out the book. You'll never believe some of the stuff this kid got away with. I started wondering how much Abagnale actually made up! I suppose none, although he did admit he sometimes stretches the truth of his tales a bit for dramatic effect.Overall, a very interesting memoir of a very interesting man who now lives a very normal life!"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I really enjoyed this book, although I guess that it could be better written by the same protagonist"},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"this book tells one of the most unbelieveable true stories i have read in a fun and exciting way. i have recommended it to many of my friends and tried to pass my copy on as many times as it could handle."},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can: The Amazing True Story of the Youngest and Most Daring Con Man in the History of Fun and Profit","review":"I wore out two of these books by handing them out to friends.

I attribute his success to two things.One, he is willing to try things others dismiss as impossible. For instance, he posed as an airline pilot. Few passengers or airline crew members would imagine that the person flying the plane was a fake. Abagnale was certainly practitioner of the motto \\"take the path less trodden.\\" Perhaps willingness to try one's hand at the uncommon and the unthinkable is an important trait for an investment career.Two, luck. Survivorship bias. There must have been other fakes that got caught at some point. Abagnale is one of the sample paths that managed to survived the longest.Very well-told story.

I was amazed to learn that Frank's time as a doctor, for example, lasted 11 months. While the movie is great and I enjoyed it very much, the book puts it all into perspective without all the romanticism the movie has. You hear about Frank's constant moving to avoid being caught and his constant uneasy feeling.

We know (from the beginning of the book) that he served time in prison in the US, and that he eventually went to work for the FBI. What had my curiosity as much as anything throughout the book was how he made the transition from crook to crook-catcher - and I was totally disappointed to find out that none of that is included.If you like reading books where someone has...discarded the last half, then this is the book for you.Someone wrote in another review that they thought the earlier editions had a more complete ending, with updates of what the author was doing at the time.

A nervy, overly mature teen fakes his way into Pan Am cockpits to get free rides and fake paychecks. He scams everyone from a French printer, to judges to patients and other doctors in a hospital. His exploits were amazing and humorous - hubris such as his has to be humorous.The story line (I'm not sure an autobiography can have such a thing, but this one seems to) is terrifically entertaining.
