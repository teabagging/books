The text does a good job of outlining the USN's Tactical Decision Making Under Stress (TADMUS) project, and provides a good balance of topics dedicated to both research and application. I am not a researcher, so I could not evaluate the work and methodologies from a scientific standpoint. However, I found the text very usable from the training developer's viewpoint, particularly Parts II and III which are devoted to individual and team-level training.

Although TADMUS was geared towards dangerous, high stakes professions, its findings are applicable to teams who do not regular face life-and-death situations. Especially useful --since so little is written on it elsewhere -- is the insight into effective team dynamics and how to train to development them. Leaders who profess or aspire to have high performance teams in any realm -- military or commercial -- should take the time to learn the lessons of the study this book describes."},{"Title":"Making Decisions Under Stress: Implications for Individual and Team Training","review":"First of all, there is a point where I strongly disagree with the authors. They say that, probably, their investigation, being so practical and so far of academic issues, should not be admitted as a paper in any important meeting. As a frequent reviewer, I have to say that I would like to find more frequently the strehgth of the rationale and the empiric work of this book.The second part: The book is very good but very centered in the development of TADMUS system. If the reader is a naval officer, that is not a problem but many of the analyses and conclusions can be very useful for other fields. However, being so centered in the TADMUS system, that enforces the readers to make a jump in the abstraction to reach by themselves useful conclusions.The book gives a lot of information about how a modern battleship works and the keys for the decision. For non-naval officers, if that part decreases and, at the same time, all the foundations and results are explained in more generic terms, the book could strongly improve.I hope the authors will prepare another release less navy-centered.

I wonder how people with such twisted, ignorant, and may I say ARROGANT views even achieve published status. It is laughable that he even has one positive review to his name. He waxes facist but seems to be unsure of himself; his Marxist outbursts make me tremble and even the most amateur of political science students can tell you that they are on the complete opposite ends of the ideaology spectrum. Don't pick up this book expecting to learn more about film. You will be sorely disappointed. Trust me.

The book helped inform us of the day-to-day activities of Jesus, and helped us sense his heart as he connected with the people around him. Some of the characters are not actually mentioned in the Bible, but Margaret brought them into the story to make it more real. We better understood the attitudes of various types of people who had contact with Jesus or heard him. We felt that we were over-hearing his close conversations with his heavenly father, and even comments from the unseen angels who were present during all the events of Jesus' life. We would recommend this book for people who have never really read the Bible or for those who want a comprehensive understanding of who Jesus is and what he did while he walked in sandals on the earth."},{"Title":"God in Sandals: When Jesus Walked Among Us","review":"Da Vinci Code? Margaret Montreuil's Jesus is interesting enough without shocking revelations.Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, this book takes a fresh, original approach, focusing not just on Jesus' ministry and miracles, but on his drama as a human being with his own disappointments and fears, his own joys and sorrows, and his awesome destiny that he surrenders to: to suffer, be crucified,, and be reborn to save mankind from sin.Hollywood secularists, repent: The Jewish religious leaders, channeling Jim Bakker, as well as the Reverend Fred Phelps who erected a monument against murdered Matthew Shepard (who Montreuil's loving, fiery Jesus would not have damned) in Wyoming, condemned Jesus because of their own arrogance. Oh wait, that sounds more like the Hollywood secularists trying to block Mel Gibson's \\"Passion.\\" In the Jewish leaders' denial of Jesus we see grim specters of the ACLU and the liberal left banning Nativity scenes, prayer at public events, and at high school football games.

Thank you for ruining the book for me and others."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"The Lady in the Lake was published in 1943. Its author is Raymond Chandler (1888-1959) whose beautiful prose style is riveting in its clearness, conciseness and metaphorical beauty. The subjects Detective Phillip Marlowe deals with are horrible and smelly human beings in the tough world of wartime Los Angeles. This book is no exception. You can feel the heat of a southern California sun as you walk the shadow streets, check in to a cheap hotel and hear the bullets fire into the tropical night.The intricate and surprising plot concerns Phillip Marlowe being hired to trace the whereabouts of Derace Kinglsey's straying wife. Kingsley is a cosmetics firm executive and well to do. He is carrying on an affair with h is sexy office secretary Miss Adrienne Fromsett. Marlowe follows the trail to Pumace Lake where he meets Bill Chess whose own wife Mildred Haviland Chess has flown the coup! Chess is an irascible mean drinker who had a fling with Mrs, Crystal Kingsley to the utter horror of his tough broad of a spouse.Marlowe and Chess discover a dead blonde floating in the lake. It is assumed the body is that of Mildred Chess.Marlowe also learns of Chris Lavery a boy toy who later in the tale turns up murdered in his shower stall. Along the way we see Marlowe being roughed up and jailed by the L.A. cops. The death of Mrs. Albert S. Almore (M.D.) is also connected to the crimes. Who is the lady in the lake and what thread will tie together all the stray sheets of evidence? Only the mind of Phillip Marlowe can solve this difficult case.Ross MacDonald said that Chandler wrote like a slumming angel. He was on target! If you want gritty crime fiction then turn to Chandler. This is one of his best books."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"It's often said Chandler could not plot, but The Lady in the Lake gives the lie to that tale. The Lady in the Lake has the complexity of an Agatha Christie or Freeman Wills Crofts and for once Chandler manages to fully (well, almost) make sense of it all at the end. Here the plot revelations keep one turning pages, along with the writing. Characters are vivid as ever, and more plausibly presented than in The Big Sleep. Not as moving a story as Farewell, My Lovely, but beautifully plotted, The Lady in the Lake is a pinnacle of genuine detective fiction."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"This book is a pretty quality read.

Lady in the Lake is notable for its sophisticated characterization and dialogue. It paints a portrait of the seedy, corrupt underbelly of Los Angeles society and is full of puns and humbling frankness. Marlowe is searching for a missing wife and discovers a different woman's corpse in a mountain lake. From there the waters get deeper. The book has interesting surprises, troublesome cops and Los Angeles lowlifes who crawl out from bungalows to blink at the sun. &quot;Police business is a hell of a problem. It's a good deal like politics. It asks for the highest type of men, and there's nothing in it to attract the highest type of men. So we have to work with what we get - and we get things like this.&quot; Captain Webber to Marlowe, Chapter 27, Page 186, from Lady in the Lake."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"The setting of 1940's California is great, and that is actually when Chandler wrote this book. It's a classic noir mystery and I couldn't help thinking as I was reading that it should have been played by Bogie as Philip Marlowe and Bacall as the femme fatale in this story. This would make a great movie actually. It's a twist on the classic missing female story. Marlowe has been hired by a big wig to find his wife. She's been missing for a month. As Marlowe tries to follow her tracks he gets pitted against some pretty desperate men, and he manages to get knocked on the head at least a couple of times before he figures out what happened to the woman he is hired to find. Chandler's characterizations are great. Marlowe is wonderful, but there are some really good bit players in this one too - for example Patton- the Sheriff from San Bernadino is actually quite wonderful. A good old boy that happens to be as sharp as a tack and a crack shot too. Good stuff."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Culled from an older short story, the book is one of his best.

Much. Times twenty. Frankly, I disliked TBS so much that it's taken me several years to pick up Chandler again; and I only did so now because I found a battered old 1960-something reprint for less than a buck at a used book store. LITL was infinitely better from a narrative standpoint, and holds together much more firmly as a simple mystery than its more famous sibling title.

Two thumbs up, and all that."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"... they're all beside the point. \\"The Lady in the Lake\\", like all of Raymond Chandler's novels, is about atmosphere, about the constant scent of lurking menace, and the menace is \\"Lady\\" is almost palpable from the first page to the last. I've been catching up on \\"crime fiction\\" lately - both the old stuff like Chandler and Rex Stout and new stuff bike Tallis and Indridason - and what surprises me about the genre is its intellectuality. Even tough guy private detective Philip Marlowe has a fine-grit wit and a sly sense of allusion that would be wasted on a reader without some of the same instincts. In short, I'm beginning to catch on to why so of the smartest people I know are addicted to crime fiction.Marlowe attracts truculence like a baby in a stroller draws ga-ga-goos. Part of the fun is in Marlowe's steely-gray ability to glare 'em down, both the hard bodies and the babes. Another part is in Marlowe's stoicism when he gets smacked around, as he does inevitably in every episode. He's a \\"cheap date' for the brutal sociopaths of his world, ten bucks a day and no apparent urge to \\"better' himself. The only characters in a Raymond Chandler novel who don't bristle with rage and cynicism are a few scared-rabbit parking-lot attendants, and a corpse or two.But the real anti-hero of the \\"Philip Marlowe Novels\\" isn't the impassive pug investigator. It's Los Angeles, or rather the greater Los Angeles area, the final collecting pond of westward-ho whither everything loose in America eventually rolls: the sleazy easy and the scummy crumby, the glitzy wealth beside the trashy poverty, all having in common just their raw transitory meaninglessness, the cheap thrill society with no history and no desire for a future. It's a question to me - a chicken-or-egg question - which came first, Los Angeles or the indelible image of Los Angeles created by Raymond Chandler in his novels and by Hollywood in films like \\"Chinatown.\\" In either case, it hasn't changed."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"In my estimation, the weakest of the Marlowe series.

Philip Marlowe is given the job. Crystal sent a telegram saying she was going for a Mexican divorce. But Chris Lavery doesn't know anything. Across the street Dr. Almore watches Marlowe. So Marlowe drives to Little Fawn Lake to inspect Crystal's last known location. He talks to the caretaker Bill Chess, and learns Chess' wife Muriel left him the same day. They walk around the lake and onto the little pier. There is something below the water, Chess' missing wife is found (Chapter 6)! Sheriff Patton questions Bill Chess (Chapter 8). Birdie Keppel, the part time newspaper reporter, talks to Marlowe. Six weeks earlier a man was looking for a woman whose photograph resembled Muriel (Chapter 9). Sheriff Patton knew his country and where to look. Muriel's car was hidden away in shed (Chapter 11). Marlowe searched the cabin again and found a clue (Chapter 12).Marlowe returned to talk to Lavery, but he wasn't home. A woman came up the steps, talked to Marlowe, then ran out. Marlowe then found Lavery, but he didn't say anything (Chapter 16). We learn more about Dr. Almore's wife and local politics (Chapter 19). The police arrive at Lavery's house (Chapter 21). Marlowe gets another lead (Chapter 22). The parents of Dr. Almore's dead wife tell Marlowe about their suspicions (Chapter 23). He hears the name \\"Mildred\\" as Dr. Almore's missing nurse. We learn more facts about the case (Chapter 28). Marlowe brings money to Crystal and learns what happened (Chapter 31). Then he is knocked out (Chapter 32).Crystal won't talk now. The police arrive but Marlowe left before this. Marlowe tells Lt. Degarmo what he surmised about Mildred and what she did (Chapter 36). There is more about Crystal's fate (Chapter 38)! Marlowe surmises what happened when Crystal and Muriel both disappeared at the same time (Chapter 39). Marlowe guesses what happened when he was sapped and receives confirmation of his guess (Chapter 40). There is an end to the mystery (Chapter 41). It will be kept out of the newspapers.Having read more than a few mystery novels I picked up on the clue where two women disappeared at the same time, and both looked similar. Mistaken identity was often used by Erle Stanley Gardner in his many novels. This story reminded me of \\"The Case of the Screaming Woman\\" as a story about life among the rich and powerful. It also reminded me of the novel \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\", and the short story \\"No Crime in the Mountains\\". A mistaken identification is part of Dashiell Hammett's \\"Golden Horseshoe\\" short story. Note how the villains are not the usual suspects of the poor and lower class of society."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Raymond Chandler takes us through Marlowe to where good and evil become virtually hard to tell. Marlowe goes beyond his usual work to the summertime getaway places of his time. Filled with twists and turns as well as the gritty dialog that I didn't expect from Chandler. The Lady in the Lake is a good book that delivers the mystery and what not he is known for. This has been my favorite summer reading book yet."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I really wish I could have liked this book. It was my introduction to Raymond Chandler. However this turned out to be a really boring novel. I found very little to like in the character of Philip Marlowe. The book was too confusing and too slow at points. The idea of Marlowe being asked to investigate the disappearance of a mans wife - and soon the body of her lover turns up, and then the dead body of a young woman was drowned in a lake. However in the hands of a writer like Agatha Christie (who I have very deep respect for) this could have been a mystery which I would want to read over again. Instead, I just wished to end this book and get it overwith. Since I am a somewhat forgiving reader, I might try Raymond Chandler again - except now I know to barrow his works from my local library, and not to purchase them from the bookstore."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"If Earnest Hemmingway wrote detective novels, this would be the result. Straight, to the point, in your face narrative by Phillip Marlowe makes these books hard to put down. The Lady in the Lake has more &quot;gotchas&quot; then the normal Marlowe story, but the main thing is still not some wild whodunnit but rather a simple crime explained in a simple plausible way. The fun is in letting Marlowe describe the action sort of like John Madden describing football without all the grunts."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I feel this book could have been better if the basic themes presented in the content were not as predictable. On the other hand if that is what Raymond Chandler was looking for, a path in which the reader can easily recognize his work, than he has accomplished that. The book does have its good points, its story line is held together throughout the novel and the dialouge is good. Yet on the other hand it seems to be the same old hard-boiled story of mistaken identity and corupt cops and therefore in my eyes very unoriginal. &quot;You're from the big town,&quot; he said. &quot;You think you're tough and you're wise. Don't worry we can handle you. We're a small place, but we're very compact. We don't have any political tug-of-war down here. We work on a straight line and we work fast. Don't worry about us Mister.&quot; Said Webber to Marlowe."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I have read all the Chandler novels since about 1970, a few of them multiple times, but it had been at least a decade since giving him a full reading.&quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; is not as interesting to me as the movie version - which altered significant portions of the plot and which was shot entirely POV - but when the book is re-read, the brilliance of Chandler's prose stands out. His Marlowe is funny and morose and heroic (in context)... and approaches a difficult case in a way which seems very true to the man and the times.The man could write!!"},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Raymond Chandler certainly has a flair for terse dialogue and hardboiled metaphor, as well as knack for quick-sketching believable characters. But the active Philip Marlowe is the presence in THE LADY IN THE LAKE that kept this reader on the case. Reason: For me, narrators who seize the initiative are better in mysteries than narrators who are saved by dumb luck or the deus ex machina of improbable intervention.But let's be honest. Hasn't Chandler been surpassed by others writing in this genre? I read very few mysteries--only three in the last three years according to my Amazon.com reviews. But two of these mysteries show Chandler's limits. For example, NIGHT TRAIN (Amis) certainly surpassed this book in sparkling dialogue and metaphor. And, TELL NO ONE (Coben) has characters that are just as well drawn while its plot (admittedly farfetched) is just as surprising but never hard to follow.What THE LADY IN THE LAKE says to me is that an above average author can write to make a dollar and still do good work. I suppose the key is to work within a genre. Then, the genre keeps a middling author from overreaching, while making him mind his Ps and Qs. Such discipline enables a modest talent, like Chandler, to produce something beloved and lasting."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets gets a little off-track when he goes to the mountains in search of the inevitable exotic/diabolical 'missing woman' (as here, usually with a hidden past). Sure there is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the various \`dames' of the piece that caught me off guard but the plot line lost energy as it gathered steam trying to get up those mountain passes. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. Still, as always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I cannot praise this book enough. I was hesitant to try it after reading \\"The Big Sleep\\". Unlike TBS, this book wasn't too hard to follow, yet the connections between the characters were intriguing, and the insights that Marlowe drew were very good. The action is fast paced and Marlowe carries all the charm of Humphrey Bogart sweating under a porkpie hat chasing down all the leads in his vintage Chrysler. The sequences of Marlowe jousting with the police are priceless. And the shocking conclusion hit me hard, yet made perfect sense.I loved every minute of reading this thriller!"},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Chandler's Philip Marlowe is the prototype for all the hard-boiled private eyes who have come down the literary pike after him. Marlowe is never fully dressed unless he has a cigarette dangling from his lip. Always ready with cynical quips, he consumes distilled spirits the way the rest of us take in oxygen. And when it comes to solving a case, Marlowe never bends the rules. No, he ignores the rules completely.The Lady in the Lake starts off with Marlowe being hired by a business executive, who wants to locate his missing wife. She's described as being quite a handful. Young, blond and two times a maniac.....klepto and nympho. Within about two days, Marlowe runs across two dead bodies and finds that a death ruled a suicide 18 months before is really a covered up murder. The plot contains many unexpected twists and turns that serve to keep the reader interested and very curious about what is going to happen next. If I have any criticism of this book at all, its that a couple of the many plot devices seem a bit contrived.In describing people, places and things, Chandler does not spare the adjectives. His remarkable prose provides very vivid images of what is happening and thereby allows the reader to be transported right into the narrative.So, do yourself a favor and read The Lady in the Lake. You'll find out why Raymond Chandler's stellar reputation is so richly deserved."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"'The Lady in the Lake' by Raymond Chandler is one of those mystery novels you either love or hate: a murder mystery becomes more and more twisted as a super sleuth, in this case Chandler's Philip Marlowe character, almost magically answers all questions to the amazement of the reader. Regardless, this novel is certainly well-written ... complete with crackling dialogue and interesting characters.The story is very complicated. Yes, a corpse of a young woman is found in a lake. But there are actually multiple interwoven murders involved, tainted with adultery, drug usage, and greed. Philipe Marlowe is hired not to solve any murder but to actually find the missing wife of a rich businessman. He certainly gets knee-deep into problems and, of course in the end, gets out unscathed.Bottom line: a tightly written mystery that almost defies belief. Great reading enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Sometimes when I read Chandler I wish he could have found a way to break out of the formula and really let his imagination loose--just let all the poetry and over-too-soon bit parts fill the page. He seems more interested in everything else than the so-called plot. But on the other hand, maybe he hit it just right. The weirdness that is so compelling on the periphery of his writing might fall apart under the harsh light of center stage.Chandler's passing-glance encounters always have the quality of real, observed life. One of the least fussy writers who ever lived, his descriptions are effortlessly evocative. Here's Marlowe entering an empty house: \\"The room had a hushed warm smell, the smell of late morning in a house not yet opened up....In the silence time passed. It passed in the dry whirr of the electric clock on the mantel, in the far-off toot of an auto horn on Aster Drive, in the hornet drone of a plane over the foothills across the canyon, in the sudden lurch and growl of the electric refrigerator in the kitchen.\\" Chandler's gift was essentially lyrical."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"The Lady in the Lake, Raymond Chandler's fourth Philip Marlowe novel, was written just a few months after Pearl Harbor (published in 1943) but there are surprisingly few references to the war in it. Perhaps this reflects Chandler's take on how the war affected Americans of the day - that, unless a son or husband was in the military, everyday life went on pretty much as normal. Or maybe he simply did not want to clutter up his murder mystery with too many references to such a catastrophic world event. Whatever his reasoning may have been, The Lady in the Lake still holds up well when compared to most of the crime fiction being produced today.Philip Marlowe has been hired by Derace Kingsley, a perfume company tycoon, to find his missing wife, a woman Kingsley believes has run off to Mexico with her lover. As a place to begin his search, Kingsley points Marlowe in the direction of the couple's remote getaway cabin located in the California hills on Little Fawn Lake. While being shown around the site, Chandler and the property's caretaker, Bill Chess, spot a woman's body in the shallow waters of the lake. That is when Chandler realizes that he is dealing with something much more complicated than the search for a man's runaway wife.Raymond Chandler is deservedly well known for his noir fiction and The Lady in the Lake is representative of that style. The novel is filled with strong characters bordering on what have become almost stereotypical types in noir fiction, all of whom play their parts well but offer little in the way of surprises. Derace Kingsley is the hard headed businessman who has little time or respect for those who do not play in his league. Al Degarmo is a brutal cop so confident and high on himself because of his unchallenged power on the streets that he has no fear of ever being exposed. On the other hand, two of Chandler's characters do have a nice feel of authenticity about them: Bill Chess, the cantankerous caretaker at Little Fawn Lake, and Sheriff Jim Patton whose jurisdiction includes the lake area. Patton, in particular, is one of those memorable characters with whom most readers will easily identify.The flaw in The Lady in the Lake appears late. As the book nears its finish, Chandler's hardcore style morphs into what more resembles the Agatha Christie school of cozy detective fiction endings. Trapped in a small cabin with the person he believes is a coldblooded killer and the lawman that can make the arrest, Marlowe begins a monologue during which he notes and eliminates, one-by-one, the possible suspects. Marlowe does manage to spook his suspect into a fatal mistake, but it is always a letdown to the reader to have so much action take place \\"offstage.\\"The Lady in the Lake is not considered classic Chandler in the way that The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye, and Farewell, My Lovely are, but Chandler fans will not want to miss it."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Though I watched Big Sleep, I couldn't really understand what Bogart was saying and I remember sleeping thorough the movie.With this book, however, you can't help but like Marlowe, the action is fast-paced and doesn't seem dated at all.

Philip Marlowe was a hard boiled detective created by Raymond Chandler. Raymond Chandler is considered a major force is the development of private detective stories. Most of his novels were turned into movies.In The Lady in the Lady Philip is approached by a husband who is concerned about the disappearance of his wife. His wife has a shady side, which would hurt the man's business reputation, so he doesn't want to involve the police.Philip Marlowe then takes a roller coaster ride through murder, intrigue, threats, crooked police and so on. There were a couple twists along the way, but they were honest twists, the author didn't pull a rabbit out of the hat.The story is a page turner. I stayed up until 12:30 to finish it.If you enjoyed classic mysteries, then I think you'll enjoy The Lady in the Lake."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"As a follow-up toThe Big Sleepand on the recommendation of Amazon reviewers, I bought _The Lady in the Lake_. As much as I enjoyed _The Big Sleep_, this is head and shoulders (big, broad shoulders in a snap-brim fedora and zoot-suit) above the other noir novels (The Maltese Falconfor example) I've read. Chandler provides us with two mysteries (and therefore twice the femme fatales) overlaid starkly portrayed class divisions. The plot is typical Chandler (I'll let him summarize it): \\"Detective confronts murderer. Murderer produces gun, points same at detective. Murdere tells detective the whole sad story, with the idea of shooting him at the end of it. THus wasting a whole lot of valuable time, even if in the end murderer did shoot detective. Only murderer never does. Something always happens to prevent it. The gods don't like this scene either. They always manage to spoil it.\\"The gender expectations (and inter-relations) are vintage 1940s, and some of the colloquialisms are passe, but the creativity of metaphor (\\"Blue Ali Baba oil jars were dotted around, big enough to keep tigers in. There was a desk and a night clerk with one of those mustaches that get stuck under your fingernail.\\") and of course the dialogue (oh, that dialogue!) keeps me coming back. An added bonus is that there are no open-ended conclusions, and the resolution to the twin plots are neither intentionally obfuscated nor easily discovered. In this respect, it is among the higher-quality mysteries. For fans of Chandler, this is a no-brainer. For those unfamiliar with the author or the genre, this sets the bar pretty high in terms of expectations, but clearly among the better works."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"While Dracula, James Bond and Sherlock Holmes continue to be featured in movies, Philip Marlowe seems to have disappeared. I'm not sure why. Certainly, some of the previous adaptations have been among the best mystery films. Murder, My Sweet (an adaptation of Farewell, My Lovely) is arguably the first noir film. The Long Goodbye with Eliot Gould showed that Marlowe could transcend his WWII-era roots. And, of course, The Big Sleep is considered a true classic.Surely the most off-beat of the Marlowe adaptations would be The Lady in the Lake starring Robert Montgomery, a 1947 movie that showed everything from Marlowe's point-of-view. The source material for this film was the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name, which like most of his books, is a nice gem.The book opens with Marlowe hired by Derace Kingsley, a wealthy businessman who is seeking his missing wife. She disappeared around a month ago and was assumed to have run off with a ladies' man named Lavery; when Kingsley realizes this isn't the case, he brings in Marlowe.During the course of the investigation, Marlowe goes to Kingsley's Puma Lake cabin, where the caretaker's wife turns up drowned (hence the title). This is the first of several dead bodies that will turn up in the course of the book.Savvy mystery readers will pick up on the key twist easily enough, though it may have been more novel at the time. With a Chandler book, however, it's not the resolution that matters as much as the journey to get there: the wonderful Marlowe narrative brings alive the era in a way that a modern writer can't. It's not merely the descriptions but the voice of Marlowe that makes this book - almost 70 years old - seem a delight to read even nowadays."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I've read this book now three times in as many months. The first time I read it, years ago, I was nineteen. Much older now, I had to come back with a different perspective and try to see what Raymond Chandler was really up to. Entertaining the reader wasn't the point. Sending Marlowe into another violent beat down, like some of the other books, wasn't the point. Chasing down the mystery man, or woman, wasn't the point either.I can say this. Raymond Chandler, for those paying attention, penned a social portrait of the relationship that the public had with the police department at the time. This is a Dickensian social commentary on the the differences of two small town (at the time) police Departments. Santa Monica PD and Lake Arrowhead Sheriff's Deputies versus the public. What you get is two polar opposites.The book before this, my personal favourite, The High Window, also has an incredibly dark take of the Los Angeles Police Department during the late 30s early 40s. The Lady In The Lake though is to The High Window as what a film is to a snapshot. This being the film.Conan Doyle once stated as Holmes:\\"It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\\" [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892) Sherlock Holmes in \\"The Copper Beeches\\" (Doubleday p. 323)]I would place a heavy wager that after The High Window came out, some of his critics were probably roasting him for his heavy-handed and dark portraits of the LAPD, which were likely too spot-on and were trying to deflect a bit for them and making the exact same point that Doyle made. I would imagine this novel is the response to that, and from that context, this book reads like a chess move. Knight to Kings' 4. I would also imagine that he was probably hearing it getting louder throughout his career. If you've read the earlier books in the series, then you'll know exactly what I'm speaking of here. And yes, Chandler was very much aware and concerned in regards to his critics.One of the more interesting aspects of this story, is that every single Police Officer or Law Enforcement official is an archetypal figure. A known stereotype lifted straight from the modern vernacular of that day. These days, Police procedural are no big whoop. But back then, you'd be hard pressed to find a plethora of them or any as scathing. With high-profile crimes like Black Dahlia and many others, as well as folks like Weegee (Arthur Fellig), Los Angeles really was a hot-bed for corruption and cops who would sap a man dead rather than fill out a tiresome form.(Sheriff) Patton up at Puma Lake & Little Fawn lake (Arrowhead & Big Bear Lake) is the indomitable, savvy veteran Sheriff who suffers no fools but wastes no energy being impolite. When you think you have him figured, you'd guess wrong.Degarmo is the text-book ne'er-do-well who roughs people up, frames poor saps who cross his path and busts people he doesn't like for intoxication and saps them on the back of the skull. He's like the bad guy out of every detective novel with a badge. Sneer included. Toothpick and quick-draw intact. Every instance on the page of this character has the reader cringing from Degarmo's behaviour, choice of words and inappropriate decisions.Webber, Chief over in Santa Monica - or Bay City as Chandler always referred to it, is the out of touch, administrative, trusting General who probably doesn't know half the business his men are getting into and is usually late to the scene on every occasion. He becomes an interesting character, quickly, once he's unearthed. It's curious that Chandler writes so snidely though about Santa Monica Police of this era, but perhaps he knew something back then that we don't, as readers, have a bead on anymore.Someone's going to mince words with me about Bay City being Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades, but in this context, we know that Chandler was writing about Santa Monica, while some of the victims did reside in Pac Palisades. Hope that clarifies it.All the other detectives and beat patrolmen do nothing but ratchet up the tension with every appearance.So much ground is covered in this book, in such a detailed manner, that the reader never sees any of it coming and the idea of stays well camouflaged throughout most of the book. You think Chandler is trying to tell a complex story about a Doctor's wife that he might've worked out backwards, first, in order to write it out artfully, but I think that would lead down the wrong mountain path.The plot becomes so convoluted in fact, that it takes almost four pages towards the end, without much dialogue or paragraph breaks to explain how it all ended up the way it did. When it does, you're left not just scratching your head a bit, but a tad dazed. It's a mouthful of explanation that reads more like Agatha Christie than it does Raymond Chandler.He was on top of his game during this period and I doubt that something so obvious, at least to me, wasn't his main aim. Chandler was a master story teller and the Dickens' of his age. Chandler was writing very detailed essays during this era about the very thing that I've highlighted in this review. Social commentary in fiction. He also wrote a lot about Charles Dickens and was a definite fan.I don't think I'm the first person to state that the overall story is pretty ludicrous. By the time you get 170 pages in, if you're not smelling the set up, then you probably just coast through books half asleep as it is. Reading like it's some form of sedative while you're curled up in bed after a long day. That's not a crime, but it does set the reader up for only a quarter of the message of the book. Some people like it like that though....\\"Police business is a hell of a problem. It's a good deal like politics. It asks for the highest type of men, and there's nothing in it to attract the highest type of men. So we have to work with what we get.\\" -- Webber to Marlowe....\\"I'm all done with hating you. It's all washed out of me. I hate people hard, but I don't hate them very long.\\" -- Marlowe to Degarmo...."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"What appears to be a case of finding the whereabouts of a missing wife turns out to be much more, as is typical of Chandler to make things a bit more complicated once the first mystery is presented to us. Marlowe is summoned and hired by Derace Kingsley to find his wife, Crystal Kingsley. Crystal has apparently slipped town with another man and Kingsley, worried about public scandal, puts a price on finding her. Marlowe heads to Little Fawn Lake, a small resort away from the city, to find some clues, as it seems to be the last place she was seen. As with many Marlowe novels, the primary mystery leads to a few other puzzles, and, soon after arriving and speaking with one of the more eccentric characters, heavy drinker Bill Chess, Marlowe finds himself in the middle of quite a case, where people aren't really who you think they are and even if they are, you can't really trust them. After a mysterious death, the game is pretty much on for Marlowe, as he tries to understand the motives of a murderer, all the while dealing with some shady types and even corrupt cops.I read The Big Sleep awhile back and was sold on Chandler. The Lady in the Lake is another solid entry into the Marlowe series, the fourth book in the series, which takes Marlowe out of his usual Los Angeles surroundings to backwards Bay City and into Little Fawn Lake. There's something about Chandler's prose and style that is so fitting for the setting and pace of The Lady in the Lake. With Marlowe as his lead, the novel can change from cynical humor to exacting, gripping tension and suspense within moments. Marlowe's imperfect style of investigation really is what makes this novel tick, and he carries the torch for the narration, being able to read seedy people and dangerous situations. When there is a slip up, he has to worm his way out using those instincts he's had for years.The Lady in the Lake is a fine example of a noir classic, and Chandler illustrates why he is considered one of the finest writers of hard boiled detective noir."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"As a writer, historian, and detective novel enthusiast I have found Mr. Chandler's novels extremely interesing.

And then another murder. And then signs pointing to a possible third.

Usually about halfway thru one of his novels, I realize that I've gotten completely lost in the haywire intricacies of the mystery, but I was able to follow along this time. On a stylistic level, Chandler wrote some of the richest prose in the detective genre, and his snappy dialog is always a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"THE LADY IN THE LAKE was cannibalized from three novelettes Chandler published, two in Dime Detective, 'The Lady in the Lake' and 'Bay City Blues,' and a third from Detective Story, 'No Crime in the Mountains.' The coolest thing about THE LADY IN THE LAKE's cannibalization is that the novel and all three antecedent stories can be read enjoyably back to back as they have different responsible guilty parties. The chapter in this book where Marlowe steals into a neighborhood home and meets a woman on the stairs is the best scene Chandler ever committed to paper. I don't know why LAKE is my favorite of all Chandler's novels, but it is (hated the movie).Second place is THE LONG GOODBYE (loved the movie because of Gould's down-low portrayal of a Jewish Marlowe and despite Leigh Brackett changing Chandler's ending in her screenplay), go figure. I thought Chandler's black sheep Marlowe novel PLAYBACK was very good too, especially in conjunction with reading Chandler's unfilmed screenplay of the same name to augment the back story. THE BIG SLEEP and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY are classics, of course, but they're mid-list efforts in the canon to me. May I point out that's a very short list, seven novels, four novelettes comprising TROUBLE IS MY BUSINESS (with the original Dalmas and Carmady character's names changed to Marlowe) and the only honest-to-God short story Chandler wrote about Marlowe: 'The Pencil.'THE LADY OF THE LAKE displaces Marlowe from the streets of L.A. and deposits him in the sticks, an offbeat and great change of pace for the Hamlet of fictional private eyes."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Dont be turned off by the simplistic cover.

My first Marlowe book I read and I still reread it every spring."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Raymond Chandler began writing pulp fiction to make money. After British public school, he initially wrote romantic poetry. But there was no financial sustenance in that.Still, when you read this exceptional novel, poetry often peeps through. The reader is not only given a new vision of the world, but a new writing style and illusive phraseology (not quite simile, not quite metaphor, just Chandleresque) to express it. He also studied the underlying formulas of the Perry Mason series and understood the construction of a solid mystery. He seems to have led an incredibly tortured life and his writing output is amazing considering his handicaps. Alcohol, a \\"chaser,\\" of the \\"dark haired lovelies\\" and \\"neat little blonds,\\" as he would and does call them, a long albeit unstable marriage to a much older woman, amidst his strange, biting and hauntingly beautiful way with language, along with his native grasp of the elements of literary construction.The Lady in the Lake features, as do all Chandler's major works, Los Angeles P.I. Philip Marlowe. This book in particular stands out because Marlowe travels from his usual Los Angeles setting - at least a little ways into the mountains above San Bernardino. He is hired to find the missing wife of a business executive. Up in the mountains, he finds out that the wife of a caretaker is also missing. This begins a journey through a host of the most colorful characters imaginable.Chandler admired toughness. He thought that Humphrey Bogart (who played both Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade) was far superior to any other \\"tough guy,\\" including Alan Ladd and Dick Powell, because he can \\"be tough without a gun.\\" Who would disagree with him?He is sometimes criticized for leaving loose ends to stories. I spotted one in Lady in the Lake. During the filming of The Big Sleep, director Howard Hawks telegrammed Chandler to ask him whether the chauffeur, Taylor, was murdered or a suicide. Chandler had to admit that even he, the author of the story, didn't know.But I think that's what is enchanting about him. Who wants a neat package all tied up with roses when you read Chandler. The Lady of the Lake certainly takes the reader on one heck of a ride as seen through his frosty glasses and ingenious words."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"One of the fun things about Chandler can be familiarity with the LA area in which his tales take place. This time, Philip Marlowe goes sleuthing in the San Bernadino Mountains in a town that, in the real world, is named Big Bear Lake. Such surroundings allow the entrance of a different sort of character - the rustic lawman. It's a nice counterpoint to the city savvy Marlowe and distinguishes this novel from Chandler's others.Reading Chandler's Marlowe novels in quick succession may not the optimum way to enjoy them. While they remain suspenseful and entertaining, the genre requires a set formula that cannot vary overmuch from murder, blackmail and mistaken indentity. The only variance being who, where, and for what purpose. I suspect the intervals between original publication were the pause Chandler's contemporary readership needed.Nevertheless, The Lady in the Lake remains highly readable. At the climactic moment when Marlowe unravels the mystery, I found I couldn't put the book down despite needing to be elsewhere. Thus, Chandler's skill as a wordsmith compensates for any formulaic repetition. I found The Lady in the Lake second only to Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely in compelling, 40's-era detective fiction. It is another 5-star reading experience."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because of its fast pace and very involved plot. Philip Marlowe is really at his best here. By the end he has been beaten, manipulated, and framed for murder but manages to solve the mystery and come out as clean as a fat man's plate. One major element of the plot was a bit obvious however, namley the identity of the lady in the lake. There was still much to be revealed and discovered. This may be my favorite of the Marlowe series thus far. They are all great, so that is saying something."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Wayward wives seems to be the theme of Raymond Chandler's fourth Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;The Lady in the Lake.&quot; A man named Derace Kingsley hires Marlowe to find his missing wife Crystal, who has run away with a playboy named Chris Lavery. The problem is that Lavery is back in Los Angeles and claims he doesn't know where Crystal is. Then Marlowe finds out about the apparent suicide of the wife of a doctor that Crystal had been seeing. Searching for clues in Kingsley's cabin in the mountains outside San Bernardino, Marlowe meets Bill Chess, the caretaker of the cabin, who lamentably tells Marlowe that his own wife had left him recently. Shortly thereafter, Marlowe and Chess find the corpse of a woman drowned in a lake near Kingsley's cabin.To reveal any more information would not so much spoil any surprises as it would be a maddening exercise in convoluted logic. The plot is so highly complicated, in fact, that Chandler seems to have attempted to outdo even the novel's three predecessors (&quot;The High Window&quot; and the seminal classics &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;). As usual, his character development and use of dialogue and action are peerless, and of course he is the master of employing characters with disguised or multiple identities. And perhaps most importantly, he knows how to disclose information to the reader at just the right pace to maintain the proper amount of tension -- never stretched so much that all credibility goes out the window nor so little that the story becomes dull."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Raymond Chandler's The Lady in the Lake was a great book.

In the novel Lady in the Lake Chandler uses the hard-boiled detective genre to expand and progress the plot of the story. The use of exploiting the evil corruption of Southern California, which includes Los Angeles and San Bernadino, and surrounding areas show how everything is not what it seems. Though he practiced in a popular genre and was once dismissed as a serious writer, his works are now receiving the attention of scholars.

(I say \\"weakest\\" as opposed to \\"worst,\\" because, to paraphrase the cliche, reading Chandler is a bit like sex: Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.) But that's just it. It's not that this is a bad read by any stretch - it's head and shoulders above the best mysteries taking up space on the bestseller lists, and most of the mysteries ever published. But, because this is Chandler, it's held to a higher standard than disposable airline reads, and by that yardstick, it falls short.The story of this (the first Marlowe novel written after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor), like all in the series, starts simply enough: Our Hero is hired by a wealthy businessman to find his missing wife. And like all Marlowe stories, the case soon becomes much more complicated, leading Marlowe on a trail of twists and turns through some of the darkest shadows of his world until, at last, all is revealed.It is a fun trail to follow for the reader, if not always for Marlowe. Still, it doesn't match the intense intricacy of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY nor the lurid seductiveness of THE BIG SLEEP - both among the classics of 20th century literature. It even misses the layering of THE HIGH WINDOW, leaving a fun read without as much depth. Worse, the twists, while they might surprise or confuse readers fed on the whodunit simplicity of Agatha Christie, are, for devoted Chandlerites, more obvious. I guessed the titular lady's secret soon after she was found in the lake, and it was not too difficult to tie in several - although, I admit, not all - later twists.Still, Chandler is Chandler. His dry, intoxicating prose is here, as is his mastery of characterization. The most vivid supporting characters here are not Degarmo, the brutal cop heavy, nor Mr. Kingsley, the wealthy perfume baron, both of whom would fit into almost any Chandler novel. Rather, the scene-stealers are Bill Chess, the roughneck widower, and Sheriff Jim Patton, the law in a place that rarely needs him. These two are far removed from the Los Angeles back alleys, grimy motel rooms, rundown slums and mansions with plenty of closet space for skeletons that are Chandler's milieu, yet they become as real as old friends.Ultimately, writing a review of a Chandler novel is almost a waste of time. His devoted fans - among whose numbers I readily count myself - will want to own this no matter how many stars I give it; and those who prefer locked room whodunits with quirky old lady detectives aren't even reading this. Still, to those interested in finding out why Chandler has engrossed readers for decades, don't start here.

Laced with Chandler's wry commentary on everything from rich dames to down and out war veterans, this book is an absolute delight from the first page to the last. Classic Chandler. Sharp, funny, full of surprising twists, and always the most original prose around. Highest recommendation for an American \\"noir\\" novel."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Another noir classic by the master, in this episode detective Philip Marlowe finds crime as deadly in a lakeside resort as it is on the mean streets of the city of angels, and the body count mounts as the suspense builds and the plot twists. The character development is impeccable, the dialogue lively and bright and suitably sarcastic, and the plotting as convoluted as any Chandler classic would be likely to be.The mountaintop setting for much of the story lends itself to some poetic prose from the sensitive tough-guy with an eye for beauty and an ear for simile. The narrative flows easily as Marlowe unwinds the mystery to it's inevitable conclusion, observing, lamenting, and condemning the corruption and injustice of the American social structure while withholding judgement from even the most vicious and violent, in his typically refreshing blend of cynicism and naivete.The writing is spare and straightforward, but it's an illusion, an act of synergy, for the totality of effect is magnified beyond the sum total of the parts, proving that in literature as in art, less is more."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"A 2007 summer reading list mini review.I recently read a book celebrating the 100th birthday of Raymond Chandler. In the book, many current detective writers tell Phillip Marlowe stories and then explain the effect that Marlowe and Chandler had on their careers. The praise was glowing, and I picked up Lady in the Lake, to see if it was warranted. After the first chapter, I had an inkling the praise was justified. After the second, I knew.The story of a Marlowe trailing an executives missing wife is excellent, but it is Chandler's use of language in dialogue that is amazing. The following exchange happens late in the book when a desk clerk uses the word whom and the crusty cop with Chandler is taken aback:Degarmo spun on his heel and looked at me wonderingly. 'Did he say, \\"whom\\"?''Yeah, but don't hit him' I said. There is such a word.'Degarmo licked his lips. ' I knew there was,' he said ' I often wondered where they kept it. ...'The wise cracking atmosphere through the maze of dead bodies and corrupt officials is why I like Marlowe so much. And while there have been so many imitators through the years, I am amazed how fresh and innovative Chandler seems in comparison. Chandler and Marlowe are definitely worthy of all the acclaim."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Raymond Chandler has always been known for his eloquent prose, and the masterful way he creates his settings, but many hard-core mystery fans have not loved the fact that he can sometimes sacrifice the disciplined, mathematical puzzle for creating an experience. Not so in \\"The Lady in the Lake\\", which offers a vivid portrayal of Marlowe, gritty depiction of 1940's southern California, and a riveting mystery that buttons up neatly at the climax. This book is a fabulous guide to another reality which will provide hours of entertainment."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"I'd agree with just about everybody, this is great stuff by a master. He creates the atmosphere, he gets the style, he's got an endless supply of similes and fabulous bad quips, and of course the characters are terrific. Where this one resides in the canon doesn't interest me too much-I'm just glad he wrote more than Hammett did.What's amusing is that his plots are so complicated that he sometimes loses control of them, most notoriously in TBS. Alcohol probably contributed here. [[SPOILER ALERT: In this one, I couldn't figure out why Talley was apparently at the scene of Florence Almore's death (to steal the slipper), when in fact he'd been hired later by her parents to investigate her death. And then by the end Talley has entirely disappeared from view; we didn't even need him, really. I mean, the bit with the slippers was a bit of a contrivance anyway, I'd say.]]Some of the major plot turns are pretty obvious in this one, also, but that didn't really bother me. Overall it's so entertaining; these are just nitpicks. When I read Chandler, I feel like I'm home. The only problem is, reading him always makes me yearn for a shot of Jameson, and that's not always a good thing."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Chandler is notorious for beautiful prose and muddled plots, but most of the blame can be attributed to his first novel from 1939: The Big Sleep. Not every Chandler plot is confusing. Here we have Chandler at his prime with his fourth novel from 1943 and it has both a nice plot and all the famous prose. If you read some other comments about the plot COVER YOUR EYES!!! Part of the fun of the present book is the good plot. The less you know the better, until you finish, and I will not spill the beans on the beautiful plot.If you are new to Chandler, start with this novel or his second novel Farewell, My Lovely or perhaps the collection of four short stories from the 1930s: Trouble Is My Business. I bought all seven novels and two books of short stories - The Simple Art of Murder is his other collection of short stories - and consider the nine books to be mini-treasures. Of course, his first novel The Big Sleep is his most famous novel, made famous by the Warner's movie starring Bogart and Bacall, but the plot leaves one's head spinning.When Chandler was starting out as a writer, he had little money and was forced to live in very cheap housing in Santa Monica. There he saw the rampant police and city corruption in action where the powerful and the wealthy controlled the city. This was at odds with the citizen's perception that the city was law abiding, proper, and conservative. He uses that experience here as a partial theme of the novel, but he calls the town his fictional name of Bay City instead of Santa Monica. It is an extension of his earlier short story writing and his second novel Farewell, My Lovely. Detective Marlowe has his office in west LA - that is in Hollywood - and he seems to drift back and forth between LA and Bay City in many Chandler novels and short stories.Now that he is famous as a writer, and moved out of Santa Monica in late 1940, he seems to pull out all the stops and hits Bay City police broadside with this present 1943 novel that involves some out of control police. This Chandler novel contains many of the elements of his famous \\"film noir\\" period, noir being the reference to police and civic corruption, a lawlessness in Los Angeles based detective stories that often reflected real news crime stories. As I mentioned briefly, the plot involves Santa Monica, i.e.: Bay City, but also it moves off into the countryside near where Chandler himself lived briefly in 1940, and there are a few chapters set in the mountains, but that is just part of the novel.Like Chandler's other novels, it is one of the most beautifully written books ever published. The lines just flow and carry the reader along, seemingly effortlessly. The writing reminds me of some of Jack London's novels (1900) such as the Call of the Wild for the smoothness of the prose, but surprisingly Chandler might even be better and more refined. His technique was to pull old stories apart, then change them, then re-write them as short stories, and then take that work and extend it , modify it again a second or third time or even more, and finally put together complete novels. There is a high level of refinement and style that he was able to develop as a result of this writing process. This technique is not new. Shakespeare himself used this technique in virtually every play, taking old myths, stories, and historical accounts such as King Lear. He would break them apart, change them, and make new works with new twists, turns, and characters; his last play The Tempest is his thought to be his only completely original play. Chandler was aware of this parallel and would joke that if Shakespeare were alive he would be living in Hollywood working for the studios.5 star classic stuff."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"Except for PLAYBACK, there are no bad Raymond Chandler novels, there are only very good and great. THE LADY IN THE LAKE for the most part is close to great, though the transparency of the plot probably drops it to merely very good. Nonetheless, its virtues are the virtues of Chandler's best books, witty, unforgettable dialogue, marvelously drawn characters, and an attention to detail that places you on the scene of the crime. The book's vices are those of his other books: Chandler simply didn't care about plot. Except for PLAYBACK (where the problem with the book is that it takes Marlowe out of Los Angeles and like a fish out of water places him in a completely alien town), the problem with every Chandler book is the same, the minimal effort he expended on plot. Chandler realized (correctly, I believe) that plot was not the central element of a good book. If you say of a writer that they write great plots, it is usually taken as a backhanded compliment, meaning that they aren't good with prose, character, or setting. Even so, at least some attention should be given to plot. For Chandler it was something to be gotten out of the way as quickly as possible so that he could get on with the things that mattered to him. Of the Big Three of American hardboiled detective fiction (the other two being, of course, Dashiell Hammett and Ross MacDonald), Chandler was the weakest of the three with plot. But to prove how relatively unimportant an element plot is, the only one of the three to be good at plot, MacDonald, is usually considered the weakest of the three writers.If you have ever read a detective story, you will instantly grasp that the lady in the lake isn't whom everyone assumes it is. It is so obvious that it is almost a tad insulting as a reader to have the plot device employed so early in the book. But from that moment on the book is an utterly delicious read, with a string of grotesque characters (in the original sense of the word), delightful misunderstandings, and devious dealings. If in his earlier books the persistent message was the hollowness and superficiality of greater Los Angeles, here it is extended to the rest of the state as well. The cynical mockery that Marlowe extends to his adopted homeland is unceasing. When Marlowe finally does admire or compliment someone or something, he means something. He doesn't praise easily.The greatest part of any Chandler novel is the way he plays around with the English language. I usually don't mark or underline the novels I read (I underline nonfiction in pencil -- I think underlining in ink should be a federal crimes or at the very least books should be dispensed with a scary tag like pillows, making it sound like you will go to jail if you ink a volume), but I make an exception with Chandler. I love to pick up one of his books and go back and read the lines that most struck me at the time. Like:Dergamo spun on his heel and looked at me wonderingly. \\"Did he say 'whom'?\\"\\"Yeah, but don't hit him,\\" I said. \\"There is such a word.\\"Dergamo licked his lips. \\"I knew there was,\\" he said. \\"I often wondered where they kept it.\\"Or there are the unexpected and striking metaphors: \\"'Go on,' he said, in a voice the size of a marble.\\" Or \\"I let the remark fall to the ground, eddying like a soiled feather.\\"I think it is a mark of just how good Raymond Chandler is that despite writing in a disparaged genre, he has always been regarded by many writers and literary critics to be a great writer. Even in the forties many important arbiters of literary taste like Edmund Wilson recognized his talent. Ironically, Chandler's books, though they have long been critically acclaimed and have never gone out of print, were not big sellers. Though they made him a living, he had to work as a screenwriter to make most of his money (and he did some great work in Hollywood, having written some great screenplays like DOUBLE INDEMNITY for Billy Wilder [an imaginative adaptation of James Cain's short novel] and STRANGERS ON A TRAIN for Alfred Hitchcock]). Chandler probably has more readers today than he did while these books were being published. If by any bizarre chance someone is reading this review who hasn't read him, they should resolve to do so immediately. He truly is one of the best writers America has produced."},{"Title":"The Lady in the Lake (Otto Penzlers First Edition Library)","review":"During the Second World War's 'lights-out' period, Raymond Chandler wrote two Philip Marlowe novels in quick succession. The overall results were mixed: 'The High Window' (1942) was judged by Chandler as his absolute worst novel and still lacks the popularity of his others. 'The Lady in the Lake' (1943), while a best-seller, has an unusual approach that seems rushed and not entirely convincing. Chandler, as it turned out, would not publish another Marlowe novel for six years (until 'The Little Sister' in 1949), choosing to deal with other projects that included a film version of 'The Big Sleep' starring Humphrey Bogart.In 'The Lady in the Lake,' Chandler's fourth Marlowe novel, Philip is hired by a Los Angeles cosmetics executive, Derace Kingsley, to track down his wife, Crystal, who may have fled to Mexico with her extramarital lover. Marlowe is directed to the Kingsleys' vacation home on Little Fawn Lake in the rural California hills and faces a secondary murder case when he discovers an unidentifiable woman's body. Chandler again uses circular plotting, with Marlowe going through a nutty investigation before finding himself almost exactly where he began.'The Lady in the Lake' is a rather odd detective story, in that Chandler tries to focus entirely upon character. The book is steeped in dialogue; there is very little action, with Marlowe drawing his gun just once and never firing it. Chandler is at his stylistic best in the rural scenes, where he uses quiet, empty landscapes to build tension. Most impressive are his descriptions of the settings and use of animals such as birds and squirrels to color the situation at hand. Chandler pulls off genuinely eerie moments whose solitude carries an omen, sometimes in broad daylight.Unfortunately, 'The Lady in the Lake' wastes an opportunity to take Marlowe in new directions. Not enough time, for example, is spent at Little Fawn Lake; far too much of the novel reverts to inner-city houses and buildings, locations that are usual for Marlowe. Chandler fares brilliantly in the rural scenes, but we don't seem to hang around them for very long. Marlowe's investigation at Little Fawn Lake spans about fifty pages before we find ourselves back in a seedy hotel room.For a novel that emphasizes character, Chandler only scrapes the psychology that 'The Lady in the Lake' wants so badly to focus upon. Most of the characters are standard noir types of only modest depth: the dandy businessman, the sly secretary, the rogue lover, the uncouth policeman. Chandler also seems distracted by America's growing involvement in the Second World War, with its population living in a kind of 'safe haven,' oblivious to the battles raging across Europe and Asia (save for Pearl Harbor). There are moments when Chandler reveals his irritation towards the U.S. military's growing presence and America's wartime economy. Coupled with the other rough edges, it sometimes feels as if Chandler just wants to get things over with.And to top off this disappointment, Chandler's ending in which he reveals the murderer feels hacked out of a novel by Agatha Christie, one of the authors whom Chandler was known to dislike. Marlowe finds himself back in the Kingsley cabin at Little Fawn Lake and narrows down the suspects one by one, in typical whodunit fashion. The outcome isn't that much of a surprise and on the novel's last page, Chandler throws in a bungled message about the coming war. This ending feels tacked-on, as if Chandler wasn't entirely sure (or concerned) of how to end it.Despite its strong points, 'The Lady in the Lake' is no match for such novels as 'Farewell, My Lovely' and 'The Long Goodbye.' The plot is very much a hit-and-miss affair, sometimes with effective twists and sometimes contrived. The Lady in the Lake's storyline just doesn't crackle the way it should. Dialogue is generally up to par for Chandler, but there are moments when the speech is too formal or stilted. The novel may have needed a rewrite, which never happened; after sixty years, 'The Lady in the Lake' is a serviceable novel that fails to deliver in the clutch.Chandler will always be a superior crime novelist to most of his rivals. 'The Lady in the Lake' boasts a high level of craft and is worth sitting down for, but there are other Marlowe tales that could be read first. For curious readers and Marlowe completists, 'The Lady in the Lake' is available in a recent edition from Black Lizard, the crime label of Vintage Books. Black Lizard has released all of Chandler's Marlowe novels in art deco format with attractive cover art. 'The Lady in the Lake' is 266 pages long and retails at $13.95."},{"Title":"Tender the Storm","review":"TENDER THE STORM is the first novel of a trilogy by Thornton dealing with three siblings of the Devereux family during the tumultuous revolutionary period in the history of France. This was Zoe's story, the youngest daughter, though 17 because of her diminutive size she was able to pose as a schoolgirl of thirteen. Together, with a man she knew only as Rolphe, they fled across wartorn France to England. She was whisked away to a safe house with other French immigrants. Weeks later she would meet up with Rolphe again as he discovers that the 'child' he rescued was really a very beautiful young lady - only in his mind, he still saw her as the child. The attraction is there, and thinking to save her from the London streets Rolphe, Marquess of Rivard, makes her his wife, in name only, then abandoned her to his country estate and a less than enthusiastic mother-in-law. Zoe did her best, to live up to the role, as she was in love with her husband and the ideal she had painted of him as her stalwart rescuer.After an unfortunate incident of mistaken identities, a heart broken Zoe, takes the initiative and returns to France to nurse her broken heart, whereupon she divorces Rolphe and blossoms into the toast of the new French society. In the meantime, Rolphe has survived an assassination attempt and it is months before anyone tells him that she's left him.Underneath the romance, in which Rolph proves to be a real 'jackass' (not having a clue as to what ails his wife) there are the undercurrents of the espionage, secret societies, treachery, and greed which is brilliantly portrayed by this amazing author. If I were to rate this book based on liking the hero who simply acted like a 'man' - clueless in terms of recognizing what was going on in his life - yes I would not like this. Instead I see a sweeping novel with a slice of real history and a romance that took some time to come to it's enviable and sensual conclusion. I was not disappointed. I loved the rich characterizations of the players in this story and look forward to the next book in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Tender the Storm","review":"Sometimes my family teases me unmercifully because I happen to be a feminist who enjoys reading Regency romance novels. Well, even feminists need to (sometimes) escape into a realm full of romantic make-believe, where the heroine (in spite of the odds) wins the heart of the dashing hero, and where romance hero not only leaves you weak at the knees but also doesn't inspire you to commit acts of violence. Unfortunately, the hero of \\"Tender the Storm\\" (Rolfe Brockford, the Marquis of Rivard) turned to be exactly the kind of hero that inspires a headache, and leaves you wishing he'd fallen into a hole somewhere and was never rescued.\\"Tender the Storm\\" was first published in the early 1990s, and is the first novel in a trilogy that follows the adventures and fortunes of three French aristocratic siblings during the French Revolution. This first installment deals with Zoe, the youngest of the Deveraux siblings, who flees France, in the company of our hero (who is part of a network that rescues innocents from the guillotine) disguised as a school girl. From the very beginning Rolfe is attracted Zoe, but deciding that she is a young unsullied innocent and not for him, tries to put her from his mind. A couple of months later, however, Rolfe runs across Zoe in London, and makes it point to reacquaint himself with her. Unfortunately, because of his attentions Zoe becomes the object of the betting books when everyone starts betting on how long it will be before she ends up becoming Rolfe's mistress: Rolfe, you see, happens to have the reputation of a shameless rake. Angry, and determined to salvage Zoe's honour, Rolfe proposes marriage to Zoe. And she, because she's totally in love with her dashing rescuer, accepts happily. Unfortunately, instead of the happily ever-after ending Zoe was looking for, she has put up with being an abandoned and ignored bride, who is left in the country with an incredibly hostile mother-in-law, while her husband cavorts in town. (Rolfe's thinks that his wife is too young for marital relationships and has decided to keep his mistress until Zoe is 'ready' to be his wife.) How will Zoe cope? Well, what Zoe does next definitely sets the cats among the pigeons as Rolfe discovers that he will have to fight to regain his wife's trust and affections...Whether or not you enjoy this novel is going to depend on just how sympathetic you find Rolfe. Actually, he's starts off rather well, and is portrayed as being intelligent, daring and terribly efficient. It's only after he's married to Zoe that he suddenly becomes an incredibly selfish and autocratic oaf. I was not surprised by Zoe's actions at all. I only wondered why it took her so long! But if Rolfe made me feel bilious for much of the book, he made me nauseous in the manner in which he dealt with his (errant) wife once he caught up with her. I mean to actually bed her in spite of her protests to the contrary (all right she did succumb in the end, but it still made for uncomfortable reading, and did read like marital rape to me) in order to assert his authority over her? Either you must bend to my will or I will break you -- Rolfe warns Zoe. This is supposed to be romantic? Either my understanding of romance and love is in error, or else someone somewhere finds such scenes to be really erotically titillating! Our hero (or the authour) obviously never read Chaucer's \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\" or else the lesson never hit home. As for the heroine of this (very dated piece), Zoe Deveraux, while I rather liked her, I did long to shake some sense into the woman when she kept forgiving the caveman she had married and allowed him to run rough shod over her feeling and good sense.In my opinion, a romance hero shouldn't behave like Rolfe at all. And I know that I'm not alone in this since I've come across a great many books where the hero is not only debonair and dashing but also displays a level of sensitivity that I've found to be rather attractive and very romantic. And I rather wished that along with the decision to republish this novel, an editor somewhere had suggested that bits of the novel be rewritten as well. In my opinion, \\"Tender the Storm,\\" is not a very romantic read at all."},{"Title":"Tender the Storm","review":"I was surprised to see the generally very negative reviews. I thought this was a very good read. The doll incident was a laugh-out-loud moment, and the identity of Le Patron wasn't one I expected. Some might dislike the hero, Rolfe, for his Neaderthal views on the place of women in society, but I found him realistically portrayed for precisely that reason. He merely reflected the views of men two hundred years ago (sad to say, some men in the 21st century hold similar views!) He was patronising, high-handed and smug, butwas rather endearing in his way. A sensitive, new-age guy, he wasn't. Zoe was also protrayed realistically. Although I enjoy kick-ass heroines a la Jennifer Garner's character in &quot;Alias&quot;, the truth is, most 18th and 19th century women were more like Zoe than our modern misses with their rights and opportunities. Nonetheless, Zoe was very likeable for her quiet strength and honesty, not to mention a hidden temper, that could be nasty. I liked the fact that she was aware of her early hero-worship/infatuation, and that she was strong enough to go beyond it -- to make a break and to divorce Rolfe. She took control of her life to the extent that she was able to under the societal mores of her times, in other words.This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Tender the Storm","review":"I thought this was a great read!! It had many twists and turns in its plot everytime I thought I knew what was going to happen next, this was a surprise waiting on the next page. Its a great escape your dull or busy life book.

However, this is not one of her best. Too long, too long-winded, too detailed.Read other reviews for plot-lines as I am concerned only with writing styles. Actually, the two protagonists hardly caused a ripple in my reading hours, but I continue to look for her books as they are usually way above the rest!

She was a student of Louis Graveure among others, and her studio was always bustling. Her book is just like Florence herself - full of personal anecdotes, interesting insites and conversations with great conductors, singers and anyone else she found interesting. This book contains many very specific exercises and diagrams of the voice. It contains a very good &quot;basic repertoire&quot; for classical singers as well. She not only taught classical voice but singers such as Marilyn McCoo of the Fifth Dimension. Her voice sounded like that of a thirty year old well into her nineties. She was a great teacher and hunman being. This book is a real witness to the life of a teacher who really &quot;knew her stuff&quot; and gave her full energy and intellect to the art of teaching voice. The book is spiral bound, and rather tightly, at that.

Ana's relationship with one of the young victims adds dimension to Ana's character and engages the reader in the hunt and capture of the suspect.The other characters in the story, however, are so thinly formed that they add no veracity to the rather incongruous turns in the story. One co-worker that had a friction filled relationship suddenly comes to Ana's aid, while another character moves from a bereaved widow to a crazy killer.A truly unbelievable relationship is Ana's so-called obsession with Andrew Berringer of the Santa Monica PD. The reader is not given any opportunity to begin to understand Andrew or the relationship he has with Ana. It is difficult to believe that Ana risks her much loved career not once, not twice, but three times for someone that you can't really feel her connect with.Overall, Good Morning Killer is a relatively quick read. The strength of the abduction plot is flawed by the sub-plot with Ana and Andrew. Although I enjoyed the book, I found I began skimming through the final portion."},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"I unfortunately have to agree with some of the other negative reviews of Good Morning Killer. I read North of Montana when it came out and loved it, and in fact re-read it to refresh my memory before settling in with this book. What a disappointment! I found myself unable to even finish the book (I basically just skimmed the last few chapters to get the general idea) as it deteriorated into an unbelievable mess. Ana's relationship with Andrew was not developed enough for me to want the details of the inevitable train wreck. While I like April Smith's writing style, this book's storyline was unbelievable. Also, I found myself wondering if the book's events were somehow supposed to take place BEFORE North of Montana, since there was no mention whatsoever of the fling with Donnato and the fact that he was supposedly getting a divorce at the end of North of Montana.

Ms. Smith takes us down one plot path and then suddenly veers off the road, goes another way entirely. The way all the plotlines converged was very effective. And I had no problem with the characters or their believability. Ana and Andrew were drawn together because they recognized that they were both damaged -- by their sad, empty childhoods and by the ugly things they had seen on the job. The way Ana so completely related to Julia, the teenage victim whose abduction she was investigating, made it plausible that she would feel great empathy for her lover. And then there was the lust -- a powerful motivation indeed. An earlier reviewer compared Ana to Kinsey Milhone. While I appreciate Grafton's heroine enormously, I think Ana has more in common with Patricia Cornwell's brilliant but deeply flawed Kay Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"I can't add anything to all the positive reviews, but I am glad I made a rule for myself not to read the blurbs on the book jackets!

Thus, it comes as no surprise that she gives one terrific reading of April Smith's follow-up to her highly popular thriller &quot;North Of Montana&quot; (1994).Los Angeles based FBI agent Ana Grey returns - she's as tough and savvy as ever. Ambitious? Of course. Irreverent? Always.With a story taken from today's front pages a 15-year-old girl has vanished. She was last seen at a mall close to her Santa Monica home. What happened? Was she abducted or did she choose to disappear? Granted, the girl had problems and she was hanging out at the Third Street Promenade, a tourist and entertainment mecca.Local police are on the job, but if it's kidnaping that's a federal offense. Enter Ana Grey. It doesn't take Ana too long to discover that other girls may also be in peril. A psychopathic killer may be roaming the streets. Ana places herself in jeopardy in order to track this sadistic murderer.Chalk one more hit up for April Smith and Christine Baranski!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"While I certainly understand why this book would not appeal to the average pulp fiction reader, I really enjoyed it because the protagonist was *not* the stereotypical female we've all come to know in the various series that are out there. In fact, I was reminded of Lorraine Page of the short-lived series by Lynda La Plante. I appreciated the fact that Ana Gray was so completely irrational during the course of this story.

Ana Grey is an FBI agent, and at the beginning of the story, she's in charge of the search for a serial rapist who victimizes underaged girls. His latest victim, kidnapped from a Santa Monica mall, is apparently only the latest in a string of girls he's run across in several states, some of whom are still missing. Ana and her fellow FBI agents, as well as the local police, must search for the rapist before he does his thing again and victimizes someone else.Meanwhile, Ana is romatically involved with one of the local cops, a Santa Monica detective named Andrew Berringer. Their stormy, rocky, on-again-off-again relationship is the second half of the story, and I won't tell you anything beyond mentioning that it goes in several surprising directions that I didn't guess till later, though I did guess one part of what was going on. It's interesting though, and the integration of this part of the plot into the larger story of how the serial rapist gets caught is interesting.While I enjoyed this book a great deal, there were a few plot twists that I guessed in advance, and one of the supporting characters so clearly needs psychological help that it's unbelievable that it wouldn't be afforded them, even insisted upon. This being said, this is still a good and interesting mystery."},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"This is an intelligent, fluent read with a driving plot and a central character that is appealing and never predictable.

Grey returns in GOOD MORNING, KILLER. She is hardworking, sharp and tenacious in pursuit of the bad guys, devoted to upholding justice. In her second novel, Smith explores the personality she has created in Ana Grey.Santa Monica is stunned when one of its daughters, Juliana Meyer-Murphy, is kidnapped. Grey is teamed with her lover, Detective Andrew Berringer, to solve the crime and return the teenage girl to her family --- if she is found alive. Tensions run high between the two law enforcement officers when the case takes them in different directions. On the one hand, Grey's authority supersedes that of the local police unit, while Berringer would prefer that the Feds remove themselves from the scene. Escalating extremes of emotion stretch the romantic relationship between the two to the breaking point, cooling off at best.Grey's persona is many-sided. She is often portrayed as too tough. The contrast between her soft maternal side and her dogged obsessive professionalism presents a woman with whom one has little empathy. Her relentless compulsion to solve Juliana's case takes her beyond the workplace. There, she has fragmented cooperation with her co-operatives by her erratic behavior.When the unsolved bank robbery case in which Grey first worked with Berringer resurfaces, she begins to cement the puzzle pieces into a nasty picture for the Santa Monica Police Department. Grey's love affair with Berringer becomes tempestuous when she realizes that he may have knowledge about the case that could blow the roof off his department. She also discovers that he has not been honest with her.Smith takes the novel down a twisting path when Grey simultaneously sniffs out the kidnapper who has brutalized Juliana and digs for evidence in the old bank robbery case. She will not give up the search for the brute that preys on young girls. But she antagonizes her team players with unrealistic emotion. In all, the suspense builds to keep the reader turning pages.Smith has not diluted the violence one expects with the capital crimes she writes about. Scarcely a breath can remove one scene of molestation from the next, however remote their connection. She describes Grey's struggle with Berringer in exacting detail and leaves little room for the question of Grey's guilt. Grey's dilemma becomes, not job stability, but the fight for her life.The conclusion brings her new self-awareness. She discovers a gentle side of herself that has deep compassion for all life. Empathy replaces raw passion.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"I had never picked up an April Smith novel before, but was intrigued by her lead character. The book had an excellent start, then went horribly wrong. Too many crimes, too many back stories, and a brilliant lead character who turned into a completely ignorant stereo-typical female-running-from-a-killer-in-high-heels victim. My first exposure to April Smith's work, will be my last."},{"Title":"Good Morning, Killer","review":"I read April Smith's first book, North of Montana, and enjoyed it. This book continues with the character of FBI Special Agent Ana Grey but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I agree with the reviewers who thought her relationship with her boyfriend, Andrew was not believeable. He was cruel, a cheat and a liar and yet she falls all over him right to the end. If April Smith's intent was to make Ana a doormat, she surely succeeded. The characterization of Andrew is very poor since nothing came through that would make him in any way loveable. He was a Neanderthal and her attachment to him doesn't ring true. In addition, I though she left several plot lines from North of Montana hanging. Her relationship with Donnato was just dropped with no explanation and we don't know for sure what happened to her grandfather. The characters all through the book were wooden and the plot was a little fantastic. This was a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Library of Violin Classics (Library of Series)","review":"If you think Chopin is the greatest violin composer of all times and if Vivaldi is your favorite Italian pasta, this book is for you! This is the most tasteless gathering of piano pieces adapted for the violin (several, quite conveniently, coming straight from the &quot;Library of piano classics&quot; by the same publisher), together with some over simplified and poorly edited opera music (a must in &quot;violin classics&quot;, right!), and even (is this a mistake?) a few actual violin pieces edited with comparable mastery."},{"Title":"The Library of Violin Classics (Library of Series)","review":"I am a music educator.

I am primarily a pianist and enjoy all of the accompaniment parts to the solo violin (which by the way can also be played on the flute.) This collection is outstanding. There are over 65 duet pieces by 33 different composers. Included in this collection are some of most well-known compositions from Bach, Mozart, Bizet, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, etc. I recommend this book highly to all of my advanced students. These selections range from intermediate to a bit more challenging. Every one of the selections is a real classic. I would also like to add that this book is bound together with a durable spiral binding which makes it stay firm on the piano. The print is also quite legible and easy on the eyes.

Needless to say, Sarah is not exactly open to another relationship so soon. However, as she helps her sister Rivka get her new art gallery organized, she is thrown into contact with Alex Caine, owner of a local restaurant, caterer, and money man for the gallery. Alex is just like William - classy, handsome, debonair - all those qualities that frighten Sarah and make her wary of entanglements. Even though they have nothing in common, can Sarah and Alex make their relationship work?This story is novel-length (197 pages), but it captures the reader so quickly that it seems much shorter. I was very pleased with this book and enjoyed it - the plot was well written, and fast-paced, and didn't throw in any weird plot twists, or have an unrealistic ending. Neither the hero nor the heroine are free from flaws, and each of them takes responsibility for some of the misunderstandings that occur. Sarah is a woman that I can empathize with, since she is full-figured and not classically beautiful, and finds herself in a position that I've been in myself. Alex, on the other hand, is the guy I've always dreamed of throwing himself at my feet - Yum! His surprise at having the relationship tables turned on him is priceless. The secondary characters, Rivka and her husband Mickey, and the individual employees of Alex's restaurant, are realistically drawn, and emerge from the generic background with well-defined roles and motivations. There are several sexy love scenes between the hero and heroine that are fairly explicit, but more sensuous than graphic. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Nothing in Common","review":"Great.

Basta el saber quien es el autor para decidir leerla.La historia ocurre en una imaginaria &eacute;poca colonial. Tiempos de cucufater&iacute;as, en las que los esquemas estaban pre-establecidos por s&oacute;lo Dios sabe quien. Tiempos en los que la gente cre&iacute;a poder decidir el destino de los dem&aacute;s, como lo hicieron con Cayetano, un sencillo eclesiasta cat&oacute;lico, y Sierva Maria de Todos los Angeles, una ni&ntilde;a olvidada por sus padres -un noble venido a menos por su caracter indiferente, a quien no le importaba absolutamente nada, ni su propia hija; y su madre una mujerzuela que decidi&oacute; consevirla con la &uacute;nica finalidad de ser la esposa de un noble-.Debido al abandono espiritual de sus padres ella es criada entre esclavos. Los negros le hab&iacute;an ense&ntilde;ado todo acerca de su cultura: lenguaje, religi&oacute;n, danzas. Hab&iacute;a adquirido la humildad y conformismo de los esclavos; su mundo era la barraca, su familia ....los negros.Un buen d&iacute;a su padre, el segundo Marquez de Casualdero, nota que su hija mostraba una herida en el tobillo y es informado que un tiempo atr&aacute;s hab&iacute;a sido mordida por un perro. Preocupado por su salud lleva a Sierva Maria a un m&eacute;dico jud&iacute;o con ideas bastante discordantes con la &eacute;poca. Al no poder conseguir que su hija sea curada el Marquez relaciona su &quot;enfermedad&quot; con hechos ocurridos previamente. La escuch&oacute; hablar en una lengua que &eacute;l no comprend&iacute;a (un dialecto hablado s&oacute;lo por los esclavos), la veia bailar con movimientos extra&ntilde;os y, adem&aacute;s su sigilo al aparecer de sorpresa en lugares donde no se le esperaba -ella parec&iacute;a un fantasma-, llev&oacute; a su padre a creer que estaba pose&iacute;da por el demonio y decide que la iglesia deber&iacute;a hacerse cargo de Sierva Maria. De esta manera la interna en un convento y, nuevamente, se desentiende de ella. Su comportamiento en este lugar fue el mismo, pues ella hab&iacute;a nacido blanca pero criada negra y nadie iba a lograr cambiar a alguien que siempre fue y ser&aacute; la misma. Sorprendidas por su comportamiento &quot;anormal&quot; (los humanos tenemos un concepto muy especial sobre lo que debe ser normal y que no) y llegan a la conclusi&oacute;n que deben exorcisarla. Esta misi&oacute;n es encomendada a Cayetano quien en sus breves, pero bien aprovechadas visitas, se enamora de Sierva Maria.Sabiendo de lo que significaria para la iglesia decide azotarse creyendo in&uacute;tilmente que, empleando ese m&eacute;todo de auto-castigo, ese amor desaparecer&iacute;a. Al darse cuenta que era imposible se lo confiesa a su superior. Cayetano fue prohibido de futuras visitas al convento. Sin embargo, el amor hacia esa hermosa mujer hace que trepe muros y evada a las ocasionales vigilantes del calabozo donde hab&iacute;a sido encerrada su dama. Le escribe cartas y cita poemas de amor, uno de los que recordar&eacute; toda la vida es este: Por ti tengo la vida/ Por ti vivo/ Por ti he de morir (Garcilazo de la Vega). Poco despu&eacute;s ambos hicieron el amor por primera y &uacute;ltima vez. Cuando &eacute;l hab&iacute;a decido escapar con su amada, Sierva Mar&iacute;a de Todos los Angeles hab&iacute;a muerto. En su af&aacute;n de sacarle el demonio del cuerpo la maltrataron tanto que muri&oacute;. Pudieron m&aacute;s las creencias y estereotipos existentes que el amor m&aacute;s puro y tierno de dos hijos de Dios.Despu&eacute;s de esto Cayetano Da Silva fue trasladado de lugar, asign&aacute;ndosele otro cargo de menor grado por el &quot;pecado&quot; cometido. Pero nadie podr&iacute;a hacer que olvide a su amada porque de seguro que &eacute;l siempre la so&ntilde;ar&iacute;a comiendo del mismo plato de uva .... y las uvas jam&aacute;s se le acabar&iacute;an.La m&aacute;s bella historia de amor que nunca antes hab&iacute;a le&iacute;do. Si usted deja caer unas l&aacute;grimas no se preocupe que es Gabo exprimi&eacute;ndonos el coraz&oacute;n."},{"Title":"Del amor y otros demonios / Of Love and Other Demons (Spanish Edition)","review":"En Del Amor y otros Demonios la intolerancia cristiana juega un papel muy importante, si no el principal. La obra nos traslada a una &eacute;poca en que la Iglesia es el eje alrededor del cual gira la sociedad y en que las autoridades eclesi&aacute;sticas gozan de mucho poder. En las colonias hispanas, la Iglesia cumple una estricta funci&oacute;n evangelizadora y debido a la firmeza de sus preceptos, no tolera que ninguna otra cultura amenace o contradiga su autoridad.Sierva Mar&iacute;a de Todos los &Aacute;ngeles es v&iacute;ctima de esta intolerancia. Nace en el seno de una familia cristiana, pero vive entre esclavos a causa de la indiferencia de sus padres. Podemos decir, entonces, que ella es una mezcla de ambas culturas. Ella aprende las costumbres africanas, celebra sus ritos, come sus platos y habla su lengua a la perfecci&oacute;n, sin que sus padres se preocupen por ella o interfieran en su vida. Sin embargo, esto no impide que ella sea feliz e incluso &quot;en aquel mundo opresivo en que nadie era libre, Sierva Mar&iacute;a lo era: s&oacute;lo ella y s&oacute;lo all&iacute;&quot; (p. 19). En realidad, como dice su propia madre, &quot;lo &uacute;nico que tiene esa criatura de blanca es el color&quot; (p. 63).Al enterarse que su hija fue mordida por un perro rabioso, el marqu&eacute;s decide reintegrarla al mundo en que naci&oacute; creyendo que as&iacute; la har&iacute;a feliz y le devolver&iacute;a la salud. Sin embargo, no pudo lograrlo y opta por dejarla en manos de la Iglesia. El obispo interpreta sus convulsiones y sus alaridos en &quot;jerga de id&oacute;latras&quot; como &quot;s&iacute;ntomas inequ&iacute;vocos de una posesi&oacute;n demoniaca&quot; (p.76). La ignorancia es tal, que se piensa que &quot;entre las numerosas argucias del demonio es muy frecuente adoptar la apariencia de una enfermedad inmunda para introducirse en un cuerpo inocente&quot; (p.76).Los cristianos no son capaces de ir m&aacute;s all&aacute; de lo que dice la Iglesia; no pueden darse cuenta que los gritos desesperados de Sierva Mar&iacute;a son consecuencia de las pr&aacute;cticas de los curanderos que por ejemplo, le lavaron la herida con su propia orina y se la hicieron beber. Adem&aacute;s, pareciera que el obispo o la abadesa creyeran que lo mejor que pueden hacer por la ni&ntilde;a es encerrarla en una celda, mantenerla en terribles condiciones y finalmente, someterla a una serie de exorcismos tan crueles como innecesarios. Cayetano Delaura se da cuenta de la injusticia que se comete con la ni&ntilde;a y aun le insin&uacute;a al obispo que, en realidad, lo que les parece demoniaco &quot;son las costumbres de los negros, que la ni&ntilde;a ha aprendido por el abandono de sus padres&quot; (p. 126), pero sus palabras son inadvertidas. Siguen viendo al demonio en una ni&ntilde;a que simplemente no sabe comportarse en un mundo con costumbres tan opuestas a las suyas. Para la Iglesia es inaceptable que una ni&ntilde;a blanca se comporte como negra y por lo tanto, creen que las costumbres africanas amenazan su cultura.Abrenuncio tambi&eacute;n es discriminado por la comunidad cristiana. &Eacute;l es jud&iacute;o y portugu&eacute;s, &quot;el m&eacute;dico m&aacute;s notable y controvertido de la ciudad&quot; (p. 27). Los otros m&eacute;dicos no perdonan sus aciertos inveros&iacute;miles ni sus m&eacute;todos ins&oacute;litos y por este motivo es perseguido por el Santo Oficio. Adem&aacute;s, es partidario de la eutanasia en caso enfermedades terminales y considera que s&oacute;lo los buenos cristianos son capaces de cometerla. De los exorcismo, opina que entre eso y las hechicer&iacute;as de los esclavos no hay mucha diferencia, &quot;y peor a&uacute;n, porque los negros no pasan de sacrificar gallos a sus dioses, mientras que el Santo Oficio, se complace descuartizando inocentes en el potro o as&aacute;ndolos vivos en espect&aacute;culo p&uacute;blico&quot; (p. 98). Por ser tambi&eacute;n objeto de la intolerancia cristiana, Abrenuncio comprende a Sierva Mar&iacute;a y se compadece de ella.Finalmente, cuando Cayetano confiesa su amor por Sierva Mar&iacute;a, la Iglesia tampoco lo puede tolerar y menos a&uacute;n, porque &eacute;l es cura. Incluso en nuestros d&iacute;as, es muy probable que gran parte de la sociedad lo considere un exceso inmoral.Esa intolerancia religiosa, en mi opini&oacute;n, no es m&aacute;s que sin&oacute;nimo de injusticia e ignorancia. La Iglesia crey&oacute; estar en lo correcto sin siquiera tomar en cuenta las ense&ntilde;anzas referentes al amor y la fraternidad, y s&oacute;lo consideraron pr&oacute;jimo al hombre blanco. Tal vez la Iglesia ya no tenga el poder que tuvo antes, pero de algo s&iacute; estoy segura: ahora y siempre ha habido gente que ha llevado la religi&oacute;n m&aacute;s en las rodillas que en el coraz&oacute;n."},{"Title":"Del amor y otros demonios / Of Love and Other Demons (Spanish Edition)","review":"la intolerancia, la ignorancia y la supersticion caracterizan esta historia, tambien el amor, ese pequeno demonio que esta dentro de todos nosotros latente esta ahi, en medio,al comienzo y al final de esta obra.una obra corta, consederando los libros de garcia marquez como el amor en los tiempos de colera y cien a&ntilde;os, pero con un ritmo incomparablemente bien llevado y de un realismo magico insuperable. esta pequena obra les hara disfrutar de un garcia marquez en la plenitud de su obra.

Her mother is a slave trader, who didn't love her; her father is a man abandoned to his fate and since he hates his wife, therefore he hates his daughter.

But even if you haven't read the first book, you'll enjoy the second as it stands on its own. And it more than stands: it shines. In TEMPTATIONS, Hergenrader deals with issues every teen faces daily: issues of trust, morality, and tolerance. Caroline and her friends Katy and Phil have strong beliefs about what's right and wrong, but Caroline's new boyfriend Mark doesn't necessarily share them. In the past, he partied, dated a lot, and even had sex. Caroline struggles with her feelings about Mark's past. When she invites him to a church youth retreat, what should have been an ideal opportunity to spend time together, turns into a shouting match and raises more questions than answers. Pretty soon Mark is hanging around with his old girlfriends, and Caroline has to wonder if he's back to his old ways. Are they broken up or do they still have a chance? Mark tells Caroline he loves her, but can she love someone who doesn't share her strong convictions?Like LIES AND DECEPTIONS, TEMPTATIONS engaged and challenged me. Though this book is geared toward teens, I found myself questioning my own beliefs and exploring them. It's original, well-written, and the characters are truly engaging. I can't wait for Katy and Phil's story! And if we're lucky, Caroline will show up again. She's a heroine you won't forget."},{"Title":"Temptations (Novel Devotions)","review":"I loved this book.

The detailed biographical information is superb and had to have taken years to compile. The amount of information on uniforms is extremely impressive. The best part of this book is that it deals with the common soldier more than the officers. I like that part as the common soldier's were the one's who fought that war and died. Officer's always get the credit, but it was the common farmboy soldier who fought. This book is enormous and it took me a long time to read. I am eagerly awaiting the 2nd volume, but I will give it time as I understand how hard it would be to write such a comprehensive book.

It is nice and well structured in terms of economics of the firm. However, from a viewpoint of an economic geographer, some of papers which talk about economic geography of the corporate organisation are too plain, old fashioned.

New omnibus editions of The Demon Princes, the Alastair novels, \\"The Dragon Masters\\" and the Planet of Adventure novels have been put into print. But nobody has yet reprinted the Durdane Trilogy, presumably because the publishers don&#8219;t think there would be much interest. On the other hand, many Vance devotees list this trilogy among their favorites.Clearly Durdane is not typical Vance work. Compared with his other books, \\"The Brave Free Men\\" has only a few instances of humor, little sparkling and delightful prose, and none of those famous Vance societies that seem completely insane yet also entirely plausible. (Which isn&#8219;t to say that the book doesn&#8219;t unfold in a strange society. Rather, we never get a full explanation of what life in the various cantons is like. Instead, we must make do with tantalizing hints and brief glimpses of odd behavior.) The writing is quite plain, and the action is straightforward. Gatzel Etzwane, possessing the tools to manipulate Torcs, sets out to reorganize Shant for war. His adversary: the Roguskhoi, mysterious man-apes who roam the interior of the continent. Etzwane finds numerous obstacles to his efforts: rigid social structure, inadequate technology, and an apparent conspiracy among high-ranking officials. There are ample plot twists and turns, and an ending that explains all the mysteries and apparent contradictions.As I said, the book is a departure from Jack Vance&#8219;s typical style. The dry irony is mostly gone. Perhaps Vance felt like trying a story with plain style, so that he could focus on plot complexity. Indeed \\"The Brave Free Men\\" starts off with an apparently normal pace. At the end, however, you realize that quite a lot has happened, for a novel of only 250 pages. In that respect, \\"The Brave Free Men\\", though not Vance&#8219;s best, is well worth reading.A final note: The Durdane Trilogy is, in fact, a trilogy. It contains three books, no more and no less. Various editors and publishers muddied the waters by printing books under two different titles for their own strange purposes. Here are all the titles:Book 1: \\"The Anome\\", also published as \\"The Faceless Man\\"Book 2: \\"The Roguskhoi\\", also published as \\"The Brave Free Men\\"Book 3: \\"The Asutra\\"All three have been out of print for twenty years, so you&#8219;ll have to search through libraries, Z-shops or old dusty used book stores to get them. As you do so, remember to try looking for the alternate titles."},{"Title":"The Brave Free Men","review":"A terrific sequel to \\"The Anome (aka \\"The Faceless Men\\") which moves the storyline along at breakneck speed. Gastel Etzwane continues his investigation into the who, and where, of the Anome, as well as finding Finnerack and iniating a war with the Roguskhoi. The ending of this story, the second book in the trilogy, is simply amazing, once again establishing Vance as a brilliant and original inditer whose eclectic verbiage raises the bar for all authors, present and future, who write in this genre!"},{"Title":"The Brave Free Men","review":"Vance has created another consuming world with this book; rich with culture and mystery. A young man find himself in a uniques position to affect change.Here, you find Vance creating one of his famous characters; hard, ruthless if necessary, clever and quick-witted and brave. In this instance, unlike others, this charcter Gastel has not receievd advanced training as a scout (Adam Reith - Planet of Advanture) or trained to be a killer by his grandfather(Keith Gersen - Demon Princes).In this instance, we see how it is possible for this toughness to be created from thin'ish' air. Perhaps, the tough, ruthless chararacter is one of Vance's favourites.Another classic from the master, nontherless."},{"Title":"The Brave Free Men","review":"The Durdane saga is vivid in every details.

Beard is a genius and a truly great writer of history. I am a high school student that is in love with American History and I am sure that any lover of history will enjoy this book as much as I am enjoying it this very moment.

For example, the authors endeavor to ferret out the causes of the Civil War and make clear the number of socioeconomic factors that were involved in the two entirely different ways of life in the North and South. They assign slavery its proper place, but point out that the slave trade had been outlawed and give figures on the number who were being freed. They tell what was known then about mechanized means of picking cotton that in a few more years would have eliminated slavery completely without the loss of more than 600,000 American lives. In this bright light of truth, Lincoln comes through as something less than the hero he is regarded as today.At the least these two volumes will present facts that have not received balanced treatment for more than 30 years and stimulate your thinking..."},{"Title":"The rise of American civilization","review":"This classic account of the the rise of american civilization has long been out of print.

This methodology paid good dividends as I passed the test with a score of 900 (Passing was 776, and there were 30 questions). I found the content of this book much more current than Exam Prep's. I also liked the format based on the test objectives. This book also helped me understand other important topics such as WINS and DNS, which were barely skimmed on the Exam Prep book (and which appeared on the exam in more than one occasion) You will notice that the book is full of study questions and sample tests, which definitely are a plus for test review, although I honestly tell you that I skipped most of the fill-in-the-blanks, True-False type of questions. On the other hand, I literally memorized every multiple-choice from the sample tests in the book, and there were plenty. I recommend following the author's guidelines about using this book: Complete and review all the sample tests, including the final review, with the expected results (85% or more correct answers) and I assure you that it works. The exam was not even close to the final reviews from this or the Exam Prep book, but with the practice obtained, I was able to tackle the 70-058 with confidence.

However, I would have rated the book even higher if it had contained more scenario type of questions (this book has only 1 out of about 200 practice questions), as these questions came up about 10 times in my exam. Also, there are some inconsistencies between this book and some other text (particularly Microsoft Press' Self Study Kit). Differences like the cheapest cabling method, wireless transfer rates, bridges' capabilities, etc, could confuse some readers. However, I guess Microsoft realises that there are many different implementations and interpretations of technologies in the industry, so these controversial questions (which different books give different views) did not pop up in the actual exam (not in mine anyway). There is however, one obvious technical error in the book: it describes that the parity information in RAID 5 is stored on one dedicated HDD only. In fact, the parity information is spread across all hard disks."},{"Title":"MCSE Test Success (TM): Networking Essentials","review":"This book is very good if you have some networking experience and/or a decent understanding of LAN and WAN technologies and how they work.

This book did not TEACH the concepts very well. However, the questions on the actual test are in the form of &quot;adaptive testing&quot; (which means that the questions change depending on the responce of previous questions) and there is no way to simulate that. The BEST way to prepare, once you think you've learned the concepts, is to get questions asked. The toughest questions were those of the &quot;scenario&quot; based, not the ones that would ask you &quot;how many netbios name characters are available for use for your naming scheme?&quot;In addition to those they WILL ask you how to set up an optimum netbios naming scheme. This book covers both types of questions but to answer those scenarios questions the best thing to really understand those concepts and also to have some experience. To understand the concepts, I like the book from the QUE publishers called: &quot;Networking essentials&quot; and the author was Dan York. the microsoft book was pretty lame in explaination and had a LOT of errors in it. My advice: buy this book and buy the QUE book. The QUE books ISBN number is:780789711939. Yes the QUE book is expensive but you'll need it to learn the concepts. Use this book and the QUE book, study your brains out.

Being a Russian citizen, I discover that it truthfully depicts the history of my country and gives a very thorough picture of what has happened in it before, during, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The authors go to great lengths in order to convey their knowledge to the reader and I very much appreciate their work and effort."},{"Title":"Revolution from above: The Demise of the Soviet System","review":"This is an important book about the cause of the defeat of Soviet Socialism. \\"Revolution From Above\\" identifies that cause as the betrayal of socialism by Russia's elite state and party administrators. The Russian elite was ideologically corrupted by western propaganda and they were materially corrupted by their elite privileges over ordinary workers. The defeat had more to do with the pressures of capitalism on the Soviet elite than with the failure of Marxist Socialism. Based on the content of the book, the catchy title is obviously wrong. The end of Soviet Socialism was hardly a revolution. It was, as the authors make clear in all their arguments, a counter-revolution that restored the same system of capitalism that prevailed in WW1 Russia and was overthrown by the REAL revolution of 1917. Throughout this otherwise wonderful book, the authors constantly point out the backward and reactionary character of the 1990s \\"Revolution\\" that wrecked the living standards and betrayed the naive expectations of the Russian people. They just can't bring themselves to use the word \\"Counter-Revolution\\". Why not?The loss of the USSR triggered the defeat of most of the world's socialist states and led to grave setbacks for workers everywhere. Since the fall of socialism, the capitalist countries, led by the USA, have embarked on new wars of conquest without having to fear a credible military response to their aggression. Coupled with these ever expanding wars, have been worldwide slashes in workers living standards and coordinated repression against organized labor and minorities. Yet all this war and repression has not prevented the implosion of capitalism in 2008.As I am writing this review, in October 2010, workers in France and Italy are in the streets, fighting for their futures against their rulers, who are determined to make the workers pay for this latest collapse of capitalism. If the workers win in Europe, they could rejuvenate labor in the West, and perhaps even stiffen the spines of American labor leaders.The brightest hope for socialists today is the spectacular success of the Peoples Republic of China -- a socialist achievement built on defying the conventional wisdom of the neo-liberal economists of the United States. It is a beacon of hope for humanity and the best verification of the superiority of socialism over capitalism. China has steadily increased state spending and social spending, pushing its economy to record levels of growth and expansion while raising the living standard of the working class, years after year. By contrast, the one-trick-pony of American Capitalism is cutbacks. Slash workers wages, lay them off, fire them, cut production, and wait for wage level to fall low enough for a new profit surge. In the meantime, use state funds to bail out every failed bank speculator and insurance company so that the income of the capitalists is shielded from the crisis. Use the FBI to round up peace protesters and to scare the pants off any worker who would dare imitate his comrades in Italy and France.I read \\"Revolution From Above\\" as a warning, and a vital lesson to the few surviving socialist parties and socialist countries. The remaining four socialist states are China, Vietnam, North Korea, and Cuba. All these states are confronted by the huge military and propaganda machines of the USA and Europe. These states, like the far stronger USSR, could fail under the pressure from the West. The lesson from Russia is that the Communist Party leaderships -- the \\"elite\\" of the socialist states -- is vulnerable to the kind of corruption that led Russia's elite to choose capitalism. Part of maintaining the survival of socialist states must be vigilance against the elite corruption that doomed socialism in the USSR."},{"Title":"What Judaism Says About Politics: The Political Theology of the Torah","review":"This volume by Martin Sicker delivers exactly what the title promises: the political theology of the Torah. Sicker winds his way easily among the Tradition's views of God, man, and society, developing a sound account of Jewish political theory.In essence and in my own paraphrase, Sicker argues that in the main and on the whole, the Jewish approach to politics firmly subordinates &quot;society&quot; to the needs and the ethical development of the individual. Politics, for Judaism, is not an end in itself, still less an arena for bringing on the messianic age by human effort, but a way of securing basic social harmony so that individual persons can develop in accordance with the Tzelem Elohim. (This brief summary does not, of course, do anything like full justice to the contents of this fine book; Sicker's own account is richly nuanced and detailed, with many citations from Traditional sources.)To my mind, at least, one of the outstanding merits of this work is that it _does_ stick to political theology, providing a standard against which political life is to be measured rather than specifically arguing for any one form of political organization. Those who, like me, believe that classical liberalism and capitalism are the proper form of societal organization on biblical and rational grounds, and that twentieth-century liberal Judaism's turn to the Left is a grave error, will naturally read Sicker's account as providing the theological underpinnings of a free society. But his account can also be profitably read by those who disagree with my politics _in toto_; it thereby provides common theological ground for discussion and debate among those who at least agree on foundational matters.From this volume alone, I have no idea what Sicker's own political views are -- and I mean that as a compliment, given his selected topic. His focus is on theological fundamentals, not on bending Jewish tradition to support his favorite cause-of-the-day. In short, there is timeless wisdom in this book for anyone who cares to read it."},{"Title":"Italian So Fat, Low Fat, No Fat: More Than 100 Recipes for Special Occasions","review":"I have just started making recipes from this cookbook and enjoy the good tastes and seasonings, especially the Eggplant Lasagne.

No matter what you believe in get this book."},{"Title":"Loving without Spoiling : And 100 Other Timeless Tips for Raising Terrific Kids","review":"I am a fan of Nancy Samalin's positive discipline techniques that are based on Dr. Hiam Ginott's philosophy of teaching kids right from wrong. I love this book because itcovers so many issues and so many tips and techniques to try with children of all ages-- tots through teens. I don't have the time nor the desire to read an entire book cover to cover that only addresses one subject. I just want the \\"how to's\\" in a nutshell. This book is arranged so that I may easily consult it--even in the heat of the moment, when I 'm at a loss of what to do instead of my knee-jerk automatic reactions of yelling, threatening, criticizing and nagging that simply aren't working anyway. I find that I get more cooperation from my kids (including my husband) when I am able to first change my approach. I realize that it is often HOW I say \\"it\\" that will determine whether I get the compliance I'm after. I would also like to highly recommend a wonderful pocketsized paperback based on the very same philosophy. So, if you have preschoolers like me, \\"The Pocket Parent\\" is written exclusively for parents and teachers of 2's, 3's, 4's, and 5's and is formatted alphabetically by behavior ( such as bad words, biting, gimmes, hitting, lying, whining, etc.) These two books offer many, many options about how communication can change for the better, still enforcing the necessary limits, while responding with understanding and empathy for the child's feelings. This approach includes many sensible, humane ways to solve problems that often require quite a bit of practice. I feel like I'm a much better parent when I am able to use this philosophy."},{"Title":"Loving without Spoiling : And 100 Other Timeless Tips for Raising Terrific Kids","review":"Samalin's latest book is a fast, easy read specifically about how to discipline children aged one through the teenage years. Samalin gives so many examples of the typical way children are and then good and bad examples of the various ways parents can/should react, with the consequences of doing things a certain way. The examples of \\"issues\\" were surprising to me because our family has experienced so many of these and I didn't realize that the scenarios were so commonplace! Samalin discusses communication methods, setting limits, making rules, and the like.Samalin divides parenting styles into three categories: 1) permissive (bad); 2) too strict (bad) and 3) \\"simply authoritative\\" which she recommends. What Samalin describes \\"simply authoritarian\\" is very appealing to me, and is much of what I already practice, although I have disagreed with and disliked previous authors' descriptions of the term \\"authoritarian\\" and never considered myself \\"authoritarian\\". I say this to let you know that if presently you bristle at the idea of being an authoritarian parent, be open to the possibility that how she defines it may be different than your present definition. This book is full of great advice and recommendations!Regarding parental emotions, Samalin acknowledges that it is all right to feel some negative emotions but is quick to point out that as the adults we are responsible for not choosing to act in bad ways out of anger. For example, to calm ourselves down before saying something that is negative (such as name calling or using a demeaning tone of voice) or lashing out in physical ways such as spanking or inflicting any other act that causes physical pain. As mature adults it is our responsibility to use good judgment when deciding how to react to some problem. She recommends we become aware of our negative emotions and acknowledge their presence but not let them rule our choices and our behavior. For more detail on this subject, see Somali's earlier book \\"Love and Anger: The Parental Dilemma\\".I feel that parents who live the lifestyle that Samalin labels as \\"too permissive\\" will strongly dislike this book. Also parents whose goal is to be their child's best friend, or those who hesitate to set limits or those who waffle on their rules or consequences will dislike this book. The reason is that Samalin explains why those actions actually cause undesirable behavior in children; they cause the very behavior that parents wish would not exist!This book is friendly toward mothers employed outside the home and there are sections about reducing motherhood guilt due to separation. This book does not in any way get into the debate of whether a mother should be at home with her children or go to work.In case you are wondering about Somali's stance of punishment methods, she is against spanking and spends a good number of pages discouraging it (tip 49). She never once mentions the use of the ever-popular \\"time-outs\\" so, sadly, we miss her opinion on this entirely. Samalin recommends using consequences-warning of their impending use and if the offense occurs, to follow through on it and administer an appropriate consequence such as loss of playing with a certain toy, etc.Samalin endorses prevention of parental burnout as essential to good parenting and I agree wholeheartedly. She gives only one remedy, however, separation. I was disappointed that other options are not discussed at all for the parents of children who are not yet ready to separate. Samalin encourages finding and using a good babysitter and then separating. Unfortunately here again is an area where I feel Samalin misses the mark by not stating that the developmental stage of the child and the child's unique personality and temperament should be taken into consideration before separations, especially for weekends or a longer vacation, are made. I personally feel that first and foremost whether the child can handle the separation should be the deciding factor. For a great book about motherhood stress and burnout see Dr. Kendall-Tackett's book \\"The Hidden Feelings of Motherhood\\".All in all I found this book helpful and interesting despite some advice that I disagreed with, however I realize that no one book will be an exact copy of my own opinions unless I am the author! I honestly feel that to cram parenting advice for the broad range of ages one through teenage years is a daunting if not impossible task. I encourage parents of toddlers to read \\"The Discipline Book\\" by William Sears M.D.-I found this most helpful for the first year and the toddler years (although the author says it is for birth through age 10). This book by Dr. Sears really stresses the developmental stages of babies and young children and what we are to expect from certain ages and then how best to avoid problems. With that said, I do love Samalin's book for use from age 3 and up."},{"Title":"Loving without Spoiling : And 100 Other Timeless Tips for Raising Terrific Kids","review":"I read this book a few months ago and immediately took it to heart. It absolutely changed the way I think about discipline. The most interesting thing is that recently, I picked it up to browse through again, and was amazed at all the thoughts from the book that I have adopted as my own. So many tips I've used...so many anecdotes I've repeated to friends...so much GOOD STUFF that I've internalized since I read it the first time.My husband read the book, too. He has for the past 4 years been a believer in the style of discipline promoted by John Rosemond: very authoritarian and a strict disciplinarian of the old school, &quot;just like your grandmother.&quot; This style has become very popular lately, as American children seem to be more insolent, violent and disrespectful than ever before. A reversion to that old-time discipline seems, at first blush, to be the answer.Although we certainly want our children to be well-behaved and respectful, we also want them to be happy and well-adjusted, not sneaky and defiant. After reading Samalin's thoughtful book, my husband and I have decided that we agree with Rosemond's goals, but not his methods. Samalin will give you options, and ways to be an authoritative parent, instead of an authoritarian one. THAT INSIGHT ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THIS BOOK, and there are many more.I've never found one parenting book that has all the answers. In fact, the longer I'm a parent, the more convinced I am that there are no clear-cut instructions on discipline that are right for every child. But this book -- with its wonderful anecdotes, sample dialogues and calm, pragmatic suggestions -- is the one book I recommend above all others. I certainly wish my parents had read it."},{"Title":"Loving without Spoiling : And 100 Other Timeless Tips for Raising Terrific Kids","review":"I have recently had the pleasure of reading Nancy's latest book, Loving Without Spoiling.

Samalin's books, although intended to assist parent/child communication, are actually useful for ALL aspects of human communication.This one however is in a class of its own. One can use it like a dictionary or \\"chinese menu;\\" a quick reference for any problem a parent may need a quick solution for. The explanations are simple, straightforward but not simplistic. The examples are universal and ANY parent can relate!The book gives a wonderful understanding of how kids view the world versus how we parents view things, allowing us to feel more empathic towards otherwise infuriating behavior. It reminds us that our struggles with and sometimes ambivalent feelings towards our kids do not make us bad parents but simply human ones.Samalin is right that parenting is not a job for which we are trained. This book can teach us how to do it firmly and lovingly. Not being born parents who cope with our kids as well as we would like is not our fault. Not becoming an effective parents by neglecting to read this book would make us irresponsible ones. This book is my new \\"Dr. Spock of Good Parenting.\\"I am a mental health professional and have come away with many new tips for my professional as well as personal life as a mother.

It includes much material not found in Scribner's original, 1940s, three-volume publication.This RICHLY AND PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED MIT Press edition is THE ONE TO HAVE.Although a major figure in American philosophy, writer of one of the finest novels set in America (The Last Puritan) and an aknowledged master of English prose, Jorge Ru&iacute;z de Santayana (1863-1952) was born in &Aacute;vila, Spain, of Spanish parents and retained his Spanish nationality until his dying day, never becoming an American citizen.He wound up in Boston because his mother's first husband, the captain of a yankee clipper, was a Sturgis from Cod city. They met and married in the Philippines, then a Spanish colony. After this brief marriage, which produced 3 Sturgis children, including the only person Santayana ever truly loved, his half-sister Susana Sturgis, the widowed Mrs Sturgis married Santayana's father, an elderly Spanish colonial official. They soon separated and at age 6 little Jorge, who could hardly be brought up in &Aacute;vila by his old father alone, was sent to his mother, who had taken up residence in Boston with her first husband's well-off relatives.While outwardly a successful &eacute;migr&eacute; student, Santayana nursed deep anger against his mother (her portrait in these m&eacute;moires is devastating) and never forgave the slight done to his father, whose austere Castilian livelihood had not been able to compete with those Yankee greenbacks.Santayana studied at Harvard and in Germany and was aknowledged to be so brilliant he was offered a teaching post at Harvard when hardly out of graduate school. But the powers-that-be there never liked him, or he them. His haughty, very \\"foreign\\" outward appeareance, all dressed in black like a Castilian; his cold sardonic humour; his atheism; his paradoxical love for the Catholic esthetic; his political conservatism; his homosexuality: all these were inimical to the worthy Brahmins who ran the University.On his side, he despised their sentimental, smug progressivism; their senseless liberal religiosity; their childish moral earnesteness--all concealing a brutal sense of entitlement and power.Santayana's successive promotions to eventual full-professorship were systematically delayed, notwithstanding his being one of the most celebrated members of the faculty. Once the crown was conferred upon him, though, he threw it in their faces, resigning his professorship in 1912. The proud Eternal Outsider moved to Europe (England, Spain, Italy) were he lived the remaining 40 years of his life. He never set foot in the US again.This autobiography is one of the most fascinating such documents ever created. All people depicted are unforgettably etched in acid, with a calm Pascalian insight into their souls that is almost terrifying. Santayana was a profound skeptic of human sentiments, an austere, stoic Spanish Epicurean writing the richest Emersonian English. A thousand times more percipient than Tocqueville, Santayana's point of view, the magisterial clarity with which it is propounded, are indeed uniquely prepossessing: here was the last philosopher of antiquity, mysteriously issued forth from medieval &Aacute;vila to address, in English, the corny foibles of the American century...in lucid Lucretian periods.One can scarcely conceive of another book quite like this."},{"Title":"Dear Daddy...","review":"This book is a letter from a young daughter to her dad, who is away on a ship, traveling to Asia, for a whole year.

Instead of reading claptrap that evolutionary theory has inadvertently produced, I recommend reading the book that started it all. Yes, much of it is refutable, but this books stands as a testament to one of the best theories science ever put forward. And unlike neo-Darwinism, it is not just one giant contradiction. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Origin of Species would be an important reference for those interested in a theory describing the development and continuation of biological species and the variations seen within. This book would also be an important read for those who imagine that Darwin claimed to explain the origin of life itself, &quot;It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life.&quot; (p. 637). This book details Darwin's Laws of Biological Variation and Natural Selection but it is not about &quot;evolution&quot; (as it might be defined outside of this). To my surprise, the term &quot;evolution&quot; is not defined nor even mentioned in this book (although the verb 'evolved' is used without special reference at the very end). Darwin comes across not only clever and articulate in his scientific observations but also honest as to the limitations of his work. I found his depth of understanding and discussion of his theory as well as his willingness to mention and discuss its difficulties (some proposed by well known contemporaries) to be impressive and sincere, &quot;...and this objection, as urged by Sir William Thompson (who later became Lord Kelvin), is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced&quot; (p. 620). Darwin also mentions another concern in regard to the lack of geological evidence in support of his theory of Natural Selection, &quot;[geological research] does not reveal the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory&quot; (p. 617).This book in no way induced a reduction in my own Christian faith nor did it lead me to question my belief in God, as I believe Darwin himself would have understood when he said &quot;I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.&quot; (p. 638). It would even seem that a fundamental belief of Charles Darwin emerges at the end of his work~ when he states, &quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.&quot; (p. 649).This book, in part, addresses the biological concept of how out of a few species can come many but this should not be confused with the concept that out of nothingness came"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Of course this is one of the landmark books in history.

It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I am very happy with the arrival of my books, they came sooner than expected.

It is still a great read 150 years after it first came out.I read this book several years ago because I heard so much about it. I don't have a science background, but it struck home with me in a way that no other book has. By just making the right observations, he unraveled what had been a mystery to that point in time. The book methodically develops the theory, and uses observations to advance it along.Ever since reading the book, I now see common things like our family cat, or other animals and plants in my yard, and know that they all have a story in how they got to be the way they are - and he came up with a way to explain that in rational terms. The book explains much of this in a way I can (mostly) understand.The book does have flaws that other reviewers note - so it is not perfect. As I understand he was wrong on some things. I am not smart enough to know what those defects are. I do know it will continue to be controversial for those who don't accept the science. But here is the thing, long after humans are gone from this earth, the religous beliefs and ignorance will be irrelevent.

The prose and logical reasoning closely follows that of Malthus's (\\"An Essay on the Principle of Population\\"), and Darwin was encouraged by reading his views of struggle for life and then stated \\"the doctrine of Malthus's applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms\\". What is especially striking in Darwin's case is the completeness of theory to include animals & plants, morphological patterns and instinctual patterns of behavior and to circumscribe his theory with statement that the Hereditable Bridge has never been broken, and a species once lost, cannot reappear. He touched ever so lightly on the subject of creationism, knowing the controversy, that would erupt, but he seemed to have reserved a room for a God and was, himself, a very caring, sincere and sensitive man.- finis -"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This book is a must read.

After its publication, biology became a systematic science with a unifying theory.To learn more about how Darwin's groundbreaking work led to the amazing growth of biological knowledge in the fourteen decades since its publication, I recommend that you also read British geneticist Steve Jones' new book Darwin's Ghost: The Origin of Species Updated."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"It took 277 years for the Church to accept that the universe did not revolve around the Earth, from the publication of Copernicus' 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres' in 1543 to the Vatican's total repeal of the condemnation of the Copernican doctrine in the period 1820 to 1835. If that's anything to go by as far as the speed with which the Church accepts new truths about the universe, none of us will be around to see the day Darwin is vindicated as one of humanity's guiding lights, as opposed to the Son of Satan. Seldom in history has such a noble person been subjected to such vilification. It reminds one of the ridicule once heaped on supporters of the Copernican theory, and their disbelieving mockery - how could the Earth possibly revolve without the people flying off? Today we all can only laugh at their ignorance, but only some of us can laugh at the ignorance of those 'Flat-Earthers' who still disregard Darwin's theory. Like many have already pointed out, much of the material that fuels the evolution debate is not to be found in this book. There are no claims or even insinuations in the book of descent from apes. Rather, it was disciples like Huxley who really helped focus the debate on man's primate anscestry, and Darwin was far more direct in his beliefs in his later books such as 'The Descent of Man' and 'The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals', both of which are worth reading as they bolster his theory in countless ways, always combining a penetrating natural observation with intelligent analysis. In fact, I must admit to enjoying them even more than this book, although of course as Darwin's classic, it's a must read for anyone interested in man's evolution, and no open-minded person could possibly remain unconvinced after going through Darwin's evidence and arguments against spontaneous creation.

I say least understood, because Darwin advances several theories (all relating to) evolution. It is a fascinating read, and a marvelous experience to &quot;peek&quot; into the mind of a genius.First, Darwin's theories are about natural selection, adaptation, extinction, species variation, and significantly, a common ancestor - all of which are a part of the bigger picture, that all life has evolved and is continuing to evolve. His evidence is overwhelming (it had to be in order to advance such radical ideas) and, for lack of a better word, brilliant.Much has been made about religion and evolution - which is why I mentioned that his theories are not well understood. At no point is God (or a Supreme Being, or whatever you want to call it) mentioned, let alone removed from Darwin's theory (regardless of how you feel about the matter.) Yet it is these theories that have laid the ground work for entire disciplines of science, and which has revolutionized science as a whole.With that said, the book tends to beat the points to death a bit. (Again, understandable given the magnitude of the ideas), but the lay reader can get a good flavor of the arguments, and the evidence about a third of the way through. Its interesting, to be sure, but a bit dry, which is why I can only give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Without a doubt &quot;The Origins of Species&quot; is one of the most seminal, controversial, and misunderstood books ever written.

Read you Darwin"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Enthusiastic readers approaching Darwin's revolutionary book often find themselves sorely disappointed. They expect a great existential debate on the origin of Man and instead they get arguments on why this or that tree produces fruit with a fuzzy skin.The reader who perseveres however will find a beautifully argued hypothesis explaining why the living things we find now in nature are both so similar to one another and so different from one another. Darwin explains why there are species of plants, trees, flowers, and ferns; why there are species of animals, insects, and pigeons; and why species can be classified into groups of similar but distinct species of cabbages or ants or primates.The book is superbly organized as \\"one long argument\\", to quote Darwin's own description of his work, and the first four chapters deserve to be singled out.It opens by examining variations under domestication. Darwin presents species we know very well have been modified consciously over time. Pigeon breeding had been a rich man's hobby for centuries and Darwin had copious data to cull. And while Darwin certainly was a rich gentleman, he was no snob when it came to appreciating expertise: he enthusiastically corresponded, discussed, and chatted with horse trainers, cattle breeders, and fruit farmers.The second chapter presents examples of variation in nature. Important ideas Darwin describes include a) that while human breeders act on this or that feature of an organism, nature always acts on the entire organism all at once and b) while man works a breed for a few decades or centuries, nature works on all species for millions of years.The third chapter explains that the natural environment is not a paradise or an Eden, but rather that it is a harsh competitive place where every organism must struggle to survive.The fourth chapter finally describes Darwin's theory of natural selection contrasted to Man's artificial selection. The theory of course is absurdly simple. Children (plants or animals) are very slightly different from their parents. Parents have more children than can possibly survive. Children who are slightly stronger and faster will have a slightly better chance of surviving and having their own children. As this process happens over millions of years and with billions of individuals, the differences accumulate into the diveristy of species we have today.This simple theory has far reaching consequences. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to these Laws of Variation and then several chapters to anticipate objections to his theory. It is in the first of these chapters, brilliantly but humbly titled \\"Difficulties On Theory\\" that Darwin shines brightest.For instance he freely admits that it seems absurd that an organ as perfect as the eye can have developed without an agent to design it. But Darwin points out that we have species where the eye is a single nerve cell that detects the presence or absence of light and nothing more. We have species that have bundles of nerve cells coated with pigments that detect different colors and amounts of light. We have insects with faceted eyes that also begin to discern shape.In short in nature today, we can find a series of species all possessing the same organ but each possessing a different grade of that organ ranging from rudimentary to extreme perfection. If these insensible gradations all are found today, it requires no great leap of the imagination to see they could have accumulated over time as well.Finally Darwin is a humble man but without false modesty. He is justifiably proud of his insights and the care with which he has researched his evidence. He is also conscious of his ignorance. He doesn't presume to discuss the origin of life and he says so explicitly. (Though we've found out quite a bit more about that since his day!) His book is filled with statements that if true would ruin his theory. He is a scientist who understands he must supply criteria against which his ideas are to be tested, and his theory on the origins of species by means of natural selection has passed these tests with flying colors.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Darwin, C. R. 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: John Murray. 1st edition, 1st issue.How does one write a review of the Origin, that most influential of scientific books? Darwin's peers reviewed him critically and in great length according to the traditions and beliefs of the day. Yet a modern person inevitably reads the book influenced by their knowledge of the theory's great and lasting impact on science and culture. Likewise, a modern biologist would recognize the gaps and errors in Darwin's incomplete theory. Instead of evaluating its cultural impact or scientific value I will focus on its actual written style and argumentative structure. Was his argument logical? Was it \\"good science\\"?Chapter one examines a practice already well-known to the English: artificial selection by breeding, or domestication. Horticulturalists and animal breeders already knew much about selection of variations through generations of practice. Darwin speculates on the scientific causes of variation, but concluded that not enough was known about the principles of inheritance to address the issue. Instead he focused on what he did know - only inherited variations come into play in selection. By taking up the study of pigeons, Darwin learned firsthand the art of animal breeding. By establishing himself as a pigeon expert, Darwin is trying to legitimize his claim as a zoologist and one who intimately understands breeding and domestication. His claim appears to work; at least has convinced me of his authority on the subject, and I'm sure many contemporary readers. By describing the accepted idea of artificial selection in detail, Darwin creates an analogy between it and his revolutionary idea of natural selection to enable the reader to grasp the concept more readily.In chapters three and four Darwin introduces natural selection. He posits that natural selection acts on the same principles as artificial selection, but on a broader scale with no intelligent agent guiding it. Nature is a Malthusian struggle for existence - Darwin illustrates this by describing the geometrical increase that would result from unhindered reproduction. Many living organisms produce far more offspring than their environment could actually support, leading to a fierce competition for resources. Nature consists of checks and complicated relationships between species in order to preserve this precarious balance. If species are being naturally selected for fitness in this savage environment minute by minute over a vast time, it could explain the immense number of different species we observe in nature.Darwin details his mechanism of natural selection by listing the conditions in which it would work faster or slower, including intercrossing, isolated populations, and number of individuals. The means of natural selection is to a large degree sexual selection, by which species choose the fittest mates and pass down successful inherited qualities. Natural selection may even cause a species to become extinct if it is not able to compete with other species. Trying to portray natural selection as an unfeeling force of nature, Darwin was not hesitant to describe the savage ways that species compete with each other, including parasites.In chapter six Darwin addresses possible objections to his theory, as should any well structured argument. For example, according to natural selection, we should see such a progression of species showing every step of modification between two related but divergent species. Yet we do not see such species in nature - Darwin concludes that they probably went extinct, since natural selection would favor extremes so that species would not occupy the same niche. Only in the fossil record may we find such intermediary species, and the fossil record will always be incomplete. One popular argument against natural selection both then and now is the \\"organs of extreme perfection\\" argument, of which the eye is the most popular example. How could the eye, an organ so perfectly adapted to perceive light, have evolved by random variation? Darwin answers this objection by recounting observations of eyes in crustaceans, which are presumably relics of mammalian evolution. He observes that the crustacean eye is a less developed, less sophisticated version of the mammalian eye and thus can illuminate the transitory steps that resulted from random variation over the ages to result in the perfected eye. Darwin also points out that not all animal organs are perfectly suited to their task. What about the peculiarity of humans in that all food must pass over the trachea, leading to possible risk of infection if food enters the lungs? The glottis seems like a stopgap, an imperfect measure to ensure that this does not normally happen. That such evolutionary maladaptations exist points to a lack of an intelligent design.In his conclusion, Darwin agrees that there are holes in his theory and aspects which could be better explained. After all, his Origins is just an abstract of the real book that he hoped to publish. Yet on the whole, he is convinced that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of natural selection. His argument is logical, and according to the Whewellian model of inductive reasoning he has gathered a bewildering array of observations from nature to examples to support his hypothesis. At a time when hypothesizing was not considered \\"good science\\", Darwin still submitted his broad theory because he realized it explained many observations in many different fields of science. Even now, his theory explains scientific findings that Darwin could never have dreamed of. Such is the legacy of true \\"good science\\"."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Darwin's _Origin of Species_ is a phenomenal work and was truly brilliant and insightful at the time. It's a classic of science and it's one of those books that everyone should read.That said, this particular Kindle edition of the book is disappointing. Primarily, the text is fully-justified rather than normal left-aligned (right-ragged). (This means that spacing between words varies so that the last characters of each line end up being aligned along the righthand margin, and the first characters are still aligned along the left margin.) It's a well-known principle of typography that justified text is harder to read than ragged text -- the spacing between words is variable, so your eyes have to work harder to move over the text. I don't see why this edition would have made that choice.If you want to read this excellent book, you might consider a different edition."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"\\"Today, at the dawn of the new century, nothing is more certain than that Darwinism has lost its prestige among men of science. It has seen its day and will soon be reckoned a thing of the past.\\" -- Eberhard Dennert, At the Deathbed of Darwinism, 1904.101 years later and nothing has changed for the anti-evolutionists. I laugh when I see them claim that more and more scientists are rejecting evolution. Such claims are a blatant lie. Go to a university library and spend and afternoon browsing the science journals. You won't find any articles in which scientists argue that evolution never happened. They argue how it happens not whether it happened. Nobody cares if you can get a scientist to sign an anti-evolution statement. Show us the articles he has published in the scientific literature that demonstrate evolution is false. Data is all that counts in science, not petitions or school boards."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is in fact an abstract of a 20 volume thesis containing the evidence gathered over many years which support the concept of evolution by natural selection. This way of describing the evolution of organisms on earth has by now become the standard and, in fact, one hardly ever thinks of evolution without automatically connecting it with Darwin's ideas.At first, upon commencing reading this small book, I continued to ask \`where is the evidence for that' but on realising that he had gathered a large volume of data to support this theory I simply continued to read on. Its not either an easy read or that complicated. Darwin looks at evolution in a very comprehensive way: first, linking the main idea with the variation of animals under domestication, something he himself had extensively studied in the case of pidgeons; second, associating this with variation under nature and the struggle for existence; he then goes on to describe in detail natural selection and the laws of variation. He follows this like any good scientist by an analysis of what may be the theory's weaknesses, such as the scarcity in the geological record and the lack of organisms in a state of gradation. He then applies the ideas to instinct, hybridism and then discusses in great depth the imperfections of the geological record. He also considers how geographical distribution can alter the results of evolution and how the embryos of various animals have a resemblance to that of other animals and how they also appear to repeat previous evolutionary steps as they mature.Its too bad the 20 volume set was never published, even the incomplete version would have been better than only the abstract. Nonetheless it is well discussed and written as a comprehensive summary of the main thesis. At times the style can be repetitive and even dull but this is compensated for by fascinating little excerpts which are present throughout. This was, remarkably enough, my first reading of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and I do believe that every practicing scientist should read it as part of their education rather than accepting its tenets without question as is the wont. However rather than being a description of the true origin of species, it actually takes a change which occurs (by whatever means) and then describes the process the species undergoes from then on. Darwin never actually said anything about how new variations are formed, this was left for others to consider and eventually led to the modern Darwinian thesis including the idea of mutation caused by radiation, viruses or chemical agents. Much has also come to light over the last century such as the symbiosis of organisms producing the merger of cell and mitochondria seen in every cell today and similarly the recent evidence of gene swapping going on between bacteria and now also larger organisms, see &quot;Lamarck's Signature&quot; by Ted Steele. Since Darwin did also not explain form but rather the possibility of how form came about Brian Goodwin's Form and Transformation is a good place to start.It must also be remembered that in his time the thesis was new even if many others were working on similar ideas Darwin was the first, in conjunction with Wallace, to expand on natural selection and obtain strong evidence for it. An essential read for any scientist."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Whether or not you agree with my title, you must agree that this book is one of the most important volumes of Western science. That is the reason I resisted reading it for so long. In the end, this book should be read not because it is important or still controversial after a century and a half, but because it is interesting reading, giving insight into Darwin and his times. A great deal of his examples remain compelling and his analysis still engages the intellect. This book is not dull or stuffy, but rather, fun, interesting reading. A number of the concepts with which Darwin struggles still engage biologists today.This book will surprise and delight you, if you are like me, force you to read the current writings on evolution, creationism and genetics. In a world where genetic developments rule medicine and where genetic advances challenge our ethical concepts, it is important for all of us to understand these concepts, and the best place to begin is with the man who started it, Charles Darwin."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The book is certainly a classic, which everyone ought to at least try to read once in their lifetime. However, for those attempting to learn the theory of evolution for the first time the book isn't the greatest of places to start for the following reason. The prose are very difficult to understand, and are characteristic of a writing style endemic to England in the 1800's. The sentences are surprisingly very long and I found myself frequently having to reread sentences several times in order to understand their meaning. Additionally points previously made in the book are repeated throughout the book way to much. For those wanting to read the book for historical reasons its great and gives some insight into the times of its writing. For those wanting to learn natural selection for the first time stick with some modern book. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so difficult to read."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Required reading for any serious biologist. This is the theory from the man himself. Also valuable for understanding evolution in a historical sense. Darwin got some things wrong, but, in my reading of this (which I have done many times over), I am struck by the brilliance of a man who figured all this out in the absence of understanding the genetic mechanism of inheritance. I think Darwin is one of the great minds of western civilization, on a par with Newton, and he deserves FAR more respect than he is given today.For all the stir this book caused, for all the stir Darwin's legacy continues to stir today, I am always struck by his modesty and dedication to the principles of scientific endeavor. He seems such a quiet man to have revolutionized everything we know and understand about life."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this \\"abstract\\"). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about \\"There is grandeur in this view of life.....\\" is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book.So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The shockwaves from the publication of this book still resound today. The full title of the book is \\"On the Origin of Species By Means Of Natural Selection or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\\" by Charles Darwin and it was first published on November 24th of 1859. The importance of the work was not in the originality of the idea; the idea of evolution had been a theory long before as Darwin discusses in the text, nor was Darwin the only scientist at the time to arrive at the theory, as a paper by Alfred Wallace arrived the same year as Darwin's. What made \\"The Origin of Species\\" so significant was the way Darwin discusses the theory, and that it was not written just for scientists, but for everyone. This makes it a work of Literature as well as one of Science.Another key aspect to \\"The Origin of Species\\" is that it has completely changed the focus of the subject from the point of its publication until now and undoubtedly will do so for some time to come. It is still the dominate point of reference in the argument between those who oppose the theory and those who support it. Those on both sides of the argument (and I use the term argument because the term discussion would lead one to believe that the discourse is much more civil than it actually is) would do well to emulate Darwin in the way he discusses his theory.\\"The Origin of Species\\" in many ways sets the standard for scientific argument. Though again Darwin did not create the standard with this book, the significance of the work and the readability of the book make it stand out as an example of the correct way to present and defend a theory. Of course Darwin presents facts which support his theory, but it is his discussion of problems with the theory which is the strength of the book and his theory. Darwin admits he doesn't have answers to all of the issue, and he offers ways to prove his theory wrong or at least force a significant adjustment to the theory.It is interesting that the issues with Darwin's theory and the methods of proving it wrong are in many ways unchanged. There will always be gaps in the fossil record, and there will probably always be questions of reducibility, but that doesn't mean that there isn't more evidence to support the theory than there ever has been, there is a lot more which has strengthened the theory, and the key point is that there hasn't been any evidence found to disprove the theory. And with regards to species being fixed, the scientific argument has long been over, though one can still find non-scientists who would argue the point.\\"The Origin of Species\\" remains an important work of science and literature today. Understanding Darwin's theory is necessary to understanding the political discussions and ramifications that continue to take place. It also serves as a great guide to understanding what a scientific discussion is and how it works, and by contrast how it differs from a political, social, or theological discussion. It should go without saying that \\"The Origin of Species\\" gets five stars, and the introduction by John Burrow enhances the experience by putting it in the context of Darwin's life, and the times in which it was written and published. I was a little surprised that the Penguin Classics edition didn't include any notes on Darwin's text, but it does include a bibliography of Darwin's works. Also, while the text included is from the first edition of the book, it does include \\"An Historical Sketch\\" and a Glossary which were in later editions."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This is one of those books you should read. If only to have a better side of the argument when you run up against a Creationist at a holiday party."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"First you must read the voyage of the beagle by Darwin in which this book is base and it will make much more sense for you to read!!!!"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This book is an eloquent, easy to follow argument that has been lampooned, caricatured, and feebly argued against from all sides. But Darwin's basic argument makes good sense and can be seen to work in the wild. The argument is that if an animal, a biological system, can exist in an environment, it will do so, and it will multiply as a result of its fitness for that environment. If it cannot, it will die. That's pretty much it. Put a camel in Antarctica and it will die. Put a polar bear in the middle of the desert and it will die. Easy, huh? Over time, those undesirable traits (from a survival standpoint)in a given population will be bred out, either slowly or quickly. They have to be! Otherwise, the species dies! Voila! Evolution theory! They made us read this in Biology 4560, and I'm glad they did. A necessary read for anyone who strives for any modicum of scientific literacy."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Everyone is aware of the importance of Darwin's 1959 classic science text. Yet, few of the many defenders and detractors of evolution have read it. While certainly out of date and lacking in the loads of modern evidence to back him up, Darwin nevertheless provides the best introduction to evolution by means of natural selection.Darwin goes through nearly every point imaginable, providing the results of years of tests, observations, and study. Each chapter goes on an exhaustive analisys of different topics. I had already read much evolution literature, but I was even more convinced after reading Darwin's well-written thesis. He is unpretentious and modest. Even when the subject gets tedious (he goes into rather extensive details on raising pigions and floating various seeds over water), his good humor is always evident and you know you only have to wait until his next big find is revealed.&quot;The Origin of Species&quot; should be read by anyone claiming to know the origin of mankind. Though often tedious and lacking in modern evidence, this is still science writing at its best. Any layman can understand the principle concepts of evolution through Charles Darwin."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"As a news junkie and biology major, I am constantly reminded of the need for people to read and understand this book. Nothing brought this home more harshly and succinctly than when I was watching a debate among Republican presidential candidates and when they were asked if they believed in evolution. The overwhelming majority signified that they did not.Few books have changed the collective human perspective about the role of humans in the universe than this book. In it, Charles Darwin describes in great detail what he had observed and the conclusions he reached. The man was a superb scientist, honestly and carefully going where the data led him, even though he knew how his conclusions would be received.That hostile attitude has not changed, for many people are not swayed by the data and the facts, they know only their emotions. Evidence of evolution is everywhere; Darwin's theories of how species change as expressed in this book have been validated over and over again. The strongest evidence is present in the attempts by humans to beat back organisms that we dislike such as bacteria and weeds. Both have evolved to withstand the chemical assaults in a manner exactly as Darwin described in this book.While the current political climate in the United States will preclude it, the country would be in much better shape if this book were required reading in high school."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"It is a crying shame that many reviewers have used this forum to try and critique evolutionary theory, making no references to the text at all and drawing on erroneous conclusions about Darwin in general. The Origin of Species is most definitely the most important work in the field of biology, as it is the most succinct and well developed explanations of the unifying principle of the field, evolution via descent with modification. I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining the theory or why a person should study it. I want to explain who should read this book and why. If you are looking for an introductory text on the theory of evolution you need to stay well away. There are other better books. In many cases Darwin's examples and arguments are outmoded or have been changed. The book overlooks many aspects that are included in modern evolutionary theory, such as genetics, simply because Darwin did not know about them. Natural selection as Darwin wrote it is one of the most effective explanatory theories in all of science but by reading this book you miss almost 150 years of the things it has explained. It is also a flat out PAIN to read, they where much \\"wordier\\" in the 1800's and Darwin's English is rather stilted and formal, even compared to modern scientific writing. So, who should read this book? Any person who is an advanced student in biology (I read it the summer before my senior year) should be aware of how the modern theory of evolution was born. You can't really achieve this without reading Origins. I am aware of no better way of understanding evolution that to follow its development through time, beginning with Darwin. And, if you don't understand evolution, you don't understand biology. As something to read it is a classic, arguably the most influential work of all time.A note on edition: this copy is the one I have. I would suggest the facsimile of the First Edition found elsewhere on Amazon. I don't know why the publishers felt the need to put the caricatured human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Perhaps the most influential work ever written, and a shining beacon of modern scientific thought. This book is the much needed breath of air the scientific world needed after millennia of religious (unscientific and assumable) oppression. The work, shines on many points, and dulls on others, but, keeping in mind the time it was written, it does not deserve a lesser rating. I will here give my impression on what was \\"hot and not\\" about this volume;Positive-Despite many who would disagree, the book is eloquently written. It is a very enjoyable read. It does, I admit, get a tad dry and repetitive at times, but keep in mind that this is a scientific volume -- it is not entertainment. Also, it was written 150 years ago, and the rules of grammar and language would of-course differ from today's.-The book is truly scientific; it does not make blind assumptions, but backs up it's theories with facts. It is the burden of the proposer to back up his claim, therefore, claims that Evolution is false and volumes of energy are wasted just to defend it is erroneous.-And, of-course, the book lacks a-lot of the modern principles discovered regarding evolution since its publication. However, there is no need to rate it down just because of age. I don't see Dickens being rated down because 19th century London exists, now, only in books. As far as a scientific work, however, it lacks in this department.Negative- It is outdated, so it should not be completely trusted as a source of valid information. Don't misinterpret me: most concepts are correct, however, details are often erroneous and not up to date. This book should NOT be used as a source of serious arguments for or against evolution, with few exceptions and examples.- The language may tire and bore some modern readers.The last comment I have is for readers who are very vexed by this book and choose to bash it publicly and claim its error in, well, almost everything. Those are usually Religious readers who are opposed to any mention of evolution for obvious reasons. I am an open atheist, I won't deny it, and, everyone on this earth has a right to their own opinion. However, bashing a work purely based on instilled hate for science is NOT helpful to the community which reads these reviews. First, if the book was so erroneous and \\"laughable\\" in its propositions, Religious folk wouldn't have felt so threatened by it as to post 3 page reviews full of angry remarks. An evolutionist/secularist/atheist is not someone who knows too little about religion or is ignorant -- it is someone who knows too much. Religion assumes, and, the bible was written for political purposes -- if you are a truly educated Creationist you would have at least an idea of what I claim here. Therefore, people who ONLY read the bible and use it as an example do not hold any water to their claims. The bible has no authority with many cultures on this earth. Science, however, can have authority with everybody, because it proves its points with facts. The angry theist reviewers, here, are as gullible as a child. I did not read Darwin's work and become an \\"instant believer\\" in evolution; I had to read several books and weigh the evidence. Another excellent work is \\"What Evolution Is\\" by Earnst Mayr.Comments I was really vexed by:- Darwin was an atheist -- most theist posts claim this in one version or another. He was not an atheist, and, even though his underlying intentions will never be clear, he was openly a theist. Throughout the book he mentions the \\"creator\\" as the \\"breather of life\\" on earth. The last sentence in the book is truly beautiful, and disproves the atheist claim.- The fossil record refutes evolution; maybe so today, but I am convinced this is erroneous; the evolutionary link to the lineage of birds from dinosaurs (Mayr 2001) was only a proposition supported by Darwin and many evolutionists, quite blindly. Why? No \\"Intermediate\\" between dinosaur and bird was found, and therefore, theists had a field day bashing evolutionists. However, the Archaeopteryx was discovered in due time. I believe that it is due to the vastness of the fossil record and its unimaginable distribution and randomness that these \\"gaps\\" exist. I believe the future will surprise evolutionists quite pleasantly.-Posts which include remarks such as \\"Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines.\\" are clearly the futile attempts of an uneducated theist at disproving evolution. Having no facts, of-course, he must resort to name-calling when all else has been expired. I urge you to read that post, and, if possible point to one fact that supports his claim. He claims we should be \\"REAL\\" scientists and investigate for ourselves -- well, most of us are, and we have simply concluded that Darwin puts forth amazing proof of evolution. This is only a very accusatory rant by yet another disappointed theist who just saw a huge chunk of Bible validity being crushed by a genius of scientific advancement. Religion and science do NOT mix; one is based on assumptions, the other on facts. I very much find it interesting that many people here compare \\"Origin\\" to the Bible -- in a way it is; it is the modern bible. It simply replaces or updates, if you will, the ideas of the bible. The bible can be viewed as a very outdated theory on the world -- one that predates science and explains everything without the need of thought -- it's all simply magic (god). The \\"Origin\\" updates it, and goes on to explain the magic of God as scientific laws. Which sadly for many, does contradict the bible.- A reviewer commented that the full title of the book was concealed by Amazon with shady purposes to cover up the book's \\"racism.\\" I particularly love the claim that Darwin was a racist. The reviewer claims that Darwin displayed racist remarks towards black people in his book, favoring races and saying Africans were inferior; where in the book, dear reviewer, did you see any mention of Africans, and, overall humanity? Darwin makes VERY little reference to humans in the \\"Origin,\\" perhaps you'd be interested in \\"Origin of Man\\" (Descent of Man). \\"Preservation of favored Races\\" refers to the animal \\"races\\" or, more modernly, types/varieties/breeds. This erroneous claim is baseless, because the word \\"races\\" was used with a different meaning in \\"Origin\\", and again, take into account that the book is 150 years old -- grammar rules and interpretations change. I remember Darwin using the word \\"Gay\\" to refer to his happiness in a discovery of some sort; the same reviewer could probably claim Darwin himself was homosexual based on this remark.And, finally, this book *proves* nothing. This book, or almost any other I have read regarding Science/Evolution/Religion proves NOTHING. They just claim, and defend, either successfully or unsuccessfully, and with variable effectiveness. Before you bash me as a hot-headed atheist, consider this; I don't believe in Darwinism completely, I don't even believe in the complete validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis either; I just treat religion and science (The bible and \\"Origin\\") as two very rightful, and respectful claims of explanation for a common problem; I only defend \\"Origin\\" because, although it doesn't prove evolution, it certainly puts forth many more valid, scientific, and truly unbiased facts for its existence, than the bible puts forth for the existence of god and his version of the operations of our world-- in fact, it puts forth NONE, it assumes the reader will trust it unquestioningly as an undisputable authority. Mr. Darwin, has successfully disputed it, willingly, or unwillingly, and uses Nature as HIS authority of choice.All you have to do is read it for yourself, and make your own decision as to the validity of his claims. However, do keep an open mind, do not embark on reading this work with a frown on your face and an eager exaltedness to ridicule and dispute its content. It is a beautiful work of unbiased and honest truths (mostly), and is a rather enjoyable and informative read to the curious and open-minded reader."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"To begin with, a note on the edition. This Barnes & Noble Classics series version is based on the first edition of The Origin of Species, which is actually nice for a couple of reasons. First, it allows the reader to experience the book as it originally appeared. This is not only interesting historically, but a nearly unmitigated virtue because of the second reason: The core content of the book remained essentially the same throughout the later revisions Darwin made in his lifetime, but such changes as he did make were for the most part unnecessary or even (in retrospect) unfortunate--mainly minor concessions to skeptics (religious and otherwise) and to the Lamarckian theory of evolution (as opposed to natural selection as the basic mechanism driving evolutionary change).That said, there are several things to say about the book itself. First, it is extremely readable. Modern audiences (especially those educated in the American government schools, which almost certainly failed to introduce them to this material) might be intimidated by the prospect of tackling a somewhat technical scientific volume of this size written a century and a half ago. Those who attempt it, however, will be pleasantly surprised to find that Darwin's presentation is extremely clear and intelligible, at times even beautiful. This admirable writing style is in large part due to his scientific method, which leads me to the book's next great virtue.Darwin's approach is primarily inductive--that is, he was not some armchair philosopher abstractly theorizing off in an ivory tower somewhere, as one might suspect from the photograph of him as a bearded old man with which we are usually presented. In other words, evolution is not \\"just a theory,\\" precisely because Darwin was not just a theorist. Rather, Darwin gathered massive amounts of evidence on his Beagle voyage, and continued to accumulate ever more (with the help of his scientific colleagues in various related disciplines) for decades before he felt ready to publish his theory (and he still felt rushed into it). (Indeed, for anyone interested in the philosophy of science, or in epistemology in general, On the Origin of Species should be the textbook case of scientific induction.) Darwin then presents all of this evidence to us piece by piece, building up his case from the ground, as it were, and in effect recreating his own line of thinking for his reader making it incredibly easy to follow his case. Which brings us to the third point.What kinds of evidence does Darwin draw on? Intriguingly, Darwin did not begin his career as a biologist aiming to solve the species question. He boarded the Beagle as a brilliant amateur natural scientist generally with an inclination toward geology. Perhaps this is why he was able to draw so widely on various fields in making his case for evolution when that question did become his main interest. From Lyell's theories and his own geological observations, Darwin concluded that the period of time available actually allowed for a very (previously unthinkably) slow process of evolution. From this geological perspective, he naturally was able to look at various pieces of evidence more directly bearing on the species question, such as the fossil record and the geographical distribution of species. After the Beagle voyage, he was able to conduct experiments in many other areas (and correspond with colleagues about the results of their experiments), including artificial selection (Darwin's pigeons being the most famous example of this) which became important as an analogy for the process of natural selection; the means of the geographical distribution and isolation of species (including seeing whether seeds can germinate after extended periods of submersion in salt water or passing through the digestive tracts of birds); and even the sex lives of barnacles. All of these experiments are described at some length in The Origin of Species.But Darwin, ever the scientist, was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove. The Origin of Species contains an excellent chapter anticipating and answering possible objections to his theory, and acknowledging its shortcomings. For instance, Darwin acknowledges that the fossil record at the time did not tend to show gradual progression from one species to another, and offers an explanation as to why the fossil record might be so incomplete. He also acknowledges that while he found the evidence for evolution by means of natural selection to be overwhelming, he did not know the actual physical, biological mechanism by which this takes place (as genes had not been discovered and the discipline of genetics created at that time), but he does briefly mention a hypothesis that was actually sort of on the right track. In fact, in all of these weak areas, subsequent history has borne Darwin and his theory out remarkably well.And finally, in addition to being a masterpiece of scientific thought, The Origin of Species is also a work of, at times, almost poetic beauty, and deserves praise for its literary merit. After presenting or indicating all the evidence in a specific area throughout each section, Darwin ends each chapter by summing it up in an eloquent statement naming the general principle to be derived from this vast array of specific evidence, often employing an apt and evocative metaphor. The most famous of these passages is of course the one with which he concludes the book: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"You cannot legitimately consider yourself an educated person if you haven't read this wonderful book, and yet a shockingly small percentage of Americans (including even those who claim to believe in evolution) have read it. But you will find that to do so is not a chore, but one of life's great pleasures."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"\\"Origin of Species\\" differs from most other scientific books or original articles in that it can be understood in its original form by an average person. When Newton wrote his Principia, only a handful of people could understand it. It had math and it was written in Latin. But Darwin's method is the same as Newton's: both developed a theory which \\"explained\\" observation. Neither gave nor claimed to give the final word. Neither is a discussion of ethics, politics, religion. business, etc. It was known to everyone that variation in life existed with some sets of living organisms being more akin to one another than to other sets. Some sub-sets within a given set of organisms were able to interbreed with one another, but not with other members of the set. Darwin attempted to explain how this happened. Science is never \\"true\\" in the sense thatreligion is \\"true\\". Science does not depend upon the authority of individues.The idea that the Pope may pronounce something true and it becomes \\"true\\" is a different definition of the word \\"true\\" than Darwin or Newton or any other scientist saying someing is true--on the one hand the \\"truth\\" exists because of who made the statement, but on the (scientific) hand, the one making the statement is not relevant.Some reviewers have stated that \\"Origin of Species\\" is hard to read. I suppose that is true compared to a novel, but compared to most scientific literature it is a piece of cake. It is about as hard to read as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" by Adam Smith.Darwin's work, like all science, is based upon the concept that nature is consistent over time. To throw out Origin of Speciesbased upon the idea that God creates inconsistencies now and again to effect this purpose or that mekes no more sense than throwing out Newton, Einstein etc and physics and chemistry as well as biology. No amount of evidence to the contrary convinces those who insist upon God's intervention because it cannot be absolutely disproved. Such views are OK, but they are not science and must not be introduced into science classes."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"It's important to remember that Charles Darwin was born in 1809 and published this book in 1859, almost a century and a half ago. It's also important to remember that &quot;the past is a different place: they do things differently there.&quot;Victorian England believed strongly that northwestern Europeans were the most favored of races, with the English at the pinnacle of favor among Europeans. Darwin grew up in an England that had just defeated Napoleon at Waterloo and was also taking on the direct rule of India as its own special destiny. So it's not surprising that he absorbed the confident young empire's predominant view of the world. Nor is it surprising that the book in which he presents his ground-breaking theory of natural selection also reflects his rather uncritical acceptance of nineteenth-century England's belief in Progress with a capital P and in The White Man's Burden with similar capitalization. Darwin lived in the England of Kipling's India.These beliefs can seem quaint, antiquated and even repulsive to us from our late twentieth-century perch, but they were characteristic of the men of his time, place and education. No doubt our own favorite assumptions about America's natural role in the world will look as odd and misplaced to readers from the mid-2100s, a century and a half in our future.Do we expect Sir Isaac Newton to be a Jeffersonian Democrat or a modern chemist in the mold of Lavoisier? No, of course not. Sir Isaac died in 1727, nearly 50 years before the Declaration of Independence was written, and 16 years before Jefferson and Lavoisier were born in 1743. Not only that, but--as strange as it may seem to us now--Newton's gaze was fixed upon the past, not the future. In this, Sir Isaac was also very much a man of his era.The focus of Newton's research was the experimental and mathematical recovery of knowledge he and his contemporaries thought had been known in ancient times and since lost. In a lifetime spent trying to reconstruct lost wisdom, he managed to create valuable new sciences that had never before been available to humankind. In so doing, he changed the way we think about the world forever. Newton's own laboratory notes seem strange to us today precisely because we live in his intellectual shadow; the same is true of Darwin. The landscape never looks the same after a major earthquake, whether the landscape is physical or intellectual. And both Newton and Darwin launched intellectual earthquakes with the publication of their discoveries.The following comment, taken from the last lecture in Caltech physicist Richard Feynman's 1964 series on &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, vividly describes what it takes to seek new, testable physical [and biological] laws:&quot;...The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought. What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible strait-jacket. We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that is known, but disagree in its predictions somewhere. . . . And in that disagreement it must agree with nature. If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else, you have made a great discovery. ...A new idea is extremely difficult to think of. It takes a fantastic imagination.&quot;Newton and Darwin both did this, in spades. They had in common both that fantastic imagination and the incredible discipline it took to put it into Feynman's strait-jacket.As B. J. T. Dobbs shows in her superb study &quot;The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy&quot; (1975), Newton's decades of fine-grained experimental investigation of the claims of alchemy developed both his amazing powers of concentration and the broad range of ideas that he could bring to bear on a problem. The results shook the world for generations after him. Similarly, Darwin's intense focus on a single big question for decades after the Beagle voyage led to an earth-shaking new view of life that still rocks our intellectual world today. This book reports that view and the evidence for it.Like Newton's monumental &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Darwin's &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; profoundly changed the way we see the world. The &quot;Principia&quot;, with its infinitesimal numbers, its invisible forces and its gravitation, took generations to achieve widespread acceptance, even as it revolutionized the study of physics. Similarly, evolution by natural selection as presented in the &quot;Origin&quot; has completely reoriented the study of living creatures, and it too is taking generations to achieve widespread acceptance. This, too, is not surprising.However, unlike the original English-language edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;, which sports concepts, vocabulary, spelling and capitalization conventions we find difficult and distracting today, the &quot;Origin&quot; is still fairly easy for us to read and appreciate. Our friends in 2139 may not be so lucky. Read it now, while you still can.-dubhghall"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Few moments in science change humanity's perception of itself, and presents science with an impetus to guide generations ahead. Examples? Watson and Crick's description of DNA structure, Einsten's theory of Relativity, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - to name a few from the twentieth century. However, one man's thought and scientific deduction was so revolutionary that it ought to be considered one of the most momentous event in science - the man was Darwin and event was the publication of the first edition of the book which I am reviewing.Before you go on ahead, it is my duty to tell you that I give the work 5 stars, only because I have no other alternative. The contents of the book are invaluable - priceless gift to humanity. HOW CAN A REVOLUTION BE RATED? It is also my duty to tell you that this book is not for unscientific fundamentalists whose lives are guided by rigid walls of baseless faith, and not an inkling of true science.I shall not be restating the contents of the book. Suffice it to mention that any lay person without the knowledge of current scientific advances in biology should completely agree with the deductions of Darwin. I will however, mention this. No more is evolution a 'theory'. It is a fact. For proof, the Human Genome Project has been completed, as have the genomes of several plants and animals sequenced. Just compare them. And you'll find the truth for yourself. Here are some facts for fundamentalists to chew: a human embryo is almost identical to that of a fish; the genetic code of a bacterium is identical to that of human, and every other species on this planet; and by the way, the basic constituents of DNA of every living species on the planet is the same!!!!! So, stop advancing anti-scientific and pseudoscientific nonsense in place of evolution. That is balderdash!Now, for the open-minded and/or the scientific, I have a request for you. Once you finish reading the book, sit down and think about this - in hindsight, without knowledge even of the basics of genetics and without the aid of scientific advancements we know today, a man, through sheer observation and deduction, proposed the 'theory' of evolution - which has virtually all the sciences to back it up. If that is not revolution, what is?"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"In this wonderfully readable text Darwin introduces the ideas that have changed biology.The two strongest points of the book are: its readability, which it really is, it's arguments against repeated creationism, which are among the best and clearest I have read.The structure of the arguments for his theory which slowly unfolds for the eyes of the reader makes for a convincing and readable story. Of course the book being 150 years old there are some shortcomings, especially focussed around Darwin's lack of knowledge of the mechanisms invoklved in inheritance (genes). Quoting and treating of scientific references might also appear oldfashioned.In spite of thse shortcomings the impact of this book has been so immense that I would advice everyone to read it, that is why it got the 5 stars as well. Without reading it neither supporters nor opponents of his theories can fairly debate about its implicaitons"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"A well-written, well-argued treatise on the volatile subject of the evolution of new species by natural selection. At the time, this flew in the face of accepted theories, and especially upset current theological doctrine, Archbishop Ussher would be particularly upset!.Darwin agonised for years over the publication of his book, and it was only at the urging of his friends (that he was about to be upstaged by Wallace) that he finally published. The delay was of his own making - torn between the evidence of his notes and correspondence with Wallace, and the furore that would inevitably result. The furore was bound to happen anyway, surrounded as he was by small-minded [people], so he should have published earlier. But ... this might have deprived us of the brilliant arguments he puts forth in support of each section in the book.He obviously knew what he was up against, so he tried to present his case as lucidly as possible - and here's the unusual aspect of the work - in layman's language! This was almost unheard of in a Victorian Scientific treatise - they were meant to be read by Scientists, not the hoy-poloy! He tries to counter every conceivable objection to each statement, as nicely (in both senses of the word) as possible, without any of the fervour and tunnel vision that one expects from a convert to a new ideal. He takes us by the hand and gently walks us through the evidence in support of his theory, helping us to realise that, yes, he is talking sense, no matter what our pre-conceptions of life might be.Discover for yourself that evolution is not 'survival of the fittest', but 'survival of the most fit' - that is, fitted for that particular ecological niche - fittest being a Victorian word that has taken a different modern meaning.An amazingly good read, even for our enlightened times, but recommended reading - I'll bet there are hundereds of copies on dusty bookshelves that have never been read - time to dust it off and find out for yourself the genius of the man."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"It's really amazing how polarized people's opinions of this book are! Whether you accept evolution or not though, it would be foolish not to read Origin of Species if you expect to have an informed opinion on the subject. I gave it only 4 stars because it gets pretty dry in places, however I definitely recommend reading this book. Reading it two or three times would be an even better idea."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I picked up this book both because I am curious about how evolution works and for its historical value. I am glad I read it and would recommend it to others with a few caveats. I have a limited understanding of biology (basically what I remember from bio 101) and this book is definately heavy on scientific lingo. I would often be lost or have to read something many times in an effort to understand it. I also have been told this many of the ideas expressed in it are no longer valid in modern evolutionary theory. The book was written over a hundred years ago, so this is to be expected. Still, the book has much value. Many times as I found myself wondering what Darwin was talking about, I would suddenly have a wave of comprehension and feel very vindicated. All I'm saying is, don't give up on the book. As soon as you start to think it is not worth your time to read it, it will be. That was my experience, at least. If looking to skip the more time consuming parts, one might consider reading the introduction, the first few chapters, and the last chapter, and still probably coming away with a relatively good idea of the book's meaning."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I had an appendix embedded in my body, but it served no useful purpose, became inflamed, and was removed.

It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Creationists often state categorically that &quot;there are no transitional fossils&quot;. This is simply not true. In fact, ALL fossils are transitional. One of Darwins main points was that evolution is an on-going process. It may speed up and slow down, but on it goes. This book is a must read. Even after 120 years it's still selling and still being read.Darwins point in The Origin of Species has been overwhelmingly proven over and over. There are abundant transitional fossils of both the &quot;chain of genera&quot; type and the &quot;species-to-species transition&quot; type. There are documented speciations that cross genus lines and family lines. You cannot simply say that there are no transitional fossils, because there are. As Gould said (1994): &quot;The supposed lack of intermediary forms in the fossil record remains the fundamental canard of current antievolutionists. Such transitional forms are scarce, to be sure, and for two sets of reasons - geological (the gappiness of the fossil record) and biological (the episodic nature of evolutionary change, including patterns of punctuated equilibrium and transition within small populations of limited geological extenet). But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical geneology.&quot;Darwin has been vindicated by the remarkable temporal pattern of fossil morphology, with &quot;an obvious tendency for successively higher and more recent fossil assemblages to resemble modern floras and faunas ever more closely&quot; (Gingerich, 1985) and with animal groups appearing in a certain unmistakable order. For example, primitive fish appear first, amphibians later, then reptiles, then primitive mammals, then (for example) legged whales, then legless whales. This temporal- morphological correlation is very striking, and appears to point overwhelmingly toward an origin of all vertebrates from a common ancestor. Creationist can say whatever they want to and practice all the deceit they want, but the clear evidence in the geological record is not in dispute by any one except fundamentalists.Numerous &quot;chains of genera&quot; that appear to link early, primitive genera with much more recent, radically different genera (e.g. reptile- mammal transition, hyenids, horses, elephants), and through which major morphological changes can be traced. Even for the spottiest gaps, there are a few isolated intermediates that show how two apparently very different groups could, in fact, be related to each other (ex. Archeopteryx, linking reptiles to birds).Many known species-to-species transitions (primarily known for the relatively recent Cenozoic mammals), often crossing genus lines and occasionally family lines, and often resulting in substantial adaptive changes.Even the gaps are easy to explain, since for stratigraphic reasons alone there must always be gaps. In fact, no current evolutionary model predicts or requires a complete fossil record, and no one expects that the fossil record will ever be even close to complete. As a rule of thumb, however, creationists think the gaps show fundamental biological discontinuities, while anyne who has studied the evidence knows they are the inevitable result of chance fossilizations, chance discoveries, and immigration events.Darwins revolution will continue, even if there are a few setbacks, because the evidence is real and overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This book is one of the most talked about of all time, yet during my philosophical discussions on evolution, this is the typical line of conversation.&quot;Have you ever read &quot;Origin of Species&quot;?&quot;No.&quot;&quot;Do you KNOW anyone who'd read it?&quot;...&quot;No.&quot;This is one of the most significant books of the last 500 years, it effects practically everyone's idea about how the natural world works, and almost everyone's ideas of God and creation.

If you would understand life on Earth, reading this book is a good start."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The Theories of Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest have been misquoted and misused nearly as often as certain Biblical passages. Rather than take another person's word for what Darwin meant by Evolution through Natural Selection, I opted to go straight to the source. I was not disappointed. Darwin's rich array of facts and furthering evidence was almost overwhelming, and yet he yields a long list of resources by which one can attempt to disprove his conclusions. Darwin is a true &quot;Truth&quot; seeker and does not seem driven to merely further his own theory by any means necessary. Read &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Read the Bible. Draw your own conclusions. You owe it to yourself."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Most people are at least familiar with the theory of natural selection, but that is not to say that they are familiar with what Darwin actually said in Origin and how he said it. Thus I agree with the reviewers who say this is essential reading.Although Darwin says it is \\"one long argument\\", it is in fact two: that the diversity of life shares a common ancestry, and second that this divergence came about primarily as a result of natural selection.There are a number of re-editions of Origin out there, especially given the recent 150th anniversary of its publication, so why choose this one?Above all it is an ideal student edition (and I include here anyone who reads critically): it is cheap, has been type-set with sufficient margins for notes, and is as lightweight a paperback as you will find for a 400 page book. The type is large and accessible, and the introduction by George Levine is, at 20 pages, short enough to hold one's interest while with enough content to warrant its inclusion. Also, given all the recent re-editions available there are few that provide the 1859 text of the first edition. This one does.This is important if you want to know how Darwin originally presented his ideas. Later editions (there were six in total, the last published in 1876) included clarifications and answers to specific later objections. As a result the first edition reads better and is a more straightforward argument. If you are a Darwin scholar you will probably want to engage with these later editions - the sixth is widely available, for the others you can find them in specialist libraries (the University of Oklahoma has the lot!), or now also in beautifully scanned editions through the Darwin online website.This is not the place to go into the detail of what gets added to the later editions, but if this book gets you hooked you might want to take your Darwin studies further. Perhaps the most notable and certainly the most famous addition is the insertion from the second edition onwards of the words \\"by the Creator\\" into the poetic last paragraph of the book (There is grandeur in this view of life... ) This is interesting stuff: was Darwin seeking to clarify that he saw evolution as God's mechanism for creating the awesome diversity of life that we see around us? Or, was this a judicious attempt to allay theological concerns that distracted his readers from the science? The jury is still out on this. Darwin certainly wrote to his friend and confidante Joseph Hooker that he later regretted \\"truckling to public opinion\\", but he did not remove the insertion from later editions. In his autobiography, written towards the end of his life, he confided that while he had gradually lost his faith in a personal God, he recognized that others had found natural selection quite compatible with religious belief, most notably the Anglican theologian Charles Kingsley and the American botanist and Presbyterian, Asa Gray.There is so much in this book that it will keep you coming back. You might also want to take this further: Although Darwin only hinted at human evolution in Origin, saying only in the last pages that 'Light will be thrown on the origin of Man and his history.\\" He addressed that hot potato explicitly in Descent of Man (1871)."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Was disappointed when I opened the book to see the extremely small print - never have worn glasses and great vision, but what I'm sure was going to be a deliciously meaty book, full of Darwin's views and where they stem from, has become a book that is passed over for something more traditional in size and font.Maybe I should have read the reviews or book into closer and would have noticed this was mentioned.Oh well, someday I'll get to it...once I find my magnifying glass!Smalls"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Darwin was one of the most brilliant men who ever lived. He was perhaps the greatest observer the world has known. In 1831, he set sail on the Beagle, a tiny little ship, for a five-year cruise around the world, and without pay, as naturalist. He had studied theology, medicine, and, finally, biology and geology. He saw how organisms change with time and environment and how Biblical events simply could not have happened as stated. He spent twenty-three years going over his notes, rethinking, and agonizing over the results. In 1859, he published Origin of Species, and it upset the world. He demonstrated evolution as no one had. Uneducated religious leaders may ridicule it, but evolution is a fact, accepted by any intelligent, educated, honest person."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I use the book to teach principles of evolution along with SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox, both in compliment give the backbone of every aspect to our change and progress.

I myself do believe that this is one very important book to all humans, this is the icon of the argument of creation. You will find new discovery here that is proven, it does enlighten the novice. I mentioned SB 1 or God as that book takes a modern approach and is comprehensive on the subject of creation as well with evolution winning out. I recommend Karl Mark Maddox to anyone including other teachers."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Go to any literature website and read it for free"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Charles Darwin's The Origin of species was published in 1859 and he basically believes and tried to prove that different varieties of species will come about because of direct or indirect action of the species with the surrounding environment and/or conditions and also from the use and disuse of certain inherited functions. Which than leads to the Struggle for Life and thus you have Natural Selection, which means that species that are not the best equipped to survive become extinct.This book is packed with examples of his theories. I was impressed with all the information he had gathered over his twenty years or so of research.I also do not see how anyone after reading this book, could say that Charles Darwin's theory proved that a Creator or God does not exist. Darwin himself referenced many times to a Creator. He even said, \\"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.\\" And he also said \\"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings, which have ever lived on this earth, have descended from some primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator.\\"Not only that but he himself understands that there are still many problems with his theory. I was impressed that he included and admitted problems with the theory. For example he said, \\"Why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? And he also said, \\"Can we believe that natural selection could produce... organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet full understand the inimitable perfection?In the end, even though I myself am still a skeptic towards the theory that simple organisms have evolved into many different complex species, I would recommend reading this book, if not for anything to see how the evolutionary theory got started and though Darwin's theory has changed since his time, it would be a good read still for historical purposes if nothing else.

I fell in love with biology at my first year in college. I have been amazed by the beauty of perfect balancing act of nature since that time. Natural selection is more beautiful than anything I could ever fathom. Reading the text put me into the mindset of Darwin at the time when this idea was so much more controversial than I could ever imagine."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I believe this book is well written. Darwin doesn't overload you with endless facts and information which would bore you to death and distract you from understanding his essential theories. Not that facts and tests are irrelevant. He has done tests and has lots of data, but he keeps this separately for those who wish to build upon his theories or dispute them. He uses just a few examples to prove his points, and the results are remarkable.There are several points in time which have changed the way people look upon the world around us. Finding out the world is not flat, but rather round is one. The Earth revolves around the Sun, rather than the reverse, and that all of the continents used to all be connected at one time, are a few more. Darwin's Theory of evolution rates right up there with these. For someone believing that the world evolved from Adam and Eve I can't imagine how upset he made these people feel by suggesting that we may have evolved from Monkeys, or some amphibian creature. Darwin's theories that animals (humans included) may have evolved from just four or five different progenitors, and that plants may have evolved from even fewer, or that we all may have evolved from just one species is fascinating. I believe he approaches it just the right way. He doesn't argue or criticize. He just lays it out there and you are forced to acknowledge it. Darwin keeps religion our of the equation. If religious groups want to go on there to name the amphibian being which crawled out of the ocean for the first time onto land Adam, that would probably be all right with him, so long as you admitted that their probably was such a being.Science has improved since Darwin's day's and geology and archeology has improved, but he is still correct that we will not be able to find perfect fossils after all of these years to match all of the changes. Some of his other thoughts and comments I do not know whether to contribute to the period in which he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing. Characteristics such as increased strength, brighter colors, and the ability to sing. However I would believe that other or similar traits would be passed down to the females as well to make them more attractive to male suitor, forcing them to want to fight over these particular females more than others.Also Darwin mentions that the strongest produce the most descendants. In our society today that is not necessarily true. Money is associated with power or strength. Someone who has two kids may have more money and be considered to have more power. Since they live within their means they may be able to afford a better house, and to put their kids through colleges, as opposed to a family with seven kids in which they live by lesser means, and are unable to afford the same amenities as the family with just two kids, because they have less money to go around. The family with seven kids by this example may not be considered the strongest since they have more money, but yet they have the most descendants."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Some time ago I found Darwin's \\"Origin\\" in a second hand store. More than a hundred years old, except for the [presumably] original owner's name, written elegantly inside the cover with a quill, it showed no sign it had ever been opened. Possessing a pleasant 'old book' smell but having no marks, stains, or dog-eared pages, it had rested unexamined, apparently for several generations. Then I came along and -- viola! -- punctuated equilibrium.Darwin's writing style is engaging, his lines of thought easy to follow. He did not 'discover,' or 'invent,' \\"evolution.\\" Classical philosophers long ago discussed evolutionary ideas, St. Augustine among them. Aristotle taught that the extent to which biological forms could change was tightly restricted. Many held this view in Darwin's day, but many did not. Many believed that species had evolved from earlier forms but no one had proposed a coherent mechanism for such a theory. Lamarck's theory of evolution failed to impress most thinkers because it smacked of vitalism and couldn't describe how changes might be heritable. Where Lamarck's theory failed, Darwin's was seen as succeeding. It is apparent to this reader, however, that in critical areas, Darwin's arguments often 'beg the question' -- in their underlying metaphysical assumptions and logic and also in terms of the difficulty resolving mathematical incongruities in 'the struggle for survival by means of natural selection.'Problems of mathematics:Several times, in the opening paragraphs of chapter 10, Darwin underscores the quantitative nature of his \\"small steps\\" gradualistic theory. Life forms are said to be \\"blended together by innumerable transitional links,\\" and, \\"so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous\\" and again, that the number of transitional links \\"must have been inconceivably great.\\" Darwin takes pains in dealing with paleontological difficulties in this regard. Concessions, arguments, and paleontological problems aside, the more interesting difficulty is one of straight-forward mathematics -- these \\"innumerable . . . truly enormous . . . inconceivably great\\" number of slow and small modifications that \\"must have incessantly occurred.\\" If 50-100 billion (the most conservative of generally cited estimates, but more realistically several hundred, if not thousand billion) species of life (mostly prokaryotes, but Darwin argues that modification proceeds most rapidly in \`higher', more complex forms) are to have been brought about by \\"small steps\\" in 2.5 to 4 billion years (3.5 billion is typically cited), with most of the action happening in the last 0.54 billion (since the Cambrian/Tommotian period), the necessary modifications and even outright 'speciations' would have to occur as a continued whirlwind of evolution. We would observe modification and speciation constantly, in significant quantity, even daily. We certainly do not observe this. Here is perhaps the most easily stated and understood of Darwinian gradualism's mathematical difficulties, but it is not the only one, nor is it seen as being the most intractable.Problems of logic:In chapter six Darwin argues, \\"It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?\\" The problem here is that Darwin himself proceeds to enlist repeated (metaphysical) assumptions about how the Creator would and would not work. Let us concede, with Darwin, that such thinking is presumptuous, and Darwin is repeatedly caught in his own trap.Another problem of logic: Darwin writes, \\"If it could be shown that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\\" Of course no one could -- how does one observe \\"any\\" possible complex organ \\"not possibly\\" being formed? In case you think Darwin is suggesting that his theory of gradualism might be falsifiable, look again. He has actually hedged his argument behind the thorny logic of 'proving a negative.' In fact, Darwin argues, \\"we must suppose\\" that nothing could present such a \\"break down\\" case! Theories that can't be falsified aren't typically held to be scientific. Yet not only has Darwinian theory gained wide assent, it has come to be protected by law in certain quarters; the only scientific theory, so far as I know, to ever be so protected (unless one counts the Vatican's Earth-centered universe theory, per Ptolemy, in Galileo's day!). Kepler's and Newton's theories did not appeal to enforcement by jurisprudent mind-police, neither did Einstein's or Planck's.Darwin frequently argues that if we presume his theory is true, and disregard countermanding evidence, then we have \\"no difficulty\\" in finding his theory to be true: \\"In all cases positive paleontological evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience has so often shown\\" (chap. 10). This kind of argument could be employed to \\"find\\" any theory to be \\"true.\\"Metaphysical problems:Darwin's \\"long argument\\" is, as he freely admits, a line of reasoning more than a body of extant evidence. In argument Darwin references his theory, over and again, to an arbitrary metaphysical demand. He says that the absolute fixity of all forms is integral to the idea of 'creation', i.e., that 'creation' must be rigidly static -- \\"special\\" creation, as he defines it. This is, of course, a very useful demand. With the language sufficiently colonized (as a prescribed condition), all evidence of variation is then automatically evidence against \\"creation\\" and supportive exclusively of his theory, and this appeal is made repeatedly. The problem is that the idea of divine creation does not demand the absolute fixity of forms. Early in the fifth century, Augustine contemplated the possibility of forms evolving, he seemed not particularly impressed with the impact of such an idea upon the principle of divine creation. In fact ideas about 'creation' [in most instances better described as 'intelligent design'] are present from early Ionic philosophy, see, for example, Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC), and earlier, if but vaguely, Heraclitus (535-475 BC), who affirmed both an essential \\"Logos\\" (design) and material change (evolution).Some evolutionary biologists (e.g. cell biologist Lynn Margulis) doubt that the natural selection \\"battle\\" can adequately explain variation. Natural selection states: if a gene z is more likely to succeed (reproductively) than a gene y, then gene z is more likely to succeed than gene y. Is this an explanation or a tautology? It makes a statement that z has been whittled from [yz], but what does it tell us about the existence of [yz] except that it, in turn, had been whittled from [xyz], for example. It states a subtractive process by which a genetic set can be modified. But does it tell us anything about how or why modifiable sets exist? Even if we accept Darwin's arguments for natural selection acting on random variation as an adequate mechanism for all variation (and doubt seems reasonable), it remains that the very existence of such things as complex cellular and genetic material (proteins, enzymes, DNA) remains unexplained. To be selected, something must exist.In citing problems with Darwin's arguments, I do not dismiss all his ideas. But his \\"struggle\\" arguments don't have the broad explanatory qualities that he believed them to have. Whether in 1859 or today, his theory is obviously incompatible with certain ideas about 'special creation', but as Darwin admits, it hardly undermines the final implication of an extant Creator. Philosopher Garth Hallett, who appears to have no difficulty with Darwinian theory, says, \\"What in Hume's day looked like products of intelligent design now look like the results of natural evolution, but natural evolution itself -- from big bang to life, sentient beings, and Homo sapiens -- now looks like the product of supremely intelligent design. To construct whole villages from Tinkertoys would be clever; to construct Tinkertoys that form the villages on their own would be prodigious. How prodigious the unfolding of the universe has been, we have only recently begun to glimpse.\\"Darwin appears to have been a rather pleasant gentleman, frequently praising others, conspicuously including his detractors (a wise tactic perhaps). He was intelligent, wrestled with very difficult questions, and tentatively believed he had discovered the best answer possible. Many still do (e.g. zoologist Richard Dawkins). As for contemporary scientists who doubt, in one way or another, that he did propose an adequate mechanism, and there are more than you may have been led to believe, I recommend the critiques of: philosopher of science David Stove, mathematical geneticists Hubert Yockey and/or Lee Spetner; mathematician M.P. Schutzenberger, biochemists Michael Denton, or Dean Kenyon, and quantum chemist Henry Schaefer III (maybe not the names you were expecting?). Some Darwinians love to hate these guys, but they are respected scientists, they don't reject Darwin 'wholesale', most of them (the above mentioned, that is) are avowed agnostics, Yockey is likely the most eminent scientist in his field, and Schaeffer has been nominated for a Nobel Prize at least five times. They've published many peer-reviewed papers (this matters inordinately to some folks!). Darwin has become a polemists icon, if not poster child, but many people [probably most] cling strongly to opinions of his work that, whether for or against, are too extreme.wes janssen 2005"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"As the great scientist Newton said \\"I saw further for I stand on the shoulders of giants\\". Wallace may have seen something further than Darwin when he later in his life said that we have souls or spirits that accounts for our humanity. I believe that the paradigm shift which brings into account ghosts and spirits when it comes to why we cannot fully explain humans is overdue. I know the reader is skeptical about these kinds of things but I myself saw entities that could not be mistaken for something else other than ghosts and spirits, which is also seen and observed by many other human beings all over the world. I do not believe that they are non-material beings who co-inhabit this planet with us and are just mistaken for ghosts for when you see them they have the form of humans, and it is well known that the physical form of humans evolve so that it could be used in the physical world to handle material objects such as legs for running, arms and hand to hold and lift objects, etc. that is why it doesn't make sense that these non-material beings mimic the physical form of humans, so it is most likely that these beings are ghosts and spirits who once inhabit the physical body of human beings and that they mimic the physical form for they once inhabit a physical body...I also cannot believe that they are holograms. On the other hand, to me it is funny that people who believe in a God has a double standard. They believe in a God that they do not see but find it humorous to believe in Ghosts that they also do not see. Isn't the two just different manifestations of the after life? To me it is even easier to see a ghost than to see God, I believe they visit the physical world more than God does..You can hear people say \\"I saw a ghost last night\\" or \\"I saw a ghost in that old house\\" but I never really heard anyone say \\"I saw God.\\" As for Scientists, wether they believe in a God or not, I cannot blame them for being skeptical about these kinds of matters for they cannot emperically observe ghosts and spirits. But not everything has to be observed. It is true that \\"observation is the key to knowledge\\" but Einstein stated that \\"imagination is much more important than knowledge\\" so that is the reason why I believed Wallace saw further than Darwin when he later on believed and suggested that we have souls that make us human for he probably realized that humans are too complex to just be explained by evolution even though our animal bodies are also a product of evolution like any other animals in this PLANET, that is the reason why when studying Chimpanzee behavior, which are 95% the same as our DNA, their are eery similarities to how they behave in society. All those power struggles, murders, sexual jealousy, male machismo and competition, its all rooted in our DNA. But unlike Chimpanzees, we humans have souls, it is the responsibility of our souls to be FREE ENOUGH of our \\"bloodline\\", free enough of our bodies to make decisions, to make choices and not be easily overcome by our bodily tendencies. Also a reader might think that in this VAST UNIVERSE, ghosts and spirits DOES NOT FIT IN THE PICTURE...but what if this VAST UNIVERSE is a VAST RUSE...DESIGNED to trap an OVERLY INTELLECTUAL MIND... Even scientists nowadays are admitting that when it comes to the study of humans we are barely scratching the surface. Darwin and Wallace was both right about their observations about evolution, but Wallace saw further for he probably knew that we cannot emperically observe everything... Science can only explain what it can observe.P.S. I challenge ALL scientists who comes across this review to begin an ALL OUT investigation of the phenomenon of seeing ghosts..so we could tell once and for all if so many people all over the world are just dillusional, that is why they have sightings of ghosts...OR they truly did saw something and is just being discredited by science because they cannot, FOR NOW, explain it!"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I picked this edition because it includes new modern evidence, not found in the original publication, that macroevolution is a fact: the cover art.

Therein lays the main argument behind Darwin's view. Darwin observed how organisms vary in nature and he observed how man had harnessed this ability for man's own benefit. Darwin referred to this trait as artificial selection, which was the basis for Darwin's dangerous idea or extrapolation: Natural Selection. With natural selection however, Darwin, proclaimed it an unguided, random process that had no real purpose. Artificial selection is nothing of this sort though. Artificial Selection is an intellectual guided, predetermined event. In fact, it is more appropriately called Intelligent Selection, since knowledge is used to carefully select those traits that can be beneficial to man.In Intelligent Selection, nothing is left to chance; farmers did not and have not relied on randomness to maximize their crops output. They have always used knowledge and skill. Darwin used Intelligent Selection for establishing the basis of natural selection, proclaiming that he named it natural selection &quot;in order to mark its relation man's power of selection.&quot; Pg 53 However, since Intelligent Selection requires knowledge, order, and guidance it can hardly be used to support Darwin's dangerous extrapolation: Natural Selection, a random, unguided process. Darwin repeatedly says that if man could do so much in his short time-span, than imagine what Nature could do through it's long time-span: &quot;I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of coadaptions between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by NATURE'S POWER OF SELECTION.&quot; Pg 91 However since Intelligent Selection is so different, or even more accurately the opposite of Natural Selection, it cannot be used as evidence for Darwin's dangerous extrapolation. Thus, Darwin's chief example for his theory is null and void.Chapters 3 thru 8 deal with specific examples of descent with modification found inside nature. To help clarify, the examples that Darwin gives are not in question. In fact, the ideas concerning populations that Darwin borrowed from Malthus, the struggle for existence that organisms go through, and many of the other examples that Darwin covers are not being questioned. What IS being questioned is the extrapolations that Darwin made that went past the evidence. Scientists observe that organisms vary in nature; Scientists observe that descent with modification occurs within nature. NO ONE doubts this. But rather the objections to Darwin's work are because his claims goes PAST the evidence. Scientists know that organisms can vary, but they ALSO know there is a limit to the amount of variation that can go into any organisms (called genetic homeostasis). There is a point of no return, where the variations start to have an overtly negative effect. To say that creatures have the ability to vary in nature is true, however to proclaim that nature can do what man has not been able to due goes beyond what the evidence tells us. In fact, it goes AGAISNT the evidence; it goes AGAINST science.Chapters 9-12 are devoted to the subject geology and geographical distribution of organisms. Darwin owed much credit to Charles Lyell, who gave Darwin the vast amount of time needed for natural selection to supposedly work. Darwin proclaimed that &quot;the future historian&quot; would recognize Lyell's book the Principle of Geology &quot;as having produced a revolution in natural science&quot; pg 232 Yet, Lyell's view of a gradual, non catastrophic, uniform geological rate has been rejected. Even today's most ardent evolutionists have conceded that catastrophes have vastly shaped today's earth. Darwin however believed the opposite. He relied greatly on the theory of uniformatarianism being the absolute truth and even declared that &quot;species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes.&quot; Pg 398 Thus, Darwin's view on the geological record is mistaken. Catastrophes have had a great deal to do with the formation of the earth and on the production and extermination of organisms.Darwin devotes Chapter 13 to talking about embryology and how the facts of embryology alone would be enough to convince him that evolution were true. (pg 374) But yet, studies in embryology since Darwin's time have not strengthened evolution. There are just too many examples where the embryo does not repeat the stages of his past ancestors. The human embryo for example develops its tongue at an early stage in their development, but it is only when the child is a few months old that they starts growing teeth. Yet, our supposed ancestors are said to have evolved their teeth first and then their tongue. Moreover, the idea that a human embryo goes from a single cell organism, to a fish, an amphibian, a mammal, a monkey, and then a human has been demonstrational shown to be false. (See the works of Embryologist Wayne Friar for further info) Anyone who still sticks to this old argument, is no longer dealing with science, but have entered the realm of the dogma, where evidence and reason takes a back seat.Charles Darwin has become synonymous with evolution. But why? He didn't reveal any new ideas in the Origin. (The idea that organisms shared common ancestry and that the earth was extremely old had been around for a while. Ancient Greek philosophers had similar speculations.) So, what was so different about Darwin? Why do people associate Charles Darwin with evolution and not Alfred Wallace, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, or even Charles's grandfather Erasmus. The answer, although in no way a short one, can be partly attributed to his attempt to rid special creation from the scientific throne. In its place instituting a naturalist paradigm, that ever since has hindered science. Before Darwin, along the time of Galileo, the dogma came from the religious sect. But, since Darwin's time the dogma has switched sides, or at least superficially. The dogma still comes from the religious sect mind you, but a religious sect masquerading around as science. In short, Darwin is synonymous with evolution not because of his scientific contribution but because of his adherence to a naturalistic philosophy, which in the words of Richard Dawkins &quot;made it possible to be an intellectual fulfilled atheist&quot;. Darwin removed the need for a designer."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Regarding the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record, Darwin said in the 1850's:&quot;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&quot; ---Charles Darwin, &quot;On the imperfection of the geological record&quot;, Chapter X, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, J. M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London, 1971, pp. 292-293.But 120 years later!&quot;Well, we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which \`does' show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling.&quot; ---Dr. David M.

I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualize such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic license, would that not mislead the reader?I wrote the text of my book four years ago. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \`show a photo of the fossil from which each type of organism was derived.' I will lay it on the line-there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.&quot; ---Personal letter (written 10 April 1979) from Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Palaeontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London, to Luther D.

The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils. Yet Darwin was so wedded to gradualism that he wagered his entire theory on a denial of this literal record:\\"The geological record is extremely imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory.\\"Darwin's argument still persists as the favored escape of most paleontologists from the embarrassment of a record that seems to show so little of evolution. In exposing its cultural and methodological roots, I wish in no way to impugn the potential validity of gradualism (for all general views have similar roots). I wish only to point out that it was never \`seen' in the rocks.Paleontologists have paid an exorbitant price for Darwin's argument.

The implication of Darwin's statement is that white purity is something that has to be strictly enforced.P.71: \\"The tendency [for cats] to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited.\\"Is this evolution through acquired characteristics or natural selection?P.105: \\"I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse.\\"The kiwi of New Zealand is a flightless bird that thrived until Westerners imported rats to the island. Beasts of prey existed in New Zealand before the rat arrived. So it would seem that he is wrong in his belief.P.110: \\"[S]uch facts as that former species of the elephant and rhino were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances into play.\\"So, he's saying that a \\"very common flexibility of constitution\\" caused the extinction of the mammoth is he? What rubbish.P.134: \\"By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life in its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent\\".So, once species have become \\"modified\\", they exterminate the original parent. Sounds like something Communist regimes over history have practiced.P.136: \\"[I]ntermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods ... as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\\"By stating that intermediate forms \\"should be exterminated\\", Darwin appears to be advocating that people should be doing the exterminating. He provides no evidence as to why this should be the case.P.136: \\"[A]ny form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers\\".He neglects to say that man is the cause of extermination of species. Anyway, what about the extermination of the dinosaurs and mammoths?P.136: \\"Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.\\"He supplies no evidence for this. If I was a Communist then I would perhaps take inspiration from this, as it implies the triumph of \\"a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat\\".P.152: \\"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\\".He doesn't say who the \\"We\\" refers to. If he doesn't know what causes these variations, then perhaps he should abandon his theory.P.154: \\"If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\"In his book on ESP, T.C. Lethbridge refers to a parasitic beetle that is only found in wasps' nests. He says, \\"This kind of situation occurs everywhere in the world of insects, spiders and so on. Every parasite is adapted for its life role and some of these are very complicated. How did the liver-fluke think out an evolution whereby its first host is a small snail which is then eaten by a sheep? These things make no sense as explained by Darwinian evolution; but they are perfectly understandable, if you once postulate an external mind planning them.\\"P.154: \\"After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\"This does not account for sudden, mass extinctions.P.155: \\"The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe.\\"On page 62 he claimed that \\"the vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\". Therefore, is he stating that the European plants and animals are happier, healthier and more vigorous than the NZ species? H.G. Wells inMr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island,makes the following point: \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious. In nature a relative survival of the rotten and dying is possible.\\" So, as the kiwi bird is exterminated by the rat, this presumably the sort of evolution that Darwin has in mind in his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.P.157: \\"Natural selection in each well-stocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country.\\"Is he saying that perfection equals strength, or that either perfection or strength will be produced? If he is saying that strength and perfection are the same thing then this is Marxist ideology. As for the inhabitants of smaller countries yielding to those of larger ones, perhaps this is what provided some inspiration to the Nazi lebensraum program.P.158: He continues: \\"For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.\\"He provides no evidence for this statement. If something is perfect in nature, then it is perfect. Who is Darwin to judge on the standard of perfection in nature?On page 168 he discusses slave making ants. \\"If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected ... The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work.\\"Slave-making is described as a \\"wonderful\\" instinct. The workers are \\"courageous\\" in capturing slaves. It sounds like Darwin is a fan of slavery.P.169: \\"According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\\".How many ants nests have doors in them? Is Darwin extrapolating from ants nest findings theories about how human slaves should behave?P.171: \\"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.\\"Yes, Darwin is a fan of the \\"wonderful\\" instinct of making slaves.P.186: There is \\"one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\"Let the strongest live and the weakest die, he says. So, presumably, Darwin would be against all forms of pest control, because the rat is the strongest animal, so it should be allowed to live. I wonder if fans of eugenics were inspired by Darwin's one general law.P.214: \\"... all changes have been effected very slowly through natural selection.\\"All changes eh? Excluding humans, of course. Darwin offers no explanation for the rapid development/sudden appearance of modern man.P.229: \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\"Lloyd Pye, fromEverything You Know Is Wrong: Human Origins: \\"600 million years ago soft-bodied corals and tiny worm-like creatures appear. All come suddenly and - like prokaryotes and eukaryotes - with no precursors.\\" It would appear that it is time to ditch Darwin's theory.P.235: \\"I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating to only two or three countries ... On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.\\"So, Darwin, instead of finding his flawed theory at fault, because it cannot be substantiated from geological records, instead puts the blame on Geology. Is this a case of sour grapes?P.242: \\"The theory of natural selection is grounded in the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\"That's rubbish. The mammoth was a superior animal to the elephant. Also, modern man walks in a less efficient manner than earlier forms of man.P.259: \\"But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.\\"He does not give specifics. When is it a very slow process? How about sudden extinctions?On page 269 he refers to \\"an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes, that 'every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species'But... that sounds like spontaneous acts of creation! If as if realising the implication, Darwin then starts rambling about modification during the process of descent from a single parent. The trouble with Darwin and his whole theory is that he cannot provide the evidence to back it up.He rambles on from mention of Mr Wallace's ingenious paper with a mention of English race horses. These \\"differ slightly from every other breed, but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\"So, they only proof that Darwin has to offer for evolution progressing by very slow changes is not proof at all. It is when humans interfere by breeding and improving the stock of race horses and cattle.P.367: \\"The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record.\\"Sour grapes because the evidence is lacking to support his theory.P.368: \\"To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual.\\"Darwin believes in God! No doubt the likes of Richard Dawkins would accuse him of being unscientific on this score.P.369: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most excited object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having originally breathed into a few forms or into one, and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful, most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.\\"There is no grandeur in Darwin's view of life governed by Malthus's principles. Darwin equates perfection with power. As H.G. Wells says, \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious.\\" Such as man! In the glossary Darwin defines \\"parasite\\" as \\"an animal or plant living upon or in, and at the expense of another organism\\". Humans could legitimately be called parasites, and so it seems Darwin must be insanely optimistic if he thought that endless forms most beautiful are continuing to be evolved, when as he noted on page 51, \\"Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\". If Darwin was a realist, then he might have come to the same conclusion as H.G. Wells: \\"So that so far from Evolution being necessarily a strenuous upward progress to more life and yet more life, it might become a graceless drift towards a dead end.\\" He was more blunt in 1939, in his Fate of Homo Sapiens, referring to a \\"new barbarism\\" and predicting that \\"Mankind which began in a cave and behind a windbreak will end in the disease soaked ruins of a slum.\\" Considering, the evidence, Wells' outlook seems more likely than that of Darwin. In addition, Darwin it seems did not want to consider any evidence for sudden mass extinctions in the past.In the glossary, Darwin defines \\"retrogression\\" as \\"Backward development. When an animal, as it approaches maturity, becomes less perfectly organised than might be expected from its early stages and known relationships, it is said to undergo a retrograde development or metamorphosis.\\" This appears to have occurred in Darwin's case. This book is a candidate for the most overrated book in the history of publishing."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence. This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades. One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts. That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the \\"Descent of Man,\\" not \\"Origin of the Species\\" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development. It's the worse case of reductionism in history. James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book. They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton. They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological. How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific? Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment. Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75: \\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.\\" There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book. Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection. Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye. See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, \\"Hume, Newton and the Design Argument.\\" Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake? First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks. Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded. Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it. A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this. I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards. Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book \\"Statistical Mechanics.\\"Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's \\"Descent of Man\\" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey?"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"\\"Step back from the tree Charles\\"...he can't - he's dead."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"To illustrate what's wrong with this book, I below lift out the central hypothesis which is the theory of Natural Selection.&quot; can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.&quot;The fact is that *all* individuals do not survive, all individuals die. Such exactness is important in science and Darwin fails this scientific standard. This seemingly insignificant error in the fundament of the theory gives a cascade of errors later on. It is really quite different to say that the chance of reproduction determines which organisms are left in the world, then to say a struggle for survival/existence determines it. The first puts focus on the individual organism (since they reproduce, but don't survive), the last puts focus on the population (which doesn't reproduce much, but can be said to survive).Throughout the book there is no effort at formalization, which is why Physicists, Chemists etc. people of the socalled hard sciences(up until the 19!80's when physicists also started to make their science softer because of the problems they ran into), looked down on Darwinism as a soft science employing a magical struggle for existence and intuitive terms like that.It is clear that Darwin, having dropped Christianity, invested as much emotion into his theory as he could, making it a suitable substitute religion for him, rather then try to make it a hard science.&quot;Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.&quot;The natural force of goodness? For crying out loud. This should have read something like: and as natural selection works by the chance of reproduction of each organism, all corpereal endowments normally contribute towards reproduction.The security of humanity depends on politics much. Certainly humanity is capable of killing themselves entirely, what with superweapons like the earth slicer, or some biological weapon, or destroying the ozoneshield, or stopping the oceanic pump etc. :( It is not good for Darwin to ignore politics as an active agency in favour of some biological determinism. This is something he also does in the Descent of Man in a *much* more creepy way when talking about the extermination of one race by another. There really is much better work done in biology in the same era, this is not up to scratch."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Charles Darwin may not have been the first to champion a theory of evolution, but he certainly was the best. Dry nineteenth-century writing aside, the book is a fascinating introduction to evolutionary theory. It still amazes me that someone completely in the dark about modern theories of inheritance could have successfully explained so much about evolution and variation. The book is chock-full of brilliant insights.It's true that the book is - of course - a little outdated. Reading a more modern update, like Richard Dawkins' &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (and &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; if you're ambitious), will definitely bring you up to speed on the topic..."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This is a handsome hardcover edition; the type is easy to read. Anyone who vilifies Darwin and claims that evolution is untenable hasn't read The Origin of Species. Christian fundamentalists should read this work: once they grasp the powerful connections Darwin makes between animaland plant breeding (intelligent selection) and how the environment gradually eliminates individuals less suited to its conditions (natural selection), they might see that arguing against Darwin's theory is like arguing Netwon's theory of gravity is wrong. Read Darwin before you cast the first stone!"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Like many other seminal literary works and ideological manifestos, 'The Origin of Species' has suffered from the fame (and notoriety in equal measure) heaped on it by reviewers, commentators, atheists, agnostics and orthodox bible believers. I would not equate this work with the bible or 'Hamlet' or any other literary work. This is NOT a literary work: it is a study, a collection of observations from which Darwin himself draws only tentative conclusions. As a man of science there is little more than Darwin can do because the truth lies somewhere between 'we don't have a clue' to '42' and he admits as much at various points in his published research.What is fascinating - to me, at any rate - is watching the process of his logic unfold as the pages are devoured. I wonder how many readers of this have read publications from, say, the Church of Scientology? I must confess I have not but my given understanding is that there is no way of completely proving or disproving their mantras.This book has set in train a wondrous debate about God, Creation and Natural Selection and in that sense it ranks as a work which although difficult at times to read - Darwin would I'm sure admit to being no literary genius - is worth reading simply to discover for yourself what all the fuss is about.I think it's important to read historical reports of the aftermath of the publication of the first edition of this book. That in itself and the ensuing debate is, in my opinion, at least as interesting, if not more so, than the work which sparked the whole thing off."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I read this book, here in Brazil.The author, Darwin was an atheist and a racist.Writen at the same time and place, as Francis Galton and Karl Marx, Darwin didn't followed both of these charlatans, to the sewages of history.The theory of evolution began first in Greece and was also supported by another english, Wallace; but Charles Darwin, with this book really put evolution in mankind's mind.This book was read by Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill,Mussolini,etc.Someone will claims that Darwin knew nothing, about the genes and DNA.Fossils found decades after this book be published, also put new evidences to evolution.Even so, the main claim of this book,evolution, was increased in believe, by time.Begined by this book, darwinism is alive and good today."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"\\"If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly service) that individuals having many advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and procreating their kind?

LeRon Shults in his brilliant book Reforming Theological Anthropology (p. 207). I've owned The Origin of Species for nearly 10 years now but never actually read it: or hardly cracked it open. I did spend a lot of time trying to DISprove what I had not read though - which really got me nowhere. I'll be preaching on ideas of creation and evolution at our church in Brooklyn, and decided that instead of just giving second-hand quotes from the book without reading it, why not read it? I'm glad that I did.Darwin's most well-known book was really virtually nothing like I had expected that it would be, and I found that I really enjoyed it: and for the most part thought that he made excellent points. At no point did I ever see him trying to disprove God in any way - he simply spoke against \\"the common idea of creation\\" (pp. 66-67, 113, 171, 223, 379, 382, 384, 392, 415-417, 458, et. al) which he seemed to take as meaning \`all things were created as they are today with no room for mutability' or something along those lines. In fact at several points he even seemed concerned that we not mock God/the Creator. On page 201 Darwin states, \\"To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old an ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\"Darwin very systematically looks at a number of objections and problems to his theories - for example:\\"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\" p.217\\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not have possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no such case...\\" p.219\\"If it could be proved and any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\" p.228-229\\"Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.\\" p.292\\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\" p.309It is important to note, however, that after each of these possible explanations Darwin gives credible thoughts as to how these (and other objections) could be overcome. He often \\"freely admits\\" that not all will believe his theory based off of his arguments, and I find that the general tenor of the book is humble: at times a little too apologetic (in the \\"I'm sorry for this\\" sense) as he often states that [putting all the details here would be impossible]. I'm actually thankful for that as at times the book became frightfully boring as he listed fact after fact about different species/varieties of creatures. Don't get me wrong though: there were many shining moments of interest as I read. For example the section on ants (p.243ff), the bit about the seeds in the mud that he studied (p.374ff) and the section on the metamorphosis of the cirripedes which I found to be stunningly interesting (p.420ff).Darwin's tremendous volume of study is clear throughout the book: the ease that he demonstrates in switching his focus from animal to animal and issue to issue was extraordinary - it would be fantastic to actually meet him and watch his mind work.I think that Darwin's most significant contribution in the book overall is showing just how dependant the entire world is on each other - I think that we could all learn a lot from this very true concept. On page 125 he states, \\"Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district\\" just to name one such instance of interdependence.Another sort of \`theme' that emerges in the book is Darwin's need for an actual explanation of why things are the way they are (pp.67, 399, 415-417, et. al.). He's not happy to just say \\"such and such was created thus\\" - he want to know WHY they are the way that they are. The Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) are really never interested in the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" of creation - only that ultimately God was responsible. With this pointed out, I can confidently say that nothing in \\"The Origin of Species\\" contradicts anything that's in the bible to any sort of severe degree, outside of staunch strict literalism, which the Biblical texts by no means demand.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the core of the ideas that have become so prevalent in today's world. I'll end my review with one last quote, which is what Darwin states at the very end of the book (pp.459-460):\\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixes law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\""},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I had read The Voyage of the Beagle first. It is easy to see how Darwin's theory of evolution was growing as he traveled and saw how plants and animals adapted to different environments. Then he invented a theory to explain what he had observed.This book is a 300 page definition of the theory of natural selection. Darwin goes through a detailed explanation of how evolution must have occured. He is very methodically, very detailed. When he doesn't understand something, he says he doesn't. He is humble in his presentation, giving credit to other scientists. I was amazed at how many experiments he performed himself, growing generations of plants and insects, watching how they developed and changed.There is a quote in the book from Darwin's gardener who said, \\"He's really a sad little man. Sometimes he stands and stares at a flower for hours. I really think he'd be better off if he had something to do.\\"We are so lucky that Darwin inherited money and could spend his early years traveling and his later years in contemplation and writing."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this.

There are books that are arguably more influential, but they do not, by-and-large, contribute to our understanding of the physical world. There are books with greater factual content which has been less revised in the light of new knowledge, but it is hard to think of one quite as influential. Darwin, after a decades-long process of formulation, research and self-doubt, with this book both established the theoretical framework that turns natural history into a science and identified humanity's place in that framework. The effect has been profound.I must admit, I found Darwin's prose harder to follow than I had expected. Victorian prose tended to circumlocution, and Darwin for this reason was for me less readable than either modern protagonists of scientific theory or the philosophes of the Enlightenment. This was a pity, and detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading such a profound work. For crystal clarity of explanation I would choose Dawkins. For gravity and historical impact, one has to read Darwin.Stylistic niggle aside, it is striking how much Darwin got right at a time of limited knowledge and means, and sometimes even more illuminating what he got wrong, or did not know. The greatest lacuna in his rather encyclopaedic knowledge of nature concerned the rules of variation and development. These are a continuing triumph in science and their effect has been to confirm and complete Darwin's own triumphs. Darwin was not aware of the rules of Mendelian inheritance. He was, therefore, forced to fish in the dark for an understanding of how variation arises and re-emerges over generations. The synthesis of this understanding, when it was widely realised, reinforce natural selection and turn it into a true, mathematical, science discipline. Darwin believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. We now do not, except in the limited technical sense of epigenetics, but this, along with the plasticity provided by the principles of use and disuse, merely strengthens natural selection.When he gets it \\"right\\", as defined by our present understanding, Darwin is even stronger. On homology and biogeography his case is simply compelling. He backs up his arguments about the movement of species with case after carefully-tested case regarding the survival of seeds in salt-water, the presence off-shore of flying insects, the movement of eggs and earth on birds' feet and so forth. It has been said that Darwin's unique notoriety in a period when evolution was emerging all around him and was formulated independently by another, Wallace, is due to his discipline and patience in gathering and documenting evidence. I have to agree. He is the quintessential scientist.Had Darwin never lived, natural selection would have been known before the end of the Century regardless. We owe to Darwin that it became a true science and that it stood so early on such strong foundations."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The Origin of Species: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for LifeThis is an excellent ebook.

The first two are correct, the third is absolutely false, and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance. Considering that &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is over 600 pages long, and took nearly two decades to write, one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words &quot;Humans descended from apes,&quot; which, in fact, it neither contains nor implies.

There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwin's magnum opus: &quot;observation&quot;.It is a lengthy book; at times it is tedious, at times politically incorrect, and at times scientifically off-base.

The theory is the cornerstone--if not the very foundation--of modern biology. Whatever your preconceptions, you will likely be surprised by this work. Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist, as well as a refined and articulate gentleman. &quot;Origin&quot; is a delight and an epiphany to read. It's amazing how much Darwin got right, despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked. It's amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled, analyzed, and described. It's amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence, noting when competing theories made different predictions, when the available evidence was not what he would have expected, and what future evidence could completely discredit (falsify) his theory. It's amazing in its honesty.The misconceptions about &quot;Origin of Species&quot; are not merely rampant, they are effectively universal, fueled (largely in the US) by the rise of creationism, which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin (often failing to distinguish between the two). It's worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume, if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book. Once you have, take the little quiz again. You may need 600 pages to answer the last question."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The Origin of Species, for the first time offering an adequate explanation for biological change and origins, should be required reading for anyone interested in biology, history, or life in general. Because the book outlines the beginnings of a vast, new theory, it is accessible to laypersons. It does not suffer from the esotericism of most scientific writings, which expect readers to have a working knowledge of a specific scientific idea. Darwin starts from scratch and builds up all the evidence for his theory in a way that renders his argument undeniable.Darwin's idea explains the production of differing species through natural selection. Darwin did little to explain evolution, or the change, of species, but this book fully outlines how the mechanism of selection would make sure such random changes would produce complex organisms. The mechanism Darwin proposes is at once so simple and seems so obvious with hindsight. It is something evident to any dog breeder--that traits can be selected and passed on to different generations--and Darwin even draws upon knowledge of artificial selection in birds and dogs to bolster his claims. Ultimately, however, the evidence for evolution by natural selection lies not in a vague analogy to artificial selection, but in the predictions Darwin's theory made and fulfilled. Darwin's expectation of biological similarity in ancestors and descendants is fulfilled by simply looking at exterior features or even bone structures. He also notes that his theory thoroughly predicts and explains the existence of rudimentary features like teeth in whale embryos and flightless wings in birds. The fact that island species correspond most with similar species on the nearest continent, instead of in distant lands, shows that these species are descended from them and changed after migrating to a separate environment. Darwin also showed how his theory explained the difficulties with classifying species, because evolution thoroughly broke down the distinction of species as pure and distinct.Not only is this book useful in gaining an understanding of evolution, but it is also a good outline for scientific methodology and research. One comes into reading the book wondering how one could prove an unobservable process that takes millions of years to occur, and is overwhelmed by the ingenuity of the predictions offered by the theory that are fulfilled by subsequent observations. Darwin's book shows that the predictive power of theories are vital, allowing them to be tested and refuted. The entire book outlines the vacuousness of the design inference as a common explanation for life, showing that an inference of design does not explain similarity in biological structures, vestigial and rudimentary parts, the geological distribution of life, and the difficulty in classifying species. All of these observations are explored in meticulous detail by Darwin, and shown to be thoroughly explained by evolution combined with natural selection.From a historical perspective, reading the book causes one to marvel at Darwin's ingenuity. One can see glimmers of later discoveries reflected in Darwin's reasoning. One shakes one's head at his ability to explain the distribution of life by glaciers and flight and rafting...only to realize that the theory of plate tectonics would have been a delightful solution to the several problems Darwin noted with distribution for fossilized species. Darwin often makes bold predictions that the modern reader knows come true, and it is simply a wonderful thing to behold such accuracy.The Origin of Species is a wonderful book, accessible to all, and a treasure to read for anyone with a passion for history, science, or life."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Before reviewing this excellent book it would be best to introduce this review with an overview of the current climate when it comes to Darwin.Charles Darwin (a naturalist) is the father of modern Evolution (not *Evil*ultion; it is pronounced *Evo*-lution).Darwin's overall explanation of evolution, in this book, is not modern evolutionary biology. Modern evolution can, and does, go beyond Darwin's view.Darwin's model is often called Darwinism, a partially philosophical concept but mostly the science of biology and geology combined. It is widely considered to be the single most important scientific discovery of all time. Darwin's underlying points are the essentials of evolutionary biology.Theories are comprised of facts without gaps. Theories are factual. Theories contain facts to explain a factual instance of something material. Theories do not contain fabrications or a little bit of lies plus some truths. If a theory is not all facts then it is not a theory.The phrase \\"it is just a theory and not fact\\" is a contradiction of terms. A factual instance of something (such as observing speciation) needs to be explained. Facts are used to explain the factual instance of something material.Darwin used philosophy and biological science and earth sciences (geology) to develop the concept of natural selection which is primarily based on explaining how evolution occurs with the mechanism of \`natural selection'. Darwin observed in the world about him what he believed to be the result of a single cell organism that had evolved into all forms of life we see today. More importantly, there is no chaos involved. It has order. \\"The Origin of Species\\" (TOOS) is all about Darwin discussing how he came to this conclusion.In the 21st Century, \\"Speciation\\" has been observed countless times. Go search right now for \\"Observed Speciation Events\\".***Speciation is a fact whether we can explain the mechanisms of how it works or not. This can not be understated! A fact is a fact regardless of our ability to explain how it works. Gravity existed well before Newton could explain it. Speciation exists (a new species developing in the world, under scientific observation) meaning evolution is a fact. Look at the title of this review. Nobody should have to explain evolution in order to prove it factual. ***Now is the time to say this. If you don't believe theories are factual, then stop engaging the results of factual science in your life right now. Walk the talk. Turn off the PC. Turn off the electricity. Turn off the heating... and walk. I will allow you the option of a bronze spear... that is if you know how to smelt bronze.As a note, the Catholic Church has been teaching the fact of evolution and the theory of the mechanisms of evolution in Catholic schools since the 1950s. This is exactly the same coursework that secular schools have on evolution. However there is some discrepancy over natural selection. Natural selection has order but it is not guided. This is the problem part for most religious people. One would do well however to experience thinking about natural selection without any divine guidance. This is truly the type of thinking that grasps the full impact of this work.The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is independent of the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is a compilation of facts (without gaps) used to explain the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is here, in part, but are much better explained and referenced by modern evolutionary biology. If its modern evolution you want (and you may well do if your first search brought you here) then go to talkorigins on the net and read about the \\"29+ evidences for macroevolution\\". It can take days, weeks months, or years, or a lifetime to parse the data, but keep going over it and it will eventually click.The most popular version of The Origin of Species is the one which contains the first edition published by Darwin in 1859 with an editor's introduction by J. W Burrow first published in 1968. Burrows covers the history of the work, the successive editions of the book that Darwin published and recent scientific discoveries that shed light on Darwin's theory.IntroductionDarwin in TOOS starts by describing his life and times as a naturalist. Darwin explains the problem of immutable claims about the species and goes through the historical record to show instances where people have indicated that the species are mutable. He explains that he is writing this book because Alfred Russel Wallace has drawn the same conclusions about natural selection.Chapter 1: Variation under DomesticationDarwin goes straight into variations under domestication showing that farmed animals are substantially different from their wild counterparts from which they came. Darwin did not have access to Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance but he did guess that there was a mechanism like this responsible for variation. His bases for the assertion that species come from other closely related species is absolutely fundamentally correct by today's standards. His explanation for it was revolutionary for his time.Chapter 2: Variation under NatureDarwin exposes the instability of the then current system of taxonomy to show that categorization and labelling is not fixed and thus questions the bases for immutability. This paves the way for the natural overview that all like organisms share commonalities and that variations can be immediate or subtle gradual changes over time. Darwin discusses intermediate forms and shows that group changes are proportional while alluding to the first shape of an evolutionary tree.Chapter 3: Struggle for ExistenceDarwin presents the ecosystem and shows that all organisms struggle to survive and that this struggle influences what we, who have survived this struggle, see in the world today. Darwin shows this complex structure and connects it with such descriptions as the presence of a feline determining through the intervention of mice and then bees the frequency of certain flowers in an area.Chapter 4: Natural SelectionThis is core material of how highly complex organisms are formed from organisms with lesser complexity and has still stood the test of time today. Darwin not only verifies evolution but explains its mechanism, natural selection. Using the analogy of a tree and the taxonomy of living things Darwin shows how beneficial variations in conjunction with heredity are responsible for the formation of new species gradually over long periods of time which compete and cause extinctions. Darwin establishes the foundation for common descent.Chapter 5: Laws of VariationDarwin, without knowing Mendel's laws of inheritance, comes close to explaining it by in-depth analyses of the variations in organisms, such as the horse and cabbage. Darwin has been preparing the reader to accept that species are highly variable and that this means that ideas of a static independent design of the species without variation are highly flawed and evolution can be the only sensible conclusion drawn from the evidence.Chapter 6: Difficulties on TheoryDarwin does what religious writers avoid which is self-critic, the hallmark of scientific thinking, brings up all possible problems with his theory and slowly shows how the answers are natural even though he doesn't have them all yet, but still manages to explain the evolution of the eye by comparison to lesser complex eyes in nature as well as the evolution of flight by comparison to gliding organisms. Darwin then shows imperfections in nature, explains why they are there and pulls off a last minute rationalization for why organisms more suited for another environment live in a completely different one with natural selection.Chapter 7: InstinctDarwin looks at complex instincts in the animal kingdom. Here Darwin examines the life of aphids and ants, revealing their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.Chapter 8: HybridismIn order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological RecordDarwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic BeingsNow that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.Chapter 11: Geographical distributionDarwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continuedWithout directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary OrgansFor anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or \`inutility'.Chapter 14: Recapitulation and ConclusionDarwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view. Darwin says, \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, EVOLVED.\\"The complex web of relations with livings things to the environment is staggering yet so obvious in hindsight. The whole point of TOOS is it is ridiculous that someone didn't get this sooner. The environment has an impact of living things and living things have an impact on the environment. This is a symbiotic relationship. There is an opportunity for improvement or deterioration in the offspring just on the basis of all possible genetic combinations. Minor changes add up to big ones.Darwin's findings about how the environment causes variations in living things is accurate in his proposals although his tenders are mostly humanistic with references to biology especially with regards to \\"monstrosities\\" that simply don't have any reason for things like \\"wings\\", such as some insects and some birds, if they can't fly. Vestiges are an extremely good case for evolution. The cave crab with an eye stalk without an eye is like a telescope without the lens. Darwin identifies the possibility of sex linked traits in animals, a proven point today.Reading TOOS is like a romance novel where the birth of something to unify the sciences further is described in a man's love for nature and his crucial discovery. TOOS is something that needs to be reread several times for the full impact. Walking around in the world today knowing that all organisms have evolved from lesser complexity to greater complexity by means of natural selection is a whole different worldview to thinking that a supernatural deity did it. Challenge yourself. Try it."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This is not a difficult book to read, and I would encourage readers to read the original work of Darwin.\\"The Origin of Species\\" is considered to be an important work in both world literature and science. An interesting aspect of the book was the pressure for Darwin to publish the book. Prior to publishing, he had spent almost 30 years developing and testing his ideas. The book is a combination of argument and debate along with descriptions of Darwin's own experiments with birds and plants, including his own cabbage garden. In short, according to Darwin, the evolution of species takes place over a long time period and is a series of random events with survival of the fitest, or what is called \\"natural selection.\\"Darwin was born in 1809, trained as a botanist and zoologist at Cambridge University, and made his famous trip on the H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. He was first inspired by the writings of the geologist Sir Charles Lyell. This same geologist would play an important role in pushing Darwin to publish his findings in 1856.Darwin - as he writes in his book - was not working alone. He was not the first to come up with the ideas. Darwin was preceded by many before him with similar ideas. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire wrote as early as 1795 that species are \\"degenerations of the same type.\\" Lamarck was in fact the first person to suggest that \\"all species, including man, are descended from other species.\\" He published his ideas in 1801, 1809, and 1815. W.C. Wells presented a paper on human skin colors in 1813 and published his results in 1818. This was followed by The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert published in the \\"Horticultural Transactions\\" in 1822 that \\"botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties.\\" In 1826 professor Grant \\"declares his belief that species are descendent from other species.\\" Also, Von Bush in 1836 \\"expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species.\\" And, in 1846 M.J. d'Omalius d'Halloy published a paper with his opinion \\"that it is more probable that new species have been produced by descent with modification than they have been separately created.\\"After the Beagle trip, Darwin's main pre-occupation was to prepare his five volume work \\"Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle\\" over the years 1840 - 1843. Also, he undertook a series of experiments on evolution and wrote shorter papers. But in 1856 geologist Sir Charles Lyell persuaded Darwin to take his notes and publish \\"The Origin of Species.\\" As he prepared the book, Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a manuscript with an identical or similar theory. The two men decided to present their works simultaneously to the Linnaean Society. Wallace had visited Malaysia and come up with similar conclusions to Darwin, but he had not yet prepared an impresive large book, as had Darwin.Darwin had been very cautious, and in the years 1840 to 1856 he had undertaken a number of experiments himself with pigeons and various plants. He had even joined two pigeon clubs and had his own garden in the country. He describes some of the slightly amusing details in the book. For example, he was able to grow over 200 varieties of cabbages by cross breeding. Among the findings, he had come to the conclusion that domestic pigeons were probably all related back to the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). He undertook a number of experiments including one where he mated two mongrel pigeons, and the resulting offspring looked like rock-pigeons.So, although Wallace had the same ideas at the same time, Darwin had a fifteen years accumulation of notes, observations, and his own experiments that he could put into the book. Once the book came out it was an instant best seller and Wallace was largely forgotten, along with his other predecessors. Darwin was very cautious with his findings, and the many years researching and thinking about his ideas - almost two decades - paid off for him when he finally released the near 700 page book.Darwin published a second well known book in 1871: \\"The Descent of Man.\\"\\"The Origin of Species\\" is a well crafted and interesting book. There are just a few figures in the book. It is an easy read, although some parts have many small details. Darwin lectures us on a variety of subjects such as flower reproduction. The heart of the book is Chapter IV: Natural Selection. He has fifteen chapters covering a range of topics including geology and fossils.It must be remembered that when the book came out in 1859 it was generally assumed that only God could create life. The book was revolutionary, and too detailed to refute. It was a comprehensive book and came as a major challenge to the accepted norm. At the end in the conclusion Darwin tells the reader that his findings just give a different explanation in the way \\"the Creator\\" works, and it does not imply a lack of a God."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"I started reading this book expecting to find offensive, disrespectful, and vicious material throughout it. What I came to realize instead, was that people have criticized this book based on offensive, disrespectful and vicious accusations. I can't identify how people have linked this work to God and blasphemy. It has nothing to do with religion, faith, or creation. This is a work of observation, logic, and adaptability. It makes perfect sense, and trust me, it is in no way offensive.To think that for a century people have been debating, fighting, and cursing Charles Darwin over this work seems comical once you read his book. The book is written in easy to understand common language, allowing the not so biologically or anthropologically astute to understand it as well. Even if you are not convinced by Darwin's observations, you will be convinced that there is no threat to anyone's beliefs from this book.I found this work to be very convincing and highly compatible with my faith in God. It does not threaten God, and it certainly does not require me to abandon any beliefs even though I fully understand and agree with Mr. Darwin. Read this book, it is worthy of consideration and it is only fair to hold judgment until after you have read it."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"This edition (Modern Library Paperback) has several distracting typos. I had to refer to project gutenberg editions to find the correct text in several places. Other reviewers have done justice to the content."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Many reviewers start with the warning that this is primarily a scientificwork, and therefore a casual reader may find it difficult to read. I wouldtake quite the opposite view: given that this _is_ a scientific work,comparable in its impact to Newton's Principia, it is a surprisinglyeasy and lively read. While the text is a bit dry, and the numerous examplesmay seem overwhelming, I still found Darwin to be a gifted writer, and his choiceof examples enlightening, and entertaining (this is the first time I read aboutants that enslave other ants, for instance). I wishthat modern scholarly works in biology, or any other science, werewritten nearly as well as the \\"Origin of Species.\\"Even so, it is difficult to give this book a rating. It's impact on the view wehave of ourselves as a species is so enormous that judging the literarymerrits of the book is, perhaps, beside the point. Darwin's amazing prescience,and the thoughtfulness in presenting an \\"abstract\\" of his argument fordescent with modifications are awe inspiring."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Darwin's Origin of Species is the first book I've read on evolution and being someone that appreciates the scientific manner of explaining observed phenomena with consistent theories, I tried to pay attention to the merits of Darwin's argument. I believed Darwin's theory was generally right(or at least on the right track) before reading this book and after reading it, I'm only more convinced.Although I knew the general ideas put forth by Darwin, I'm now more educated as to the manner in which Darwin came to his conclusions. It was interesting the way in which he considered, for example, how two similar species of mammals or plants could be found on two different continents very far from each other. I particularly liked his consideration of our knowledge of geological history and its relationship to his theory. I also enjoyed learning about the difficulties in distinguishing varieties and species and why it is this distinction may be somewhat arbitrary.One of the things I like about this book was the fact that Darwin addressed the various counterarguments against his theory and usually provided compelling discussions as to why his theory provided better explanation as to the observed nature of things than the idea of Creationism, which he mentions a few times throughout the book. He was meticulous enough to give much thought to potential weaknesses in his theory and yet offer explanation to how these supposed weaknesses may not be as formidable as they initally appear.I found that Darwin's work was rather thought-provoking as I found myself thinking more of mankind's development and the potential uses and development of our own organs and how they may have given us an advantage over other species.Darwin was sometimes a little long-winded in his discussion, but considering the importance of the subject matter, I appreciated his thoughtful and thorough exposition.I'm no expert in evolutionary theories or how Darwin's theory is regarded by experts today. And I don't necessarily think he got everything completely right, but I found his argument generally pretty convincing and think he was closer to being right than wrong. The origin of species, particularly ourselves, is a very important subject and I believe someone would be doing themselves a service to read such an important work."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"Many people assume that Darwin's initial account of natural selection is so out of date that it is to be avoided in favour of more recent text books of evolutionary theory. While it is true that huge gains have been made in the one and a half centuries since the first publication of \\"The Origin\\", there is nothing in this work which is wrong. Darwin was too good a scientist and too cautious.Some claim that Darwin admitted of the possibility of Lamarkian mechanisms. They have not read the original. Darwin knew nothing of the molecular basis of genetics, but knew that natural selection did not need a Lamarkian mechanism. He simply did not rule it out, although he found it improbable. Everything that is stated in this great classic is as true today as it was at the time of first publication.It is also said that Charles Darwin was a lesser intellectual when compared to most other great names of science; that he was a plodder, a naturalist, a sort of gentleman stamp collector who pressed flowers into his books and barely a scientist in the contemporary sense. This is nonsense. Darwin was one of the giants of rigorous systematic thinking; the kind of rigorous thinking and critical attitude that asks the right questions and provides the capacity to answer them. Let me buttress this claim with one example.At the end of chapter six Darwin noted that the theory of natural selection could not account for structures or behaviors found in one species that exist solely for the benefit of another unrelated species. In setting out the theoretical terms for the refutation of the theory in this way, he anticipated Karl Popper, that analytical non-nonsense philosopher of science, by more than a century.I recommend you read this book with an attentive curious analytical mind. You will find yourself walking in the footsteps of an intellectual giant."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"There are many different versions of Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\" available, but I found this one particularly helpful. First, while it is nicely printed and easy to read on good paper, it is not terribly expensive. Second, it reprints the first or original version of the book which Darwin subsequently modified substantially in the the further five editions he published. Third, it also includes Darwin's \\"Historical Sketch\\" and \\"glossary\\" which had not appeared in the first edition. Fourth, the color cover illustration by the Victorian artist Henry de la Beche is an important indicator of why the Victorians were so into prehistoric studies. However, the thing that really distinguishes this Penguin Books edition is the incredibily incisive and invaluable introduction by the editor, J.W. Burrow. Burrow is beyond question one of the most significant intellectual historians of our time. Among other things he has written extensively on the concept of evolution in Victorian thought in his classic \\"Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory.\\" In 37 crisp pages, Burrow incomparably sketches the Victorian intellectual background against which Darwin wrote. Although the essay is nearly 40 years old, it has stood the test of time very well. It alone is worth the price of the book. Altogether, a very nice introduction to this critical event in scientific and intellectual history."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted. Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists. He may be, I have not read \\"The Descent of Man\\" yet. The origin of species talks very little of man. It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today. The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change. Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth. I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book. It is a difficult read. I would rather have read the dictionary. One does need to know his enemy. Darwin is not the originator of \\"evolution.\\" There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time. He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical. Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it \\"hip.\\" What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world has adopted. I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has. From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful. I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist. It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove \\"evolution\\" as proof of our existence. What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found. He was a confusing man.150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case. In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.The theory of evolution caused Darwin to loose his faith and his experience has been repeated in countless lives. Evolution is an acid that eats away at the mind, a cancer.One only needs to open the pages to Michael Behe's book, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", to understand the futility of the evolutionary theory. The engines of life at the molecular level are so complex that there leaves no other possibility than a creator of the universe. There should be no excuse.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species","review":"The true title that Darwin gave this thesis is: &quot;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.&quot; Amazon.com makes no mention of this.

About 8 years ago there was talk of a new version, but I guess that has been shelved,The biggest changes in recent years, haven't been so much in epoxies, as they have in methods. Cold molded boats are still made, but with computers (as sophisticated shape generators) and better fabrics, the majority of great new boats are being built strip style. There is little coverage of that here. Neither is there coverage of Constant Camber, Duracore (though there is balsa core relative stuff), Cylinder Molds, glued lap, and the list goes on.Few amateur builders have ever lofted a boat these days, it just isn't the same scene.But on the other hand these guys understand wood. They go into a lot of non-hull details, from decks to gas tanks (though they no longer recommend the latter. If you read and understand this book, you will be a far better wooden boat builder. There really isn't anything else as serious out there. Mead Gougeon's tri made Sail magazine's (I think) list of the 30 most important boats, I don't think anyone else who made that list has written a similar book.Other than 207 hardener, their epoxies remain much as described here.Oh by the way, they have a free booklet on strip building."},{"Title":"The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction: Wood and West System Materials","review":"This book is a very comprehensive overview of wood boat construction. I checked the book out of the library before making the decision to buy it! Two vital pieces of information, in addition to boat construction, was the attention to detail regarding the power and hand tools you might need, and the layout of your shop in the construction of your boat.I would recommend the Fourth (Revised) Edition, which was published in 1985. At that, I was still concerned about the dated materials on epoxy being fifteen years out. I contacted G.B.s Inc. and they emailed me back that there was no plans to update the book. They let me know that they have a free newsletter they send out on the latest construction techniques and the evolving science of epoxy construction materials. They apparently have archived past newletters for those looking for particular information. I would, however, recommend the Fourth (1985) and last edition if you are going to purchase this book. The 1979 edition is too dated. An excellent companion book is &quot;Boat Strength&quot; by David Gerr, N.A.

That said, though, there's a deep wealth of practical boatbuilding advice here that can't be had elsewhere, and I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in wood-and-epoxy techniques. The chapter on lofting is also better than many entire books that have been written on the subject.The book also comes with a small addendum covering updates in the WEST System technologies (the latest I've seen is February 2001, although there may be newer), although it's only a few pages."},{"Title":"The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction: Wood and West System Materials","review":"As editor of a popular amateur boat building site I have seen quite a few books on building in wood, this is one of the few that I own...My first contact with \\"Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction\\" was the previous edition at a time when I was getting back into boat building seriously. The boat was a glued lapstrake and my first ever contact with epoxy so I read cover to cover and learned a great deal. This new edition improves on the previous one in many ways - the content has better organization for example.The Gougeon Brothers know a lot about wood. They know a lot about building boats in wood. They invented some of the modern epoxy boat building techniques used today. If you are going to build a boat in wood get this book - even if you are not going to use epoxy. There is a wealth of information here that makes this book one (if not the one) book you must have on your bookshelf. If you are going to use epoxy for the first time you must have this definitive reference.

I tend to like books of this sort, and have read quite a few of them. By the title and brief description, I thought it might be a sort of middle-of-the-pack choice, the purchase of which was spurred by my respect for the authors (perhaps for interviewing Krishnamurti...). In any case, I have found wisdom, sanity, insight and inspiration on virtually every page. These authors and this book really have something extra to contribute, compared to other \\"find meaning in your work and life\\" works. It is spiritual and practical at the same time, rooted in an expanded perception of reality and traditional wisdom, and doesn't fall into the \\"just wish for pie in the sky and it will be yours\\" trap. It will make you feel good, but not so good that you forget your own responsibility in making things work. Lots of meaning packed into not so many words. This is my go-to book for help along the path of struggle that some times in life can be, the best book of its kind I have found. Doesn't emphasize one religious or philosophical viewpoint.

It is followed by a listing and identification of Irish heroes and a brief bibliography of Irish tradition and history. A few suggestions ensue on how one may begin a genealogical search for one's own Irish ancestors.The rest of the book is basically a guide to traditional Irish family relationships presented in chart form complete with maps to help the reader identify the origins of family names. There are over 2,000 names categorized.A GUIDE TO IRISH ROOTS is an ambitious undertaking. It will be of some value to the newcomer to Irish genealogy but of much more benefit to the person who already knows the names of at least four grandparents or eight great grandparents. If nothing else the book alerts the reader to the many difficulties involved in searching for Irish forbears and also the importance of oral tradition among the Irish people."},{"Title":"Anne Truitt - Sculpture and Drawings, 1961-1973","review":"This is a wonderful, albeit brief, exhibition catalog. The writing is one page of Acknowledgements, a four-page Introduction, a three-page Biographical Sketch, a two-page Exhibition list, a two-page Bibliography, and a seven-page Catalogue listing of the sculptures and drawings in the exhibition. There are also two nice b/w photographs of the artist, one portrait and one picture of her standing with one of her sculptures. The remainder of the book is comprised of photographs of the drawings and sculptures in the exhibition. The cover has a nice reproduction of one of her drawings as well. The photos are both color and b/w.Anne Truitt was one of the great inventors of the Minimalist aesthetic and is said to be in league with the likes of Donald Judd. You can see her influence on other artists by viewing the art represented in this handy book. I would also recommend her books of personal writing: Daybook, Turn, and Prospect. But this book is a great way to get a glimpse of what her work looks like. This book is a must for the serious Modern Art historian."},{"Title":"Texas Rose (Lone Star Country Club)","review":"This book was not like Marie's other books. The heroine was so uptight and just really...bitchy. She was so set on not staying with him, and what bothers me in romance books is when someone doesn't even tell the other person why they can't be with them. She pushed him away, she was so rude, and sometimes I just couldn't even tolerate her. Poor Matt kept trying, and sometimes I just wanted to shake some sense into him and make him stop being so nice to her. I thought he was being so considerate and sweet and caring, but in the book everybody was telling him he needed to work on how to talk to her. I really disagreed, and felt like Rose was too spoiled to deserve him."},{"Title":"Texas Rose (Lone Star Country Club)","review":"The Carsons and Wainwrights have been fueding for generations.

The two carry on a secret relationship until Rose discovers she's pregnant. Knowing that a Wainwright and a Carson can never wed, Rose tells Matt she's lost interest in him. When Rose reveals to her father that she is pregnant, he sends her to New York to live with his flaky sister Beth. A miserable Matt follows Rose to New York. With a little help from Aunt Beth, Matt sets out to win Rose back.Matt is a great male lead. He is sexy, caring and vulnerable. He's determined to win back the woman he loves in spite of their fueding families. I never could understand why Rose was so set on not getting back together with Matt when he was trying so hard to show her how much he loves her. Aunt Beth was a very interesting secondary character who added alot to the story."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"Tired of the same authors peddling their rapidly generated, poorly edited, mass-market novels that clutter the window display in your ubiquitous shopping mall mega-book store? Frustrated that American publishing houses prefer to engage and promote recognizable names rather than new voices? Well, here's your opportunity to try something new and, more importantly, satisfying. David Bradley's CD-Rom book is unlike anything you've read before. At one level How to Build a Skydeck is a novel, with characters worth getting to know. At another, it's a passion play, a study in race relations and class consciousness -- an examination of the human spirit questioning why we get out our beds each morning. Simultaneously, there's a healthy dosage of humor and a taste of classic science fiction, where the willful suspension of disbelief means more than the meaningless techno babble that plasticizes today's sci-fi trade. Bradley will draw you in with well developed characters experiencing the human condition until, well, until they confront the unexpected. Then, Bradley's creative, fresh plot, which propels itself forward without fail, will keep your attention riveted to your screen. Also, the CD-Rom format is worth trying -- as a neophyte to electronic text reading, I was pleasantly surprised by the convenience and comfort of reading on my computer screen. Similarly, compared to a lifetime of reading conventional books, I was ecstatic when I learned that I could search the text when I wanted to recall a carefully placed detail or hint that Bradley had introduced earlier in the work. Bradley will make you laugh, but more importantly, he'll make you think. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"In his freshman novel, Atlanta based author David Bradley cooks up an interesting recipe that calls for 1 cup coming of age, 2 cups new age science fiction, 1/2 cup workers rights and diversity issues, a tablespoon of modern management theory, and 1 full ounce of perfectly cured cannabis indica. Surprisingly, the unusual mixture results in an awfully tasty little treat entitled How to build a Skydeck.Bradley follows nineteen year-old Stan Davis' fall from upscale suburbia, country clubs, cable TV, and a full refrigerator into a manual labor construction job and a small sub-let room in a trailer park. From this humble station, young Stan comes to better understand himself, the people around him, and his place in the Universe.I loved reading this book. Bradley successfully conveys the message that while life isn't always easy, it does have a purpose. There is a reason for all the pain and frustration. Watching Stan try to figure out his purpose will make you laugh, but more importantly, it might just change the way you think about your life. Very few books have that kind of impact on people.I strongly recommend you give this one a try. It gets two thumbs up, three cheers, and five stars. Based on my enjoyment of this most excellent novel, I anxiously await Mr. Bradley's next effort."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"This book aims directly into the heart of the stewardship of a soul. On a par with Madeleine L'engle, David Bradley moves his characters deftly through loss, poignancy, love, humor, intrigue, danger, transcendence, with graceful skill, and a spiritual energy to make one believe in the profundity of life.Bradley writes fully formed characters, personalities who suffer, disappoint, enlighten, and live with a realness this natural born writer conveys seemingly effortlessly. Stan accepts with humility the trials of life and conscience. His story and the characters who leave their impressions will capture you to the final page. You will be reminded of the exquisite breathlessness of falling in love, know the love of a mentor for his charge, find compassion in the most unlikely stiff, experience a desire for acceptance that perseveres to the very root of suspicion and fear, and face mortality with a long forgotten key. Exquisite. Read and be awakened."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"I read the book twice because I loved it so much the first time! And I bought the CD-ROM so I could sneak the reading at work...Seriously, though, this is one of those books that you really have to sit down and read, not just race through in a hurry. The characters are real and easily draw themselves in your mind and I found myself casting the movie. But, putting that aside, it appears to be deceptively simple until you realize just how much is really happening around the edges.Bradley writes for the thinking Sci-Fi readers, not just those who are into little green men and shoot-em-ups on Jupiter. There's a richness to his story-telling that you might now see at first, but it creeps up on you and never fails to surprise. Readers who want to think about what they've read would do very well to read Bradley's works, especially this one."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"I must consider myself lucky to have happened upon this work. It is rare to find an unknown author so polished. His story is told from a unique perspective. His characters are unexpected, and controversial. His heros are bad boys,...and I find myself cheering for them. I loved this book, the only disappointing thing was that it was over too quickly. I eagerly await more from this guy!"},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"This was a very well written story that draws you in. Meet Stan Davis, a young man who's quit college, can't hold a job and is finally kicked out of home when his Mum and Dad decide that he has to stand on his own two feet. It's interesting watching him go from a freeloader to a person who 'crosses the tracks' as it were - leaves the mansion and debutante life for construction and sharing a trailer. The person living next door at the trailer park isn't quite what he seems, so a second storyline develops alongside this young man 'finding' himself, of government agents, aliens, and love!! Sounds corny, but is well written and believable. The only thing I found that made me uncomfortable was the religious angle that developed about 2/3rds of the way through the book. As a non-christian I thought that the author was pushing that particular religion, but he goes off at a slight angle with that too, so whilst I think he could have distanced himself a bit MORE from religion, it did get explained. A thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"Good story, not quite what i though it would be, but still a good story and it held my attention.

I can't wait to read what happens to Stan next, so hurry up and write another one David!"},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"Interesting story about a slacker trying to work through a big change in his young life that will require that he finally start to grow up. This involving narrative is interrupted 7/8 of the way through with a sudden switch to a philosophical explanation of the world that is not as profound or well thought out as the author may think. Good until the last drop (which was a little sour)."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"A classic example of a specific sort of science fiction at its finest. A small, tightly-written story that comments on race, culture, history, philosophy, and religion in genuinely thoughtful ways.

I did think it got a little heavy-handed at the end, but hell compared to the way Star Trek handles this stuff it was light as a feather.

(He is, he's just not exactly local.) By turns funny and touching, he gets at the heart of the human condition through some of fiction's kindest characters. Even the villains have something redeeming about them, even if they do remind you in a warped sort of way of Jake and Elwood Blues.This is an incredibly gentle book, with a genuine heart for not only the characters, but the reader as well. You're a guest in a very unusual home in this work, and it's hard to keep from smiling, even as you find your way out to the skydeck out back, for a double portion of &quot;divine swine.&quot; It's hard to not like a book that welcomes you like an old friend. Expect to read it over and over again."},{"Title":"How to Build a Skydeck","review":"I must say that I didn't expect much from this book but figured I'd read it based upon a friend's recommendation. Well, the story unfolds very nicely and the character development is excellent. Bradley has a certain Richard Bach (Illusions and Jonathan Livingston Seagull) likeness in his larger than life characters; and the philospohical aspects as metaphor of life underpin my comparison of the authors. All in all and excellent read!"},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"Traversing the diverse footprints of America's influential women seems a daunting order for one book. American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country by United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison navigates the lives and accomplishments of America's remarkable women, spanning from Mary Austin Holley to Sandra Day O'Connor and Amelia Earhart to Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The book reads like a collection of short stories, so it's perfect for the reader-on-the go. Read a chapter an evening, and be enlightened by a brief biography of an influential American woman, then commentary on the significance of her historical impact. Hutchison keeps the narrative light and lively, and she infuses the biography with her perspective on her subjects' lasting contribution.Diversity of subject strengthens this book. Senator Hutchinson groups the chapters into similar sections, such as \\"Pioneers and Preservationists,\\" \\"Education for Everyone,\\" \\"Conquering the Skies,\\" and \\"Public Lives, Public Service.\\" While Hutchinson is a political conservative, her biographical praise crosses back and forth across the ideological aisle - she gives equal admiration to Geraldine Ferraro and Madeline Albright as she does to Elizabeth Dole and Condoleezza Rice. And, her esteem reaches beyond politics. She commends healthcare pioneer Clara Barton, astronaut Sally Ride, and artist Mary Cassatt.The colloquial writing proves a little distracting. One more word-cutting and cleaning edit would have improved the work. However, Hutchinson voice is the book's finest attribute, and that remains clear throughout the biographies. Her admiring observations provide a personal touch to the history. An extraordinary woman herself, Hutchinson is the first woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. The book highlights her own resourcefulness and intelligence and reveals her affection for her home state. She's a little partial to the ladies of Texas in her subject choice, but what Texan isn't?Don't read this book if you're looking for a challenging and intellectual dose of history - go buy a textbook instead. But, read American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country for an enriching, entertaining and comprehensive tour of the lives and accomplishments of 45 outstanding American women."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"Senator Hutchison is a woman who has risen above stereotypes to become the first woman in Texas elected to the Senate. That says a lot in a land where men still open doors for women and call women \\"ma'am\\" or \\"miss\\" even though you may be a complete stranger. Put aside your political beliefs and you will have a book highlighting women who conquered the \\"glass ceiling\\" despite what was the norm of the times. These women may be from Timbuktu for all we know, but they are women whom our daughters can learn how to reach beyond gender stereotypes. Of course Senator Hutchison will include more women from Texas than from elsewhere, she grew up in Texas. These are women who influenced her and helped her achieve the \\"first\\" status as well. Again, putting aside politics, this book is a good book on the power of women who can rise despite criticism and social norms."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BOOKS OF ITS KIND THAT I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME.\\"AMERICAN HEROINES\\" IS A VERY SPECIAL BOOK AND REALLY SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN MOST HIGH SCHOOLS SO MOST STUDENTS CAN GET TO KNOW WHAT GREAT DEEDS THESE WONDERFUL WOMEN PERFORMED TO SHAPE AND MOLD THIS GREAT NATION OF OURS.

Kay Bailey Hutchison's (R-TX) book, American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country, I found a large error. The error was in her reference to NASA astronaut, Dr. Sally Ride;1. On page 207, 2nd paragraph Senator Hutchison writes: \\"Fast forward to June 18, 1983, and Dr. Ride became the first female astronaut for a mission into outer space.\\"2. Continuing on page 207, 3rd paragraph: \\"In 1983, she became the first women in space...\\"Dr. Ride was not the first woman to fly in outer space; she was the first \\"American\\" woman to fly in outer space and the third woman in outer space. The two other women that preceded her were Valentina Tereshkova (Vostok 6 in 1963) and Svetlana Savitskaya (Soyuz T-7 in 1982), both from the former Soviet Union. Some may argue that it is correct to say that Dr. Ride was the first women \\"astronaunt\\" as the former Soviet Union women were referred to as \\"cosmonaunts.\\" I do not agree, still incorrect information.One review of the book said that Senator Hutchinson's \\"combines biography and social history to shed light on what she calls the indomitable spirit of American women which has shaped both the country's history and its society.\\" Dr. Sally Ride's contribution to space flight and American women should be celebrated and she is an important a role model for women but it is also important that her accomplishments be presented correctly.It is unfortunate that this information was not researched more thoroughly or corrected by the editor. Several online encyclopedias contain the correct information.[...]"},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"Book only appealed to me because of the all but to brief sections on Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Madeleine Albright, because these are two very independent women I admire.The book is a tad 'slap together'and many of the questions the Senator asks are lame. There is no even flow or lay out and in some ways I think the book is like a dinner party with to many odd guests and to many choices in food. Some of the time you come away satisfied, but often one is left hungry or wondering where the rest of the story is.I recommend Lazy B : Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest by Justice O'Connor and Madam Secretary: A Memoir by Madeleine Albright former Secretary of State who is still very much admired and respected in Europe, Asia and the middle east. Each tells the story of these independent thinking women who are both excellent role models for women of all ages and of a progressive mindset."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"That Kay Bailey Hutchinson is working to burnish her political credentials is evident in this thin tome. Her choices of American heroines are safe, politically correct and generally right-wing. Many of those chosen have had business or social relationships with Ms. Hutchinson, giving the impression that she is shoring up her own base. Without doubt, many of the women profiled - especially the Texans - have risen above female stereotypes and oversome other obstacles, but they seem bland and predictable. REALLY \\"spirited women who shaped our century\\" are conspicuously missing."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"It would be tempting simply to compare Hutchinson's book with that of another Senator----John F. Kennedy. Kennedy would of course successfully go on to the presidency in 1960 after rising to national prominence in the 1950's with Profiles in Courage. Certainly, there are some similarities between these two titles and authors.Kennedy was also roundly critiqued for writing a book about \`leadership' when he (certainly unlike brother Ted) had not been in the Senate leadership---or even in elective office----for a substantial period of time.While Hutchinson certainly could also find herself facing similar allegations today, her own work adds the layer of gender analysis which had obviously not been made available to Kennedy in the 1950's.Hutchinson's book has the benefit of being written well after the revival of American feminism. Feminism has subsequently encouraged many women to increase their public sector participation, find \`role models' for themselves, and make further progress on behalf of future generations. Whatever personal-political label she now claims (if any), Bailey had also participated in some of the feminist movement's activities-another claim which Kennedy could not make with his own earlier book. Whereas he was attempting to court swing voters who would not have recognized him unless he was representing their state, Hutchinson is also attempting to court women's rights advocates who might perhaps discount her interest in gender equity issues because of her state and party identification.The feminist movement is technically non-partisan, but the institutionalization of feminist and anti-feminist interest groups has entrenched the political parties. Hutchinson is hardly the only Republican woman serving in the senate (she is joined by four others) but she does take a more economically/socially moderate voting record than her New England counterparts Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. This in turn causes state and national feminist PACS to give their \\"Republican\\" money only to the \`gypsy moths' and avoid the southern Republicans. Unfortunately, those feminist groups also overlook the common ground they do have with Hutchinson on women's rights.As a member of the Texas legislature, Hutchinson co-authored a rape reform bill with Sarah Weddington (who would later gain fame for successfully arguing Roe v. Wade) which reformed that state's rape prosecution laws. Removing the burden of proof from the survivor...etc, the Bailey-Weddington law successfully challenged the historical idea that \`good' women were not raped; rape was a crime of power---not lust or morals. Hutchinson also helped to pass the displaced homemakers bill, women who could no longer financially afford to be homemakers (whether because of divorce, breadwinner death, or the rising costs) deserved transition assistance such as college tuition credit breaks.Finally, Hutchinson came out against Admiral Frank Kelso's full retirement with military honors because she believed the women who had accused him of sexual harassment; her own personal experiences had subsequently built up her empathy for women in similar situations.This is hardly the resume of an anti-woman right wing extremist.Certainly Hutchinson has been careful with these \`woman activist' credentials. Local and state reproductive rights groups have criticized her position on abortion for being \`multiple choice'. Bailey wants to continue portraying herself as a \`moderate' while also being acutely aware the social conservatives who control the Texas Republican Party are not open to any compromise on abortion. Because they consider abortion (and even some kinds of birth control) \`murder,' these groups eye Hutchinson with suspicion-is she really their \`friend'?Since women's history remains generally underreported in Texas, I actually had considered the through inclusion of women's history important to the central premise of Hutchinson's book. Hutchinson understands that increases in women's political participation did not happen out of the goodness of somebody's heart, but instead took many years to see fruition. The individuals who are profiled in this book are only a fragment of the masses who were once formally excluded from political participation. Such a legal expansion had taken many years to achieve, and our democratic nation is still dismantling cultural vestiges against women's public sector participation according to interspersed narratives about the Senator's own life.The interweaving of her own personal life story (although definitely needing better editing for continuity purposes) throughout this book definitely serves a purpose. It is supposed to remind critics/potential critics that Hutchinson personally does not want to return to the \`good old days' when women's issues were only regarded as private-personal issues. She approaches it differently, but appears to share some common ground with left-wing feminists who have advocated for greater gender equity in both government and the general society, including former United States Representatives Bella Abzug and Patricia Schroeder.The fact that two women have served as secretary of state (and are both included in this book) illustrates how far we have come from 1955 when the only women in presidential cabinets had served in \`outer cabinet' positions. Frances Perkins was the first female cabinet secretary in 1933 (Labor), by the publication of Kennedy's book, Oveta Culp Hobby lead Eisenhower's Department of Health Education and Welfare Such expansion of women's leadership roles also demonstrates how the national definition of \`leadership' itself has expanded.I question whether some of the profiles which were included in this book would genuinely share Hutchinson's gender consciousness (however self-labeled). Even if they are not attacking it, it seems like some of these other women are not grateful for the gender/racial revolutions which made their public sector participation a reality.Considering that Iraq's ever-mounting casuality level is being facilitated through her promotion of false evidence about Iraq's (ultimately non-existent) \`weapons of mass destruction' program, including Condoleezza Rice among the leadership profiles is not wise. Because Rice's claim had comprised the backbone of the Bush administration's rationale for invading Iraq, the subsequent truth substantially undercuts her public weight for this---and other public policies. This person, who thought nothing of American troops deployed with fabricated evidence, does not convincingly demonstrate values and morals herself.It is important that we can recognize that women are not automatically better or more ethical leaders than their male counter parts. Although this proposition honestly is still being advanced by the editors of some other \`women in politics' titles, it is generally now in disfavor. Speaking only for myself, I would rather have a male public official in office with whom I agreed with on the issues than a woman public official with whom I did not agree with, but still increased women's numerical representation in government-such as Hutchinson herself. Even if she is confirmed by the Senate as the next Secretary of State, Rice is not likely to be remembered as an ethical individual who did the right thing for America.I do however applaud Hutchinson for wanting to show that talented women can (and do) cross all ideological and/or party affiliations. At this point, the only people who are considering books on women's leadership to be \`extremist' are themselves extremist in their scornful view of all women's public sector potential. Women's public sector participation (and their interest in politics) is not a passing fad, but has become a necessity for the national good."},{"Title":"Opening the Eye of New Awareness","review":"This is the thesis of H.

Needing to recover, he is taken off his current assignment and sent home to heal. Blue is unhappy with this turn, but understands he is unable to complete the mission.In the San Francisco airport, Blue learns of the death of the \\"great\\" man, his father Felix Perrineau, dead at seventy from a heart attack in his sleep. When his cell phone rings on the other end is a person speaking his mom's language Farsi and knowing too much about Blue and his parents. He meets the stranger who takes him to his \\"dead\\" father. Felix demands that Blue find his other son Daniel or his mom and his Dirk and Steele pals will pay the price. Though he loathes his sire, Blue believes the evil man and sets off to locate his half-brother. He easily fined Daniel working at a Vegas circus where Blue meets and is attracted to animal trainer Iris. When the shapeshifting woman is assaulted, the two siblings vow to keep her safe while both wonder if their dad is behind the attack while Blue finds himself in love.The latest Dirk & Steele thriller, as always, is a fast-paced, action-packed tale with the twist that the lead male is not on a work assignment, but instead this one is personal from the airport phone call through a complex lethal conspiracy until the final altercation. Blue and Iris are a fabulous pairing who as a team can handle almost anything, but supplemented by Daniel, they actually have a chance against overwhelming odds especially when the diabolically clever Felix is involved. Fans will enjoy perhaps the best novel in the series while newcomers will seek out the D&S; backlist (see TIGER EYE, SHADOW TOUCH, and THE RED HEART OF JADE).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"I loved this book. The author's descriptions of the shapeshifting process are the best I've ever read and I have read EVERY book about shapeshifters I could lay my hands on. The story is completely unpredictable and I cared so much for both the main characters and the supporting characters I could not lay it down until the end. I dearly hope there is a sequel because I am not at all finished with these characters!"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"This was my first introduction to the Dirk & Steele series by Liu and I am impressed. The series, while tagged a paranormal romance, does not lack in adventure/thriller elements. The book focuses on Blue, a member of Dirk & Steele detective agency, and Iris, a lion tamer/shapeshifter. Weaving together several subplots across continents, Ms. Liu deftly combines action and mystery with paranormal romance.The characters, both paranormal and human, offer a complexity of emotion that is often lacking in other paranormal series. I also appreciate the way that the romance scenes are written to add plot and/or character elements - not just to throw in a gratuitous sex scene.I eagerly await the arrival of the other books in the series!"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"So here I am still slowly but surely working my way through the Dirk and Steele books, this being the fourth full length novel (theres a novella that fits in there somewhere too). I pick up these books because I like the diversity of setting and situation. In particular this one promised the treat of Las Vegas and circus shows, and in contrast the murky underworld on Indonesia. Liu also has some of the most diverse and interesting characters, and the leading couple in this book are no exception.Blue is has power over all things electrical, apparently able to turn on, shut off, or blow up anything that even slightly relies on electricity. Some elements of this really bothered me. Repeatedly, Blue uses his power to stop a human heart and thus kill that person (because, as we are repeatedly reminded, the human heart relies on electricity to run). He struggles with this, not feeling that its morally correct to stop enemies this way. Maybe this is just the biologist in me, but I kept thinking, why the heart? EVERY muscle in the body relies on those same electrical impulses to work so if he could stop a heart, couldn't he theoretically stop their legs from working, or their eyes, or just shut their brain off momentarily and cause them to black out? I bring this up not to nit-pick, but because this control over human hearts thing is a really big plot point with emotional implications for Blue, so it should have been explained and thought out better. Anyway, Blue has been working to stop an organization that is involved in organ theft and human trafficing. This project is interupted and Blue is sent on a (seemingly) unrelated search to find his brother who is currently performing in a circus.Iris works in this same circus, in an act involving large cats of various species. She is also, secretly, able to shapeshift into a leopard. Iris has serious trust and abandonment issues, never having been able to maintain a relationship because of the aformentioned secret. Her mother, who is the only family she's ever known, left her two years ago with no explanation. Most of Iris' developement in this story involves her becoming comfortable with herself and with affection (through her instant-love relationship with Blue) and coming to terms with her mother's choices.SPOILER ALERT--As a way to tie her in to the central action drivin plot, Iris happens to be the target of one of the ring leaders of the organ theft circuit. This was one of many incredible coincidences which, as a reader, I was bothered by but chose to let go.This book in overrun with conflicts. You have the emotional issues between Blue and his brother, and their father, the budding relationship between Blue and Iris, Blue's struggle with his powers, Iris and her mother, Iris and her power, the organ theft and human trafficing...Point is, I think it was a bit too much. I give Liu credit for tieing it all together pretty well, so that at least the plot was cohesive. And there aren't to many plot holes that I can think of, which is never an easy task. But in my oppinion, less would have been more. For me, in any book there is a limit to how many characters I can be asked to keep track of without needing flashcards and flow charts and therefore getting really annoyed. Liu always rides that line because she is so eager to include all of these characters, their powers, conflicts, and motivations. Don't get me wrong, this book is readable, but expect a to have to back track to remember who a character is and why he might be doing what he's doing. And consequently, it's harder to really connect with the main couple and their relationship because there is a lot destracting from it.Overall, I had my frustrations with this book but I liked it. It was not as good as Tiger Eye or Shadow Touch, but the plot was fairly engrossing and theres a nice touch of romance. I intend to continue with the series, and I do recommend it. 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"Very interesting story, but it's not really a romance, so not sure why they push it as such.

Blue has been searching for the horrid flesh peddler Santoso but his latest mission in Jakarta goes horribly wrong almost killing him. Blue isn't through hunting Santoso, he is determined to shut the man down. However, he gets sidetracked as his own father blackmails him into finding the brother he never knew existed. This lands Blue in Las Vegas where his life will be changed forever.Iris McGillis has a certain affinity for lion taming. Perhaps this is because Iris is a shape shifter herself. Iris has grown up amidst the circus life. She isn't good around new people preferring not to be touched. However, that all changes when Blue storms into her life and stirs it all up. Iris can't deny the strong feelings he provokes within her but she can't explain them either. She knows that there is more to Blue than meets the eye and she's going to figure him out. She may not get the chance; it seems someone is intent on kidnapping Iris. Can Blue protect Iris from the evil stalking her?Eye of Heaven is a beautifully written romance. Blue and Iris are sensational. These characters are strong and extremely driven. Blue is used to being tough and in control yet it is his power he is the most afraid of. The journey that he went through during the story is fabulous. He truly grows, as does Iris. As it turns out, she is quite afraid of her ability as well. She is content to live her life with her cats but Blue shows her just how much more is out there for her. Marjorie M. Liu's Eye of Heaven pulls you in with its fierce beginning, keeps you with its lovely couple and ends with a bang that leaves you wanting more of Dirk & Steele! The reason I truly enjoy Ms. Liu's novels is actually not because of the romance. It is because of the powerful stories Ms. Liu weaves around her compelling characters. The romance is a must but I love getting into the complicated paranormal world surrounding Dirk & Steele. I can't wait to find out more about the despicable Consortium and watch Dirk & Steele agents bring them down. Eye of Heaven is a thrilling edge of your seat treat.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"On the surface this seems like the most likely book (so far) in the series to resemble a typical Paranormal Romance. The hero has a magical power, the heroine's a shifter who works and lives with her animals, two men want the heroine at the same time, the heroine doesn't like to touch anyone until she meets the hero, etc. These are not unique things in PNR, yet somehow the author manages to morph the story into something fresh and different. I really think that her writing reads like an Urban Fantasy with a great romance. The world she creates is practically a character itself and while the romance is a central part of the story, it develops while the story takes place as opposed to the story developing while the romance takes place.Blue and Iris were wonderful characters. They both had past issues that made them lean toward being loners and they both feared the impact their powers would have on any future relationship. Their personalities complimented each other nicely, but when you stop and think about it, you might wonder why this person. The attraction is strong, but I felt like the beginning foundation of their relationship was a little shaky. But that small nitpick was quickly brushed aside once I saw them together. I may not have understood what specifically led to the initial attraction, but once it was established as fact I couldn't help but see how perfectly they fit together. Their strengths and vulnerabilities came together as if they were tailor made for each other, without ever once feeling disingenuous.Once again we are treated to a wide cast of characters. Some are new and some are previously seen. If it's been a while since you read the last book or if this is your first book in the series then you might suffer a little from character confusion. I, personally, really like that there are so many characters that feature in the series. It helps set the stage and gives the world a well rounded feel instead of giving me the impression that the characters live in a vacuum.I like how we continue to see the shadow of previous villains. The more that I read, the more it feels like the Dirk and Steele agency is slowly being surrounded. I think it makes a great series arc, but I really wonder why all the agency discoveries are happening now. Why not years ago? This is not a big issue for me, it's just something I ponder when I think on the series.One of the things I love most about the way Liu writes her characters is the depth and nuance she gives them. In this book we saw that the \\"good guys\\" don't always do good things and that it was possible for some of the \\"bad guys\\" to have the occasional softer emotion, even if they didn't show it easily. It really makes you stop and think about what defines the good guys as \\"good\\". There's a storyline that crops up involving Artur, one of the previous characters. It was absolutely intense and his willingness to step over the line made me question my reaction if he actually did. Unfortunately, that story thread was solved in a completely convenient manner, but at least it was intense while it lasted and the reason for the convenient solve made some sense.If you were to read a list of events that happen in this book you might feel overwhelmed, but Liu ties each piece together neatly. The plot is layered with events that seamlessly blend together in the overreaching story arc. At times the coincidences can feel a little thick, but on the whole I loved seeing side events and previous characters tie into the main plot. I'm sure you could start the series with this book, but I think a greater enjoyment will be had if you read the series in order. Then you'll know exactly who's who and how they tie into the current events.Favorite Quote:Blue woke the next morning with a crick in his neck and a boot in his crotch. He was not sure which was worse, although he thought the very large half-naked man staring down at him with a cleaver in his hand might trump them both.\\"Hello,\\" Blue said.\\"Guten Morgen,\\" said the man, with a smile that was almost as violently cheerful as the giant yellow happy face tattooed on his massive chest. \\"I think you are very wundersch&ouml;n, but if you hurt my friends, I will cut you.

I love Marjorie Liu's writing, and I love this series. But I usually have some small complaints about each book - too much violence, too much magic, something. But this book is nearly perfect. A last-minute save by a mysterious friend almost stretched things too far, almost wrapped that storyline up too neatly, but it didn't bother me after reading the character's explanation for waiting until the last minute. My only continuing complaint is that, in this series at least, Liu is skimpy on the love-making. And you love her characters so much, you want them to make love constantly! : )If you are considering starting on this series somewhere after the 1st book, you should re-consider. Characters re-appear in each book, and they develop over time so you really need to start at the beginning. I have skipped around and it gets confusing, trying to remember what we know about characters at different points in their lives, when we have learned about their later life out of sequence. You may want to keep notes about who does what in each book. It is amazing how Liu keeps this all consistent."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"Fans of Laurell K.

The first book, \\"Tiger Eye\\" had a great combination of paranormal, romance, and action. Unfortunately I've been loosing some of my enthusiam for the series as each subsequent book in the series gets published. The premise of a secret agency that is publically just a detective agency using their secret powers to help justice and people is great. However, after the first book, all these other unnamed agencies and people w/ super powers are popping up everywhere. Now it's superpower against superpower hero, you're not quite sure whether the other agents in these shadow agencies have agendas that are good are bad. I had hoped that after the \\"Dark Dreamers\\" anthology that the agency would go back to helping regular people and be more romance centered. The anthology story was a great story.However, this full length novel is continuing the previous books on X-men like action and a couple of love scenes thrown in at the end to qualify it for a romance. Liu is a wonderful writer and able to display all the action and the emotion to the reader but the romance in the books have suffered. The resemblance in the books to X-men is too difficult to ignore and it getting a tad ridiculous because every person that the Dirk & Steele agency is tripping over has powers.Back to the story of this book, Blue has been blackmailed by his father. Blue is the illegitimate first son of millionaire Felix. Felix wants Blue to find and bring his legitimate son--a son that Blue never knew about--back home for some nefarious reason. If Blue doesn't obey then Felix has threatened Blue of Dirk & Steele's exposure in the public, and other consequences to his mother. Blue is able to track down his brother, Daniel, at a travelling circus. The sparks fly when he runs into lion tamer, Iris, who has her own secrets. Blue is temporarily on hiatus from his job because he has just come out of a coma, decides to join the circus too. The reasons are both to be near Iris, and to find out what is so important about Daniel. At the same time, danger stalks Iris and the terrorists that Blue had been hunting when he got bombed may be involved, and other agents from other unknown shadow agencies begin to pop up out of the woodwork--are they good or bad?Good action sequences, but low on the romance.

Blue is a part of Dirk and Steele, an agency of psychic and para normal men and women who work quietly to preserve the peace and justice in our world. Now his father is supposedly dying and he has summoned his son. With threats and coersion he tells Blue he has a brother and the father is determined to control this one. Blue has managed to escape his influence because he is illigetimate. His brother is legitemate, because the father married his mother.So with the health and even life of his mother at stake he agrees to find the missing brother. Blue has no idea of the sordid world he must traverse to find his brother and finally save the woman he meets and desires along the way.Iris is a show performer. She is a lion tamer with several tigers and lions and jaguars, that she takes care of and performs with. She is also a shape-shifter. Her whole life has been concealed and secreted in the circus where she lives. Now they are in Las Vegas, she is performing at a major hotel and with her telepathic bond to the animals and the mass of people generating more mental static than she can handle, she is near a meltdown.Blue knows immedately that she is a shifter because some of his friends at Dirk and Steele are shifters too. Knowing her secrets he realizes how tightly she must be holding her shields. He finds her fasinating and trys to help her, he also finds his brother. Neither brother acts like they know each other but they do, although they have never met.Protecting Iris and his brother becomes harder when they are caught up into the dark underside of the sordid business that his father runs.

The characters are fun and well rounded and Liu is adept at taking you around the world in her adventure stories. In this case the story begins in Indonesia. Yet, strangely enough, this one stays mostly in America. Mainly, Las Vegas.Iris works with wild cats (lions, tigers, but not bears)in a circus. Blue works for the Dirk and Steele detective agency and is threatened into finding his (never knew he existed before) half brother for his evil father. This leads him to the circus and right into the arms of the amazing shape-shifter, aka Iris. Of course, there's always more going on in a Liu book. While he's there observing his half-brother (escape artist) they are attacked by the some of the same men working for a very bad man Blue was tracking in Indonesia. Same sick man is interest in Iris and Blue's brother. Some how his crazy dad is envolved and Iris's missing mom. I know--it sound's crazy, doesn't it? But somehow Liu pulls all the strings together in the end and makes for a very entertaining read.

Liu was writing Blue Perrineau's story, of Ms Lui's paranormal romantic suspense universe, Dirk and Steele, that this was going to be a GREAT story, and one of my very favorite's. Maybe I had a little of that \\"extra sensory\\" stuff myself, or it could be because, since reading her very first (Tiger Eye, 2005) book about a group of paranormal, mutant, gifted (which ever adjective you would most like to use) detective's, I've been hooked on her universe of agents trying save humanity from evil.In Eye Of Heaven, Blue is after an organ peddler, a flesh and blood broker, who is not just powerful and rich, but who's family actually owns the bank. But Blue is seriously injured, and in his delirium, with his power, he also injures one of his best friends wives.As he tries to recuperate, he gets the news that his estranged father has died.Only things aren't what they seem. Not only is Blue's father not dead, but he finds out he has a brother. With his father blackmailing him, and guilt for the injury he caused his friends, Blue goes to Las Vegas, following a lead to find his brother. Not only does Blue find him, but he finds the love of his life. Iris McGillis.Iris McGillis, circus performer, shapeshifter, orphan. After Iris mother disappears, she tries to make the best of her life that she can. But with men attacking her, causing problems with the big cats that she has care of, causing problems with the Las Vegas hotel that has hired the small circus to perform for them, Iris is more emotionally confused then ever. Then a handsome, sexy man saves her, and her confusion only intensify. But again, things aren't as them seem.Not only must Blue reconcile the fact that he has a brother, but he must save Iris from the very people that he has been chasing, and people who he thought was family. Iris and Blue both, must face the lies, heartbreak and betrayal, of those they trusted and come to terms with who they are and what they want out of life for themselves."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"This latest entry into the Dirk and Steele series continues the high standard set with the first book. Liu is a wonderful writer who can really flesh out what should be unrealistic characters. She makes them believeable with all the problems (and more) of ordinary people. They have their good and bad characteristics.I think it would be difficult to start the series with this book. Readers actually have to be familiar with the world Liu has formed. Blue appears in the other books in a supporting role, but assumes the primary one here. All the characters in her first book seem to be getting their own. Each finds their significant other and all are not normal. The books hold interest well, although this one got a little drawn out at the end.One problem that I am finding with the series, is that the overall plot is very complex. Since the books are not published very close to one another it is difficult to keep all the characters and plot points straight. This book seemed to complicate things even more. It would probably be best to wait until most of the series is published, then read them all in a row. However, I wait for each eagerly as do most of her fans for the next. I hope there are many more."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven","review":"Ms. Liu's latest Dirk & Steele fantasy romantic adventure, Eye of Heaven, is in my opinion, her best yet. This book has it all, a strong hero, Blue, and heroine, Iris, and a supportive cast of additional heroes and nasty baddies. The characters, with all their supernatural powers, seem like comic book creations but Liu gives them enough emotional angst to flesh them out and make you care about them. From the first page, this book takes off and the reader is in for one exciting, emotional thrill ride. This series keeps getting better and better and I eagerly look forward to the next novel.

He's in search of his brother, Daniel, but also finds Iris McGillis, a shape shifter. Unfortunately, Blue knows the truth about his father's death and the ramifications of Blue finding Daniel and Iris may be catastrophic.Marjorie M. Liu weaves a complex tapestry with EYE OF HEAVEN. The details of this intricate tale cleverly unveil themselves as the story progresses. Each book of the Dirk and Steele series is a stand alone but there are some ongoing threads throughout the series. EYE OF HEAVEN is starting to bring some of those threads, along with characters from previous books, together. Marjorie M. Liu provides enough details that new readers will be able to follow along but I would highly recommend reading the other books in the series in order to get a better picture of the machinations of the Consortium.EYE OF HEAVEN is an excellent blend of fantasy, the paranormal, action, and romance! Marjorie M. Liu carefully builds up the tension to the grand finale, leaving the reader breathless with anticipation as each page is turned.

I particulary liked the history of Greek math and then Indian and Arab math -- those chapters were especially well done. It's amazing that not much happened mathematically speaking until practically the renaissance -- the burning of the library of Alexandria really held up most signficant developments. The other terrific chapters were on Newton and Leibnitz, plus all the French and Italian mathematicians like LaPlace and Legrange. I sometimes wished for a bit more biographical anecdotes, but the author covers hundreds of mathematicians. My only small gripe is that he quotes extensive sections in Latin and French with no translation as if we all have a perfect reading knowledge of these languages, even the 16th century versions complete with archaic terms. Still, this book is a good reference and overview of major math developments. I had some trouble following all the math, but I'm not a mathematician either."},{"Title":"A short account of the history of mathematics,","review":"This is a classic history of mathematics and is surprisingly readable considering it was first published in 1912. It covers math from ancient times up to the late 19th century. It was interesting to read about how math developed down through the centuries, and who the famous mathematicians were and their contributions. I was most in interested in developments since the Renaissance, but I also enjoyed the author's coverage of the Middle Ages and Arabic contributions to algebra. For example, you'll learn about Al-Khwarizmi, Abu-Kamil, and Al Karaji. In the Middle Ages there was Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa (who gave his name to the famous fibonacci series), who lived in the 13th century (not to be confused with da Vinci who lived later), and was so renowned for his abilities that a competition was once staged by the Holy Roman Emperor to demonstrate his prowess. In fact, these sorts of math contests were quite common in the Middle Ages, which I didn't know about. Three questions were posed, such as give a number that when increased or decreased by 5 remains a square, and Leonardo was the only contestant to get all three right. Leonardo also was one of the first to introduce the Hindu/Arabic number system into Europe. He wrote a number of books, of which several survive today, which made him a celebrity as much for his writing talents as for his mathematical abilities during his lifetime, and the true extent of his contributions wasn't recognized until recent times. He is considered the most important mathematical theorist after Diophantus of Alexandria until Fermat in the 17th century--a span of 2000 years. But he is only one of hundreds of important mathematicians whose contributions are discussed. This book is still a very readable classic history that is still a valuable resource on the subject almost 100 years later."},{"Title":"A short account of the history of mathematics,","review":"Frankly I'm a little confused, I was under the impression that I was buying a used hardcover 1960 reprint from seller Quality7.

From more complicated and important theological issues all the way down to the simple ones...like, \\"I can't seem to stay alert during sermons.\\" I will keep this book for always.

He successfully combines the trappings of sci-fi potboilers with melodramatic farce, thereby creating a work of fiction that will stay in your memory for a long, long time.

Time travel plays a part in delivering a ring to a combat medic in WWII. The ring lies unused for years until a little boy finds it. This ring becomes the pivotal part of the story, as it turns the boy into a new Sinestro.There is a scene that takes place in 1972 (though the book gives 1992 in the heading, which is a missed typo, and later the characters refer to 1971) with Hal Jordan, Green Arrow and Black Canary fighting Sinestro and defeating him handily. This passage really seems pointless to me, as it might have been a factor later in the book, but seemed not to be. Perhaps this will be relevant in the sequel(s). There is also an inconsitency in one part of this scene when Green Arrow gives his bow to Canary, but then still has his bow...?Hmm, anyway, we move to the present day and get tons of Kyle Raynor agonizing over his personal life, while his girlfriend Jade keeps turning away his offer to commit for real. This really reads like high school claptrap, but it is at least somewhat well-done. This relationship issue ends up leading to the abduction of Jade by Sinestro, with whom she was kinda messing around. So GL has to follow, he gets in trouble, they have to work together to get free, somewhat typical plot development.There are cameos by Plasticman, Hal Jordan as the Spector, Superman, and the old golden age Green Lantern, Jade's father. Only Spector really seems important to the story, though he does not do much more than change something here, influence something there. We get a lot of angst in his inner thoughts as well. Not too badly done, though.The resolution is rather abrupt, though it did not really leave anything hanging, which I appreciated. Too many first parts of trilogies leave things obviously open, which vexes me. However, the writing style of this novel was not great to me. Nearly every paragraph relies upon simile and metaphor to explain things, and the references are so contemporary that the book may be unreadable 10-20 years from now. It really got old fast. Also, there was a fretfully large population of typos and word mixups, like \\"the\\" for \\"they\\" and \\"breath\\" for \\"breathe.\\" I think that a word processing spell check was used, but that a thorough proofread was not performed.However, the story was not terrible, though it was not a very long book to pay hardcover price for.

In modern Iraq, a member of the Mossad, Israeli&iacute;s secret service force, joins a midnight raid and discovers ancient parchments of incalculable value . . . and terrifying peril, for they contain the bloodlines and identities of Jewish families in hiding across Iraq.In modern day Israel, the Prime Minister&iacute;s wife finds herself the target of assassination attempts. Her father dies saving her life, but with his last breath, offers her a clue about the motives behind the attacks aimed at her. Careful research leads her to a meeting with one of the world&iacute;s most controversial Jewish people, a man whose demands for reparations from the Iraqi empire have set off a wave of anti-Semitic murders in Iraq. The gruesome executions of two beautiful young girls and their parents are aired across the world, shocking nations and stirring a cry for armed intervention.In times past an Exilarch represented the Jewish people in exile to their foreign lords. A modern-day Exilarch might hold the key to ending the violence and restoring peace and safety to the Middle East. But such a person would have to be descended of both the Davidic bloodline and of Mordecai&iacute;s line, Queen Esther&iacute;s adoptive father who served as Exilarch in Esther&iacute;s time.The information that will bring about peace and justice for all involved lies in ancient missives between the queen, Mordecai, and a Jewish concubine in the king&iacute;s harem that have been hidden across Iraq and Iran for centuries. But will the Mossad agent find them in time to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish families and prevent an all-out war between two nations fraught with enmity?The ancient missives in this book are heartfelt and moving, so acutely describing the plights of Esther, Mordecai, Leah, and Jesse, whose very lives are subject the perilous whims of a foreign king. They seek to do the will of God and live lives of purpose while forced to hide their Jewish roots. How can they know that the decisions and choices they make will affect their people 3000 years later?"},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant","review":"Here is an audio based on the life of biblical Queen Esther. In Tenney's ancient Persia (now Iraq and Iran), the king is brutally murdered, and Esther (Hadassah) wonders what her role might be in continuing to further God's plan for her people. She ends up helping her uncle Mordecai in preparing Leah, a lovely young Jew, for her \\"audition\\" night with the new king. In a parallel contemporary story, the Israeli prime minister's wife, Hadassah (a descendent of Leah), must delve into the past to resolve a tragic standoff with terrorists who threaten the lives of contemporary Jews living anonymously in the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant","review":"In Susa, Persia, Queen Regent Esther, the \\"Hadassah\\", knows she is in trouble though her spouse King Artaxerxes has sat on the throne for two decades. The Queen Mother Amestris has returned to cause trouble and Commander Megabyzos secretly leads the rebellion. Concern in the empire over the Jews led by Nehemiah returning and rebuilding Jerusalem worry the Persians. Esther's apprehensions turn true when her husband is murdered. The new monarch must select a new queen. Esther's \\"sister in spirit\\" Leah feels she is heir apparent, but is stunned that the monarch clearly hates Jews; upon seeing the Star of David selects someone else as his is chosen one; Leah is relegated to the harem.In modern times, the present Hadassah, the wife of the Israeli prime minister is stunned when her beloved \\"Poppa\\" is assassinated. Before he dies Kesselman tells his daughter that she must find the ancient documents that speak the truth of what happened in Persia to stop terrorists from killing Jews living incognito in Iraq. After sitting Shiva for eight days, she begins her quest.This is an intriguing follow-up to the superb HADASSAH: ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING though too much has to be accepted as gospel this time around. Following up on what happens in Persia after Esther becomes the queen is cleverly handled so that the audience can sense the political uproar especially when Artaxerxes dies. The modern story line has it own intrigue, but plotted to enhance the past yet comes across disruptive of the follow up to Esther. Still this is a fine ancient biblical fiction novel that will please sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant","review":"Sometimes it is easy to believe that God only works in big ways using big events: David slaying Goliath; Esther becoming queen and saving the lives of the Jews in Persia; and Saul transformed to Paul and becoming an apostle of Christ Jesus. For the rest of us, His hand is not always so readily seen, although He is always present. He has a purpose for every single person, and He is faithful to reveal it as we seek Him.The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy captures the parallels between the lives of Leah and Hadassah, two ordinary women whose lives seem to have no extraordinary purpose. Leah lives in the times of the Jewish exile to Persia, following in Queen Esther's footprints. As the wife of the Prime Minister of Israel, Hadassah is well known to the current world but has no meaning in her life. But God has a purpose for both of their lives that spans the centuries of time.After her father is killed during a terrorist attack, Hadassah determines to track down his assassins. Her investigation is fraught with unusual twists and turns, and she finds connections between current and past events that she never could have imagined. Assassins stalk her. Jews living in Iran are being routed out and murdered. War seems inevitable.But she and Ari Meyer, an Israeli commando/archeologist with an obsession for Jewish artifacts, are determined to find the truth. This truth saves the lives of thousands of Jews in a way that only an omnipotent God can envision and carry to completion.Sometimes I really feel like I am just a puff of smoke--here today and gone tomorrow--but I can have peace in knowing that God knows otherwise. That's the lasting theme The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy leaves with me. The read is quick with lots of action and adventure. Although I am not well acquainted with Middle East politics, the authors provide good background and I didn't get confused.Armchair Interviews says: We know you will enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant","review":"Picking up where the biblical book of Esther leaves off, THE HADASSAH COVENANT traces the fate of a concubine named Leah whose Jewish ancestry prevents her from becoming the queen of Persia during the Babylonian exile of the Jews from Jerusalem. Years earlier, Esther, then the queen, had befriended her, and the ongoing exchange of letters between the two women provides crucial clues to historical events that reverberate down to the present day.Those events place Hadassah (the Jewish name for Esther), the wife of the present-day prime minister of Israel, in the critical role of saving the lives of \\"hidden Jews\\" who are being hunted down and killed by militant Muslims in Iraq. Unable or reluctant to leave Iraq decades earlier, many Jews had hidden their ancestry by taking on Arabic names and assimilating into the culture; now their identities have been revealed, and their lives are at stake. Several brutal murders of adults and children have even been shown on television.The link between the ancient Israelites in Persia and the contemporary Jews in Iraq is Mordecai, Queen Esther's uncle and adoptive father who had served as \\"exilarch,\\" one who represented the entire Jewish population during the exile. The letters between Esther and Leah, which tell the rest of the story about Mordecai, offer the key to a peaceful resolution to the wave of terror that has struck Iraqi Jews.Enter the Mossad, the secret service of Israel, and one Mossad agent in particular who discovers and carefully guards the ancient letters as he analyzes their content. He and Hadassah share an important link, and they join forces in applying what they've learned from the past to forging a plan for peace in the present.Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen do a credible job of imagining what might have happened in the lives of Esther and Mordecai and placing that possibility as a backdrop for present-day tensions in the Middle East. They've done their research, and on a technical level --- the book is highly detailed with regard to secret intelligence and covert operations, and the weapons and technology that make both possible --- it's all plausible. I had no problem believing that any of the governmental or terrorist actions could actually happen. The link with Esther, not so much, though it makes for a great story. Once I got past some of the unlikely scenarios and settled back into the story, I found myself genuinely enjoying it.From what I gather, if you've read the first book in the series --- HADASSAH: ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING --- you may be a bit let down by this one, which makes me glad I didn't read the first one. With nothing to compare it to, I got caught up in both the present-day story and the ancient letters. Sure, I had a hard time imagining the Israeli prime minister calling his wife \\"honey\\" (isn't that a purely American term of endearment?), just as I found it hard to believe that there could be two green-eyed Israelis named Hadassah (the second being a child who narrowly escapes slaughter). And yes, I'd like to circulate a petition calling for a moratorium on green-eyed beauties in Christian novels for at least a decade. But these are minor annoyances and, I suspect, problems for me alone. Same with the cover, which brings the word \\"cheesy\\" to mind. But don't judge a book by it and all that.

Everyone is &quot;amazingly beautiful&quot; and her characters don't mind saying that to each other.....constantly. Once you wade through that, however, you find a good story. You have two women, a doctor and a lawyer, who have both suffered terrible losses in their partners and are brought together by the illness of the lawyer's mother. They are drawn to each other immediately, maybe a little too quickly, but you get to watch two women who have been hurt so badly by life get to find a chance to try again. The quality of their lives seems almost too fantastic, but their love scenes are scorching. There is a secret lurking however that can destroy their happiness and, once it is revealed, you wonder if they can overcome it. All in all, this is a good book and worth reading. Just try to skip over the adjectives."},{"Title":"Durga/Umayi: A Novel","review":"This is an amazing read. I thought I was lost by the end of the first chapter, but soon realized I was actually bobbing right next to the unseen narrator and main character: we were all swept into the strong waters of recent (1960s-present) Indonesian history.This is the story of an ordinary woman drawn by fate to witness and participate in a string of delirious events that unfold after Indonesia's independence from the Dutch colonial powers. This woman, Auntie Wi, Madame Nussy, Sis Tiwi, (whatever she decides to call herself) spirals around the world of partisan politics, financial corruption, and unsatisfied love with a charmed and resiliant spirit, but in the end finds herself yearning for some imagined dream of a simpler life. The surprising end to her unfinished tale haunted me for days. Did she finally find some happiness in accepting her place in history? Did she discover how to clutch the worst of her desires while yet hanging on to a shred of sweet memory? Would her friend the historical microphone ever come back to hear her thoughts?The work is written in a style that reminds me some oral epic overheard on a long bus ride, where details and names are spun out with dizzying relentlessness. Other authors have used this consciousness streaming mode to tell their tales, but there is something intoxicating here about the cadences and rhythms of the words. Here is a refreshing take on a topic that many of us know little about, written in a form that left me buzzing with thoughts each time I reluctantly put the book down. The translator assists at all turns here, giving the reader an ample introduction to the story and the recent history of Indondesia, but not overwhelming the tale; footnotes are provided where clarification is needed.All in all, a stunning work."},{"Title":"Durga/Umayi: A Novel","review":"Y.B. Mangunwijaya's novel \\"Durga/Umayi\\" tells the engaging story of a woman's ongoing personal transformation while the country she lives in moves past colonialism into independence. The book works well on two levels. First, as a literary novel filled with vividly drawn characters--especially Iin (aka Punyo Iin Sulinda Pertiwi Nusamusbida), the not-very-sympathetic protangonist--that contains colorful descriptions of the sometimes surreal situations they find themselves in; it is told in a most unorthodox way. Suggestions made by translator Ward Keeler in his introduction helped greatly in knowing how to approach the text.Second, \\"Durga/Umayi\\" is an excellent introduction to the modern history and culture of Indonesia, particularly for someone who knows little about Southeast Asia. Again, Dr. Keeler's introduction and footnotes are an invaluable aid.Mangunwijaya's narrative style and the surreal nature of his novel were a bit challenging at first, but after a few pages it became an engaging read. \\"Durga/Umayi\\" is a fascinating story told with great wit and empathy, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Positioning in A Wheelchair: A Guide for Professional Caregivers of the Disabled Adult","review":"This is a great book that thoroughly explains the basics of wheelchair positioning to building positioning aides to meet the needs of clients/residents. Provides the reader with a baseline of what to look for from someone's trunk, head, through toe; and where to go from there. Specifics types of seating needs are also discussed in order to achieve proper wheelchair positioning. Great book overall, especially in long-term care for OT students or new grads.... wherever wheelchair positioning is encountered daily. Helped me a lot!"},{"Title":"The Socialist Tradition: Moses to Lenin","review":"This book is a history of unorthodox economic ideas, a companion volume to the Gray's acclaimed and authoritative \\"Development of Economic Doctrine\\" which covers the thought of the \\"orthodox and respectable\\" professional \\"economists.\\" At the outset Gray raises this question: What writers are properly included in a survey of socialist thinkers? Because \\"there is . . . no agreement among the experts as to what socialism is supposed to mean . . . we shall guide ourselves . . . by accepting somewhat unquestioningly those whom the general consensus . . . has agreed to designate as 'the great socialist.' \\" Gray therefore postpones to the final chapter his distillation of the \\"essence of socialism.\\"The first two chapters consider the contributions to socialist thought of those dual influences from the ancient and medieval world which have been the principals in shaping modern thinking, the Jewish tradition, modified and supplemented by Christianity, and the Greek tradition. Gray concludes that Spartan communism is not the romantic historical remnant of primitive agricultural communism but the inevitable result of a State perpetually organized for war. The communist views of Plato are presented together with a \\"cold douche of individualist criticism\\" from Aristotle. Study of the main body of Christian doctrine shows that Christianity assumes or defends the correctness of private property, although \\"wealth is a trust held for the public good.\\" The minor line of Christian thought which tends toward communism, owes its inspiration to the ancient woman-less Jewish sect, the Essenes.The transition from the medieval to the modern periods is accomplished by treatment of that \\"curious and fascinating . . . sideline in the literature of socialism,\\" the Utopias. Gray emphasizes the Utopian doctrine of the perfectibility of man and the incorporation in the Utopias of an astonishing number of modern totalitarian devices. Modern socialism finds its immediate forerunners in the French egalitarians and in the remarkable, though neglected, English pre-Marxian group, as well as in the so-called \\"fathers\\" of socialism, those interesting eccentrics, Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and Blanc. The \\"fathers\\" are described as associationists, only Blanc foreseeing the importance of the role of the State.Modern or \\"scientific,\\" socialism means Marx and Engels primarily, but Rodbertus and Lassalle are also so classified. Gray need not have included his apologetic explanation that \\"much as a sensitive typewriter may rebel against being called upon to perform so hackneyed a task,\\" it is necessary to understand the place of Marx among the great socialists, for he presents an excellent essay on Marxian fundamentals. Gray observes that the labor theory of value, the core of the Marxian system, has \\"frayed . . . irretrievably\\"; that common terms such as \\"value\\" and \\"capital\\" are employed by Marx without specific definition, consequently making possible the horde of confused interpretations of \\"What Marx Really Meant.\\" \\"Yet despite his prosy and interminable dullness, despite the confusions and inherent contradictions of his theories, despite his manifold defects in temperament and disposition . . . the indubitable fact remains that Marx has proved the most influential figure of the nineteenth century.\\" Why? Because Marx became the cult of an anemic intelligentsia unable to face reality and because he supplied a body of myths, a social religion, by which men could explain away their unhappiness. (Lenin is described in a later chapter as the one-sided restater of Marx, extending with \\"damnable emphasis\\" the theory of the strategy and tactics of the proletarian revolution and dictatorship.)The failure of the world to fulfill the Marxian prophecies led to the development of Revisionism. Bernstein, the prime begetter of Revisionism, finally came round in substance to \\"old-fashioned, mid-Victorian liberalism,\\" even declaring that \\"'one need be no anarchist in order to find the eternal heaping of duties on the State too much of a good thing.'\\" Fabianism, the other major development in Evolutionary Socialism, unlike Revisionism, was not a reaction to Marx. Fabian Socialism found its original inspiration in Henry George's principle of the unearned increment. But Gray quite properly sets George apart from the ranks of the socialists. George's doctrines, such as his principles of distribution, his clean-cut distinction between land and capital, his statement of the advantages of free trade, are incompatible with the socialist position. The Fabian Socialists improperly extended the principle of rent on land as an unearned increment to capital and labor. Thus Fabian theorists have gone so far as to describe wage differentials as the \\"rent of ability,\\" individually unearned, and therefore to advocate wage equalization! Socialist Thought, Ancient and ModernThe anarchists are represented by Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Bertrand Russell. Gray admits that although anarchism theoretically \\"is the complete antithesis of most forms of socialism.\\" its inclusion is justified because \\"in practice anarchism works out as an extreme form of socialism.\\" The trade-union relatives of the anarchists are considered in chapters on continental syndicalism and English guild socialism.In his final chapter, Gray concludes that socialism and individualism are complementary, involving varying proportions of the social and the individual. After considering the proportions in which present-day society should be mixed, Gray decides that \\"the great need of the day is for a prophet of liberalism\\" standing for the \\"pre-eminent worth of the individual.\\" \\"The danger involved in the drift or urge in the direction of an ever more actively controlling and intervening State, is that at the end of that path-however it may be disguised-lies totalitarianism, with the individual even less than the Guild Socialist's manure, even less than a thing of naught. The very great and deserved welcome accorded to Dr. Hayek's warnings regarding 'The Road to Serfdom' may perhaps be interpreted as an indication that the public mind and conscience are not wholly at ease on the question.\\" Few books in economics are a comparably sound combination of the sprightly and the scholarly. Particularly rare is a history of economic doctrine which can be said to be exciting. But competence of treatment has in no way yielded to entertainment. Richness of reference, evidence of familiarity with the complete works (and biographies) of the great socialists and their critics, meaty, brevity, good-natured humor commend \\"The Socialist Tradition.\\""},{"Title":"Famous Pistols and Hand Guns","review":"This is a very well written book covering the major semiautomatic pistols adopted or used extensively by a major power. The pictures are excellent and a lot of material is presented one cannot find elsewhere. Specifically covered are the Luger, Mauser 1896, Walthers, the 1911 and predecessors, FN Brownings, Webley and Scott Pistols, Berettas and Astras. The Tokarev TT-33 and Steyr 1911 are omitted.This is an excellent book for someone not familiar with these major automatic handguns. It is a trifle odd that suddenly at the end of a book devoted to semiautomatics we are presented with two pages of Astra revolvers, all S & W clones. Why?Regardless, this is an excellent book and an interesting one to read."},{"Title":"The Dragon Healer: Book 1 (Bk. 1)","review":"The author's wife dropped an email to me, suggesting that I might enjoy this book. I ordered it and read through it. This is a charming story and, although I mostly confine my dragon reading to McCaffrey and a few others, the story seemed fairly original to me.The problem with this book is that the author desperately needed an editor. Misuse of words (&quot;heard of runner beast&quot;, &quot;no bases in fact&quot;), lack of punctuation, grammatical errors all marred the story. The dialogue is repetitive and doesn't ring true. It's a shame, because without these difficulties, this would be a really good read.I can't write a novel and applaud Mr. Adams for his effort, but in future, a good proof-reader and editor may come in handy to reduce the kind of errors that ruined the suspension of reality for me."},{"Title":"The Dragon Healer: Book 1 (Bk. 1)","review":"I absolutely love books with dragons, and I really loved this book. I found it to be extremely original and not simply a retelling of different versions of older dragon stories.The only real problem I had was bad grammar and spelling. The spelling was what got me the most. I could handle the punctuation problems, and grammar but the spelling tanked the story.However, I highly recommend this book if you can look past all the errors. Considering that this was his first published story he did very well. The shame of the errors is strictly on his publisher and editor for not catching them."},{"Title":"The Dragon Healer: Book 1 (Bk. 1)","review":"The \\"Dragon Healer\\" is a most pleasing tale, which transports the reader to an ethereal world filled with fantasy creatures. Terra and Fienna are likeable as the main characters, and their adventures flow continually as new dreams unfold. Because of this, the book is difficult to put down, and the reader can't help but look forward to the sequel. This is a book which has appeal for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"This book was also purchased for my wife's reading enjoyment and to add to her Zane Gray book collection. She enjoyed reading Zane Gray western novels."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"When Jim Lacy rides away for his partner, Ben Ide, he is at a loss as what to do. He had settled his debt to his friend in the book \\"Forlorn River\\" and despite having fallen in love with Ben' sister, Hettie, he knows the RIGHT thing to do was to ride away; for he was not worthy of Hettie's love. \\"Nevada\\" has always been considered one of Zane Grey's best loved and known works--much more so than \\"Forlorn River\\". And I really don't understand why that is the case. Unless the reason is: More people can recognize more of themselves with character of Jim Lacey than they can with Ben Ide. But for whatever reason this book has always been rated higher on the scale of Zane Grey's books. Nevada has left Ben and returned to Nevada where he known as Jim Lacy, and after a series of adventures and two passing years he overhears a conversation between his boss and a judge about his old friend, who is now in Arizona. Their suspicions about Ben cause Nevada to offer his services, as range detective, his only condition, if he lives through this ordeal, his name will be cleared. They agree. During these years, Hettie Ide has longed for Nevada, not undersanding why he had run away; for she loved Nevada, and love was all that mattered to her. Nevada IS one of Zane Grey's best books, I even rate it as high as its sequel, but I do like the first novel better, and I suggest you had better read \\"Forlorn River\\" first to make the story fully understandable."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"I ordered this book to add to my set of red/white Zane Grey books. It was not at all as pictured, though it was a first edition. I was disappointed that the item was not as I expected it to be."},{"Title":"Nevada","review":"I've enjoyed reading Zane Grey westerns since I was a boy in the 1950s. Still re-read them regularly.

This book offers the truth that out of the uniqueness of the individual and in his original self is man called by God. Francis was not burdened when he felt called by God. On the contrary, it was a liberating experience which fulfilled and freed his whole person. White, while remaining true to human experience, illustrates that when a person opens up his life fully to the work of God, he is not to be led in chains to a dismal dungeon life or to death, but rather, he is to be a \\"bird of fire,\\" still hampered by man's fallen condition, yes, but not enslaved by it.

Whether you are seeking a day or boarding school, the 2002 revised version of PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS by Peterson's is the most comprehensive guide written about private and independent secondary schools to date.(Some K-12 and junior boarding schools are included but the main focus of this guide is secondary education.) As an education professional who works both in the field of Private Secondary Schools and College Admissions, I can without hesitation give this Peterson's publication the highest recommendation possible.Peterson's has created an informative and easy to use guide with website references and contact information. While not all schools are presented in the format of a detailed one to two page article, you will be able to find the vital statistics on most 9-12 private day or boarding schools in the United States even if they have not been featured in the aforemention in depth profile. You will always be able to find the following information for each school: Academics, Athletics, Endowment, Number of Faculty members (a breakdown of how many hold Bachelors, Masters or Ph.Ds), Physical Plant, Amount of Financial Aid given last year, Applied vs. Accepted Statistics and of course Admissions contact information.I have worked with many families who were exploring the idea of sending their child to private school. Whether you or your family are familiar with independent education or are just being introduced to the idea, I promise that this guide will be your best reference throughout both the exploration and application process.Do keep in mind however that a campus visit (including a tour and interview) and a school's own literature are always the best sources of information about a particular school. Nevertheless, the Peterson's guide will help a family to determine which schools are a good match and will best meet their needs, thus making the best of each campus visit."},{"Title":"Beet Queen","review":"I found this novel to be enjoyable to read, with unexpected events occuring around every corner. The dark humor fits in well with the story line and it keeps the reader motivated. While the ending appears to leave the reader hanging with respect to some characters, it really makes you think about what the reason for that is. Why don't we know what happens to Jude? Maybe it is because Jude is the only character in the novel who has his needs met -- all the other characters endure a life long struggle for one need or another. The author uses strong symbolism which can be cryptic, yet challenging. It's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Beet Queen","review":"Erdrich has that special touch, to make surreal situations so very believable. I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn.

Nobody is perfect here, motives are always mixed and all actions have unintended consequences. The writing is strong and quirky, full of painfully hilarious situations. The characters are distinct and memorable, each acting out of his or her inescapable logic. This book makes me want to read the author's previous novel, Love Medicine."},{"Title":"Beet Queen","review":"I bought this book for $1 at a book sale. At first, I enjoyed it. I have read Louise Erdrich's \\"Love Medicine\\" years ago in a literature class and, from what I remember, I enjoyed it for the most part. However, there was a lot of symbolism and mysticism which made that book a little difficult to read. This one had a lot of both of those elements as well. But this book became a nightmare after maybe 100 pages. The stories are very fragmented and numerous. There were too many characters and narrators, too much unfinished business, and to me, pretty much all of the characters were unlovable. I respected the aunt and uncle of Sita, but thy were whisked out of the book much too soon. I felt sorry for Mary & Karl as children, at first, being abandoned by their mother, but as they grew up, they became totally unlovable and annoying. Even Celestine became a character I didn't respect because of the brat she raised. I did not like the way Sita's death occurred. It was just bizarre & annoying to me. Every major character in this book had a bleak and depressing progression of their life. I would never read this book again and unfortunately, after reading this one, I will probably never read any more books by this author, even though I know that she is a highly respected and talented author. However, her style of writing is just not for me. I plan to donate this book to a library an I'm not even sure I can finish the final 30 pages. Ugh!

The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la \\"Weekend at Bernie's.\\" Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say.

Abandoned by their mother, they have come to look for their mother's sister, Aunt Fritzie, who runs the House of Meats, a butcher shop, with her husband. The two Adares lose each other. Karl is frightened by a dog and runs back to the boxcar, and Mary runs the other way, toward town. And so begins the forty year saga of a family, and a community.Through the years the family holds together through the tenacity of relationships, in a fierce and passionate drama, filled with Erdrich's dark humor. Changes sweep across their lives - birth, death, madness. Change also comes in the form of a growing sugar beet industry. Ms. Erdrich story chronicles Mary's life, as she puts down roots in Argus. She also keeps track of the tragic and sensitive dreamer, Karl, on his endless road journeys. He seem to compulsively flee emotional ties, and yet returns to Argus, again and again. At one point Karl says, \\"I give nothing, take nothing, mean nothing, hold nothing.\\" He struggles with connection - with the past, and with his family and community. Mary's astounding dreams and fantasies also play an incredible and surreal role in the novel.Themes of parenting and abandonment, jealousy, sexual obsession, and great love play out with passion in Ms. Erdrich's complex and believable characters, as does her portrayal of people's aggression and the self-destructive side of human nature. Her narrative is written with beauty, clarity and pure magic. This is not an easy book to read, nor is it always pleasant. It is, however, well worth the effort.Like many of her characters, Ms. Erdrich has a foot in two worlds. She grew up in Wahpeton, North Dakota, near the Bureau of Indian Affairs school where both her mother, of French-Ojibwe descent, and her father, of German descent, taught. She writes movingly about Native Americans \\"whose nobility resides in their ability to make their lives work.\\""},{"Title":"Beet Queen","review":"I picked up this book at a second hand store.

A moment of fear sends Karl running back to the train, and Mary in the other direction, towards her aunt's house. This division between them sends them on different paths. Mary grows up as the despised cousin of lovely Sita, the foster daughter of Pete and Fritzie who own a butcher shop. Karl is eventually sent back to Minnesota to grow up in a Catholic children's home. The people who know them - Sita, Celestine, the Chamber of Commerce president Wallace Pfef, and finally Dot, the Beet Queen of the title - add their voices to weave a story that goes beyond Karl and Mary to include the entire town of Argus. Spanning forty years, the novel encompasses changes not only within the characters but in the town and the times in general.Erdrich's characterizations are complex and heartfelt, especially since the multiple points-of-view allow us to see the characters from both inside and out. When characters describe the same incident from different perspectives, we get a deep understanding of what is at stake for each.The Beet Queen is one of Erdrich's finest novels. Fans of Erdrich's will recognize some of the characters that appeared in the earlier Love Medicine and in her later books, but you don't need to be familiar with the author's work to become engrossed in this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beet Queen","review":"From the mesmerizing first chapter I was hooked. This is an adventure that makes you want to turn the pages quickly.

I just wanted to keep reading and reading to find out what would happen with each of them next.Each chapter has its own narrator and we often learn of an event from more than one perspective. I have read a few books written in this style, but this is by far the most effective.Lousie Erdrich is a prolific author of poetry, children's books, fiction as well as non-fiction.

Let's get started.First, the characters are so feeble and unsympathetic I foundmyself not caring what happened to them. From hobosexual Karlto mediocre Mary, and oh yes, Dot.

Thereare 2 characters of interest (Russell and Fleur), but theycontribute about 3 pages to this monstrosity of a book.I had to read this monumental waste for a literature class. Inormally like to read, but this book nearly beat the readingbug right out of me. Even if I had not been required to readit, I might have finished it anyway in the expectation thatsomething interesting would (finally) happen. Bad news, folks:it never does.

Much like James Bond, some of these stories are great (My Life Undercover), and others, such as Deep Cover, are sloppy and dull. The setting in Deep Cover is in the Florida Everglades, and all of the native Floridians are, for lack of a better word, hicks: a complete 180 from the smart criminals he dealt with when infiltrating the mafia. It is unfair to expect it to be as good as the first book, but I still held Deep Cover to very high standards and was more than a little disappointed in the outcome. In my mind, Deep Cover is Die Another Day while My Life Undercover is Goldfinger."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Night : The Angry Angel","review":"When I first received this book, I looked forward with anticipation to reading it. 20 pages into it, my enthusiasm was dampened mainly by the use of the phrase &quot;Militant Angel&quot; in every other sentence (are there no editors anymore?). However, I thought if I persevered, it was bound to get better and it did for the most part. This book has so much promise, so much potential that is lurking just below the surface, you just want to scream at the author to keep working on it, to reach for those hidden details and fleshed out storylines. As it stands now, &quot;The Angry Angel&quot; could be shortened by a third or more and be a very good novella but as a book it loses some of its punch in the padding. This is probably due to the publisher making a trilogy out of this but I'm going to bet the story of all three &quot;sisters&quot; could be told in one longer book. I will probably check out the next one but from a library before I buy. To summarize, not a bad book but one that disappoints as much as it entertains."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Night : The Angry Angel","review":"The promise of this book was great.

I could clearly see the Kelene's family and could relate to them on many levels. The father and mother to me ver yvery well thoughtout and described, along with the other minor characters. Kelene's character throughout most of the book was rather sad/tragic and interesting.But one problem I did have with the book was it's treatment of Dracula's and Kelene's relationship. I thought the character of Dracula was well done...he was ominous and tragically sad at the same time, and it left me wanting more about him throughout the book. Iknow this is the first of the series so I will eargly await more info. But for his relationship with Kelene.....during the first couple parts of the book..it was very good...and griping, but towards the end it just became repetitive. During the whole journey to his castle it seems to me that thye were repeating the same scene over and over again.

When Kalene's family is driven out of their land by the Turks, they travel to the locale where the angel in the vision dictates they go.In Belgrade, during a dark moment, her angel appears in the flesh. He turns out to be Count Dracula, who is determined to have Kalene join him as one of his queenly undead. Will Kalene have the ability to resist the allure of the living dead or will she shed her humanity and become one of his vile minions?Anyone who reads SISTERS OF THE NIGHT: THE ANGRY ANGEL will quickly understand why Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has written over 50 bestsellers and has a large fan following in several diverse genres. Her current dark fantasy is the first of a trilogy based on the \\"Three Weird Sisters\\" who appear in Stoker's Dracula and is quite simply one of the best Vampire novels to be published in several years. Fans of horror, especially vampiric tales, will want to read this book and the subsequent next two tales of the \\"Three Weird Sisters\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sisters of the Night : The Angry Angel","review":"While at the 1997 Vampire Con in Los Angeles, I was very interested to learn of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's pending series Sisters of the Night consisting of three books which would provide voices for Dracula's brides. Yarbro would tell readers how the three brides came to be turned and their stories would be told. I was excited at this prospect despite that I usually dislike such vaults into poetic license (such as Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind from Mass Market Paperback 1992 and Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea 1996 from W.W. Norton &amp; Company). I find they do not represent the vision of the original text, and, rather, operate in a direct affront to it (namely Marie Kiraly's Mina: the Dracula Story Continues from Mass Market Paperback 1996-who, when I asked her what she did to prepare to write Mina, responded that she simply \\"thought\\" and did not even have the respect for Stoker or the character of Mina to read the original text. For shame, Ms. Kiraly! But, as we know, is reflected in the mediocre work that she produced). I had hopes that Yarbro, based on her Saint-Germaine series, would have a bit more panache than other similarly assuming writers.The first of the series, The Angry Angel (Avon, 1998) is an interesting work. The writing is fantastic, with gorgeous landscapes and interesting characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the Romanian proverbs and quotes Yarboro offered at each chapter opening. However, to cast Dracula as a psychic, sadistic pedophile? Yarbro completely misses her mark in representing Dracula, and instead writes a fetish text with nice scenery. While I come to care about Kelene and her family, I am too distracted by the ill formation of Dracula to much care for the text as an elaboration of Stoker's story. One of the most detracting, annoying plot points that gives Yarbro away as having not truly read the text from where she hopes to leap is that she makes Dracula fatally vulnerable to sunlight. Dear readers, vampires withering into dust when struck by sunlight originated in our collective conscious in 1937 when Mr. Bela Lugosi penetrated to our hearts' darkest corners as The Count to which all others would be compared. Stoker's Dracula, as emulated in Francis Ford Coppola's film representation, does not die when exposed to the sun. Vampires, according to Stoker, merely lose their superhuman powers during the daylight hours (they are weakest at noon and strongest at midnight). Vampires, during the day, are just regular Joes.As for Kelene as a character, I'm not terribly impressed, either. She is marked as the blond vampire bride, about which Stoker's Jonathan remarks, \\"I seemed to somehow know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where\\" (p. 38, Bantam edition). She is the first female vampire who will approach Jonathon and lick \\"her lips like an animal\\" after she finishes gloating over him. I am to believe that Jonathon Harker will find this slip of a woman-child \\"deliberate[ly] voluptuous\\"? (p. 39). Are we then to see Harker as the same pedophile Yarbro casts for Dracula? I think not.Kelene just doesn't measure up and the fair girl who is \\"the first\\" and responds to Dracula's threats with \\"a laugh of ribald coquetry\\" (p. 40). For as much as I enjoyed the mechanics of Yarbro's text: the striking imagery, the creative mind who provided the \\"fair girl\\" a name, a history, a mind, I am even less impresses with Yarbro for sexualizing and erotisizing a pre-pubescent girl. Yuck! I can only hope that for the next two books in the series, that Yarbro actually bothers to read all of Stoker's text and does some forward thinking before writing the tales of the remaining two vamps who require more ritual and fanfare to kill than the Count himself."},{"Title":"Afghan Frontier: Feuding and Fighting in Central Asia","review":"I think that after Sir Olaf Caroe's book \\"The Pathans\\" which is generally regarded as the magnum opus of this confounding subject, this book (though not as well known) is the second best exposition I have come across regarding Afghans (also Pashtuns or Pathans)that I can safely recommend as such.Victoria Schofield is very much a contemporary english author, but to my scrutiny she does not seem to suffer from the flaws which such people mostly display, especially those from the now dominant American style of writing. Consider: she doesn't touch her subject of study lightly or casually, or lace it with flighty rhetorical assumptions or hyperbole. She is forthright but gracefully so, in her assessment of Afghan realities past and present, unlike the timorous liberal or childishly amateurish and abrupt attitudes we now see prevalent towards it. For instance on P.266 of the book she mentions an international antiques dealer John Suidmak, who \\"discovered in a curious way that he could not do good business (with his Afghan counterparts)until he had learnt to lie\\". Now that would evoke howls of protests from \\"non-ethnocentric\\" and \\"politically correct\\" Western types, as well as \\"educated\\" immigrant Afghans residing in the West - who want to conceal as much as they can the realities of their native culture and society from credulous Westerners for a variety of cunning reasons - but it is a reality which I as a Pathan can vouch for 100%. And I wouldn't want to hide it from Westerners, because unlike other Afghans, I am half Anglo-Saxon and my principles and upbringing wouldn't permit such chicanery or hidden agendas as being justified. The whole tone of her book is set like that, a treasure rarely wittnessed nowadays. The truth is the truth whether it is ethnocentric or not. Western liberals and scholars of the present day have beset themselves with a plethora of terms that cast aspersions on ordinary common sense, and Victoria Schofield is not one of those! The book's subtitle \\"Fighting and Feuding\\" sums up the main aspect of Afghan reality, which the author wishes to bring to her readers' attention. Lastly, Victoria's work doesn't suffer from the \\"typos\\" and misspelt native place and people's names that nowadays so ubiquitously bedevil even the best of publications and distract from their worth. In other words, Miss Schofield is a high quality author. She seems to remind me of those pioneering British ladies of a certain period and disposition, made of stern and sturdy but graceful stuff - who went confidently where their vast empire used to take them. In this regard I am reminded of Lady Sale (also mentioned herein) who chronicled an elaborate account, from her personal travails, of the First Anglo-Afghan war of 1839-43; and of my own British mother Kathleen, who married my Pathan father in 1959 and lived for the rest of her life in Peshawar on this perpetually troubled Afghan Frontier, for for 43 years...Another advantage of this book is that while Caroe's classic work is dated by as much as 50 years, Schofield writes from a very recent perspective in time (2003), covering this area's history from the very start, down to its dramatically changing present situation as well - using the relevant maps and illustrations where needed. Thus her writing becomes a story and a treastise at the same time. The histories of modern Afghanistan (from 1747) and the British Indian \\"Frontier\\" (now the Pakistani NWFP) are elaborately presented intertwined as they should be, in a single narrative that is replete with the detailed anecdotes and impressions of British and other European colonial administrators, soldiers, diplomats, statesmen, writers, physicians, tourists, educationists, businessmen and christian missionaries past and present, who from 1809 to the present encountered the Pathans in both the Frontier as well as over the border in Afghanistan. These not only bring the book to life, but also present a wealth of valuable social, anthropological and historical information in an extremely palatable and stimulating manner. So this book is very much upto date as far as the post 9/11 reference datum of the current world situation is concerned - and is infact a very useful guide for this new scenario.The paper, binding and typesetting are also of equally high quality, so as to complete the overall picture of an excellent book."},{"Title":"Know It All!

As I am researching 18th century theatre, this book made my work rather easy!"},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"She Stoops to ConquerIt was said of Oliver Goldsmith that he only wrote one play, one poem and one novel but that each one of them was perfect. The poem was \\"The Deserted Village\\", the novel \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" and ofcourse \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" is the play. I rather agree with the assessment.This play owes much to the Restoration comedy of the seventeenth and early eighteenth century. There is the emphasis on wit, and the rather stock plot of townie meets rustic and the consequences of the encounter.The characters also owe their roots to Restoration Comedy - Tony is of course the boisterous yokel, Marlowe and his friend the townies, Hardcastle the suspicious country gentleman, etc.But there is a twist. The yokel is actually the one with the brains and sets in motion the plot to solve the lovers' problems. The women take action to reveal Marlowe's actual nature. (Incidentally Marlowe is surprisingly modern). And the townies rather meet their match instead of the other way around. The whole is permeated with good nature which does exist in Restoration Comedy although not in William Congreve its most renowned and best writer, see the play \\"The Beaux Strategem\\", one of my personal favorites. Missing from \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" is the stage Irishman so prevalent in Sheriden as well as Restoration Comedy.This is a romp and works very well onstage - but it's a bit like a number of such plays - the cast has to be superb there are no throwaway roles. And it can make for casting difficulty. And while it is never out of date it doesn't adapt itself very well to trendy different time settings, modern dress, flapper that sort of thing. That period was very much unto its own, at least for its comedy.The Dover edition is well printed, although the paper is not so glossy. The price is right, particularly for a single play, and it would make a great performance edition as there is ample margin room for comments and moves."},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith (c. 1730-1774) was born to an English clergyman in Ireland and is often described as an \\"Anglo-Irish\\" author. Originally trained in theology, he later studied medicine and worked as an apothecary's assistant. Both then and now, critics regard the vast bulk of his writing as \\"hackwork\\"--poorly written material undertaken for the money offered. Even so, Goldsmith was indeed an exceptional and often innovative author when he put his mind to it, and his finest works rank with the best of his age. By most accounts Goldsmith wrote the comedy SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER in 1771; it was first performed in 1773 and has remained a favorite of the English stage ever since.The play concerns the Hardcastle family, who are country gentry living living outside the common realm of English aristocracy of the day. Mr. Hardcastle dislikes \\"society\\" and frequently battles with his silly wife over his refusal to spend a season in London; Mrs. Hardcastle is in turn besotted Tony Lumpkin, her wayward son by a first marriage. Indeed, the only sensible member of the family is daughter Kate--and as the play begins she is told by her father that his choice for her husband, Charles Marlow, will arrive that very night. But things do not go as planned: due to a prank by Tony Lumpkin, Charles and his companion George arrive under the impression that Hardcastle's house is actually a roadside inn. Needless to say, complications abound, and Kate finds herself assuming the role of rural barmaid the better to study her intended and bring all complications to a happy resolution.SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER is often considered a turning point in English theatre. Earlier comic authors tended to emphasize themes of hypocrisy for comic effect; Goldsmith certainly makes use of this, but instead of giving us cuckolds and strumpets he takes a more kindly point of view. His characters may sometimes be foolish and silly, but they are not so much vicious as playful and although the plot is farcical the situations are never unkind. The result is a charming confection of smiling entertainment. SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER has remained a favorite of the theatre for over two hundred years for a reason: it is as spritely, elegant, and amusing as it was when first produced. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"I have to read She Stoops to Conquer for school and it is absolutly terrible. For a play that is supposed to be funny and one of the most comical plays of its time, I find it completly boring. I am not discriminating against the &quot;classics&quot;, as I have read many which I have highly enjoyed, but reading this play is a waste of time."},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith may not have had the linguistic virtuosity or satiric audacity of his great contemporary, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, but 'She Stoops to Conquer' is one of the few highpoints in English drama between the Restoration and Oscar Wilde. Ironically, in view of its satirising the slavish devotion to French fashions, the play is influenced by early 18th century French comedy: the plot is very similar to Marivaux's 'The Game of love and chance': two fathers arrange a marriage for their children; this paternal decree is severely shaken by disguises, misrecognitions and counter-plots. The difference being, English comedy is always the funniest, and we get lots of marvellous words like 'obstropalous'.In effect, this drama consists of characters staging dramas to get their way, which are spoiled by other dramas, e.g. Mr. Hardcastle decides his daughter will marry a man she never met, and arranges their meeting; Tony tells this prospective husband, Marlow, and his friend Hastings, that the gentleman's house they seek is a tavern; Kate disguises herself as a barmaid to woo the diffident Marlow. The effect of all these conflicting dramas is to take a supposedly solid, class-based system, based on paternal and aristocratic power, and reveal it as a fragile one based on illusion, a series of masks and attitudes adopted to suit the required social context, where wrong directions can as easily derail as resolve the social order. The best comedy here comes from characters mistaking the social context, as when Marlow treats his host and future father-in-law as a pesky inn-keeper. Significantly, in this over-cultured milieu, most of the spanners in the works are thrown by the illiterate Tony.In Goldsmith's world, there is no such thing as a 'natural', whole identity - character is divided by public and private roles, fragmented by clothing and ornaments, with passions dictated by fashions. Goldsmith's benevolently cynical view of his century encompasses all its familiar tropes - the carousing squire rake; the social mobility; the marketplace of marriage; the refined bawdiness; the hints at the incipient decline of the aristocracy (where an old estate has degenerated into a plausible inn); the wars turned into legend from a safe distance. Its teeming culture is catalogued too - sentimental novels, the love of theatre, the rise of Gothic fiction (marvellously parodied to the point where the mistress of the house is terrified of her own garden), Hogarth, caricature prints etc."},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"Few English plays dating from the eighteenth century appeal to modern audiences. For much of that period comedies were characterized by an exaggerated sentimentality and intense moralizing. Independently, the playwrights Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan rejected this moralizing mode, returning to the English stage a humorous, mildly satirical form of comedy.In a short period they created three plays that are still enjoyed today: She Stoops to Conquer (Goldsmith, 1773), The School for Scandal (Sheridan, 1775) and The Rivals (Sheridan, 1777).In recent months I have read all three play. All are quite good, but I especially liked She Stoops to Conquer and The School for Scandal. While The School for Scandal is widely admired for its witty dialogue, She Stoops to Conquer offers the most hilarious situations.The basic theme in She Stoops to Conquer is familiar. The guardians, her father Mr. Hardcastle and her aunt Mrs. Hardcastle, have arranged a suitable marriage for young Miss Hardcastle. She, of course, has other plans. Oliver Goldsmith adroitly transformed this overly used situation into delightful comedy. The plot is complicated by a shy suitor, friends with their own plans of elopement, and an unruly prankster, all leading to utter confusion in the rustic Hardcastle household. I quickly became engaged with the ridiculous happenings; I read She Stoops to Conquer in a single sitting. Five stars.Possible Interest - Another Comedy and Two Moralizing Plays:John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, first staged in 1728 in London, was another exception to the moralizing trend in the eighteenth century. This delightful, satirical comedy is considered the first modern musical. Five stars.In the prologue to The Conscious Lovers (1722) Sir Richard Steele states his objective: \\"To chasten wit, and moralize the stage\\" and to \\"Redeem from long contempt the comic name\\". Steele's objective was to instruct and to ennoble rather than to amuse. Humor is clearly subordinate. Two stars (plus perhaps 1 star for historical interest).George Lillo's moralizing melodrama, The London Merchant (1731), was a resounding success in the summer of 1731 and was apparently performed 179 times by 1776. Its repetitious moral lessons seemingly resonated with eighteenth century audiences.

There is a lot of flirtateous game-playing going on here, but it is entered into by strong, intelligent women who are using the resources they have at hand in their culture to get what they want. Reading this play, or seeing it performed, it is hard to believe that it was written in the 18th Century. Goldsmith has created a humorous story with intriguing plot twists that manages to show women as thinking individuals who take control of their own destinies....even if getting the right man is the way to do that!"},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"This play is a wonderful little comedic satire that is as funny now as when it was written in 1773. Mr. Goldsmith's characters are wonderful, and the storyline is funny without being \\"sappy\\". His characters are so very human! He does not shy away from exposing human frailities, and he does it in such a way that no one would take offence to it. His characters make common human mistakes based on misunderstandings and practical jokes, but his characters are not tragically changed from these occurences. They, as well as the audience, understand human frailties, and look upon these as things that help us grow. This is a jovial, friendly play that is well worth the time it takes to read it. I find that reading plays is a nice alternate to reading long novels. A little different from short stories. I like the economies of a play. So much is written and so much is implied all in five scenes."},{"Title":"She stoops to conquer, (Merrill's English texts)","review":"SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER is one of the best plays to be written during the Restoration era. It's full of wit and great one liners, not to mention that it's a comic satire on the dramatic conventions of the day. The play is quite funny and when performed is one of the few \\"classical\\" (meaning anything pre-20th century) plays that all audiences seem to enjoy. Unfortunately, Goldsmith's masterpiece is seldom performed nowadays. Most American's have never heard of Oliver Goldsmith (is that the guy who directed PLATOON? is a typical response), let alone SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER. SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER instead tends to be one of those plays that everyone in theatre knows about, but that most people outside of the theatre universe don't even know exists.

Writing must run in the family - the author is the great(?) granddaughter of Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"This was one of the most delightful books I have read in ages. Monica Dickens (great-granddaughter of Charles), despite her privileged upbringing, despite being presented at Court as a debutante, is bored and has little desire to do the rounds of social events expected of a young upper class girl in the mid 1930s. And so she decides to try her hand at domestic service. If you have ever enjoyed watching the wonderful &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; series or reading other tales which reflect the upstairs downstairs lives of the British class system, this is for you. It is light, entertaining and the author writes so fluidly, it has inspired me to begin reading more of her works."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Monica Dickens, the great-grandaughter of Charles Dickens, fits into the &quot;good sport&quot; type of memoirist, recalling life experiences for which she was quite unprepared. I think of Betty MacDonald's &quot;The Egg and I.&quot; Apparently well-to-do, Ms. Dickens decided to work as a Cook General for a couple years during the 1930's. The book is a chronicle of her relationships and experiences with various employers. I fully expected that the various households would blend into each other but was delighted to discover how vividly the personalities were portrayed, and so they remained distinct. Most memorable was the clothing designer with a constant finger on the call button, a mistrust of her spending habits and a penchant for draping her in fabrics to envision his newest creations. Some may have a problem with the fact that Ms. Dickens took on the job as a lark and could return to her comfortable life at any time, but the fact is that she really was up to her elbows in the muck of a 1930's kitchen. All in all, I found it a delightful read, although the final chapter which recounts a lecture on &quot;The Problem of the Servant Today&quot; is tedious and merely restates in an arid manner the &quot;problems&quot; so well-documented in the rest of the book."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Monica Dicken's autobiographical novels are some of the most delightful books I have ever read. I first read &quot;One pair of hands&quot; some 25 years ago after finding an old copy in my local library. I rarely remember novels, but her's were so entertaining, I simply could not forget them. Her exploits trying to make it as a servant, even though she knew little about cleaning or cooking, are really funny--something akin to &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; I hope some day that some smart movie producer takes all of her novels and makes a series of movies about them--at least Masterpiece Theatre ought to be interested!

The video is very good, and goes very well with this book. The video is in color and is very clear, where as the pictures in the book are too dark.

Finally we have books which explain exactly how and why the techniques we have been using for years work. Tim Cartmell gives us a complete guide to throwing, explaining and grouping techniques by the principles under which they are executed. Cartmell's roots are, interestingly enough, in Jimmy Woo's ever practical San Soo Kung Fu, although later Cartmell moved to Taiwan and then China and trained there with a number of extraordinarily skilled teachers, including Hsu Hong Chi and Hsu Chen Wang (Hsing Yi), Chen Tso Chen (Hsu Hsi Tao), Lin Ah Lung (Tang and Chen Taiji), Kao Liu-te (Yi Chuan), Hsu Fu-chin (Chen Taiji), Luo Te-hsiu (Kao-style Pa Kua Chang &amp; Chen Pan-ling Taiji), Sun Jian-yun (daughter of the famed Sun Lu-tang &amp; present headmaster).Author Tim Cartmell begins by describing types of throws (arc, circle, and spiral) and the basic principles which guide their application. Next, he explains principled of body use, and then the bulk of the book, comprised of an analysis and application of each throw. Cartmell is extremely thourough in his description of each stage of the technique, describing every little facet of motion, how to balance, how to turn, what you will feel and what is happening to your partner. Each technique offers an analysis of entry, analysis of the technique, of body use, of practical application, of counters and combat use, and variations on the throw. While there are plenty of illustrations, you will need to be a patient reader to glean the most from this volume. It is with words that Cartmell makes the whole picture come together. Whatever your discipline (Chinese style or not), if your art includes throwing techniques, this is the volume to explain the how and why's."},{"Title":"Principles, Analysis, and Application of Effortless Combat Throws","review":"This book was great from start to finnish. The author starts out by changing the way throws are classified. He defines them by how the opponent moves through space, and simplifies it into arcs, spirals, and circles. He then moves in to eight principles of motion for effortless throws, like transfer of momentum, and then goes into different methods of executing those principles. Chapter two focuses on eight principles of &quot;body use&quot;, which amounts to some very specific details about proper posture, but which is nessesary in order to execute throws with minimum effort. These two very important chapters make up about 1/4 of the book. The next chapter goes into the performance of the throws, as classified by arcs, circles, and spirals. There is even a separate part for sacrifice throws. In demonstrating a throw, Mr. Cartmell starts by describing the throw, showing how it is applied, then analyzing it's entry, the throw itself, and the use of your own body in the throw. He then gives examples of how to move into the throw based on different defenses, such as vs a punch or headlock. At the end of the book is an appendix section that covers a broad range of topics, like relaxation and stability vs. mobility. The focus of the book is using a minimum amount of force to throw an opponent, and I believe it explains it well. I would recomend this book to folks who have to use throws for self-defense, such as bouncers and police officers, and for those who wish to understand the internal arts, but like me, don't really get the whole &quot;expand your chi&quot; thing. It's also just a really good book to read, and would complete anyones martial arts library."},{"Title":"Principles, Analysis, and Application of Effortless Combat Throws","review":"In \\"Effortless Combat Throws\\" Tim Cartmell masterfully unravels the core principles of internal martial arts devoid of \\"chi\\" oriented mumbo jumbo.

It doesn't matter what kind of martial arts you do. Just because the title says \\"Effortless Combat Throw\\" doesn't mean it's just all about throwing. The book goes far deeper than that if you bother to actually read it.Too many people just like looking at pictures and think they can add another technique to their repertoire. Guess what?

He has both tori and uke wearing grey t-shirts and black pants. Furthermore nobody taught the photographer to open up the lens aperature to let a little light into the camera. All the photos are too dark. So the result is in most of the pictures, there is a mass of black where four legs ought to be, and some arms and hands, but you can't really tell which arms belong to whom.The book needs to reprinted on good paper, hire a photographer and make the book something to showcase Mr. Cartmells' vast knowledge.

Tim Cartmell's depth of knowledge on this subject shines through page after page, matched only by his ability to explain the details of motion in such a way that the reader can easily envision and perhaps 'feel' what he's talking about.Each section covers a fundamental 'type' of throw, detailing both WHY it is done and HOW it is applied. Then the rest of that chapter is filled with variation after variation of the standard throw. This type of extrapolation and depth of content makes \\"Effortless Combat Throws\\" one of the richest sources of information on throws that I've ever seeen. Most books on martial arts techniques rely heavily on the photographs to convey the material and then give shallow written details. This book is almost opposite this norm. The photographs are black and white and very basic, yet adequate to demonstrate the sequence of motion. The explanation, however, is what FEW other martial arts books can actually achieve, it's \\"Instructive\\".My ONLY complaint?That Mr. Cartmell hasn't put out MORE books!"},{"Title":"Principles, Analysis, and Application of Effortless Combat Throws","review":"Level: Beginner to AdvancedI've spent quite a bit of time reading, re-reading, and practicing the techniques and principles of Tim Cartmell's excellent book. The techniques work, the principles are superb, and the insights quite eye-opening.Cartmell is another young championship-calibre martial artist who basically makes things real. In a martial arts world where there is so much mysticism and legend clouding the picture (qi, qigong, breathing, auras, whatnot), it's great to hear from someone who has had success, and puts things in verbiage that make it understandable to the everyday Westerner. I am struck by the fact that in our school we have two students who work as Chinese interpreter/translator types. They are fluent in Chinese. But contextually, when the great Master from China gives us a seminar, there is so much that is unique to the Chinese martial arts-- history/legend/context-- that they cannot interpret for us. Interesting no? The analogy I use is this-- how would a medieval Chinese peasant/martial artist/monk explain to you how to learn to ride a bicycle? Today we have terms like center of gravity and equilibrium. Back then... nope.So Cartmell keeps it real. Principles, physics and body mechanics, mental attitude. The throws are examples, certainly. 14 techniques total-- with so much explanation and analysis it's almost overkill. The throws are illustrative of the four main categories of throws. In each throw, Cartmell talks about the category, the lever arm, the key structural elements, the approach, and applications to self-defense situations. It's quite good... like I said almost redundant, but necessary especially if one reads only about one technique without reading the rest of the book, for example.The pictures ARE poor. Especially by today's standards. But good enough to understand what's going on. I would have been more pleased if the publisher had recommended twice as many pictures, of better quality, with about 1/3rd less text.Before/after the techniques are descriptions of principles, exercises to develop balance, breathing, mental attitude, and body awareness useful in these techniques. Cartmell discusses his opinions on body mechanics, etcetera, including pelvic positioning. The afterward essay relating these issues to martial arts \\"myths\\" is also a bit redundant-- basically stating the same thing but relating it more to traditional Chinese martial arts training.I really think that conceptually, this is an essential book for any martial artist... not just throwing arts. The principles are prudent to striking arts, as well. It allows one to see more clearly openings and possibilities-- one sees/feels the body with a different completeness that's nice. In fact, that's how I'd explain it-- instead of just feeling the opponent's center-- as is somewhat more typical-- Cartmell helps us see it, as well."},{"Title":"Principles, Analysis, and Application of Effortless Combat Throws","review":"I have taught both Shaolin Kung Fu and Aikido for many years and have run across many books that are a collection of throwing techniques. In this book, the author outlines a new way of categorizing throws in terms of how they affect the opponent's body and details the principals that go with these categories, then gives a number of effective throwing techniques as examples. He takes as the starting point some of the key things that many students only start to understand after doing a technique many many times. If you practice Judo, Aikido, Shuai Jiao, or just about any other throwing art you're almost certain to get something out of this book, even if it's just a new way of looking at and understanding the different classes of throws you use. If you're just starting out, you can get a lot out of this book that will help you along, provided you've got the instruction and mat time to go with it."},{"Title":"Mapping the Godzone: A Primer on New Zealand Literature and Culture (Latitude 20 Books)","review":"The premise of this book is fantastic: it aims to be an introduction to New Zealand culture geared toward the educated but non-specialist American. By explaining dominant trends in NZ literature, describing some of this literature's historical context, and relating it to American culture, William Schafer outlines some answers to the questions of what it means to live in New Zealand, and how that nation has structured its unique identity. On a more basic level, this book gives its readers a sense of what NZ lit and film is available, and thus provides a spring board for an independent exploration of NZ culture. Schafer's quotes and discussion of the fiction of Witi Imihaera (author of the novel The Whale Rider, upon which the 2003 film is based), for instance, were particularly attractive to me and, as a result, I have since read several of his works. Mapping the Godzone opened a new world to me, and I look forward to continuing to explore NZ culture under its guidance.While the book's aims are laudable, its execution is not quite as impressive. Schafer tries to avoid the jargon and heavily theoretical analysis of contemporary literary criticism, but at times he slips up and his prose drags. At other times, he is somewhat too summary in his discussions--particularly when he relies on series of lengthy quotes by other critics. The quotes from literary sources should be well appreciated, since they provide a window into the style of many authors; the quotes from scholars simply seem to point to laziness on the part of the author. Could he not sum up the material himself? Besides these (not too grave) issues of style, the content of the book could have been improved. Clearly Schafer (an English professor) was mostly interested in the literary achievements of New Zealand. However, he does intend his book to be a primer on culture as well, and to achieve this end he would have done well to include more of popular and visual culture in his book. He does write a short section on film, but it consists mostly of a list of movies that the reader might find interesting.Despite its flaws and shortcomings, Mapping the Godzone is a unique resource for the American reader curious about New Zealand, and it seems to be an excellent overview of that country's literature. I am glad to have found it."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"It has been my life-long wish to become a writer. To put words down on the written page that will move, captivate, and enthrall the audience. Novels that are not only well written but seemless -- moving the reader into another realm where words blur into reality. I have seen only a handful of authors do this and Iris Rainer-Dart is one of them. This is the first book I have read by Dart and to be honest, it sat on my shelf for monthes. Now that I have read it, however, I can't help but ask myself &quot;Why did you wait so long?&quot; She is a wonderful author and this is an astounding novel. All throughout the novel, I lost myself in the pages. The characters were so well sketched, the story so plausible. It was just so REAL. How often can you say that about a novel and its characters? Even now, several days after I have finished reading it, the story stays with me. I find myself re-reading sections that I particularly liked and thinking about the characters as if they were real. I don't know how Dart does it, but she finds a way to dig into your soul and remain there. Just how does she do that? And, more importantly, how can I learn her secret?"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"Sometimes, a reader needs to pick a book because the blurp makes it sound enjoyable, and she needs enjoyable. Sometimes a reader chooses it for the romance and laughter, something she is craving that day. And somtimes, when the reader gets into the book, she realizes that yes, it is romantic; yes it is pleasurable; yes it makes her laugh out loud at times; but, unexpectedly, it makes her think, and that is a wonderful gift she hadn't expected. She finds the words to be magic carpets that transcend time and space, and for a full day she is immersed in the lives of Lily, Byran, and Charlie. She learns about handicaps, emotional and physcial; she learns about beating the odds; she learns about love penetrating prejudice. Her heart is full; her eyes are wet; her beliefs are buoyed; she has read a deftly written book in one sitting and she is most grateful to the author. She thanks Iris Rainer Dart profusely in her review and she encourages others.........If you need to feel uplifted by life again, treat yourself to &quot;When I Fall In Love.&quot; The carpet ride awaits!!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"Altho I am not a person with a disability, I have been around disabled people my lifetime (I'm 42). I found Dart's treatment of this subject to be incredibly right on. People fear disability, and tend to treat anyone disabled with kid gloves, as if they are saints and imbecils, both. Lily does all the stereotypes of the freaked out &quot;non-disabled&quot; mom, the son goes through typical grief stages, and so on. I don't want to give away the whole story as is my wont.I loved the interplay of the characters, and I fell for the unlikely (in fiction) love-interest, Charlie Roth. Go for the book-- it is well done!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"I don't know just what it was that drove me to read this book as I haven't read any of the author's previous ones (although I did see the move based on her book, BEACHES). I didn't know anything about the plot or characters when I began and didn't know just what to expect. The author hooked me from the beginning and I was pleasantly surprised at the choice of love interest she chose for Lily -- talk about your unconventional hero! Since reading this book over a year ago, I've been recommending it to everyone I know - it's my pleasure to recommend to anyone viewing this review at Amazon.com. This book is a guaranteed &quot;feel good&quot; read."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"Author Dart has labored in the trenches of writing television comedy herself so what better protagonists to bring to a story than two comedy writers for a television show? The heroine is already engaged to a handsome heart surgeon when she meets Charlie, known as The King Of Jokes, who is her new writing boss. Any novel that features a heroine who picks a comedy writer hero, who also has a disability, after dumping the heart surgeon, is/was a must read for me! The best love story of 1999."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"I am a fan since Boys in the Mail Room. This book was warm and funny. The ending was not a surprise but great anyway. I read it a few times and cried each time. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants to relax with a good book."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"The whole story line with Lily and Charlie and Mark kept me focused on what would happen even when I knew I had to put the book down, but I simply couldn't bring myself to do it.The part when Lily sends Charlie the video of &quot;I love you's&quot; and he starts bawling like a baby. I just love it when men get emotional in novels like these. When Mark is out of the picture, and Charlie is free to profess his love for Lily, the way he proposes made my heart swell three times its size.This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves pure romance without the huge hunky jerks who always get the girl in the end, and finally can have a true hero winning out.Now get off the computer, get to your nearest bookstore, and buy this book!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"As I read this book my whole family was still adjusting to thenews that my 2 year old nephew has cerebral palsy.

They were very real as was the situation that Lily found herself in. I appreciated the often true reactions that the characters had when confronted with tough or uncomfortable situations.

Definitely a book to stay up nights with!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"I found the characters lacked depth, and the events a little too predictible. The book didn't challenge my thoughts on handicapped people. The story was essentially boring."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but how could I? Here's an excerpt from Chapter 7, pg. 51:\\"In one swift move that came so quickly [Lily] wasn't prepared, [Charlie] seized her and, holding her tightly around the ankles, thrust the rest of her out the window. As she shrieked in terror four stories above the parking lot, he held her out there upside down. She could see the cars below and among them a group of people who had stopped to look as the blood rushed to her face.\\"There's curmudgeonly but lovable, and then there's violent and abusive. This is the latter.Neither her colleagues (who witness the thing) nor the onlookers from the parking lot nor her family suggests that she should call the police. Later, Charlie gives Lily a gift to apologize. Somehow, this gift is supposed to show that he's an observant and thoughtful guy--not that he's building a relationship based on a cycle of abuse and apology. I was half expecting the end to be a thriller wherein he is revealed to be a homicidal maniac, but no such luck. What the hell?!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"What a marvelous story Iris Rainier Dart has written! Lily Benjamin is a single mother and writer for a TV sitcom. Engaged to a cardiologist, her life is very nearly complete. When tragedy strikes, support comes from a very unlikely source - her new boss, Charlie, himself afflicted with cerebral palsy. This is a terrific book which will have readers laughing through their tears. What a delightful, life-affirming book! I can hardly wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"WHEN I FALL IN LOVE is a wonderful story filled with tragedy, hope, and triumph. It is a story about a very humorous man, Charlie, determined to succeed in life despite his handicap and about a divorced mother, Lily, and her recently paralysed fifteen year old son, Bryan, who are both trying to cope with their tragedy. Charlie becomes a guiding light for Lily and Bryan, showing them that life does go on even if you're body is no longer whole. The three bond in a way no one expected. When loves blossoms between Charlie and Lily, this story's beauty truly begins to unfold. The fantastic, heart wrenching ending was its pinnacle. WHEN I FALL IN LOVE is an absolutely fabulous read that I know you'll love. I recommend it to anyone with a heart. Read it and see for yourself. Trust me!"},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"After having read Beaches (a movie I disliked but a book I absolutely loved) and Some Kind of Miracle (which I enjoyed even more than Beaches), I was really curious to read one of Rainer Dart's other books.And frankly, even though I've had a few hours to reflect upon finishing it, I'm still not quite sure what I think of When I Fall in Love. The only thing I can say with some certainty is that I don't like it anywhere near as much as I liked the other novels I mentioned above.Reading this book - although one of the quickest and easiest I've read - was a journey of back and forth. I loved the very beginning. Then it got difficult to read for a bit. Then it started picking up again as it neared the end. But given such back and forth emotions, I'm really not sure what that says about the book overall.Admittedly, the story was a little too sugary for my taste, especially the ending. I remember adoring the language and the characters in her previous novels, and during this one, it just didn't feel the same. I'm not sure if it was the constant use of jokes that got in my way, but I just didn't feel too much for the characters, except Bryan and, to some extent, Charlie too. Lily's life changes and realizations on love just seemed to come on so quickly; perhaps that made it seem a little unreal and a lot mushy. Or maybe it's because I still feel I'm tossing around the same life questions in my head now that I was over ten years ago so it seems unreal that such moments of clarity exist!I certainly didn't dislike the book. I'd say that I liked it for what it was - quick, simple, and touching at times. But, it definitely came in below my expectations given my adoration for Rainer Dart's other work, and I can quite confidently say I probably won't read this book again.Lastly, and a nit-pick I must readily admit in advance, it completely threw me for a loop that in the beginning scenes with Kimberly, the author alternated the use of her name with Kim in every other line. Perhaps given my name I am too close to this complaint, but while the two names are often (oh so often) alternated back and forth, it just seemed silly to see it change every other line."},{"Title":"When I Fall in Love","review":"Wonderful story about a woman, Lily, raising a teenage son, Bryan, as a single mom with a high power career. She gets a new very ambitious, intelligent boss that has cerebral palsy who does not have a problem with his condition. Lily learns a lot from this man Charly and some of the lessons were a hard study for her. As I tell my children, it's not the outside that counts; and also: never prejudge. Lily has an outgoing, athletic, handsome, popular son that ends up shoot and paralized. Charly also helped him though this horrible, emotional time by using his experience.

However, I was hugely disappointed with the simple way it brushed through the traumatic issues of rehab, grief, and acceptance -- on the entire family's part, not just the young man's. While I didn't expect a medical tome on the subject of SCI, in just a few pages everyone had adjusted beautifully -- thanks to some pretty lame comedy -- and lives happily ever. Very unrealistic.

Some might say, I don't want to read about tragedies, but please give her a chance. This is what life is all about. You'll laugh &amp; cry with this book. At the risk of letting the cat out of the bag, suffice to say that Lily learned what is truly important in life, in regard to Charlie.

Combine this with the high winds often found on the bay and you get a, shall we say, 'delicate' boat to handle.First designed in 1922, these boats are designed to a class that only contains about a dozen boats. And the 80 year old boats from the 1920's are still running and competing in the races.This book is a love story about the A Cats. It tells the story of how they were first designed. It gives a bit of history about the class overall and a description of just about all of the boats ever built. With such a small class, each boat gets a set of photographs and comments from the owners, their wives, their crews, stories if incidents in various races and so on. For instance the 'Helen' was built to win the trophy but proved to be slow. She only raced one year and then went down bay somewhere and was never heard of again.

We have built a culture on the mistaken assumption that human beings are independent of one another and of the places and systems of the earth.&quot; To borrow from author Derrick Jensen, we are a culture of make believe; and the end result of the lies we tell ourselves and our children is economic and cultural alienation en mass. But Moore is not content with this revelation. She goes on to discuss several other &quot;lies that isolate us&quot; (the false dichotomies of today/tomorrow, near/far, us/them, and humans/nature) and then outlines the process of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance of our ecological predicament. It is a very sobering essay that seeks &quot;creative acts of commitment--acts of imagining and choosing.&quot; It is an essay about &quot;caring for people and caring for places, (accepting) the challenge of reconciliation, bringing together what has been apart for a very long time.&quot;The second essay, &quot;A Conservationist's Manifesto,&quot; is just that--a rich, stirring document about humanity's relationship with nature. Having begun as a lively talk between members of the Century for Land and People, it encapsulates the insight and wisdom of many individuals, including such environmental luminaries as William Cronon and Bill McKibben. Point 22 reads: &quot;In order to live, we must use the earth--but we should not use it up. For the sake of our descendants, we must learn to grow food without depleting the soil, fish without exhausting the seas, draw energy from sunlight and wind and tides. We must conserve the minerals we mine and the products we manufacture, recycling them as thoroughly as the forest recycles twigs, leaves, fur, and bone.&quot; All together, it is truly inspiring document, promoting a mature and ethical relationship between humans and the environment; and would make for a wonderful educational tool.The third essay, &quot;Lifting the Veil&quot; by Peter Forbes, is actually six essays in one, and by far the longest and most eclectic of the bunch. Weaving in and out of such topics as time capsules, domestication, and the biographies of great people (Aldo Leopold, Scott and Helen Nearing, Thoreau, and Rachel Carson), Forbes articulates a new vision of conservationism. Differing from the old view, which simply seeks to preserve places, Forbes' vision seeks deep and lasting social change. Ever conscious of how it might end in less funding and social marginalization, he keeps his radical roots. In his words, &quot;As much as conservation is succeeding in creating refugia, or safe havens for pockets of diverse life that might survive the industrial growth society, we conservationists are failing to take the risks necessary to help people life differently, to envision and create an alternative culture. The alternative culture won't emerge solely because land has been protected, but only when our relationship, connection, and communion with that land have been restored.&quot;Altogether, this book is about &quot;protecting the places that we have a birthright to, (helping) us find our roots or put down new roots, enabling us to envision the land as part of ourselves.&quot; Full of common sense, deep, earthly wisdom and a vision of what truly matters, COMING TO LAND contains the germ of an ecologically sustainable future."},{"Title":"Coming to Land in a Troubled World","review":"This book brought tears to my eyes with the way it speaks to the realness of Land and our human connection to it, specifically, the relationships we have with the land and with ourselves in juxtaposition to land.

Each fought for social justice and in some way influenced our educational system. Munro gave a different perspective of what an educator activist was by including Addams and Wells. They were known for women's clubs and settlement houses. The work of these ladies influenced education although the brunt of their activities did not occur in a school or as formal teachers.Crocco shared the difficult lives of Elizabeth Allen and Marion Wright as they fought gendered norms of the time. Allen was involved in many associations and fought for issues such as tenure, pensions, and a disability system. The stress in Allen's life may have caused her death. Wright, an African American woman, is recognized for her dissertation. She gave up her children in order to continue to climb the educational ladder. She committed suicide possibly due to consequences of her struggles and guilt of leaving her children. Her life is an example of the price that women had to pay to break out of gendered (and racial) norms. However, the fact that she chose to pretend her children did not exist makes you feel less empathy for her and makes her harder to relate to.Weiler told of the lives of Helen Heffernan and Corinne Seeds. Both women influenced education in California. They worked to educate teachers and progressively reform education. Weiler also shares how they worked to create a more egalitarian society through their work in education."},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"The authors of the book, Pedagogies of Resistance, tell a tale about six women educator activists from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

It's a tale recounting how reform was enacted, how it developed and how it evolved to transform schools, districts, government, education, and people. Women stood strong in their beliefs and fought to change the way society treated not only women, but also immigrants and migrant workers.

The book portrays each woman effectively both in their personal life and their professional life. The accounts of the journeys that these women embarked on give us a true picture of what it means to be a progressive education activist in the Progressive Era and today. It also provides today's teachers with true accounts of how to be a maker of change. The women in this book were also forced to confront their own ideas of education and what it means to be a professional and to have a career.In Jane Adams and Ida B. Wells, we meet two women whose work in settlement houses and women's clubs seek to promote a vision of education that was community based and directed toward social equality - an effort that was largely ignored by educational history. Marion Thompson Wright and Elizabeth Almira Allen enlisted others in their work that created a grass roots movement that collectively resisted centralized forms of education and supported a vision of education of social equality. For their work, they received less professional recognition than men in their field did. Their views created controversy and as a result, their personal lives remained scarred.Helen Heffernan and Corinne Seeds were committed to social equality and saw public education as central to that task. For their accomplishments and struggles they have been rewarded by being forgotten, largely due to their gender.From the stories of these women, we truly see how women struggled for a voice and for equality while instituting reform. &quot;In complex and constrained cultural milieus, women have managed to create expressions of feminist agency shaped by their own historical specificity and human particularity.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"In Pedagogies of Resistance, the authors Crocco, Munro, and Weiler take a look at six different women educator activists. The extensive look into the women's lives in and out of education demonstrate how important women were in improving public education then and for educators today. An example of one of these accomplishments, which is discussed on page 58 of the book, would be the statewide pension system. The authors attempt to incorporate important men activists into their book to reveal the willingness of a nation to help women in the profession of education. The authors approach to identifying the men activists takes away from the women's accomplishments. This seems to take the significance from the women and places it on all figures in society. I am not saying that both men and women did not have an influence on education, but, by doing this I feel that the authors have defeated the purpose of their book, women educator activists.If the reader is able to look past some obscuring items, then I believe that they will find the book to be informative and at times uplifting."},{"Title":"Pedagogies of Resistance: Women Educator Activists, 1880-1960 (Athene Series)","review":"This book, at times, provides an interesting look at some of the different experiences and work of women educator activists of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.A broad look at the views and actions of these women reminds one that men weren't the only ones who had an impact on education in the past, and are not the only ones that can affect it in the future. Their struggles with opposition and resistance in their professional lives, as well as the effects that may have been felt in their personal lives, may make one wonder why they stuck to their convictions. With support from others and their involvement with different institutions, some of their actions had lasting effects. However, at times, the names of these people, institutions, and publications that provide concrete examples of, or support for, the women's work are overwhelming and crowd the book.While this book includes issues of race relations and gender that the women encountered, The white architects of black education: Ideology and power in America, 1865-1954 by W.H. Watkins is a nice complement. It discusses the notions, actions, and educational roles of several prominent white, male figures during a similar time period.

M.S. Crocco, P. Munro and K. Weiler. New York and London: Teacher College, 1999. 132 pp.The period in which six extraordinary women educators were very active was a crucial one in the history of the United States. It happened in the preliminary development of feminism: women's club, suffrage and civil rights organization, teachers' associations, settlement houses and the suffrage, which eventually won the vote for white women. The book begins with the time during which women like Jane Addams and Ida B Wells developed their views of education as a wide-ranging endeavor that could be the basis for social change. Within public education, leaders like Elizabeth Almira Allen of New Jersey fought for public school women teachers' right to job security and pensions. Although they were well-educated, reflective, and articulate leaders, Wells and Marion Thompson Wright were constantly placed as both different and inferior because of their gender and race. Pedagogies of Resistance strand them on its key note as women of strength by portraying how they were both empowered by the possibilities of educational careers, but at the same time they were alienated and consistently demeaned, as their authority was continually undercut by their caste status. As for Wright, she also had to face the entrenched sexism of Howard University, where she taught. Crocco, Munro & Weiler, furthermore encompasses how \\"(Corrine) Seed's and (Helen) Heffernan's challenge to the established social order manifested itself not only in their advocacy of progressive and democratic schools of California, but also in their willingness to defend outsiders groups such as the children of migrant farm workers during the Depression or Japanese American children during the World War II relocation.\\"The authors accomplishes their purpose of illuminating and highlighting courageous lives and work of six activist women educators during 1880 to 1960, as educational leaders and professionals. They convey how these women's collective focus and vision of education developed a base for establishing lessons of democracy. Providing all members of society with the same sense of empowerment these six women themselves had found was in sharp contrast to dominant ideas of the elite intellects at the time. \\"Their advance ideas about democracy foreshadowed the arguments of the current multicultural education movement that democracy must be multiple, inclusive, and collective. This was a time of intense conflict over the shape and purpose of education, as radical unions and socialist organizations, intellectuals and teachers and academics influenced Deweyan ideas contested the growing dominance of conceptions of standardization and social efficiency (Crocco, Munro & Weiler, 1999, p.118). These women educators did not just implement other's ideas of progressive education, their contribution and work extended the provincial concept of what progressive education meant in domains not previously considered.In conclusion, the reader will perceive that the book's central theme is set and accomplished with Munro's persuasive stance on page 21. She writes, \\"I contend that these collective efforts at building community were a form of democracy in action. Interactions among academics, women's clubs, and immigrants served an important educational function by providing a mechanism for people of various classes to \`speak together' as a means for widening understanding of different communities and enlarging active involvement in the work of social change (Crocco, Munro & Weiler, 1999).\\" These network and organizations shaped women's culture and identity that was pivotal to America's social and political development. The authors build the book well on this social-political development in the early 20th century as it influenced educational reform and theories of curriculum to rethinking educational history from an alternate perspective."},{"Title":"Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement: Analog Circuit Design with Structural Methodology (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Like many Kluwer books, format is poor and editing non-existant.

At one point, Fresno had the largest population of Armenian people in the United States. Much more than a coffee-table edition of provincial or regional significance, &quot;The Fresno Armenians,&quot; by Berge Bulbulian, is a modern history of Armenians in their former capitol of the New World. Armenians provided a tremendous contribution to the growth and culture of a community reluctant to embrace their arrival, but glad to have the benefit of their participation and labor. Fresno, California became , as a result, the center of agricultural production in the world. A huge array of crops grow on the fertile alluvial plain that rests between the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the coast range of California, with much thanks to the efforts of Armenians. To gain the distinction of the &quot;Breadbasket of the World,&quot; the valley needed ingenuity, sweat and toil of the Diaspora immigrants to change the desert landscape into a garden that would rival ancient Mesopotamia. Among the earliest immigrants to Fresno, Armenians were directed to California by the Christian missionaries who infiltrated their homeland, splitting their ancient church in two. In Fresno, Armenians found a dusty village on the train tracks in the barren wastes of the Central Valley, and would have left immediately, save for one-way train tickets. The first Armenian arrivals established an outpost for others facing persecutions and slaughter by the pre-Ottoman Turks in the 1890's. Realizing what the future foretold at home, and in search of security and freedom, many found their way to the eastern United States. Armenians leaving the homeland were educated, prosperous professionals, craftspersons, merchants and city-dwellers. They found work in the factories of the East Coast and industrial belts of the U.S. Letters from Fresno provoked many to leave and join their brethern in the west to mold the possibilities of an undeveloped territory. One of the most comforting of the otherwise disconcerting arrangements for the immigrants in early Fresno was the climate and soil, much like the weather and land they were accustomed to in the Middle-East. Shortly after the turn of the previous century, Armenians became the largest minority population in Fresno. &quot;The Fresno Armenians&quot; describes a remarkable history of a determined people driven by massacre and religious hatred from their 3,000 year old home in the Caucus Mountains and fecund plains of eastern Cilicia. In the San Joaquin Valley, Armenians became pioneers of agriculture very soon after their arrival. Through determined efforts of perserverance, they became leaders in business, religion, education and governement, prevailing in a difficult time of virulent discrimination. Presented in chronological order, &quot;The Fresno Armenians&quot; begins with a brief history of the nation before emigration. Suffering through centuries of foriegn domination and persecutions, the real end for Armenia came when the Ottoman Turkish government, between 1915 and 1923, annihilated 1.5 million innocent Armenian people. Many of the far-sighted had already established themselves in Fresno. Maintaining balance in a history like that of &quot;The Fresno Armenians&quot; is difficult at best, but successfully achieved in this study. The book sings loud praise to the successes of the Armenian community. But then again, the Armenians brought good business sense, decorum and cultivated civility to an otherwise wild-west railroad town. &quot;The Fresno Armenians&quot; details the number of Armenian arrests, crimes, divorces in the community, but does not provide scintillating details about the sensationl crimes, like Mark Arax's, &quot;In My Father's Name.&quot; What little dark underside that existed in the Armenian community is overlooked. Nevertheless, Armenians have caused Fresno, the city and it's people, to rise to the heights of the immigrant's rich history, determination and craftsmanship and the whole of thecountryside has benefitted. The book is a compendium of the Armenian's great efforts and individuals in Fresno and the surrounding area, and contains all the details."},{"Title":"What's the Difference?: A Compendium of Commonly Confused and Misused Words","review":"This book covers many commonly confused words and attempts to explain their differences in usage. It covers subtle distinctions between words such as nude and naked, even though a person is not likely to misuse them out of confusion. It also covers not-so-subtle distinctions between commonly confused words such as murder and manslaughter.The problem is that for a book that's supposed to be about shades of differences, the author makes many errors that might show up in somebody else's book on the same subject. For example, rather than having an entry on the proper use of comprised and composed he uses comprised when he means composed.The section on religion shows a complete lack of research on his part. He uses the term \\"Judeo-Christian\\" as if the two religions were identical, and gives completely wrong explanations for some concepts. In that section, he describes a series of concepts that differ significantly between Judaism and Christianity, yet he describes only the Christian concept and calls it the \\"Judeo-Christian\\" concept. For a book that is supposed to clarify concepts, it actually does the opposite. It presents the Christian concept of a devil as a Jewish one, even though Judaism does not have a concept of a literal devil. It explains that Muslims do not see others as worshiping the same God. In reality, while it's true that many Muslims see Christians as polytheistic, others don't, and Muslims generally recognize Jews as followers of the same God. He applies the Christian belief in eternal damnation of non-believers to all other religions, while other religions do not necessarily have such a concept. For example, Judaism has no concept of eternal damnation or a literal separate place called hell, and simply does not hold that people of other religions are automatically excluded from their place in the world to come. In fact, it holds the opposite. Righteous people of other beliefs are equally worthy, and the concept dates back to the earliest parts of Judaism.As a whole, the book covers many distinctions quite well. The problem is that there is no way of telling from reading the book whether you are learning another level of information, learning distinctions with no real life merit (or that even dictionaries don't make) or are actually learning complete misinformation.The book does make an interesting read, but I would not take any of its points at face value. If you find an interesting point that you did not know, you had better look it up elsewhere before you decide it's correct."},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"In this orderly collection of autobiographical sketches Edith Wharton - generously and with nearly photographic recall - begins by inviting readers into her early life in nineteenth-century New York. We are treated to its cast of characters, old New York, country life up the Hudson River, the clothes, the houses, and the remarkable (and unremarkable) personalities - Washington Irving was a friend of the family - as well as the sensibilities of a sociable, bright, and wonderfully observant little girl.Edith began to read so early that it surprised her upper-class (but unintellectual) family. Before long she became an &quot;omnivorous reader,&quot; happiest plowing through the volumes of the classics in her father's library. She soon found that she required time alone - to invent characters, to make up stories. She knew that she had to write fiction - from childhood on, despite realizing by young adulthood that &quot;in the eyes of our provincial society authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a form of manual labor.&quot; Of the social imperative to closet one's writing urges she elaborates: &quot;My father and mother were only one generation away from Sir Walter Scott, who thought it necessary to drape his literary identity in countless clumsy subterfuges, and almost contemporary with the Brontes, who shrank in agony from being suspected of successful novel-writing.&quot; The idle rich, Wharton makes clear, were intended to stay idle - and not busy themselves with writing, especially for (horrors!) pay. Her descriptions of her early popular successes are memorable.In subsequent chapters Wharton lays out her well-thought-out opinions regarding childhood, self-discovery, the formation of the writer's imagination and intellect, and the importance of finding one's own way - as an intellectual and as a social being. There is dry humor, too. She treasured good literature and good conversation - and pursued (and found) them throughout her life. She loved beautiful things and places, too. Finally, she describes her sojourns abroad (mainly England, France, and Italy) and the relationships and places that sustained her and nurtured her creativity, her productivity - and her soul.Lifelong friends play a central role in much of this memoir. She describes people well, without breaches of privacy or confidences. This is not at all limiting. She writes tenderly of the blossoming of her friendship with &quot;American gentleman&quot; Egerton Winthrop, a man of &quot;cultivated intelligence,&quot; a shy, physically awkward man whom Wharton considered &quot;the most perfect of friends.&quot; Others were George Cabot Lee, Vernon Lee, Howard Sturgis, Geoffrey Scott, Percy Lubbock, and most of all, Henry James, who is drawn wonderfully (and not uncritically) in this book. Of her friendship with James she remarks &quot;The real marriage of two minds is for any two people to possess a sense of humor or irony pitched in exactly the same key, so that their joint glances at any subject cross like interarching search-lights.&quot;I loved this memoir, and greatly admired Wharton's ability to reveal herself and her world so fully and well."},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"Such a lovely child, so patient and well behaved. New York and its society are made magic by her eyes. The opening sections of this memoir are a delight as Mrs. Wharton recounts the sights and feel of New York City in the 1870's. I liked it that she gave us a knee-high view of taking a walk with her beloved father and meeting his friends along the way. (She could never tell what the people's faces looked like, as her view only extended to their knees). Her total recall of her very best bonnet is amazing, and a very pretty bonnet it must have been.If there is such a person as a \\"born writer,\\" Edith Wharton is that person. Before she could write, she made stories, and situations \\"flew around her head like mosquitoes.\\" The world she lived in had no place or interest in a writing lady, so she made her own world, and it was a life-long undertaking.When Mrs. Wharton received her first acceptance of publication, she was so excited she \\"ran up and down the staircase in glee.\\" I couldn't have been more surprised if I had read that George Washington played kickball in the back yard. Mrs. Wharton rarely lets you see anything but a very reserved and proper Victorian lady. Yet she did get a divorce (though it is never mentioned.), she lived almost her entire adult life abroad; she compartmentalized her friends like a butterfly collector, and had no interest in being part of the New York society she describes so well. When she was well into her writing career on a family visit to New York, she was invited to a dinner party where she was told a \\"Bohemian\\" would be one of the guests. When she got there, she discovered that she herself was the \\"Bohemian\\" in question.The book has a wonderful introduction by that fine author of New York manners, Louis Auchincloss, who is obviously fond of Mrs. Wharton, but not intimidated. Mrs. Wharton has a couple of insightful (and often hilarious) chapters on Henry James that are alone worth the price of the book. But then there are the \\"friends.\\" I felt I was being buried in endless pages of formal introductions to people I had never heard of, who wrote books that were never read, who gave parties which are long forgotten, and men who were great conversationalists according to Mrs. Wharton, though the witticisms she quoted were so arch and refined, I felt they belonged in bad drawing room comedy.The book reads well, except for the stretches of introductions. Mrs. Wharton firmly believes that if you can't speak well of someone, you shouldn't speak of him or her at all. Not a bad idea at that"},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"Edith Wharton wrote &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (I believe it won the Pulitzer), the only fiction she wrote that I have truly liked--and an excellent book. She also wrote much nonfiction, and I have enjoyed her travel writing very much.In this book, Ms. Wharton reflects on her childhood and adulthood to middle age. (A short biography of her life is included in the introduction by Louis Auchincloss.) She speaks of her parents and growing up in 'Old New York' and living on the Gold Coast of New England with her husband.Ms. Wharton was a great friend of several men of letters who were prominent during her era, including Henry James. Her writing describes these relationships in part. She may have had an affair with one of them (not James), but unlike writers of today, more is not said than said. Mrs. Wharton divorced her husband in an era when it was not the best thing to do if one wished to remain a member of high society. She seems to have cast off New York society and moved to France to live permantly after her divorce. If you're interested in the story behind the story in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; this book is a good resource.In addition to her early years in America and later years in France, this book covers some of Ms. Wharton's travels in France and the Mediterranean. The most evocative sections cover her experiences in a trip to the French front in WWI. During WWI, she became a reporter and sent information to a New York newspaper on a regular basis."},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"This autobiography which really gives a feel for the times in, which Wharton lived as well as for her own life experiences, contains some the most stunningly succinct annecdotes I've ever read. Wharton is truly brilliant at conveying the importance of literature in her life and sharing the possibilities of the literary life with her reader. She reaches through time to inform us of universals and redefine our value systems without being the least bit pedantic. She is a genius. And her autobiography is as entertaining and resonant as a great novel."},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"If you like autobiographies or memoirs by literate, intriguing, strong women, you should enjoy this one by Edith Wharton. She was born in 1862. Her father was a Jones, the family that inspired the \\"keeping up with the Jones's' expression. She had a privileged childhood living in New York City, traveling in Europe for 5 years between the ages of 4 and 9 years of old, and spending summers in Newport. She was friends with Teddy Roosevelt. Her ancestors mingled with the founding members of America so it's fun to read about her family stories.As a published writer, Wharton wrote novels, short stories and non-fiction and was one of the first American writers on interior design. Her 1897 book THE DECORATION OF HOUSES is considered a classic in the field of interior design. She is one of America's first interior designers. In 1905 her novel, HOUSE OF MIRTH, was the best-selling book for the year. Her novel THE AGE OF INNOCENCE earned the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. She is the first woman writer to receive the Pulitzer award and she also received an honorary doctorate from Yale.Living overseas in France as an adult, Wharton met a mix of fascinating people who populate this book. Her friendship with Henry James, and insights on the man, is worth reading this autobiography alone for. When James died, Wharton wrote: \\"We who knew him well know how great he would have been if he had never written a line.\\"If you like examining an era through the lens of one person's life and perspective, this is like time-travel back to the gilded age and the early years of the 20th century. Wharton died in France in 1937. Her autobiography doesn't include all of the elements of her life: a divorce and love affairs. It's said that what was left out is as interesting as what Wharton chose to include. Writers then were more discreet and genteel about personal affairs, but her cosmopolitan and cultured glance is not provincial.What is fascinating about Wharton, is that although many of her heroines in her novels were passive and tragic (Lily Bart, for example in HOUSE OF MIRTH who eventually commits suicide because of the lack of options for women who were dependent on men), Wharton herself was proactive and positive about creating a fulfilling life for herself. Perhaps it was her family fortune and monies from writing which enabled her options which her heroines didn't have. Their lot which was more usual for women of that era which Wharton was trying to highlight in her novels.This is one of my favorite autobiographies, almost novel-like, and would be a fascinating and literate selection for a book club discussion. It would be enlightening to take a class based upon the autobiographies of women writers and artists and compare and contrast influences and inspiration among them."},{"Title":"BACKWARD GLANCE (Scribner Library of Contemporary Classics)","review":"Just a great book on Edith...I collect books about Wharton and this is wonderful. to add to my collection.

I had to keep reading to find the answer, and I'm glad that I did. The ending was a surprise too. I don't want to be a spoiler, so just read this novel!I would fault Andrew Klavan, however, for killing off one of the secondary characters late in the story. That was unnecessary, and in a way broke trust with the reader. We don't care how many good guys are killed to further the plot, but that character could have been badly wounded. Also, the ending should have been very clear. As a reader, I hate it when things are not totally and absolutely wrapped up (it was, but I wish he had written another half page).Nevertheless, I highly recommend this forgotten thriller.If you like this strange plot of someone going to work and nobody recognizing them, then also read \\"The Trader,\\" by Charles DeLint.

All the characters in the book seemed real and were very memorable. I'm somewhat confused by some of the other reviews here and I'm glad I didn't read them first.

From the right way to go about philanthropy, to forging a solid moral idenity, the importance of the Golden Rule, and much more, The Moral Advantage is recommended supplementary reading material for every business owner and manager."},{"Title":"The Moral Advantage: How to Succeed in Business by Doing the Right Thing","review":"The subject of this book is how to develop a unity of purpose that melds \\"the desire to excel, to accomplish something important, and to act in a decent and responsible way.\\" The author calls this \\"the moral advantage.\\" Based on 48 interviews with successful executives, Damon identifies the key strategies of a moral approach to business and shows how these can lead to both personal and financial success. Damon's focus is on the morality shared by people of goodwill who act decently, live honorably, care for others, and are fair, honest, and responsible. The moral advantage is further defined as \\"a positive way of thinking about morality that transforms both the worker and the work, a powerful force that can propel people toward their own goals while at the same time generating great benefits for society.\\" The author builds a four-dimensional concept of morality in business and presents a discussion of people whose careers in business exemplify the moral advantage. Damon concludes the book with ten principles distilled from his research. The book presents a refreshing and inspiring value-based framework for understanding business and personal success."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"This small book actually began with 10 lectures given by Robert Johnson at an Episcopal Church. Thus they are concise and do not offer a broad array of examples. I found the book to be excellent and found it much more to the point that Emma Jung's long study of the Holy Grail myth in all it permutations.Of course, as a Jungian, Johnson sees mythology as reflecting underlying psychological and spiritual processes that take place in the human psyche. These myths are spontaneous images from the unconscious and contain both psychological and spiritual truths. Myths allow the interaction of archetypes, which are patterns of life that are universally true for humans. Myths are to mankind as dreams are to an individual. Therefore a dream shows the dreamer a truth about themselves whereas the myth shows mankind a truth that applies to all of us.Individuation is a process that Jung describes as a life long movement toward wholeness and completion. It involves the life long expansion of consciousness and the ability of the conscious ego or personality to reflect the total self. One interpretation of Jesus Christ is that of a man who has been able to allow the unconscious to fill up the self and be always present in the personality. Because God the Father moves through and emerges in the world through the human unconsious, Christ may say that he and the Father are one.A primary first step in the individuation process is the confrontation with the Shadow. Actually the confrontation with various aspects of the Shadow continue throughout a lifetime, but the first encounter is usually of great psychological power. The negative repressed side of the personality, that longs for acceptance and integration, continually follows the ego until the strength is mustered to face the shadow, accept the shadow, and then integrate the shadow into the personality which increases the energy and strength of the personality/psyche because energy is no longer used to suppress the shadow.After the shadow is integrated, many people then may develop to the point where they can integrate the anima/animus, which is the characteristics of the opposite sex into their more complete psyche. It is here that Johnson points out the Parsifal and quest for the Holy Grail is in fact a myth of the male reconciliatoin with the anima who becomes a guide and leads him to the Grail.Here Emma Jung and Robert Johnson would have slightly different interpretations of the Holy Grail myth. Whereas both see the anima as being essential to reaching the Grail, Johnson believes the integration of the feminine, the Anima, is a major and tricky task for young men. Also, whereas Emma Jung saw the grail as serving mankind as an expanded consciousness through which much psychic material may now flow; Johnson sees that the grail serves mankind through and expanded consciousness but also serves God because it is through this expanded consciousness that God flows into human interactions and becomes real and active in the world. This is a philosophical and theological issue of great importance. The first question is: Is God an active participant in the world and in the lives of men? Johnson goes beyond Deism, which would acknowledge God acting through nature, and would assert that God acts through the unconscious of mankind and it is through expanded and integrated consciousness that God becomes real in the world of men. Thus the Grail, the symbol of the accessible unconscious, serves man and God. This is the key to both Emma Jung's and Robert Johnson's work. She would emphasize that the Grail serves man and Johnson would emphasize that the Grail serves God, but both would acknowledge that the Grail serves both. This is the point of Johnson's book but he takes you down many fruitful trails to reach this point. I will point out some of these paths:The Fisher King has wounds so severe that he cannot live, yet he is incapable of dying. The kingdom is dependent on the virility and power of its rule. As an adolescent, the Fisher King is burned on the fingers when he tries to eat hot broiled Salmon. He touches the divine part of his own unconscious but it is too hot for his consciousness to handle. He touches his individuation but can not hold it. His life becomes barren, his wound never heals, and he can not cure himself even though he and the Grail are in the same castle. The fool must come to cure the king.Parsifal is the holy fool, the innocent, who emerges from the forrest nieve and full of creative possibilities. He is entraced by the knights and longs to become one. He must break with his poor heartbroken mother, Heartsorrow, on his journey to be a man. All men must be somewhat disloyal to their mother on the path to manhood and toward individuation. His first quest is to fight the Red Knight and gain his armour. He kills the Red Knight and thus takes on masculine power, courage and virility. However when he gets on the Red Knights' horse, he can't steer or stop it but must let it run its course. This is the symbol of a young man's first forray into the world of power where forces can be let loose which no one can control. Johnson points out that a boy gets his red Knight armour by taking it from someone else. This is the way of young male competetion. But a man must not carry the young male competitiveness throughout life, he must move beyond the Red Knight. A young male moves beyond the red Knight when he learns to master his own aggression. So every young man must defeat the Red Knight, take on the armour of power, aggression, virility, strength, courage, but must also not let these attributes consume the entire psyche. Parsifal gets a mentor, Gournamond, who teaches him chivalry and the skills of knighthood. He also tell Parsifal that he must seek the HolY Grail, the ture vocation of all knights, that he must not seduce or be seduced by a woman, and that he must ask \\"Whom does the Grail serve?\\" at the right moment in the castle of the Fisher King.There are many women in the story who play various aspects of the Anima, but it is White Flower and the Ugly Hag who play critical roles as the positive and negative anima, each with a part to play.The book ends with a really good explanation of why the Holy Grail serves the Grail King (God) and also serves Parsifal. Parsifal asks the question and the Fisher King is healed immediately, he becomes whole. But God now has a path, a window, into the world of Man and thus the Grail ultimately served God's purposes. Even though this interpretation of the Holy Grail story is more Christian in interpretation than that of Emma Jung, both are fantastic and insightful reading."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"A very pleasant and quite interesting little book analyzing the story of parsifal and the castle of the grail through the lens of male psychology.Though it's treatment of the mythological story seems quite conscise it seems to fail to really bind this and it's psychological interpretations to any tangible real world experience of my male psyche. In a way it is to abstract, not tying things back to reality.Thus it offered so far (finished it a few hours ago) no real insights or answers. How many questions and different ways to look at things and approaches to take as well as those experiences of catching your inner world tricking you it will induce will have to be seen.All in all at 80 pages and it's small format a very pleasant and worthwile read.A note about another reviewer's complaint about it being heavy on preachy christianism. I am normally quite allergic to christian preachyness in 'unrelated' books like these.

Why, then, the four gold stars?Because it reveals every man's story: through the retelling of the deeply symbolic Grail Legend, it unmasks many of the landmark trials in man's psychological development, and it does so in an unassuming way.Some of the trials Mr. Johnson addresses are:1) The Fisher King Wound - that happy fall that casts him out of his \\"ignorant paradise\\" into duality and starts him on the arduous path toward redemption and wholeness.2) The healing function of the Inner Fool (the childlike unconscious)3) The Red Knight killing (overcoming the Shadow and using its power for strength)4) The poison of the Mother Garment (overcoming the mother complex)5) Learning from the Godfather (furthering one's masculine development)6) The mother death (the necessary separation from the mother in the transition from boy to man)7) Blanche Fleur (the Anima, or internal feminine motivator) and her danger8) The Hideous Damsel (Doubt, Hatred) that motivates a new grail search9) Consulting the Old Hermit (our wise, introverted aspect within that leads us toward the Grail)10) The true meaning of the GrailI saw myself on every page and had many awakenings about my identity, about masculinity, even about the development of western civilization.The writing at times may be muddled, but this book is a rich and momentous journey which will help you on your own."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"\\"He\\" is a book that takes the mythological tale of the Fisher King, and parallels it with stages and traits of the modern male psyche. Granted the book is a slim one with only about 80 pages, but it's something you can read over and over. There are so many characters and parts to the classic tale that it's easy to go beyond the meanings and modern examples that the author gives along the way. After you read it once, I suggest reading it again while sitting down and making notes on the characters and basic outline of the central myth. It's an insightful read no matter what state you feel your life is in right now.Not too long ago I saw the movie \\"The Fisher King\\" (Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges) for the first time. I wouldn't have understood half of what was going on if it wasn't for this book. As the author even explains, there are different variations to the story, and the movie doesn't match up 100% to the book. But after you read the book, it might be fun to rent the movie to see another example of the symbols manifested in modern times.Although the Fisher King story itself deals with the Holy Grail myth, the lessons and over all message are actually quite secular. The author draws a few religious parallels, but they didn't distract from the main lessons that the myth teaches. And believe me, I'm talking as a guy who's the furthest from being god-fearing or even a philanthropist.With so many books on feminism, countless commercials and sitcoms that constantly use the male as the butt of jokes, and universities that even offer \\"Women's Studies\\" majors, it's refreshing to find a book that looks into male behavior without being guilt-ridden and self-defeating about it."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"In &quot;HE&quot;, Robert Johnson, relates the myth of the Fisher King, and explains the age-old psychology of masculinity in both men and women.

There is a risk that one tries to find an easy, stright forward matching between him and his stages of life with &quot;parsifal&quot;. The book is very concise.

Again and again, I was fascinated but bewildered. If Johnson had given us just a few more examples of how the archetype of Parsifal is reflected in the lives of real men, this book could change lives.As it was, I was as much frustrated as I was intrigued. If I had not already done a little work with archetypes and psychological rituals, I would have been totally baffled.Johnson's &quot;Owning Your Own Shadow&quot; is far more comprehensible and valuable, at least to me. Also, his &quot;Inner Work&quot; is almost all practical suggestions for work on oneself, and very good."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"I have studied this book with a group, and have found it a very tedious study.

Understanding we cannot find or pursue happiness. We simply choose happiness by living in the \\"happening.\\" Something we've all been told, but a concept that does not easily sink in without meditating on it. This book is just that meditation.The one inconsistency in this book is its occasional spattering of religiosity. I find it odd how the author relates jungian theory and then religiosity. It takes away from the focus of the story and muddles the reader's focus. It gives a feeling of inconsistency, almost as though added in after the fact to please someone's whims. The jungian theory goes side by side with the main concept of the book, the religiosity only serves to distract, thus weakening the message.In summary if you can manage to ignore these blips, you will gain a valuable perspective on life."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"I rated He with 3 stars because it was undoubtably an interesting and very thought provoking book, but it failed on some key aspects. One, being that it rooted psychological analyzation to an opinionated base and was not believable due to the recurring statistic used being \\"every man\\". Also, it did not include enough examples referring to what exactly the author was trying to say, therefore some of his ideas resulted in, at some points, simply ambiguous statements. Johnson also seemed to dance in circles with the French version of La Morte D'Arthur, and heavily drift from his main ideas, leaving the reader with an understanding of the story, and only a basic understanding of what the book was supposed to be about...understanding masculine psychology.I must say though, the points he hit, he really nailed, all except for the representation of the Grail. I do not agree that happiness can only be reached through a contribution to religion or society as a whole. His idea of happiness through being contempt with one's self is accurate, but his relating psychology to religion is very unnecessary, and very inaccurate to those who do not hold religion close to them. Lastly, I think that if a person is writing anything at all, to really write it, and not summerize their thoughts through symbolism in a myth, or by quoting another author to the point of distastefulness. I expected to read more about psychology and less about the unattractive story he related the entire work to.-Watts"},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"After reading this book for a project in AP Psychology, I found that Robert Johnson's much-vaunted connections between mythology and the psychology of men are ultimately incoherent and insubstantial. The underlying concepts may be reasonable, if difficult to follow, but Johnson fails to achieve a solid connection between said concepts and his metaphorical writing. His writing style relies heavily on excessive repetition and oversimplified platitudes which insult the reader's ability to comprehend basic metaphor, and his constant implication that Christianity is an absolutely essential element of all masculine psychology is deeply offensive. Carl Jung has written numerous works on this same subject which are more intelligible and avoid the incomprehensible web of mythological allusions Johnson uses which bewilder and alienate the reader. In brief, Robert Johnson's 'He' is a waste of trees and effort.1 out of 5 stars because Amazon does not offer the option to assign 0."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"The Arthurian legend, the quest for the Holy Grail, and particularly that of the Knight Parsifal, illustrate the patterns of male psychology, the journey we go through, the twists and turns we must experience before we get where we are going.As you read this book, you learn through understanding its implications for you, and how it resonates with your journey.

However, I will admit I was surprised to see this one was so short and wondered at the reading. I was not disappointed.Johnson chooses a more religiously-neutral myth - in this case, that of Parsifal - over the Christ myth, so that more men will be able to not only gain insight and interest, but come to conclusions with a fresh outlook. Parsifal is oft-neglected, after all.The myth of Parsifal shows men how to internalize the mythic adventure so that the potential for self-realization outlasts the actual experience. The existential crisis is very particular for men. If you can remember that experience you will be able to re-embark and continue the quest for the fountain of creativity and the balance that comes from the anima, the feminine aspect of the psyche. It's not necessary to save the world or find ultimate happiness; in fact, the inner world is just as important if not more so, as it is the lenses which we use to perceive and relate to the outer world and loved ones.This falls into the genres of Jungian psychology and comparative mythology and goes well with Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"As a 30 year old male this is one of the simplest and best self-help books I've read.Not that its a problem but a lot of other self help is steeped within the traditions of Eastern thought and systems, Johnson addresses it all as a Westerner, with the intelligence and understanding of metaphor, insight and experience.I can't recommend this highly enough for men and women in the west of all social, religious, sexual and political persuasions; relevant for all."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"I found this very brief book quite provocative. Some of the myth's metaphors are well-explained while others are only mentioned in passing.

It is still reverberating in me and certainly has stirred up my inner masculine Self."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"I found this book to be very interesting. It goes into great detail about the symbolism of the story of the Grail, and Johnson shows you how you can use mythology to relate to your own inner experience. That being said, I thought that there were not enough example of how certain things play out in everyday life. I was hoping that he would say how a man shows his mother complex, or how the father archetype shows itself in man's development. (Ironically, there is no mention of the father archetype at all!) The analysis basically boils down to a man needing to understand his feminine side, which I have frankly heard enough of in my psychoanalytic studies. I do believe it is important, and I would dread life without being in touch with the feminine, but why can't Jungian psychology move on? Why is there so little talk about the father? Why is it that every book I pick up tells me that I need to be in touch with my anima? I get the picture.In addition, Johnson mentions that the masculine search within ends with a higher understanding of the self, but he ends rather abruptly. I wish that there was more about the mysteries of the self, and how the masculine enhances the self, but there is no such discussion.If you think about this book enough, you will see that it is lacking very much, and it is better as a primer about the story of the Grail than it is about masculinity and the struggles of men today. It still has strong interpretive value, and it teaches us things to look for in mythology. So I would still recomend it for anyone."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"This was an interesting read, but I recommend going to straight to the source."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"Johnson's use of mythology and retelling the myths I find exciting, simple and understandable.

It would seem that the most enduring of them are likely so powerful because they tap into some elemental truth of our humanness. If so, a deep reading of the story should illuminate ourselves.This is what Robert Johnson achieves in He: Understanding Masculine Psychology, a deconstruction and interpretation of the Grail story. Johnson, a psychologist with Jungian training interprets the tale of Parsifal's departure from his mother, arrival at Arthur's court, and search for the Grail.The Arthurian legends comprise a body of stories with multiple variations. The tales focus variously upon Arthur, the nave knight, Parsifal (Percival), other knights, mentors, the ailing Fisher King, Queen Guenevere, other damsels and loathsome ladies. Johnson uses the French version, penned as an epic poem by Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, in the 12th century because it is the oldest. Being the oldest version, it is simpler, more direct, and closer to the subconscious.As we follow Parsival through his adventures Johnson interprets them as life transitions for men. In the process we discover antecedents to Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars trilogy, and Harry Potter. At the end we understand that chasing happiness is ephemeral and true meaning and wholeness can only be attained through service to others.To get us there, I have a worry about the fidelity of Johnson's retelling of the story, the origins of which are lost in the mists of time.My leadership story here:Turn the Ship Around!: How to Create Leadership at Every Level"},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"ive been interested in mythology since i was a kid but this is the first time, in my experience, that ive been able to apply the symbols of a myth to my own life. i think this is a great book for a man of any age. its been very useful to understand some of the masculine forces that are at work within and gives great explainations for why these forces urge us to make the decisions in life that we do. i think reading this book will help men so that they dont have to re-invent the wheel in there own life. not to mention that the grail myth is a great story in itself."},{"Title":"He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)","review":"Robert A.

But the same honesty which made the book so controversial is also what makes it so valuable. Leudemann decided to write this book because he was dissatisfied with so much of what he read, and therefore the book is a comprehensive treatment of the resurrection. He systematically surveys all of the passages in the New Testament which pertain to the Resurrection, beginning with 1 Corinthians 15 and ending with the last chapter of John. In each instance, Leudemann writes like a sober historian, carefully considering each passage from a redactional, traditional, and critical historical perspective. Leudemann argues that the tomb stories are late--Jesus may have received a dishonorable burial--and likewise the appearance stories are largely legendary. But *something* did happen. Leudemann skillfully extracts as much information as possible about that something from Paul's often cryptic statements, in order to formulate his own hypothesis as to how Christianity began. Whether one one agrees, disagrees, or suspends judgment about Leudemann's hypothesis, all serious students of the Resurrection narratives will want to be familiar with this important book. My only complaint about the book is the lack of a bibliography and detailed indices (e.g., NT verses, subject, author)."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Jesus","review":"For some time now Ludemann has been wrestling with the idea of how to understand Christian faith in light of our knowledge of history and since the publication of this book his views have changed.When this book was published, Ludemann believed one could still remain a Christian even while denying Christ's resurrection. But in the book, Jesus' Resurrection: Fact or Figment (which was adapted from a debate between Ludemann and William Lane Craig), Ludemann makes it clear he no longer holds this position. In my opinion, Ludemann is correct that Christianity should collapse if Jesus did not rise from the dead.But as far as the main point at hand--whether Jesus did, in fact, rise from the dead--Ludemann today holds very much the same position he did when this book was written, viz., Jesus did not rise from the dead. In his denial of the resurrection, though, his case is very mistaken.One of Ludemann's weakest points comes right at the beginning of the book. Ludemann states that miracles \\"cannot be the object of scientific historical work.....David Hume already demonstrated that a miracle is defined in such a way that no testimony is sufficient to establish it\\" (p. 12).Unfortunately, there is no elaboration or defense of Hume here as many philosophers have critically examined Hume's arguments only to demolish them. So it doesn't serve Ludemann's purposes well to make such a hasty remark.The fact is, Hume's assertion begs the question. The only way one could determine that no testimony is sufficient to prove a miracle is to already believe that miracles cannot exist. Ludemann's reliance on such a fallacious claim without any interaction with the countless number of critical reviews Hume has received misleads the uninformed reader.When we get to specific evidences concerning the resurrection of Jesus, Ludemann's case is similarly troubled. According to Ludemann the early church could not have known where Joseph of Arimathea's tomb was located because \\"it can be presupposed that had Jesus' tomb been known, the early Christians would have venerated it and traditions about it would have been preserved\\" (p. 45). Not only does Ludemann not state why this can be presupposed but now it is he who is begging the question.Ludemann's point begs the question in that it would only be true if Jesus did not rise from the dead. If Jesus' body still laid in the tomb then, yes, veneration would be expected. But if Jesus did rise from the dead, why must one presuppose this?The only significance a tomb in which a holy man is buried possesses is that it holds the remains of a holy man. But if the remains are not in the tomb, what do we make of the tomb other than a hole in the ground? There would simply be no reason to venerate a hole in the ground. If Christ rose from the dead, the tomb would have been conquered and, more importantly, utterly irrelevant. Thus, ironically, given the resurrection, we would expect the lack of veneration of Christ's tomb and this fact seems to support the exact opposite conclusion which Ludemann holds!In discussing 1 Corinthians 15:3-10, Ludemann makes one of the most remarkable statements in the entire book. He states, \\"We can assume that all the elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus\\" (p. 38). This tradition includes Christ's death for our sins, his burial, his resurrection on the third day, and that he appeared to Peter, then the Twelve, his appearance to more than 500 people at once, his appearance to James and all the apostles, and his appearance to Paul.So we are expected to believe that, within the small span of two years, these elements completely destroyed the truth. Consider that A.N. Sherwin-White of Oxford researched how long it took a legend to completely erase the truth in the Ancient Near-East and not even two full generations were enough time! Furthermore, when you consider that for other secular ancient writings several hundred years divide our first present copy with the original. But, as Ludemann admits, this is simply two years. However, by the above standard, two years is a historical blip!This is why the scholar Gary Habermas has concluded that there are minimal facts of Jesus' resurrection which cannot be denied, but once these minimal facts are accepted there is no better explanation for them than Christ rose from the dead.Having said all this I have found Ludemann to be an honest scholar and would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know the basic arguments brought forth against the resurrection. But if you do decide to read this I would also recommend reading Doug Geivett's and Gary Habermas's In Defense of Miracles. Many of Ludemann's objections are answered in this book.Perhaps the best book I can recommend if you are interested in Ludemann's book is the one I mentioned toward the beginning of the review (Jesus Resurrection: Fact or Fiction). This debate between Ludemann and Craig was very insightful on the topic of Christ's resurrection and should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Jesus","review":"Luedemann's work is fair to middling, at best.This tome is something of an aporetic description of what &quot;must have happened&quot; in place of the traditional description of the rise of the Christian faith.Paul was really a nice guy, but felt like he couldn't be that way until he was around Christians (who he felt guilty for persecuting), so his brain cooked up an image of a dead guy who he'd never met who made him feel all warm and fuzzy (and psychosomatically blind for a while). He decided then that the image he saw was none other than the Son of God, the Resurrected Messiah. This explanation works as long as you believe that Paul was insane. We have no other evidence to support that thesis, though.Peter was just another disciple of Jesus who ran off when he was arrested. He felt so guilty about Jesus' death, however, that his brain cooked up a vision of his dead teacher which inspired him to found the church at Jerusalem. He ended up fighting with James who also felt guilty so (can you see a pattern here?)his brain cooked up an image of his dead brother.Pentecost? The appearance to 500 mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15? Luedemann kills two birds with one stone here. Both legends are based on one common group hallucination in which people had a really good time and felt like Jesus was there with them, kind of like if they had played a live version of &quot;Truckin'&quot; at Jerry Garcia's funeral.Luedemann claims to be an historian. He is not. Rather, he is a speculator.He claims that depth psychology can be of use to biblical interpreters. Psychology is far too amorphous and unreliable for historical interpretation. Here's why:Herr Luedemann could sit across the table from me and ask me as many questions as he would like about whatever topic he felt needed his attention, and he would never have the slightest idea of what was going on in my mind, except through the matrix of whatever the latest in psychology could theorize.Now, let me write down something that may take a few hours to compose and wait two millenia, then let him say what was going on in my head. Good luck, Gerd.His book fails because his methodology and tools are flawed and, in the end, it takes less faith to believe that Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead than it does to believe that Jungian psychology can accurately interpret the human mind."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Jesus","review":"Although, Professor Luedemann is obviously learned, and has done much thought on the subjects of early Christian origins and the resurrection specifically his ideas do not hold up under any sizable scrutiny.From the very beginning it is easy to tell Luedemann believes the church has not been interested in the truth in its pursuits of spirituality. So he writes, \\"this book is specifically not written with a view to its results being useful for the church; its main aim is to investigate the historical truth.\\" Because of this we must look to Prof. Luedemann to tell us what the church was not honest enough, or curious enough, to find out. Unfortunately, for Luedemann his analysis is wrong. The church has done very careful study of the issue of the resurrection, and truth was their main concern. As Paul writes in 1 Cor 15, the truth/reality of the resurrection is of utmost importance to the church, because without a TRUE, HISTORICAL resurrection there is no Christianity. The whole religion is based on the FACT of the resurrection, and if it is not true then to be a Christian is worthless.In regards to Luedemann's arguments I can mention a few. First, he argues the New Testament (specifically the parts which refer to the bodily resurrection) is dated late. This is quite mistaken. In regards to standards of judging the accuracy and reliability of documents of antiquity, the NT is very, very early. In fact, Luedemann contradicts himself when he concedes 1 Cor 15 to be dated very early. To see a popular treatment on this you might want to pick up Lee Strobel's The Case for the Real Jesus. If you would like a much harder work to really delve into on this issue see NT Wright's The Resurrection of the Son of God.Another angle Luedemann takes is to systematically discredit the eyewitnesses who claimed to see Jesus alive after his death and burial. Unfortunately, this is one of his weakest points. There is no reason to disbelieve the accounts of the eyewitnesses. Luedemann's main tact here is to take some form of naturalistic explanation for all of these accounts. However, naturalistic interpretations do not fit the facts. For Example, Luedemann cites group hallucination at one point. But there is no such thing as group hallucination. Hallucinations, by definition, are individual occurrences. Strobel's Case for the Real Jesus, and Case for Christ answer this emphatically.One person Luedemann specifically tries to discredit is Paul. According to Luedemann, Paul was attracted to the Christian lifestyle while he persecuted them. One day he hallucinates and decides his hallucination was that of the Risen Jesus. This is a possible explanation, but unfortunately, we have the passage from 1 Cor. 15 which emphasizes Paul was not the only one to have see Jesus. Paul ends this passages by saying, \\"The people who saw Jesus risen are still alive today. Go ask them what happened.\\" This is how confidant Paul was. He wanted people to try and disprove his claim. He knew people would back up his story.Much of the book is riddled with problems such as above, but there is one final problem in this work.Near the end of the work Luedemann includes a chapter on whether or not we can be Christians if we accept his analysis to be unassailable. He spends the entire book trying to prove the resurrection is not a historical fact, then he comes to the end and says we can still be Christians if we hold to this view. This is false! Christianity is based on the resurrection. Without it there is no conquering of sin. Without it we cannot live transformed lives. Without it we cannot be followers of a risen Christ, instead we are followers of a delusional madman. To paraphrase scripture, \\"If Christ is still in the grave we are still in our sins.\\" Luedemann is far off base in this view.This book is readable, it is informative, but it is not right. I would not recommend it to anyone truly searching for the truth. Instead, I only recommend it to people who want to do some very serious thinking and defense of the faith. But first, pick up any of Gary Habermas' work, or The Resurrection of the Son of God by N.T. Wright. Both these authors are much more honest in their analysis."},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Jesus","review":"Gerd Ludemann's vision/hallucination theory, which has since been republished in different formats, is not based on historical conclusions and evidence but rather on the author's own biases against the supernatural. This is clear in his statement that \\"David Hume already demonstrated that a miracle is defined in such a way that \`no testimony is sufficient to establish it'.\\" He later says that \\"the literal statements about the resurrection of Jesus . . . have lost their literal meaning with the revolution in the scientific picture of the world.\\" Ludemann is starting from a presumption of naturalism and trying to squeeze the historical evidence into that model rather than following the evidence wherever it leads.Hume's argument has been refuted multiple times, perhaps most recently and effectively by John Earman inHume's Abject Failure: The Argument Against Miracles. Ludemann's commitment to Hume leads him to postulate outlandish theories based on discredited Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis. According to Ludemann's speculation, Peter had a vision of Jesus which was brought on by his guilt over having betrayed him. When he spoke of this vision to others, they became \\"infected\\" somehow, leading to their own visions. He never does explain the naturalistic mechanism by which one person's vision can \\"infect\\" someone else. Certainly I have heard other people talk about visions, but it never induced one in me. Ludemann wants us to believe that Peter's vision infected dozens of other people to the point where they would sacrifice their freedom, property, and even their lives to tell others that Jesus had risen from the dead. To say that this thesis lacks sufficient explanatory power is a gross understatement.But none of this explains the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, so Ludemann has another psychoanalytical theory for that. Saul suffered from some kind of \\"Christ complex\\" which is what led him to persecute the church, but then the inner conflict of his suppressed guilt resulted in a powerful vision which transformed him into the remarkable and tireless apostle to the Gentiles. Again Ludemann relies on Freudian pyschobabble in explaining all of this. Besides the obvious weakness of this theory, he also fails to show that Paul only had a vision. Ludemann engages in questionable exegesis of Paul's letters to show that Paul only claimed a vision. He goes so far as to suggest that Paul really was blinded on the Damascus road, and that this blindness was \\"hysterical blindness.\\" This in itself shows another problem with Ludemann's approach: he approaches the evidence in an ad hoc manner as it suits him. Thus he considers Paul's blindness in Acts to be historical, but not the fact that Paul's companions were also affected by the phenomenon. No historical or evidential basis is given for this. He simply picks and chooses his evidence because it fits his theory that way. In the same way, Ludemann regards Peter's denial of Christ as historical but the discovery of the empty tomb by the women as not.However, Ludemann is to be given credit in some respects. For example, he recognizes that the list of appearances given by Paul in 1 Cor. 15 is very early, dating back to within 2-3 years of the crucifixion. He recognizes that Paul's claim included seeing Jesus, and that other \\"vision\\" theories which only include a light but not the person of Christ are inadequate. However, his attempt to show that Paul's vision of Jesus was merely an internal, subjective experience rather than an objective one comes up short on exegetical and historical grounds.Despite the one or two good points in the book, it is mostly a fairly desperate, ad hoc theory based on outdated and discredited psychoanalytical theories, and that treats the evidence inconsistently. Ludemann simply determines the final destination in advance and then tries to find some way to get there. It's actually a credit to the strength of the evidence for the Resurrection that he is compelled to create such an outlandish hypothesis. Ludemann's thesis is unpersuasive and is unlikely to convince even most skeptics. But for naturalistic explanations of the evidence for the Resurrection, it may be the best that skeptics can come up with."},{"Title":"The Rice Bible: The Definitive Sourcebook with over 500 Illustrations","review":"This book is all about rice! The recipes are flavorful and different. No particular ethnic flavor preference in the dishes (there are a couple of paella dishes). One draw back to this book is not having all the tools necessary to make some of these dishes (like a paella pan), but most of the recipes are adaptable to other tools. The other draw back is not being able to quickly, easily and readily have all the ingredients necessary. The recipes take planning and a couple of trips to different grocery stores to find the necessary herbs, squash, etc. Fantastic photos and the wonderful risotto recipes make this book a must own for anyone that likes to do a bit of cooking and likes rice.

One could quibble, I suppose, that the science is slightly dated and there were certainly a couple of predictions that have since been proven incorrect but, for my money, the story is made all the more exciting and amazing for the degree to which it is now, fifty years later, approaching reality and the possibility of achievement!Martin Gibson, a celebrated science fiction writer, has been invited to be the first and only passenger on the maiden voyage of Ares, the first interplanetary vessel that will be devoted to passenger travel. A simple thesis indeed for a marvelous novel - Gibson's job is to report back to earth on the trip and his perceptions of the progress that the first colonists have made in their establishment of a flourishing base on Mars. Unlike Asimov's \\"The Gods Themselves\\" which addresses the philosophical and psychological impact of living in an alien environment on Earth's moon, The Sands of Mars restricts itself almost exclusively to addressing the hard core physical and scientific issues. Not to suggest that makes it less interesting or a weaker novel - that's just the side of the sci-fi coin that turned up when Clarke flipped it, I suppose! There certainly wasn't any shortage of topics - oxygen, air pressure, weather, heat, buildings, local travel (both on the planet and to Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos), interplanetary travel back and forth to Mars, emergency preparedness, government, effective utilization of limited manpower, biology and zoology (or at least Clarke's rather exciting vision of what is possible), communication and more!I also appreciated the fact that, while the science was straightforward and not particularly complex, neither was it dumbed down or patronizing. For example, when Ares first left Earth's orbits to begin the long trip to Mars, it was described as follows:\\" ... she would pull away out of the orbit in which she was circling and had hitherto spent all her existence, to swing into the long hyperbola that led to Mars.\\"I haven't been a big fan of Arthur C Clarke's other more open-ended esoteric novels such as \\"Against the Fall of Night\\" but I certainly enjoyed this one!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"I purchased &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; years ago after I read another novel (The Songs of Distant Earth) which I adored.I really enjoyed reading &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot;. It was an unusual read since Mr. Clarke had written the novel many years ago - when many assumptions at that time about the moon and planets have been proven false today. In fact, Mr. Clarke mentions that in the preface of my book - and asks the readers to see how many they can spot (like plants that grow on the Moon and Mars, to name a few). These distractions should not at all take away from the novel. It's actually a simple and straightforward story. A writer (of Science-Fiction), named Martin, decides to go to Mars - which is still in it's infancy of colonialism. The story then relates of the colony's attempts at maintaining the colony on Mars as well as their attempt at terraforming the planet. It's a good story, that many should enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"I read the book about 23 years ago and have re-read it time and time again. What it lacks sytlistically it makes up for in sheer joy of discovery and achievement by its characters on a Mars that was a valid extrapolation from knowledge at the time (c.1950) of writing. Good SF is about real people in a world that really might be - hence the personal secrets that are discovered along-side the planetary ones as the novel progresses.Mars officially is a cold, lifeless world, but the author Arthur Clarke has endorsed recent claims of life evidenced in space-probe photos. He might be mistaking hype for science, and geology for biology, but he might also have &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; in the back of his mind too."},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"Although not one of his absolute best stories, The Sands of Mars is a classic work of science fiction and one which has held up well over time. It starts out a little slow at first, but once the story gets a bit into the Mars landing part of the book it increasingly picks up steam. Once again, in the climax of the book, Clarke has a seemingly impossible thing happen and describes it in such a way as to make it believable. Maybe that is the mark of a good science fiction writer. Also, the characters in this book, unlike some other works of Arthur's where the characters tend to be flat and somewhat dull, are quite believable and likable. Certainly you should read 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous With Rama, and Childhood's End first, but if you are an Arthur C. Clarke fan then you should definately pick up The Sands of Mars.On a sidenote, ignore the reviewer below who refers to this novel as &quot;Part of Clarke's one novel per planetary body pulp series&quot;. This is simply a ridicilous statement. First off, ACC DOES NOT have one novel per planetary body, and he, being of the leading and perhaps pioneering practicioners of hard SF, certainly does not write pulp. Indeed, if you read this book as part of the omnibus Prelude To Mars, you will read in the preface to Prelude To Space that that novel took Arthur 20 days to conceive and write, which is a record he has never since come close to equalling. Yeah, sounds like pulp to me. Sure. Forget the negative commentary and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"Arthur C. Clarke's second novel, \\"The Sands of Mars\\", published in 1951, differs greatly from his first novel. Whereas \\"Prelude to Space\\" was focused on the technical details of space travel, Clarke puts much more effort into character development in \\"The Sand of Mars\\". That is not to say that Clarke ignores the technical as much as he did the character development in his first novel. He has some interesting discussions on creating livable conditions on Mars for man, and he floats an idea which he would return to in \\"2010: The Year We Make Contact\\".The story centers on Martin Gibson, a science fiction writer who has been invited to take a trip to Mars so that he can write about it. He is to ride aboard the Ares, which is a ship configured to start taking passengers to Mars. A fair amount of the story takes place on the Ares, as Gibson becomes acclimated to space and Clarke adds several incidents to the trip to keep the reader's interest while developing the characters. Clarke then plants the seeds for the big secret which Mars is keeping from Earth as Gibson arrives and is shown around the largest settlement.The reader becomes acquainted with Mars through the eyes of Gibson and the events which occur around him. Using these events Clarke builds the reader's expectations for the secret, and also throws a few curves into the story itself, some of which aren't all that believable. In the end, the secret is revealed and along the way the reader has met some interesting characters, but all in all it is not one of Clarke's better works. There are just too many coincidences both in terms of character surprises as well as storyline ones to make it very believable."},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"Arthur C. Clarke's THE SANDS OF MARS was written in 1951 and almost every aspect of the novel betrays the fact that over half a century has passed since its publication. What we now know about the fourth planet contradicts sharply with what's presented here. The pacing and style of the story are much like other science fiction writings of the period. And, indeed, the very attitude of the book feels very old-fashioned. But any potential reader shouldn't be scared off by the book's age. Clarke is one of \\"Big Three\\" of science fiction and his writing is strong enough here that something that would be regarded as a historical curiosity from another author still has a solid enough foundation to interest today's reader.We're told the story from the point of view of science fiction writer Martin Gibson who has been sent to a colony on Mars in order to better explain what life is like on this new world through written dispatches to the people back on Earth. The Mars colonies are still in their infancy; opinion on Earth is divided between those still excited about mankind's spread across the solar system and others who feel that Mars is simply an unnecessary drain on Earth's money and resources.Clarke spends far more on world-building and describing his future history than he does on advancing the plot, and the story-line itself never turns out to be anything likely to send the blood racing through one's veins. Indeed, it's one hundred and twenty pages into a two hundred and twelve page book before we get a hint at what the main conflict is. However, to look for an exciting, knuckle-whitening plot is to overlook the real purpose of the book. Clarke is much more interested in theorizing about how space travel will work, how a human colony on a hostile planet could exist and how humanity can flourish in the solar system.Having a science fiction author as the book's protagonist (and one who had an early novel titled MARTIAN DUST) allows Clarke to make quite a few meta-textual jokes about himself and his genre. At one point he is able to make a sly joke about the science fiction of the 1930s and 1940s by pointing out that \\"today's\\" more scientifically literate audience is able to accept the technical details for granted and to simply move quickly into the story. However, from my modern point of view this \\"quicker\\" novel still seemed very hung up on scientific explanations and slow to get to the plot (which is not a criticism, simply an observation of how science fiction was told at that time) .Of course, the other main difficulty to the modern reader will be the fact that very little was known about the red planet when Clarke put pen to paper and therefore many of his working assumptions turned out to be completely incorrect (no fault of Clarke's, of course). For me, the most difficult example of this was the descriptions of the terrain of the fictional Mars. My mind kept visualizing the landscape of Mars as it appears in the pictures we would later see from the Viking and Phoenix rovers. Then my mental image would be jolted by a throw-away mention of the thick, lush vegetation that the characters encountered on the surface. It was occasionally enough to jar me out of the flow of the story, which is a shame but not something that can be blamed on Clarke.Other things have changed since the early-1950s. I did a double take every time someone would pull out a cigarette and light up -- on a spaceship of all places. This is also a future where typewriters and fax machines are the technology of the day. And for old-fashioned attitudes, there are a number of vaguely disturbing (although faint) echoes of European colonialism in the book's concluding chapters.Still, it's probably bad form to criticize a book that's old simply for being old. The story may be slow moving, but it is fun and Clarke was at his best when spinning out all kinds of ideas for how scientific knowledge could be applied in practical ways. While it's not as challenging as some of Clarke's more focused pieces, it is a very interesting example of one of his earliest novels. This isn't the best place to start reading Arthur C. Clarke, but if you've enjoyed some of his other novels you'll find things to like here."},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","review":"For a science fiction book written in the late 1940s, this is an amazingly undated piece of work. Oh, sure, there are a few anachronisms ~ vacuum tubes and the possibility of vegetation on Mars are the most obvious to my non-scientific mind ~ and we are not as close to having a colony there at the end of the Twentieth Century as Clarke expected, but almost nothing else is out of place. The plot itself is impeccable; Clarke has created likeable, fun, believable, cogent characters of whom it is a pleasure to read. Martin Gibson is a Terran writer journeying to Mars to report on the successes there; his discoveries, including the major one that life on a frontier is what he wants. Mars is on the cusp of starting to make itself independant of Earth by the success of a secret project that Warren Hadfield ~ Chief Executive ~ has had scientists working on: Nothing less, in fact, than the complete reformation of the planet is contemplated.

Clarke. This is the story of the first human colonies on the planet Mars. In this story Clarke brilliantly weaves the personal saga of the story's protagonist against the panorama of Man's successful colonization of Mars. Clarke's speculations are dazzling, and as always, he weaves a touching personal story into a grander story of Mankind's expansion into the universe.There are, of course, the inevitable anachronisms in a story written more than 40 years ago. Clarke's protagonist uses a typewriter (typing on actual paper while in a spaceship) and they fax his manuscripts back to earth. Probably they used slide rules too.If some of Clarke's science in this novel is a bit out of step with what we now know (or think we know) about the planet Mars, it is not so far out as to detract from this story. This one has stood the test of time, and will not truly be dated until humanity has actually colonized Mars. In fact, \\"The Sands of Mars\\" accomplishes in a few hundred pages what Kim Stanley Robinsons' Red/Green/Blue Mars series never accomplishes in thousands of pages--Clarke creates a plausible and believable scenario for humanity's conquest of Mars, and tells an interesting story to boot. In Clarke's novel the people seem real, the science seems real, and the story moves along smartly at all times.The discerning reader will return to this novel more than once.

Some are born to juggle with golden balls.&quot; Beerbohm was an admitted juggler, and yet his seemingly &quot;light&quot; work is ultimately more insightful than most so-called serious projects. And often much funnier.Beerbohm was also quite a caricaturist, and his theater reviews (many out of print) are still great to read all these decades later.Get hold of this book and start off with the classics &quot;Enoch Soames,&quot; the story of a third-rate poet who, convinced of his own greatness, makes a deal with the Devil in order to travel to the future to enjoy his posthumous success (with comic results), and &quot;Savonarola Brown,&quot; a hilarious sketch of a frustrated playwright and his great &quot;unfinished&quot; opus.Beerbohm's contemporaries referred to him as &quot;the incomparable Max,&quot; and it's a title that fits. I wish I could've met him."},{"Title":"Seven men,","review":"Bernard Shaw called Beerbohm &quot;the divine Max,&quot; and this collection of short pieces will tell you why. The book consists of short character sketches of six men (Beerbohm is the ever present seventh), and each one is a small masterpiece of Edwardian parody and humour. Beerbohm's line sketches of each one of his (imaginary?!) characters are included at the end of the book. Some of the tales have an unexpectedly supernatural twist (the neo-Faustian bargain struck by Enoch Soames being the best of the lot). Three cheers for the NYRB Press for bringing these forgotten gems back into print."},{"Title":"Seven men,","review":"This isn't even five men, as another reviewer said. It's four and a half.

Not only is this not worth the $0.00 you'll pay: you'll regret the spoilers that you get to when you read past the missing section. This is the kind of thing I HATE."},{"Title":"Seven men,","review":"the best collection of short fiction written in EnglishDuring the years it was out of print, I kept it regularly renewed from the library until a kind friend in London found me a copy."},{"Title":"Seven men,","review":"There are two stories in this collection that are incomparable: &quot;Enoch Soames&quot; and &quot;Savaranola Brown&quot;. For the story of Enoch Soames alone, this collection is perhaps worth the price. Enoch Soames is a disheartened poet who is unappreciated. One day he becomes fed up with his inability to court fame (his second book sells 3 copies) and so makes an agreement with the devil to travel to the future to learn what's been written about him in return for an eternal trip to the Devil's home. I can't reveal what happens next, but suffice it to say that the story revels in metaphysical twists and fascinating character sketches.Most of the other stories were disappointing (John Updike admits as much in the introduction). But if you've never read Beerbohm, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"VIRTUAL REALITY","review":"Back when Internet access was uncommon, Howard Rheingold was traveling the world, talking to VR researchers. He'd visit a lab, give them a presentation about what he'd seen in other places, then see what they had been developing. Then, he'd go to another lab, frequently in another country, and do the same, incorporating what he'd seen at the last place into his presentation. In this fashion, he was serving as a walking information nexus. Researchers who were largely unaware of other research going on in other places would learn about each other, and make contact with each other, as a result of his travels and his presentations.Hell of a gig if you can get it. Where do I sign up for something like that? And get paid to do it?Many of the technologies he writes about are still unknown, a decade later. They were cool when he wrote about them. They're still cool. They just haven't gone mainstream, for one reason or another.If you buy and read this book today, you won't spend much time thinking \\"gee, that's old hat.\\" Much of it is still quite eye-opening.The guys in the UK who were using compressed air and hoses, where many people would be trying to use hydraulic actuators (much higher cost), were very interesting.The differences between US and Japanese mindsets, WRT wearing headsets, was very amusing.Creating a device which you can move with your hand, which simulates different textures, was intriguing. Not sure what the practical applications are for that, but it was definitely intriguing. There's a whole realm of VR there which I don't know that anyone is touching.The high-speed motorcycle ride through Brooklyn, without physically moving, would be very fun to try. Even if it was film-based, back before the advent of cheap electronic displays. The fact that the guy even managed to incorporate wind, coming from different directions, and scent makes that one truly ground-breaking.I'd love to see an updated version, with \\"where are they now\\" information on more of the projects. I can't imagine what else has been developed in the interim."},{"Title":"VIRTUAL REALITY","review":"First published in 1991, this is a gem that should be one of the first readings of anyone contemplated the sacred and the scary aspects of how humans, machines, and software are being changed by emerging information technologies.

S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"C. S. Lewis would doubtless have scoffed at the idea of a reference book about himself, just as he disapproved of university courses devoted to modern authors on the sensible ground that &quot;helps&quot; to reading them are not needed and come between the writer and his audience.Nonetheless, students and &quot;fans&quot; of the great Christian apologist and literary scholar now are offered two thick compendia on his life and work. Each has its virtues and faults, and both are worthwhile investments - though not a substitute for the straight, unfiltered Lewis.The &quot;Companion and Guide&quot;, reviewed here, is the production of one man, who has devoted almost his entire adult lifetime to editing and writing about Lewis. The rival &quot;C. S. Lewis Readers' Encyclopedia&quot; is a composite work whose contributors range from giants in the field to eager amateurs.When he first met C. S. Lewis in June 1963, Walter Hooper was an American schoolteacher who had dropped out of studying for the Episcopal priesthood and never gotten started as a graduate student in literature. Instantly star-struck, he volunteered to help with secretarial chores. Within a few months Lewis was dead of a heart attack, and this 32-year-old foreigner, whose academic credentials consisted of a master's degree in education and who had never published a word on any Lewisan topic, improbably became the great man's de facto literary executor. Within a year he had edited the first collected edition of Lewis' poems, and he has worked at the same stand ever since. The double meaning of the present volume's title is no accident. The book is a companion and guide to readers of Lewis' work, but Lewis has also been, metaphorically, a lifetime companion and guide to Walter Hooper.&quot;Companion and Guide&quot; weighs in at almost a thousand pages (twice the length of the &quot;Readers' Encyclopedia&quot;). It leads off with a hundred page biography that may well be the best life of Lewis yet written (not that the competition is very formidable). The next and longest section discusses each of CSL's books, with the inexplicable omission of &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot;, his seminal tome on courtly love and medieval poetry. Of greatest interest are the accounts of how the works came to be written, which draw on Lewis' vast, incompletely published correspondence and on conversations with his large circle of friends. Also provided are epitomes, which are useful for reference but sometimes flabby, and haphazard excerpts from book reviews. The last feature calls attention to one of the Companion's defects: Hooper is too much a Lewis partisan to pay much attention to detractors. The uniform, almost gushing, praise of the quotations is not representative of contemporary reaction to Lewis. It would be very surprising if smashing modern idols had made him popular among the high priests of idolatry.Closely related to the discussions of the works are short essays on &quot;Key Ideas&quot;. Relatively long pieces summarize Lewis' positions on such topics as &quot;Imagination&quot;, &quot;Natural Law&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;. Shorter ones range from &quot;Bulverism&quot; to &quot;Monarchy&quot; to &quot;Quiddity&quot;. These rapid presentations of Lewis' point of view, quoting liberally from his own words, are excellent as far as they go, but have little critical depth.Next come a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of people who were important to Lewis, a miscellaneous &quot;What's What&quot; of places, organizations, concepts, terms and facts (&quot;The Kilns&quot;, &quot;Oxford University Socratic Club&quot;, &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;, &quot;Don(s)&quot;, &quot;Stage Plays of the Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) that relate to Lewis in some fashion, and an 84 page bibliography of everything by Lewis that had appeared in print through about 1996.The strength of the Companion is the immense fund of information that it provides. Its weaknesses are the author's uncritical devotion to his subject and the lacunae in those areas that don't interest him. The academic side of Lewis' career, in particular, is underdeveloped. One finds little about the controversy over the Oxford English curriculum, in which Lewis played a prominent role. As already noted, &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot;, which made CSL's reputation as a scholar, gets scant notice. Important essays like &quot;What Chaucer Really Did to Il Filostrato&quot;, &quot;Donne and Seventeenth Century Love Poetry&quot; and &quot;The Fifteenth-Century Heroic Line&quot; receive none at all.The readers who will find the Companion most useful (and will prefer it to the Readers' Encyclopedia) are those who are interested in CSL primarily as a Christian thinker and novelist and who are more concerned with gaining a fuller appreciation of his writings than in examining what others have written about him.Since another reviewer has raised it, one must address the question of Mr. Hooper's reliability. When he first came to Lewis studies, a callow outsider abruptly elevated beyond his expectations or deserts, he sought to enhance his statute by falsely claiming a long and intimate association with Lewis. That was a foolish course of action and gained enemies who have hounded him for decades with increasingly sensational accusations. I have no way to judge whether any or all of the charges are well-founded, but they are mostly of interest to biographers of Hooper, not to students of Lewis. Save in marginal areas and subject to normal human frailty, there is no valid reason to impugn the Companion's accuracy. One may leave the last word on this topic to the Readers' Encyclopedia, which, in the course of a far from flattering article about Mr. Hooper, calls the Companion a &quot;landmark volume&quot;. Its author may, for all I know, be a bad man, but he is a good encyclopedist."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"Having read a great deal of work by and about C.S. Lewis over the last decade, I was surprised by how much I learned from Walter Hooper's superb volume. Hooper looked for information about Lewis from several obscure periodicals to add to his already rich knowledge of Lewisiana, and the rewards are apparent in the brief biography he writes about Lewis, the contemporary book reviews about Lewis's works, and the &quot;Who's Who&quot; and &quot;What's What&quot; sections. I found Hooper's explanatory chapters on Lewis's academic works especially helpful for understanding what Lewis was saying in such literary works as THE DISCARDED IMAGE, ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE 16th CENTURY, and PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, and his chapters on the fiction and theology of C.S. Lewis are no less erudite and helpful. Whether you have never read anything by Lewis or have read every Lewis title you can get your hands on, C.S. Lewis: COMPANION AND GUIDE will be an entertaining and helpful aid."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"Walter Hooper was a companion of Lewis in his last days and a long time student of C. S. Lewis works. This book shows his affection and knowledge of Lewis. It covers every book and work. It answers the common questions people have about the life and writings of Lewis. I recommend Hooper's book as an indispensable tool to have on the serious Lewis scholar's or just the curious C. S. Lewis fan's bookshelf."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"Companion and Guide is the sort of reference book that almost always answers the specific question you came in search of and yet whets your appetite for the original texts. I suspect that it would have this effect even on someone who had not yet read the originals.Immensely helpful for teachers even if they know Lewis very well. For example, Peter Kreeft's excellent talk on \\"Til We Have Faces\\" (available on his website) seems to have been built around Hooper's entry in this book.It was a great help to me in teaching the Ransom trilogy.Warning: if you are prone -- as I am-- to the vice of curiosity, this book is not always a time-saver. You will find yourself browsing when you meant to be only verifying a fact or running down a citation.Because of the excellent little book that she wrote on Narnia, I would hesitate to speak ill of Kathryn Lindskoog even if she were still alive and had not died what I consider to be a heroic Christian death. That said, it would be foolhardy in the extreme to let her later attacks on Hooper (some perhaps just, some quite bizarre, personal, and unsubstantiated) so poison your judgment about him that you miss out on this monumental acheivement."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"Veal's excellent organizational overview of the work is spot on, and thus not to be duplicated. What this review will attempt to supplement that excellent review is Hooper's intent of providing this companion/guide: to unite the poet, critic and Christian into one. This was one of the major themes Lewis had expressed to Hooper, to find that there is a guiding thread uniting all of his life's writings.Reading and rereading Lewis is a pleasant and wonderful task, seeking and finding new emphases and insights. Hooper's reflections on the same are thus a friendly aid to this, if one chooses. I find his insights sometimes illuminate, sometimes expose my overlooks, and sometimes stamp what I've already found.Thus, for Lewis devotee, this is excellent resource. Omitted here is Lewis' work on education, which is so filled in a scholarly fashion by a new work by Joel Heck."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"Debates persist between laypeople and scholars regarding who has the best claim to Mr. Lewis. Some say the \\"true Lewis,\\" whatever that means, is the sole provenance of his self-proclaimed experts, while others insist that he belongs to his readers. Lewis actually had a say on the matter. He got incensed over the idea that anyone could know a person based on his books, as many have attempted to claim. Thankfully, we have kind Uncle Wally's Companion and Guide to the man and his works, and he does an admirable job of bringing both to life. Mr. Hooper has never felt the pressure of bowing to the guild--nor did Lewis--and as a result his writing is, for lack of a better term, down-to-earth. Having said that, it's hard to say how well someone who only knew Lewis for a few months before his death can know the man himself, but let's admit it: he is one of the few people who actually ever lived with Lewis, and Lewis was particularly forthcoming in sharing his life with Hooper, to the point of giving him access to all of his papers. If that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is. He trusted Mr. Hooper's instincts, and, as a result, so do I. You want to get a deeper insight into Jack and his works? Read this book."},{"Title":"C. S. Lewis A Complete Guide to His Life and Works: A Complete Guide to His Life & Works","review":"It is absolutely indispensable for lovers of Lewis.

So I bought this book thinking that I could use it to teach my kindergartner various science topics. There are 33 chapters divided into 4 parts (Part 1- Using Children's Literature as a Springboard to Science; Part 2- Life Science; Part 3- Earth and Space Science; and Part 4- Physical Science). Each chapter is laid out by first recommending a book to read (i.e. \\"The Very Busy Spider by Eric Carle for the chapter on spiders). Next there is a 1-2 page summary of the book, then 1-2 lines of science and content related topics & words. Finally, there is a list of activities suggested for a variety of ages.What I would have liked is for the author to include a summary of the actual topic (i.e. 4-5 bullet points on spiders). In my opinion, this is a big piece missing, and hence the reason why I gave this book only 3 stars. If you don't know a fair amount about the topics, you will need to do further research if you want to use this book to teach.

I found these two errors in my first 3 minutes looking at this book. They wash over the more difficult concepts to the point where you aren't really learning anything at all, and what you learn is up to widely varying interpretations.

It's more about life and all it's implicit meanings as woven into a tapestry of past and present, as well as some of what is inevitable in the future, than just an account of an old cemetery.The pioneer family cemetery she inherits in Yoncalla, Oregon is a platform, a stage and a point of departure for her journey of exploration of the essence of life and it's compelling human drama.Of course, this was not her plan. She thought she was going to just run a cemetery. How much trouble could that be? Well, Katie, bar the door! Through it all Shannon Applegate shares with us her strengths and weaknesses, her acuteness and obtuseness, her determination and her fears. She has portrayed all of this while at the same time writing in such a style as to transport us to that very fine spring morning with the sunlight filtering through the Douglas Fir trees projecting the dappled sun on the aging surface of the headstones. Metaphor and allegory abound. She was not afraid to put just who she is on the pages of this book, or if she was, she did it anyway.My personal expectation that Living Among Headstones would be a text book, a how-to cemetery operations manual, was wholly my own self-imposed limitation. Shannon Applegate relates stories that start with her experiences as a new sexton of the Applegate Pioneer Cemetery then charges into her own personal family past and present to share with us the deep universal human values of recollection and reflection.I am reminded of one of my highly respected teachers in a very small Midwestern high school. He would enter the room each morning and welcome us all with: \\"Good morning scholars, today we will come out of the darkness of ignorance into the glorious sunshine of wisdom, knowledge and brotherly love\\". I feel that Shannon Applegate has done that for me.We are brought into personal stories of tragedy and loss. With her sometimes-Victorian descriptions of the lives, letters, and diaries of generations gone by, Shannon gives us the pieces of life's puzzle so that we can begin to see the great value that even the smallest (and largest) events that our daily lives hold.Her work is a living monument to the connectedness and aliveness we can feel through her experience and now through her book."},{"Title":"Living Among Headstones: Life in a Country Cemetery","review":"In reading Living Among Headstones I found myself consistently looking back on my families, as well as my feelings about our final resting place or even if we should have one at all in a very positive light.

I found Shannon Applegate's novel to be quite entertaining,informative, and very hard to put down. I can't say how many times I laughed with her as she told many a tale. I loved her descriptions of the cemetery which made me feel as if I was right there walking beside her. I wanted to experience the cemetery so I made a point to locate it and walk through it. I could see the many items left on the graves as well as the plastic flowers as I read, yet they did not diminish the beauty of the cemetery in the least in person, they enhanced and personalized it for me as well as she seemed to realize. I was not in the least disappointed as to what I found and felt as I walked through the cemetery, except for the wish that Shannon was my guide in person. I would love to thank her for sharing herself in such a open and beautiful way. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if cemeteries are one of those things you avoid.

This is not the sort of responsibility most people anticipate or prepare for, and Shannon is no exception, but when duty calls she responds with pluck and determination.Much of the job description involves the routines of taking care of any piece of country acreage: clearing the debris of last winter's storms, keeping the grass mowed, the weeds under control, the fences mended. Then there are the duties of the sexton, calling for people skills, for kindness, caring, tact, and compassion. All this happens within the spectacularly beautiful countryside of rural Oregon, where the hum-drum rhythms of everyday affairs blend seamlessly with the timeless themes of human life and death. Some incidents are quite droll: what does a person do, after passionately bringing order and decorum to a graveyard, about mourners' graveside offerings when these are in garish bad taste? Others are desperate, even grim: with the decline of logging, dearth of economic opportunity in Yoncalla leaves some of its citizens teetering on the brink of destruction, frequently aggravated by their own folly. And some events feel downright tragic: when Shannon's father dies and joins his ancestors on the hill in Yoncalla, it is not entirely unexpected. Nor unbearable. But her brother? And then her stillborn granddaughter?Through all these levels of events and moods we are guided wisely and gracefully. I deeply enjoyed this book, and was sad when I came to the end. I plan to reread it this summer."},{"Title":"Living Among Headstones: Life in a Country Cemetery","review":"Shannon Applegate, Living Among Headstones: Life in A Country Cemetery (Da Capo, 2005)For some reason I had it in my head before reading this that Shannon Applegate was a twentysomething just-out-of-college type who decided to try and run a cemetery because she had no other real aims in life. I'm not entirely sure how someone would get into that situation, which should have tipped me off that I was wrong. No, Shannon Applegate was just carrying on the family business, which happened to be the running of a private (i.e., not affiliated with a particular church) cemetery. I also expected this, because of the odd picture I'd painted of the author in my head, to read like some sort of chick-lit mess, or at the very least a punk-ish DIY manual for how to get a job that no one would ever think of getting but that's actually pretty darned cool. I was entirely wrong on the first count, but if you were to take the second and have it written by, say, Anne Lamott, you might come up with something like Living Among Headstones.This is a memoir, of sorts, and as such I'll admit that I'm biased against it at times; when it's talking about the day-to-day trials of running a cemetery, it's great, but it drifts off into ruminations about life, the universe, and everything a bit too often for me. I do understand that a lot of people seem to like that sort of thing (witness the rise of the memoir-by-person-who's-never-actually-done-anything-of-note in the past decade), and for them, this may well be a much more rewarding read than it was for me. But I don't want to sound like there was no upside to the book for me; I did learn good deal about how one runs a cemetery and the sorts of things one runs into that laymen wouldn't even think about. That works. The rest, well, it's up to you. ***"},{"Title":"Living Among Headstones: Life in a Country Cemetery","review":"I read this book as research for my own. I loved it! As a sculptor who specializes in posthumous sculpture and memorials this book made me feel comfortable with my own research. It is a refreshing read on such an unusual subject. I have always loved an author who can paint pictures with their words tantalizing your literary taste buds with every chapter. Reading Applegate's book was like having a box of your favorite candy. You want to save it, eating a little at a time, but before you know it you have devoured the entire thing.Applegate has a knack for weaving many of the items that interest me into her writing, things like history, biology and Native American Indian culture. The usual topics of cemetery reformation, the Day of the Dead, and intricate details of death and burials in other countries are speckled throughout the writing with just enough information to entice the reader without overwhelming them. Most of the funerary facts in Living Among Headstones I have learned from other research that I have done, but, a few things I have just never thought of before, such as what happens with the \\"spoils\\" (left over dirt from a grave) in the cemetery, and the idea that many people are buried east to west, and that some countries burry people in an upright position to save space. I can tell that, like myself, this entire process has occupied much of Applegate's thoughts. When it comes to aspects of death and burial Applegate leaves no stone unturned.I had found myself emotionally involved in the chapter titled Grave Goods where she discusses removing items like plastic flowers and trinkets from graves to tidy up the cemetery. I had never thought of the practice of leaving personal items at a grave until I visited a grave of a young girl for whom I had created a sculpture. To my delight the grave has many knick-knacks that seem to change with the season, personal items left by friends and family, even a pinwheel. I have no problem with the idea of grave goods at all, and think it is quite unique and special. I would not think of removing anything from a grave no matter what it might be. If I were a sexton I know that would be a difficult decision. For even in some situations a piece of pizza on a paper plate could be considered a token for a loved one. Though it must be a hard call to make I think I would be on the side of those leaving items behind.As I progressed into the book I was surprised to read her memoirs of burying her own brother and father. The personal accounts made the book so much more alive, and real. Her personal and emotional involvement that was illustrated in her writing seemed to give me permission to weave my own personality and feelings within my descriptions used in the book that I am writing \\"Bringing to life the Sprit of the Deceased, a Sculptor's Journey.\\"I was also surprised to see a direct reference to a subject that I had just read in another book. In Malvina Hoffman's Heads and Tales Malvina worked for the Field Museum, and Applegate refers to the field museum with distaste... as late as 1897, the field museum in Chicago was still sending expeditions to plunder the graves of native Oregonians (73). I am passionate about my thoughts on anyone disturbing any grave for whatever reason. To this day I still refuse to view any of the artifacts that have come from the Egyptian tombs. It seems a great invasion of privacy to participate in these practices even in the name of \\"science.\\"Hoffman is a wonderful writer and I have enjoyed finding her book and reading it in my research of death and dying. I can see now why her first book Shookum: an Oregon Pioneer Family's History and Lore, was named Oregon's Best 100 Literary Works. Living Among Headstones was not only a welcome treat but I will add Applegate to my favorites list and hope to keep up with the author and read her other works in the future."},{"Title":"Living Among Headstones: Life in a Country Cemetery","review":"Responsibility is a hard to meet. This is especially true when your responsibility requires dealing with grief - the grief of others and your own grief. Shannon Applegate meets that responsibility and gives all of us a window into the struggle that doing so requires. In the process, she shares with us life in a small American town. Applegate is unique in her ability to share this experience in that her family has occupied a place in the community for six generations. Applegate exposes her prejudices and through hard experience learns to be more open and appreciative of the experiences of others. This journey is one which is rewarding not only to Applegate and the small town in which she lives but to all of us who read her book."},{"Title":"Reading Rhetorically: A Reader for Writers","review":"Reading Rhetorically was one of the books required for a class I took a few years back, and I must say, it has really opened my eyes to the writing process and I've depended on books like this to get me back into that mental mood that is the process of writing. Reading and writing have such an important connection--much more so than we think-- and this book makes the theory behind that evident with substantial reasoning and examples. However, I don't mean to say that is all theory; practical evidence and advice is included on how to become a more effective writer, and strategies a person can use immediately. Reading Rhetorically is an amazing book in that it gives writer's ideas on how to have a stronger voice embedded within their writing.An easy format to follow and \\"reader friendliness\\" make this an accessible reference book. Each chapter is outlined with details about where it is headed. Chapter 1 and 2 give some background into what it means to read rhetorically, defining it. It gives tips on pursuing an author's voice, mood and purpose while we read. In short, the author explains the critical point of digging for not only comprehension, but everything about an article, passage, chapter or book. Chapter 3 and 4 explore listening and questioning strategies while we read; that is, being an active reader who participates while reading. Several strategies illustrated are annotating a text, highlighting difficult parts of a passage, marking unfamiliar terms, and noting organizational signals to help you see where the article is heading. They also offer a checklist of items to think about while writing a summary, as well as help writing a rhetorical pr&eacute;cis, a four-sentence analytical summary that is an indispensible tool for high school and college students (colleges now require these). Chapter 4 focuses on questioning a text, which basically means to question the author's credibility, logic, and persuasive, emotional appeals, which includes their style or implied message. The reader gets steps to help them draw conclusions about a text, but to also detect an \\"unspoken\\" or implied message from an article or text. Finally, chapters 5 and 6 help you to take these strategies of reading rhetorically and form your own argument while conducting and producing research papers. Information such as evaluating a source, strategies for managing your writing process, thoughts on generating ideas, an critiquing your own writing are offered in an editing checklist. Also, there is a section on how to paraphrase, direct quote and summarize in your paper to make it more effective and avoid plagiarism as well as an excellent section about parenthetical citations and building an MLA works cited page.In each chapter, there are several easy to read and understand charts that illustrate what the author is discussing. For instance, in chapter 3 there are checklists for composing a summary and evaluating a summary, a rubric of sorts for you to use. In the appendix, there is a sample works cited page along with instructions on how to set it up.This book covers such a wide range of information about reading and writing that you will have literally a wealth of knowledge by the time you are done reading. It is a handy reference book that you will come back to many times, so don't let the cost of the book throw you off. I highly recommend this third edition, as it has a better format, more visuals, and examples to help you than the previous two.A must for any college student, or anyone required to do academic writing!"},{"Title":"Reading Rhetorically: A Reader for Writers","review":"While this text is written directly to students and could be used very effectively as a text in a college writing course to supplement other texts, this book is not for students alone.

Black relies almost exclusively on primary sources to meticulously document the ignoble history behind the actions of our government officials, scientists, sociologists and progressive corporate philanthropists who comprised the American eugenics movement. He takes the reader step-by-step along the harrowing recounting of this, one of the darkest periods in our nation's history, including the very darkest heart at the core of this movement: eugenicide, the call for mass murder of the unfit and unwelcome in lethal gas chambers (long before the Nazis ever got hold of the idea) and actual practice of infanticide of the impaired and disfigured by doctors and hospital staff. All while our leaders looked on and applauded.Most important, Black does here what no one else had done before (at least to my knowledge): He traces the roots of the German Nazi racial rampage and genocide against the Jews and others deemed unfit to the American eugenics movement. It turns out, we gave Hitler the blueprints; the Americans taught the Germans under the Weimar banner and later under the Nazi flag, everything they needed to know to get started on their own eugenics campaign.This comprehensive, scholarly but imminently readable and accessible volume is devastating in its impact but utterly impossible to put down. I can honestly say, I was a different man when I turned the last page than I was when I turned the first. There are few books about which I can make that claim."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"Maybe if this was the first book I had read on eugenics, I would have liked it better. There is no doubt that Black did his research...but much of this information had been given in a few books I prefer, including Daniel Kevles \\"In the Name of Eugenics,\\" and in \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" by Stephen Jay Gould. Part of what bothered me about Black's book is the title. As someone who is deaf and works in the bioethics/disability community, I was not crazy about perpetuating the idea that those of us with differences are 'weak'. I know that is what they thought back in the early 1900s, and they used much more derogatory terms like feeble-minded and idiots! But the word 'weak' is not one I want conveyed to others who read these books. It's great to have authors write with concern about eugenics raising it's ugly head again...even if they have no disability. However, there are many of us with differences who are working on our own to prevent another medical holocaust here...please do not perpetuate the image that those of us with disabilities need protection from the world. We will kick our own ass thank you!The book was very repetitive of information I had garnered else where. Black provides very little new information in this huge, heavy tome. I think Black is trying to say that the U.S. needs to look at itself first, instead of getting on Germany's case about the Holocausts...because the U.S. provided the groundwork for the Nazis eradication programs of the disabled as well as the Jews and the Gypsies.Black's writing in this book lacks passion. This is what gripped me in Gould's and Kevles' books...is they felt very strongly about statistics being used to label and denigrate people, and about our country's own holocausts. When writing a paper, social commentators need dispassion; in writing a book, passion should underline the stand the author takes. I don't see that here.Black writes well...his book on \\"The Transfer Agreement\\" is spell-binding. This particular book lacks the emotion and yes, even the opinions, that drove that book.Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"Many are familiar with the litany of 20th century regarding the plethora of ways in which the Nazi thugs used the much-hyped science of eugenics to gain acceptance for their many horrific activities, from programs of forced sterilization, euthanasia of the old and infirm, and later even as the justification of genocide during the conduct of the war along the Eastern front. In fact, much of the rationalization for the racist phlegm spouted by Hitler and his ilk was derived from the semi-scientific ideas of the eugenics movement. Much less well known is the fact that the early medical experiments and notions spouted by medical doctors like the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele were highly respected and even revered in the United States as well as Europe, and that Dr. Mengele in fact held public presentations that were hugely successful in this country. Moreover, as the author of this provocative book reveals, there were several popular centers of eugenics research and support for such research for well over thirty years before the Second World War.While the book is both interesting and full of shocking facts, it is also not especially convincing nor especially well written. It appears to be a somewhat muckraking attempt to sensationalize a particularly lurid aspect of 20th century history in American history, and much of what he purports does not appear to be independently verifiable or consistent with information one finds elsewhere on the topic. In fact, his most outrageous claim, one that argues that the notion of so-called \\"Nordic \\" racial superiority originated here in the United States, is quite poorly supported by the evidence he cites. While it is admittedly a sad and despicable period of our history, there is little verifiable documentary evidence to lend credence to such a thesis.This is not to deny there is much of interest in this book. He traces the sad progress of the so-called Immigration Act of 1924, showing how it was inextricably tied to the pseudo-scientific notions popularly associated with the eugenics movement, and with a rampant fear of foreigners as well. Given the rapid influx of immigrants from both eastern and southern Europe at the time, the purported facts regarding potential damage to the genetic makeup of the country was seen to be at risk, and some sad and retrogressive legislation attempted to stem the tide against such potential dangers. The legislation led to a number of state laws outlawing interracial marriage, and were part of a growing campaign of both racial and ethnic intolerance most Americans would just as soon forget rather than learn about in the kind of detail offered here. Thus it is a potentially valuable book, but one which one can recommend only with appropriate caution regarding its veracity and accuracy.Still, while the author does admit as to the fact that the eugenics movement arose in an atmosphere of ignorance, fear and intolerance, and added and aggravated the long-term manifestations of such emotive passions, the kind of complied list of eugenic sins delivered in a polemic style is hardly the sort of dispassionate and accurate document one would associate with a more scholarly approach that attempts less to sensationalize and much more to elucidate, explain, and analyze the topic at hand. It is indeed a sad period of time in our history, but one that deserves a more dispassionate, less muckraking, and more scholarly approach to truly serve the admirable stated purpose of this work.

Had some of the great philanthropic institutions and social engineers of the time had their way, America would have tried to keep up with the Nazi's!Our knowledge of the past may prevent us from repeating our mistakes, but unfortunately, this tome, with its academic aura of footnotes and references, serves primarily to solidify the perception that ALL things linked to Nazism must be summarily rejected. Barely beneath the \\"factual reporting\\" surface of this book seethes a swirling hatred of the Third Reich's creators and supporters. It makes for gripping reading and allows the author to foster a sense of foul conspiracy and sinister plot in the reader's mind. Entertainment trumps scholarship.I have no problem with entertainment, as long as the masquerade serves to deliver some grains of truth. What I do take issue with is the abandonment of scholarship in the book's eye to the future. Yes, there were horrors; yes, we went astray; but to think that we can permanently reject EVERYTHING associated with eugenics is to bury our heads in the sand. Sooner or later, we will be forced to deal with physical and biological facts that will not go away-our resources are not boundless; our genes, the foundations of our specie's existence, are physically frail and in constant need of assessment and selection; our current infatuation with the sanctity of the individual must eventually be balanced by an increased sense of each individual's responsibility to our society. War Against the Weak, while obliquely referencing these issues, ultimately contributes to their perpetuation because Mr. Black fails to suggest that some aspects of eugenics should be retrieved from the dustbin of history.Common wisdom teaches that noble ends do not justify ignoble means. But noble goals are not made despicable when pursued by foul means. It is the means that were misguided, not the goal. To think that we will somehow survive and prosper without doing our genetic housekeeping is pure folly."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"This book is a fascinating account of the eugenics movement that flourished in the United States during the first third of the twentieth century. With the help of an international team of researchers the author details the movement's history: creation of the Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island; the leadership of poultry researcher Charles Davenport; extensive Harriman, Rockefeller, and Carnegie funding; state laws legalizing compulsory sterilization; widespread acceptance by college presidents, clergymen, mental health workers, school principals, and leading progressive thinkers such as Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, and Woodrow Wilson; its validation by the United States Supreme Court in 1927 when it voted 8 to 1 to uphold the constitutionality of Virginia's eugenic sterilization law; and much, much more.The book's most dramatic and controversial conclusion is that the American eugenics movement fueled the triumph of Nazism in Germany and thereby helped bring on the Holocaust. As Black writes in his Introduction, \\"the scientific rationales that drove killer doctors at Auschwitz were first concocted on Long Island at the Carnegie Institution's eugenic enterprise at Cold Spring Harbor.\\" To his credit he provides a great deal of evidence to make his contention plausible, if not totally convincing.The extremes to which the Nazis took their eugenics--euthansia killings of \\"unfit\\" Germans and the extermination of Jews, Gypsies, and others--gave eugenics a bad name from which it never recovered. This important book sheds much needed light on one of the darkest and most bizarre chapters of American history.Charles Patterson, Ph.D., author of ETERNAL TREBLINKA: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust"},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"_War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race_ (2003) by Edwin Black is a fascinating history of the rise and role of eugenics in American history and Nazi Germany. The book demonstrates some of the faulty fundamental premises behind the eugenics movement as well as showing some of the horrors that resulted from the implementation of the eugenics in both the United States and Nazi Germany. The book also shows the relationship between eugenicists and social Darwinists in the United States and Adolf Hitler who later adopted many of their ideas to implement in Germany. The book also shows how following World War II eugenics became discredited but was slowly morphed into the new field of genetics which achieved many positive scientific and medical results for humanity. However, with the new field of genetics came the baggage of eugenics and the possibility that eugenics could be implemented again. The book shows how the weak, poor, and \\"feeble-minded\\" were particularly targeted by the eugenics movement and many were sterilized in America or euthanized in Germany. The book also shows how ideas of racial supremacy entered into the thinking of eugenicists in their goal of creating a master Nordic race. Many of the individuals targeted by eugenicists had little wrong with them and thus the role of sterilization was completely unnecessary.The book includes the following chapters-Introduction - explains the role of eugenics in America and the need to give voice to those never born because of its implementation. Explains some of the misdeeds of eugencists in both America and Nazi Germany (including the role of the Holocaust) and notes the role of prominent organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegies, and Planned Parenthood in implementing eugenics.Part One: From Pea Pod to Persecution.Mountain Sweeps - acknowledges the role of poverty in the formulation of eugenics by America's wealthy elite. Explains how many of those particularly among the Brush Mountain \\"hill folk\\" of Virginia were targeted by American eugenicists because of their alleged inferiority and \\"feeble-mindedness\\". Explains the role of \\"human engineering\\" and the frightening possibility that the eugenic crimes of the twentieth century could be repeated.Evolutions - examines how the Christian worldview which its emphasis on charity came to be overturned. Notes the problem of poverty both in the Middle Ages following the \\"Black Death\\" and in industrial England. Notes the role of \\"paupers\\" and the role of socially conscious reformers such as the author Charles Dickens who called attention to these matters. Examines the role of Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin in founding the scientific theory of evolution as well as the role of the Czech monk Gregor Mendel in his studies of pea pods which began the science of genetics. Focuses on the life of Francis Galton (a relative of Darwin in Britain) who began scientific and statistical investigations into these matters and who was to coin the term \\"eugenics\\". In particular, Galton developed the field of \\"positive eugenics\\" in his study of hereditary genius and wealthy families.America's National Biology - explains how eugenics came to be implemented in the United States following studies of the feminist Victoria Woodhull, the racial theorist Lothrop Stoddard, the Carnegie Institution, and the eugenicist Charles Davenport in his goal of creating a superior \\"Nordic race\\". Notes the role of \\"the Jukes\\" a small family of \\"paupers\\" who served as propaganda for the eugenics movement.Hunting the Unfit - explains how the \\"unfit\\" were singled out by the American Breeder's Association as being harmful to society. Notes the role of epileptics and the \\"feeble-minded\\" as being particularly singled out by eugenicists.Legitimizing Raceology - notes the role of \\"raceology\\" as well as the role of IQ tests in legitimizing it. Notes some of the problems encountered by the early eugenicists.The United States of Sterilization - explains how eugenicists sought to sterilize the \\"unfit\\" to prevent them from breeding. Notes the prominent role of eugenicists behind such efforts of sterilization which were implemented in the United States.Birth Control - notes the role of Margaret Sanger founder of Planned Parenthood in promoting birth control for the poor. Explains how Sanger promoted both abortion and eugenics at the time. Also notes the role of individuals such as Lothrop Stoddard and others.Blinded - explains the role of eugenicists behind the persecution of the blind who were singled out for their schemes.Mongrelization - explains the role of the Census Bureau and the relationship between eugenicists who frequently believed in Anglo-Saxon supremacy and other races as well as fear of \\"mongrelization\\".Eugenicide.Origins - explains the role of eugenicists in implementing their sterilization techniques which focused particularly on outcaste groups. Examines the role of Charles Davenport behind the eugenics movement (funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie). Notes the importance of opposition to immigration (particularly that of Jews, Italians, and Poles) by eugenicists.Britain's Crusade - notes the role of eugenics in Britain in its goal of sterilizing \\"paupers\\" and the other victims of the Industrial Revolution. Notes the role of Charles Davenport in collaborating with Francis Galton and others. Explains the role of Britain's \\"Poor Laws\\", illegal surgeries, the Ministry of Health, and other issues behind eugenics in Britain.Eugenic Imperialism - notes the role of \\"global eugenics\\" and the hope of eugenicists to implement eugenics worldwide especially as it concerned the events of World War I. Notes the prominent role of conservationist Madison Grant behind the eugenics movement at this stage.Eugenicide - explains how the idea of a \\"lethal chamber\\" arose in the thinking of various eugenicists at this time as a means to euthanize and exterminate the unfit. In particular, this notion was to play a role in the novels of Robert Chambers, and in the thinking of H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw. Explains how this notion was used to promote abortion and the euthanasia of deformed infants.Rasse und Blut - explains how \\"negative eugenics\\" came to be implemented in Germany after Adolf Hitler discovered American eugenicists in his _Mein Kampf_. Notes the role of major American eugenicists such as Charles Davenport and Madison Grant in promoting eugenics and raceology in Germany.Hitler's Eugenic Reich - explains how Hitler came to implement eugenics in Nazi Germany in his persecution of the mentally ill, \\"feeble-minded\\", and handicapped. Notes the role and support of American eugenicists including Lothrop Stoddard for these ideas. Explains the race laws in Nazi Germany as well as the role of American companies such as IBM behind eugenics and the death camps. Notes the importance of Catholic opposition to eugenics in Germany as expressed by the pope and also by Catholic thinkers such as G. K. Chesterton in Britain. Explains how Hitler altered eugenic ideas of Anglo-Saxon and \\"Nordic\\" supremacy to include Aryan and Teutonic supremacy.Buchenwald - explains the role of Katzen-Ellenbogen, a psychoanalyst who promoted eugenics and aided German officers, at Buchenwald concentration camp. Explains how Katzen-Ellgenbogen came to counsel German officers who frequently suffered from neuroses caused by the mass killings they were forced to engage in.Auschwitz - explains the role of Auschwitz concentration camp for implementing human destruction. Notes the prominent role of the eugenic lethal chamber. Shows the inhumane and sick experiments of such individuals as Dr. Josef Mengele on various individuals in the death camps. Notes the prominent role of Nazi science and some of the results that came out of grossly unethical Nazi experimentation. Notes in particular the results of experiments on human reaction to extreme cold and the Nazi doctors' obsession with twins for their experimentation.Newgenics.From Ashes to Aftermath - explains the end of the Nazi terror at the end of World War II. Notes how the Americans came to make use of Nazi experimentation following the Second World War (medical results obtained from experiments conducted on Nazi victims).American Legacy - explains how the results of Nazi medical experimentation were brought to America under Project PAPERCLIP. Notes the prominent role of Nazi science for the American military as well as some of the results obtained through unethical experimentation for medical science. Explains the results of various lawsuits filed by the ACLU against the United States for sterilizing the \\"unfit\\". Notes the prohibition on marriages for the unfit in the United States as well as the advocacy of sterilization by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his remark that \\"three generations of imbeciles is enough\\".Eugenics Becomes Genetics - explains the discrediting of eugenics following the end of World War II but the continuing of some eugenics movements. Explains the role of the new science of genetics but notes its tarnished past in eugenics. Explains how genetics has offered many positive contributions to medical science and humanity but also is fraught with certain dangers. Notes the role of Francis Crick and Thomas Watson who helped discover DNA and their eugenic theories.Newgenics - explains how in the twenty-first century issues raised by eugenics promise to become prominent again. Notes the role of animal cloning and the possibility of human cloning. Notes the role of DNA and genetic testing both for criminal science and the insurance industry (with the dangerous possibility of creating a \\"genetic underclass\\"). Notes important issues raised by bioethicists concerning the new industries of genetic engineering and the possibility of the dangers of eugenics becoming prominent again in a brave new world.This book offers a detailed account of the rise and role of eugenics in America's sordid past. The issue raises many profound philosophical and ethical questions concerning the role of science and bioethics and ethical experimentation. The issue also shows the prominence of race science as well as the role of eugenics in promoting the Nazi state. I felt that while America readily condemns the Nazis it should be noted that many of the ideas implemented by Hitler had their origins in the United States and Britain. Ultimately what becomes of eugenics remains an open question that must be decided by humanity as it approaches a brave new world of genetic engineering."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"You learn something new everyday, here in an important book: the history of the American eugenics movement and its influence on the perpetrators of the Nazi version leading to the Holocaust. Sanitized or amnesiac history has forgotten the details here, and they are grisly, the more so being American data of record, deep in the many archives the author and his team researched. The details include the involvement of many of the foundations, Carnegie, Rockerfeller, et. al. The eugenics era is routinely denounced, but the facts are diffused from discussion and this book is eminently worth reading carefully to see how it actually happened. The account has eye-popping details on every second page,viz. the actual episodes of tracking down hill billies for enforced sterilization. That's right, in the US of A.The cheerleading of the Eugenics movement for the Nazis continued right up through the beginning of World War II in certain scientific journals. After that eugenics became genetics, and the author explores at the end the implications of all this as we enter the age of the genome under the banner of genetic fundamentalism.I would get this book under your belt asap, and it is also an indirect contribution to the legacy of historical Mendelism/Darwinism/Social Darwinism as these generated the milieu for this phase of Americana Goes Haywire. It can happen here. So watch it."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"It's hard to review a book like this: as the author states, each chapter could be a book itself; the volume of information is astounding. The basic thesis is simple: Black brings home the idea that America was a pioneer in the eugenics movement, influencing politics and society worldwide by the early 20th century. Although the most obvious disciple of America's eugenics program is Germany under the Nazis, Black documents how other countries, such as Sweden, Norway and England also took their cues from US policies to regulate marriage and birth of those considered desirable and undesirable.There's simply too much information to fully review, but some of the major items include the fallacy of IQ testing; the campaign to prevent interracial marriage (some laws in the American South lasted into the 21st century); sterilization of those deemed 'feeble-minded' (a very subjective decision made by racists and others with an eugenical agenda); and a general re-ordering of society to create a 'master race'(most evident in Nazi Germany). The final chapter deals with 'Newgenics', and was perhaps the most potentially frightening, as it clarifies the challenges of dealing with genetic issues such as cloning, medical and life insurance based on an individual's genetic 'predisposition' to certain diseases based on family history, and the possible emergence of the designer children by the 'GenRich', those who can afford to create their own mini-master race kids.As a side-note, I found it interesting that although Black devotes several chapters to Germany, there's no mention of the Paraguayan 'Nueva Germania' colony set up by Elizabeth Nietzsche in the 1880s. Like many of the characters Black mentions, Nietzsche and her group wanted to preserve the 'pure' Aryan race they felt was already corrupted in Germany by too many 'outsiders'. Their attempt to create their utopia in South America failed, just as Black's Davenport, Laughlin and others failed in the US. 'The War Against the Weak' is a great addition to modern social science; I learned a lot, and Black's book makes me want to learn more about this topic."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"...and have to say it was a GREAT READ! I'm going to keep this short, simple, and to the point; give this book a shot. I feel I've gained a very unique perspective of WWII and it's relationship to the US.I was walking out of Barnes and Nobles only a week ago as my eyes grazed over the cover of the book on a shelf. Out of curiousity, I picked it up and was immediately engrossed by the first few pages. I venture to say any American would be, too. Edwin Black provides a clear, comprehensible history of not only eugenics, but the formation of modern genetics. You will uncover a largely untold piece of American history, as unbelievable and shocking as it may be. My friends wouldn't believe me when I shared the contents of this book with them; so I challenged them to read it. I finished it in under a week and am passing my copy along to them...I'm also taking the time to write this on Amazon...the book is that good."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"This book lays out a case, in plain language, that diseased ideas can propogate like wildfire, particularly when powerful people get behind them. Adolf Hitler did not just wake up one day and decide that Jews, homosexuals and the mentally disabled should be killed. That idea had been alive, spreading and in fact exported to Europe by US. This may explain why ships of Jewish refugees were turned back from entrance to this country during the war, eventhough everyone knew they would likely face death. This explains why so many Nazi scientists were welcomed into this country to continue biological research after the war.But mostly what this well-researched work shows is the importance for standing up for all people and not assuming that any one of us has the right to determine who is fit or unfit to exist."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"As a child in grade school in the mid-40s I wondered why our principal (and his preacher friend) were always ranting about 'bad blood' and 'sins of the father' - Edwin Black's book, War Against The Weak, sheds great light on their attitudes and demonstrates how famous, well-intentioned people get sucked into evil notions such as Eugenics and other 'absolutes'. Ideas, no matter how bright and glittery, can lead downugly paths and take that evil fork in the road which leads to holocast.This book should be required reading for every freshman college class."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"In chronicaling the eugenics movement in America, Edwin Black fills a much needed void in the study of the history of eugenics and helps to rescue Eugenics from the abuses of Nazi Germany (which are dealt with in the book). I say \\"rescue\\" only meaning that he provides some much needed scholarship on the collusion of America institutions in the founding and propagation/propagandizing of the movement. The book, as you might expect, is full of revelations about the pioneers in America (such as the founder of Planned Parenthood, a woman who would later retreat from her position of birth-control as population control and go to see abortion as a proper alternative for women)and how they were only stopped from implimenting those methods the Nazis would employ less by their consciences, but by a little document called The United States Constitution. He deals with how the movement inspired men all the way up to the president, a man who was enthusiastic about \\"ridding society of its degenerate elements.\\"The book suffers, however, from one, taking an intentionalist view (that the Nazis wanted to annihilate the Jews from day one) of the Nazi atrocities (as opposed to a structuralist view which sees Nazis atrocities against the Jews as an evolution of their policies in general and WWII) and two, by concentrating too heavily on these atrocities. By placing the focus on the Nazi atrocities against the Jews, Black mildly subverts his own thesis which is that Eugenics was never meant to be a war on a certain group (jews)so much as it was a war on many \\"undesirables\\" (including the unemployed, the \\"feeble-minded\\", the blind, the mentally ill, women, the poor, blacks, and American immigrants, just to name a few).That said, the book is still a good read for anyone interested in this subject and in its first section (dealing primarily with America) a fascinating read. (As an addition, check out the documentary Homo Sapiens 1900, directed by Peter Cohen, a film which deals with primarily the Eugenics movement in Europe but touches on the movement's roots in America. It additionally serves as a great, if Eurocentric, introduction to the Eugenics movement.)"},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"This book takes one from the innocent beginnings of eugenics/genetics: A harmless monk's observations of wrinkled pea pods in Europe, through the Carnegie Institution's subsidized archives at that ongoing bastion of racism: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (post publication: Cold Spring's chief, the DNA double-helix co-discoverer -- 1962 Nobel-laureate James D. Watson -- spouted off in Oct 2008, during a UK interview, about black inferiority -- He was forced out as a result.) then straight into the retorts of Auschwitz, and it winds up in current-day insurance-industry genetic databases.Interestingly, IBM facilitates this pseudo-science throughout the Nazi regime.Oddly, and little known, the spark for Germanic racial hygiene policies came fr American eugenics.If humans continue down a genetically revealing, corporately fascistic route, we'll likely repeat history -- create an H.

Chapters trace the roots of the movement to 1904, when a small group of scientists launched a new race-based concept, funded by American corporate institutes and foundations. Eugenics was even sanctioned by the Supreme Court and resulted in racist laws in over 27 states.

True discernment is hard to come by."},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"Oh, wait! This book is about the *saviors* of Western civilization, girding the Western Fortress against the rising tide of the underman - the Culture Bolshevik - from within and without. Those who were warning us against the evils of socialism upon human liberty and the horror of bolshevism upon culture and civilization were at the same time planning their own murderous utopia, based on the self-serving criteria of the West's \\"natural rulers.\\" Overall, a depressing subject - I would much rather write another review on Stalin's 5-Year-Plans than reflect on the sad cruelty of this story.First, Black's research team was meticulous and he did the most thorough job possible of integrating all this into a coherent narrative. Many researchers would lose themselves in this forest of documentation for its leaves of data. In his concluding remarks, Black sums up the psychology of the eugenics movement in the single word *arrogance.\\" I agree. Having myself read many of the original eugenicist monographs, what struck me - beyond the Protestant prudery, typical racism, and patrician snobbery - was the gloating meanness, even sadism, lurking in the pages. Dr. Mengele's ghost hovers close indeed in reading Goddard's \\"Kallikaks.\\" H. G. Wells' Dr. Moreau may be more prophetic than we care to acknowledge as the \\"new genetics\\" of engineered human genomes takes hold in the coming century. Auschwitz may indeed rise again in even more evil forms.I can understand where the eugenicists were coming from, because I have branches in my own family who would have made excellent monograph material: poor, part native American (\\"Redbone\\"), with notable streaks of substance abuse, sexual promiscuity and illegitimacy, welfare, and felony records - the whole regalia of trashdom. Yet this same \\"breed\\" produced stable craftsmen and educated, middle-class professionals. The only purpose of nipping their seed in the bud would be to protect the class privileges of the established against the competition of upwardly-mobile upstarts \\"who don't deserve opportunity - just look at the kind of people they are!\\" That, in a nutshell, was the raison d'etre of the eugenics movement.Black also explores how the social basis of eugenicism was preserved beyond its disgrace by Nazism, in clinical psychology and sociology through the \\"culture of poverty\\" thesis. Although more liberal-sounding than their predecessors, this crowd also devolved into a blame-the-victim rationale for punitive social engineering. Of course, the West is not alone in misusing genetic science. Trofim Lysenko's extreme Lamarckism in trying to breed desert-proof corn nearly brought the Soviet Union to famine. Scientific idiocy and professional vanity know no politics, nationality, or religion.Yet I must take issue with Black's own grandstanding. His status as a well-known journalist and author no doubt facilitated the corporate co-operation he graciously received in digging up dirt on themselves, and the willingness of Virginia to release state files on Carrie Buck. But this is not \\"uncovering\\" anything new per se, as Black claims, though it does fill in some fresh details. The eugenic-Nazi connection was already established in works like J. David Smith's \\"Minds Made Feeble: The Myth and Legacy of the Kallikaks\\" (1985), or Allen Chase's \\"The Legacy of Malthus\\" (1977), or Stephen Jay Gould's \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" (1981), or even Richard Hofstadter's \\"Social Darwinism in American Thought\\" (1955). When established publications rave over this work as \\"groundbreaking,\\" \\"an eye-opener,\\" \\"a bombshell\\" \\"of remarkable new data\\" \\"whose message must be made known,\\" I smell the rat of professional backscratching.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"Black tells a totally different history of The Holocaust than the one that is in current academic fashion. An investigative journalist, he and his team of international researchers have diligently dug up thousands of documents and adroitly connected the dots.What were the factors that led up to The Holocaust? Anti-semitism and racism of course, but there was nothing new about those. The other much overlooked factor is a false science.Its methods were \\"guesswork, gossip, falsified information and polysyllabic academic arrogance\\" justified by a copious collection of records and \\"mathematical acrobatics\\". It was advocated by esteemed professors and elite universities. It was funded by the wealth of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and railroad magnate Harriman among others. It was endorsed by big names like Alexander Graham Bell, famous for inventing the telephone. It was sanctified by politicians, legislators, educators, social workers, and judges including Supreme Court Judge Oliver Wendall Holmes. Its philosophy claimed to draw on the work of the well-known monk Mendel and his experiments on the heredity of pea pods. The writings of Thomas Malthus and Herbert Spencer also influenced it. By the way, it was Spencer, not Darwin, who coined the phrase \\"Survival of the fittest\\". It was Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, who gave this pseudo-science its name: Eugenics.It was also Galton, still today revered as a medical innovator, who suggested \\"wed[ding] ... biology to government action\\" starting with \\"a highly regulated marriage licensing process.\\" Galton, too, was the one who advocated twin studies of mengele infamy. Galton's passion was collecting statistics, a field that today dominates medicine. Black calls him \\"a clever and compulsive counter\\". Galton achieved his fame and fortune not by hard labor, but by being born into an upper class family in class-conscience England. However, his views rapidly crossed the ocean where they were well received.Various social conditions both imagined and real were redefined by eugenicists. US Census Bureau Director Francis Walker, lamenting the waves of brown-haired people whom he considered \\"genetically defective\\" flooding through Ellis Island, called immigration \\"race suicide.\\" Physicians perceived disease as genetically determined, including conditions previously recognized as caused by a blow to the head such as some forms of epilepsy and insanity, as well as contagious illnesses such as tuberculosis. \\"[C]rime was increasingly viewed as a group phenomenon, and ... an inherited family trait. Criminologists and social scientists widely believed in the recently identified 'criminal type,' typified by 'beady eyes' and certain phrenological shapes. ... It was the petty criminals, not the gilded ones, whom polite society perceived as the great genetic menace.\\" The key to wiping out these menaces was considered removing the so affected people from the human gene pool through segregation and sterilization (rendering the person incapable of producing offspring).Other names dotting the chapters of this book include Margaret Sanger, founder of the Birth Control movement. Claiming to base herself on medical authorities, she was an avid proponent of eugenics and coined terminology like \\"vermin\\" and \\"extermination\\". Ophthalmologist Lucien Howe, who had introduced bathing newborns' eyes with silver nitrate drops to fight neonatal infection, campaigned for sterilizing blind people, even though more than 90% of them had no blind relatives at all. New York urologist William Robinson advocated gassing the children of the unfit with chloroform or potassium cyanide. In England \\"eugenic extremist George Bernard Shaw lectured at London's Eugenics Education Society about mass murder in lethal chambers\\" which he endorsed. Then Home Secretary Winston Churchill \\"reassured ... eugenicists that ... 120,000 feebleminded persons should, if possible, be segregated under proper conditions so that their curse died with them and was not transmitted to future generations.\\"Back in the US schemes for hunting down the perceived genetically inferior were proposed. These included sending questionnaires to schools to collect information on their pupils. \\"Measuring man's intelligence had always been a eugenic pursuit\\" Black points out. \\"The movement [amassed] volumes of data on families and individuals by combining equal portions of gossip, race prejudice, sloppy methods and leaps of logic, all caulked together by elements of actual genetic knowledge to create the glitter of a genuine science.\\"Critics? Yes, there were some. One was ironically British scientist David Herron, writing in a Galton Laboratory publication, who called American eugenics \\"rubbish\\". Another penned an editorial in the San Francisco Daily News asserting -The millions of ... Harriman ... Rockefeller and Carnegie, are to be devoted to sterilization of several hundred thousands of American \\"defectives\\" annually, as a matter of eugenics. ... We see that our moneyed plutocrats can own the governments of whole states, override constitutions, maintain private armies to shoot down men, women and children, and railroad innocent men to life imprisonment ... we ought not to be surprised if they ... sterilize all those who are obnoxious to them.Some at the US Census Bureau resisted eugenics in a protracted bureaucratic battle. Bell eventually started having misgivings and bowed out of the movement. Published under the pseudonym of Ezekiel Cheever, a 47-paged booklet lampooned \\"Naughty Germ Plasms\\" calling eugenics \\"one of the greatest blunders made by scientific men in America the past fifty years\\" and \\"statistical legerdemain\\". But high-ranking eugenicists dismissed their critics as \\"paranoiacs and imbeciles\\" and \\"heckler-critics\\".Eugenic law was spearheaded by the US state of Virginia. Here Walter A. Plecker, a physician born at the beginning of the US Civil War, became county health officer. As such he was in a position to enact bureaucratic registration, prevent racially mixed marriages, expel students suspected of having black ancestry from their schools, and segregate railroad coaches. Many other states followed, with California performing the most forced sterilizations.Having imported eugenics from England, the US now exported it back to Europe. \\"Harvard professor Robert De Courcy Ward advocated eugenic screening of immigrant candidates before they even reached U.S. shores.\\" Leading eugenicist Harry Laughlin proposed introducing \\"legislation to create a corps of eugenic 'immigration attach&eacute;s' stationed at American consulates across Europe and eventually the entire world.\\" America's consuls with their \\"biological preferences and prejudices would become insurmountable barriers to many fleeing oppression\\" during Europe's pre-Holocaust era.\\"After purifying America from within and preventing defective strains from reaching U.S. shores,\\" writes Black, \\"they planned to eliminate undesirables from the rest of the Planet.\\" The first international meeting advocating eugenics was held in the cradle of eugenics: London. Delegates arrived from the US, England, Belgium Denmark France, Germany, Italy, and Norway. World War I set eugenic efforts back, particularly as German eugenicists refused to participate alongside delegates from their country's enemies Belgium and France. The second international eugenic congress was held after WWI in New York. The US organizers endeavored to pull the Germans back into their ranks.In Switzerland eugenics was led by psychiatrist Auguste Forel. In Denmark it was Dr. Tage Kemp who was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Norway joined, led by its raceologist Jon Alfred Mjen, and enacting compulsory sterilization laws that lasted from 1922 to 1977. Sweden performed no less than 63,000 sterilizations, mostly on women. Finland, Hungary, France, Romania, Italy and other European nations followed suit. But \\"One nation ... would go further than anyone could imagine.\\" Germany.The last section of the book titled \\"Newgenics\\" is at the same time Black's finest and his most fumbled. Notwithstanding that compulsory sterilization around the world including the US continued until the seventies and beyond while limitations on immigration were never revoked, eugenicists dissociated themselves from The Holocaust by changing the name of their pseudo-science to genetics. Black most astutely recognizes the traps this supposedly new science sets for us and the human rights violations inherent in its practice. Yet he tempers his warnings by postulating that genetics is basically a legitimate and effective discipline. \\"So much is possible: genetic therapies ... and ... modification of the genes responsible for adverse behaviors, such as aggression and gambling addiction.\\" In fact, none of this is possible nor will it ever be. In spite of decades of well-funded research, no \\"genetic therapies\\" exist other than genetic screening, which amounts to prenatal eugenics. As for \\"adverse behaviors\\", they simply have nothing to do with genes.One of Black's earlier publications related to a subject of MeTZelf concern isIBM and the Holocaust. Both books are thoroughly researched and highly recommendable particularly for the reader seeking to connect history with present medical practice.Copyright MeTZelf"},{"Title":"War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race","review":"As I history major, I was always indirectly fed the narrative that history always progresses. The over simplified version of this is that the progressive \\"scientific\\" types are constantly having to battle it out with the religious \\"barbaric\\" types for the betterment of humanity. Well, the eugenics movement in America and abroad certainly contradicts that argument. It reminds us that such progressive luminaries as Margaret Sanger, Alexander Graham Bell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mary Harriman, and even to some degree Justice Louis Brandeis were sympathetic to the \\"science\\" of eugenics. It seemed that in this particular case, it was many of the \\"backwards\\" religious people who thought the eugenics movement to be an abomination. This is a story that needs to be told again and again.Edwin Black does not make this argument directly.

I wanted to move into web development, so I had to learn Java. Unfortunately, I bought two other books before this one. This is very clear, very concise, and doesn't assume that you're already a C programmer! What's that about? This book is laid out and organized very well, and is very easy to read. Concepts are expanded on through the use of analogies, which makes them much easier to recall from memory. Excellent for people like me who didn't know what a compiler was and never programmed in ANY language. I love this book - thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Java for Students","review":"I've been trying to teach myself programing for the last year and a half. I've tried several languages and a number of those &quot;teach yourself in x hours/days&quot; books. I've finished many of those books and re-read several of them as well. However, sit me down and solve a problem? --just couldn't do it. This book helped for a number of reasons:1. It pretty much focuses on Applets. This helps by not bogging you down with two many libraries (which you encounter when you switch from applets to applications). You're able to deal with a few things alot and get really familiar with them.2. It has a lot of examples at the end of each chapter to help you review and incorporate what you've learned. (Examples are related to skills you've just learned and do not incorporate new ones out of the blue).3. It seemed the authors had considerable teaching experience. They really hammered on points that other authors just &quot;blow&quot; over...like &quot;What is a constructor?&quot;, &quot;How do you use the &quot;this&quot; keyword?&quot;..4. It stays concise within a smaller segment of Java. You deal primarily with the AWT, as opposed to Swing.5. It uses examples that are easy to conceptualize. You don't have to mess with binary, hexadecimal, and octal numbers and use mathmatical formulas all the time--like you do in Beginning Java.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to build foundational skills and who needs to understand why they did something as much as how they did it."},{"Title":"Java for Students","review":"This book is perfect for my students. It presents the concepts in small simple steps. It introduces graphics early on so that the students can appreciate their work. Events are covered early on too so that they can create interactive software. (This first edition covers Java 1.0 event model. The second edition -- sold in Europe is even better -- it covers the Java 1.1 &amp; 1.2). Objects and inheritance are covered in a timely manner. My students find this book clear and straight forward. By the end of the book all major features are covered -- including threads and exceptions. This book is not a complete reference book and is better for it. Once my students understand what's going on I send them to reference books to find out all the intimate details. This book is just right for beginning high school students with no programming experience. Job well done.PS -- if anyone is interested I have lecture notes and theory quizzes that I could share with others."},{"Title":"Java for Students","review":"For several years I have been struggling with understanding programming. Networking training often references C or C++ or Visual Basic ideas to illustrate concepts as if everyone understands their basics. I have beat my head against a wall trying to follow along with texts on scripting and Active Server Pages because these books often assume familiarity with fundamental programming concepts. I even read SAMS Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours without learning enough to put everything together. And then I found Java for Students by Douglas Bell and Mike Parr.Java for Students is written for people with absolutely no prior knowledge of programming. Books often say things like this and then after the first chapter or two take off into the skies where it is impossible for many to follow. This book taught me to fly!Like many introductory books you write your first Java program inside the first 20 pages. And then the authors continue to provide example after example and more than 100 exercises that build progressively on the information presented until you really get the hang of programming in Java and understanding programming concepts - variables, calculations, methods, parameters, events, decisions, repetition, objects, classes, inheritance, arrays, string manipulation, exception handling, packages, abstract classes, interfaces, threads... My proudest moment was when I scanned through the Glossary at the very end of the book and really understood all the terms included. If you want to understand programming in general and Java specifically, this is a great place to start.These authors do an excellent job of presenting essential information in a simple fashion and then adding more details and complexity as you progress through the book. They presented code that illustrated concepts and syntax in early chapters that they added to in subsequent chapters to demonstrate additional features or problem solving methods. The result was an opportunity to develop confidence and familiarity without being overwhelmed with all the details at once. At the end of each chapter Bell and Parr included a Grammar Spot, Programming Pitfalls, New Language Elements, and a Summary. They did a good job of reinforcing important points.The authors teach in the UK and the book has a funny mixture of British and US influences. I was a little nervous when an exercise invited creating a program to calculate making change for a soft drink machine in British money but then they offered an overview of UK coins and a suggestion to work in the common denominator, pence. I did not find any difficulties following the discussions as an American.I noticed more editing problems in the last third of the book - missing words, mislabeled material. This was a little challenging but if you were following along closely you could understand what was meant. It was more disconcerting than anything else.The book refers to a website that provides the source code for all the examples and demonstrations of their running...I liked this book a lot. If you need to start with the basics I think you will too!"},{"Title":"Java for Students","review":"As a Java instructor, I respect the author's attempt to create a Java Textbook; this is not a simple task. However, I must say that this particular text is NOT a good choice for use in an Introductory Java course. I found this book a very difficult read, as some other reviewers have also commented - statements are tedious and at times you get the impression that the authors real intent is to convey how eloquent he can formulate his statements rather than convey a clear understanding of the technical principles being described. I find myself constantly wishing he'd &quot;get to the point&quot;.Java is all about Objects, yet OOP is only presented later in the text, and then as an after thought. I've seen this in other books too, where you get the impression the author is not comfortable with OOP and prefers to provide an explanation of classic procedural programming techniques, rather than embrassing and exploiting the benefits of OOP as provided with a langauge like Java. The student may come away with a basic understanding of Java syntax, but will not adequetly appreciate or understand the fundamental reasons we're using Java instead of COBOL, PASCAL, or BASIC - it isn't just becuase it's a cool language.The focus on Applets may be useful for grabing the initial interest of the student and learning &quot;fun&quot;, but by ignoring the more important role of java applications is doing students a disservice. Applets today are taking a less significant role in web application developement with the use of .NET and JSP.There are many better choices: the Dietel books, Core Java, BlueJ.org, etc."},{"Title":"Java for Students","review":"From my own experience I found trying to learn from this book an extremely difficult task especially being new to programming in general.

The examples are very clear for students to understand. All of the main concepts are explained in the textbook. It is easy to supplement AP questions for the AP Computer Science class.

It speaks plain English, and explains things on the spot instead of annoyingly putting them off for later. The only edge I could possibly see for &quot;Students&quot; is that there are more exercises.The main problem with the Bell/Parr book is that these two English university men have serious difficulties with English, and apparently can't get any help from their editors. Sentences whose meaning is effectively hidden in a subsidiary clause are their forte. Yes, just like the last sentence!From page 88: &quot;The amount the value is changed if the area between the slider and the end of the range is clicked is 1.&quot;What they said: &quot;... so don't be disappointed if you get some error messages. One of the standing jokes of programming is that error messages from compilers are often cryptic and unhelpful.&quot;What they meant: &quot;Unfortunately, you can't expect much help from these messages. Most are so cryptic and unhelpful that they are a standing joke among programmers.&quot;Save money. Avoid tantrums caused by mangled English. Buy &quot;21 days&quot;.

Many people forget that Luther was primary and professor of the Old Testament and that he often found God's grace and mercy-later fulfilled in Jesus Christ-foreshadowed in the Old Testament's writings and stories.The little book of Jonah is a great example. Many of us know the story of \`Jonah and the Whale,\\" but the book is about so much more. For Luther, Jonah is the archetype of the preacher, or any bearer of God's message. We, like Jonah, are not always faithful or obedient to God's will and calling. God, despite our unfaithfulness, is ever faithful. God's Word will go out, despite our failings and incompleteness. The great inside joke of the biblical book is that Jonah succeeds in converting the hated Ninevehites in the face of his rebellion, lackluster effort, and post-event pouting. It is certainly not Jonah's stellar personality or preaching that changes the hearts and minds of these Assyrians, but the power of God's Word to affect change. He is the vessel; the Word is the treasure. In other words, Luther writes, we are not the object of the message, we are not the power that makes it work, and the success of the gospel is not dependant on our personality and persuasive power. Neither is the failure of others to receive the gospel always our fault either, \\"Jonah is also an object of comfort for all who administer the Word. It teachers them not to despair of the fruit of the Gospel, no matter how badly it appears devoid of fruit and profit.\\" (pg. 36)I have always felt that Luther's commentary on Jonah should be required annual reading for all pastors, teachers and others who minister in the church. We would do well to be challenged and comforted by the example of Jonah and Luther's exegesis of the gospel for us all."},{"Title":"Lemuria: The Lost Continent of the Pacific","review":"I loved this book. In a matter of fact way it presents the concept that the ancient continent of Lemuria was completely real, and there are maps to prove it! I especially loved the claim that Lemuria is still in existence on the West Coast of the US, specifically in the Mr. Shasta area of northern CA, i.e. the part that didn't sink into the ocean. This book was written in 1931, and is apparently the definitive New Age tome on this subject."},{"Title":"Lemuria: The Lost Continent of the Pacific","review":"This book was printed back in 1930's.

I had heard that Pratchett was \\"satirical\\", \\"devious\\", \\"irreverent\\", \\"magical\\", \\"entertaining\\" and \\"above all funny\\".Sadly \\"Men at Arms\\" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of \\"ho ho ho see how clever I am!\\" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame.

This book deal with some very serious historical delima regarding the classic case of the stranger hero who is the long lost king of some kingdom.This book is one of the latter in Terry Pratchett writing career when he has fully develop his Discworld story structure. All of Pratchett's latter books deal with some major social issue that exist in historical or modern time. He deal with them in a highly intellectual manner using extremely complex humourous satirical technique.All of the latter books are very funny, and intellectually charllenging. To the reader with some historical knowledge of the jokes and anecdote provided by Pratchett, his book is intriging. I would advise anyone with interest in the real world as well as those looking for a great piece of literature to read Pratchett.This is a great book about a young copdude who would be king, little dragons, and a world where science, magic, fantasy, and who know what else is mixed. The story line is interesting and funny, character very well developed. Books rarely come better than this. Pratchett is underappreciated because virtually no American (beside myself) know of his work, not even well read english professors!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I love the Night Watch novels, I am reading the third at the moment, I can't stop!

In Men at Arms we get the next instalment of Corporal Carrot and the retirement of Sam Vimes. Of course there is a threat to Ankh Morpork and Discworld as a whole but it's not the overblown rip of fabric of reality into the dungeon dimension (or similar) of previous books. Much more subtle and interesting. Great little plot (with a very unexpected villain), and the characters just keep getting more interesting and complex as the series progresses."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I just finished re-reading this novel, which remains high in my esteem. My review will contain some spoilers, so avoid it id you don't like those. Its main theme is the final success of integrating city minorities, starting with a dwarf, a troll and a woman, into the all-male Watch. Dwarfs and trolls are ancient enemies from the mountains, now moving in droves into Discworld's biggest city, Ankh-Morpork. Putting two of them together as a police team seems insoluble, and would be but for Corporal Carrot. The new watchwoman is also a werewolf (actually werewolfhound), and her kind of minority is shunned by just about everyone--except Carrot--but Angua no longer bites people and is trying to be a vegetarian! There are numerous subplots, skilfully woven into the main story--the insanity of extreme royalist snobbery; the growing affection between Sam Vimes and Sibyl Ramkin, his temporary backslide into alcoholism, Sibyl's steadfastness and (at the end of the book) a happy beginning; the reluctantly heroic talking mutt, Gaspode, who reminds me of Huckleberry Finn (he refused to be &#34;sivilized&#34;). Most relevant to our own problems is the &#34;gonne&#34; (the earliest English spelling of &#34;gun&#34;) invented by Leonard of Quirm. Supposedly it was destroyed, but instead was put away in a private museum and stolen. Like our own guns, it has a murderous personality of its own that infects its users, but Discworld is luckier than our world. At the story's end the gonne is destroyed by Carrot--and there are no others in existence."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Terry Pratchett is a fantastic author.

Will Vimes and the rest of the watch be able to stop d'Eath? Or, should d'Eath prevail, will the new monarch be up for the job?Like the rest of the discworld books, this is an easy, pleasant read. I enjoyed getting to learn more about Carrot Ironfoundersson (a charismatic two meter tall dwarf) and the aura which surrounds him.Is it a great book? No. I didn't like it as much asGuards! Guards!for example. But it's a *good* book and well worth reading, especially if you enjoyed Guards! Guards! Four stars."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This is my second Pratchett read, and I'm convinced that it will be unlikely to find one of his books that I won't enjoy. This one follows the City Watch, which is basically the police, as they try to unravel the mysterious murders that are suddenly happening in Ankh-Morpork. They are an organization in decline, without much real work to do or skills to practice, until now. Many colorful characters are enountered, and there are a surprising number of relevant and keen observations about the life of law enforcement personnel in general. One particular character, Carrot, is a fine example of that rare person who attracts and inspires people, without seeming to try. The book is witty, fun, and funny. There are a lot of different types of characters, including dwarfs, trolls, dogs, werewolves, thieves and assassins, and it makes for a story that is never slow or dull. One minor distraction for me was the often-encountered passages where I could not readily identify the character who was speaking. It required a little sorting out at times. But there is a lot to enjoy and recommend, in this very non-traditional humorous fantasy."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"to funny to be real. i don't ask for much more in a discworld novel."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards!

In this book, Pratchett does a multi-cultural transformation of the Watch, transitions Vimes from a Captain to a Mr., and, one way or another, brings Carrot into his own.

She has just joined the Night Watch under the Equal Species Act, along with Detritus the Troll and Cuddy the Dwarf.No wonder Sam, who is a bit of a male chauvinist speciesist is going to retire.Not since Stephen King's \\"It\\" have clowns gotten such bad press as in \\"Men at Arms.\\" They seem to be the saddest creatures on Discworld. One of them, Beano is murdered and ends up playing 'Knock Knock - Who's There?' with Death, who is trying to develop a sense of humor.Humor will never be the strong suite of a hooded, seven-foot skeleton with glowing blue eyes, but Death does get in one inadvertently funny line. He tells Beano to think of his newly deceased state as being 'DIMENSIONALLY DISADVANTAGED.'Meanwhile back in the world of the living and undead, Captain Sam Vimes and his command investigate the circumstances of Beano's death. Sam is also under orders from his wife-to-be to find a missing swamp dragon, which is likely to explode if it comes under stress.When a large hole is blown in the headquarters of the Assassin's Guild, Sam has a pretty good notion of what caused the explosion. What he really wants to know is whether this latest calamity has something to do the Beano's death. After all, the Assassins are right next door to the Guild of Fools and Clowns.What he does not yet know is that mad genius, Leonard of Quirm's deadliest invention has fallen into the hands of a rabid monarchist who will do everything in his power to restore Ankh-Morpork's rightful king---and that king is a member of his own Night Watch.\\"Men at Arms\\" (1993) is another great slapstick-with-a-message adventure in the Sam Vimes/Night Watch Discworld novels.

But &quot;Men at Arms,&quot; the first Pratchett novel I've ever read, is the funniest most entertaining read I've had in years, in ANY genre.My only problem now is that I want to go right out and read the other 20+ novels ASAP, but fear I will lose my job because I am reading them under my desk at the office, and lose my husband because I wake him up laughing so hard while reading in bed.BTW if you want a real treat, try this (or other Pratchetts) on audio CD/cassette/download. The fellow doing the reading (Nigel Planer?) is a riot. Plus, if you listen in your car on the way to work, you can keep your job and your spouse."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Of all Pratchett's brilliantly drawn characters, Samuel Vimes stands unique in providing a realistic role model for the rest of us. He's honest, forthright, deeply suspicious of aristocracy, and best of all, despises the idea of kings. The last is important here, for someone wishes the return of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy. And Sam Vimes' remote ancestor, Old Stoneface, executed the last one.Edward d'Eath [how does PTerry come up with these names?!], an impoverished aristocrat, seeks fulfillment of his destiny by restoring the monarchy. Recruiting fellow lords to his cause proves difficult. It's been a long time since the last king, and the Patrician runs the city with commendable, if frightening, efficiency. So Edward embarks on a solitary campaign.Pratchett's inventive mind takes us from the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre into the murder mystery domain. Murder isn't a common event on the Discworld, and its occurrence here creates an intensity of feeling rarely evoked by Pratchett's works. Vimes is particularly irritated by such abhorrent events as murder. Assassination is bad enough, although carefully regulated by its Guild. For Vimes, murder is too arbitrary. It reflects the one aspect of society he resents the most, the exercise of absolute power. He's affronted both as a copper and a man.Partly inspired by Corporal Carrot, Vimes is no longer content having the Watch &quot;let things lie anymore&quot;. Forces that used to push a drunken Vimes into the gutter are forces he now resists, even struggles to overcome. It's an inspiring read watching Pratchett give Vimes a new sense of dedication. Vimes has always sought justice, and his recent rise in society and the Watch has given him fresh impetus, and clout, to gain it. However, first he must survive. He's up against a new force. A force of absolute power, without soul or pity - the Gonne.There are other aspects in this book beyond the new Old Stoneface trying to catch a murderer. Pratchett pays homage to the struggle for women's and immigrants' rights in Britain [and elsewhere]. The Watch has been compelled to recruit dwarves, trolls and, um, a woman. Sergeant Colon's attempts to reconcile size, attitudes and anatomy with a traditional human, male, role must bring tears to the eyes of all recruiting sergeants reading it. Pratchett's sympathetic view of Angua pays homage to the efforts of women striving to enter men's realms. But for a novel view of the world we all inhabit, there's few that can out-express Gaspode, one of Pratchett's finest creations.Pratchett possesses a superior ability to create timeless works. Nestled in this library since its publication, this book is taken up as an old friend for repeated enjoyment. There's nothing lost in re-reading Men At Arms - the issues remain timely, the characters worth noting - sometimes emulating, and the wit undiminished. If you're new to Pratchett, this is a fine place to start. If you're coming along in the Discworld sequence, be prepared for an item of exceptional value, something beyond the humorous fantasy of wizards, witches and Mort's employer."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Edward D'Eath by chance becomes obsessed with the royal line of Anhk Morpork, the city watch enjoys the benefits of several directions of integration, Sam Vimes of the Night Watch prepares to retire to a life of comfort and other torments, the harsh and serious nature of clowns is considered, the genteel and sophisticated nature of Assassins is considered, and the fruits of allowing a certifiable genius to run loose with tools are sown.As an obsessed Assassin works behind the scenes to restore the heir to the royal family of Anhk Morpork to the throne, the unsuspecting presumed heir walks the streets of Anhk Morpork commanding the respect of the crimenal element of the city. This is most unusual as he is a junior Watchman.An invention of Leonard of Quirm is loose in the city, and as the inventions of madmen and geniuses (and Leonard is both in his own special fashion) are wont to do, it is making mischief.Sam Vimes is about to marry the wealthiest woman in the city, and the clash of cultures is brilliant social commentary.And the dogs of A-MP have a leader with a dark vision of the supremacy of canines over bipeds...This is Terry Pratchett at his best! Discworld is in fine form, reflecting the obsession with royals, gun control, affirmative action, political action, and the dark side of clowns. One of the best of DIscworld."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Captain Sam Vimes is about to become wealthy, married, and retired from his career in the City Watch. When a strange explosion occurs in the Assassins Guild, it really isn't his business--especially when Vetinari, the Patrician, specifically orders him to stay clear. Vimes's common sense wars with his self-defined duty and duty wins--at least until Vetinari calls him in for a second appointment (nobody wants a second appointment with the city's strange and nearly omnicient leader). For Vimes, the bottle is the way out. But Corporal Carrot isn't about to let a little thing like Vetinari's orders keep him from donig the right thing (Carrot always does the right thing) and pushes on in Vimes's absence.MEN AT ARMS tells the story of the fundamental reshaping of the City Watch under the combined influence of Vetinari, Vimes, and Carrot. The Watch is expanded from all-human to include dwarves, trolls, and a beautiful werewolf. Vetinari's policy of constructive anarchy may allow the city to work after a fashion, but a watch made up of misfits from all walks of life can certainly help. The novel is a near-continuation of the very fine GUARDS! GUARDS!Author Terry Pratchett combines puns, outrageous and over-the-top action, and real insights into humanity in ways that keep the reader laughing and thinking at the same time. Both Vetinari and Carrot are admirable, but both are also beyond most of our reach. Vimes, in contrast, is every-man. His dilemmas are those that all of us must face. That Vimes can rise (and sometimes fall) to the occasion brings some hope that any of us could do so too. Pratchett's work is at its best when it uses Discworld as a backdrop for the actions and decisions of its all-too-human sapients, and MEN AT ARMS is a fine example of exactly this."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Captain Samuel Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Guard is about to be married to Lady Sybil Ramkin, an incredibly rich woman who is totally into Dragons. Because Lady Ramkin finds the current job of her fianc&eacute; too dangerous -clearly forgetting that being blown to smithereens by a sick dragon is not commonly known as a \`safe' job opportunity- Captain Vimes decides to retire and dedicate his life to Dragons and other so-called \`nobilities'. Subsequently, a new league of City Guards has to be found and trained. In these modern times it is fashionable to be ethnically correct and in the true spirit of this trend: Lance-constable Detrius (a troll who hits himself unconscious if he salutes), Lance-constable Cuddy (a \`short'-tempered dwarf) and Lance-constable Angua (most of the time a woman) become the new recruits. When a series of murders leads to a strange theft of an even weirder weapon, their first ordeal is about to start. To make matters worse, the culprit seems to be a troll and... not everyone is happy about this.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel to feature the Night Watch (Vimes, Colon, Carrot and Nobby); the first one is Guards! Guards! These two books certainly belong to the highlights of the Discworld series. Their characters are so colourfully rich and funny, that actually they do not need a strong plot to entertain the reader. Nevertheless Terry Pratchett has delivered with Men at Arms one of his strongest story-lines. It reads like a good suspense novel where you can actually try to find out actually who did it - you won't succeed, of course, but that's part of the fun, isn't it. It's not without reason that Captain Vines sometimes sounds like Inspector Columbo. A lot of funny sidekicks make their appearance: Death tries to become a more \`complete' person, Leonard de Quirm has problems naming his numerous inventions, the speaking dog Gaspode finds a girlfriend, Captain Quirke of the Day Watch shows what the word stupid really means and many, many others. Ever wondered why trolls count like this: one, two, many, many-one, many-two, many-many? Then you simply must read this book!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I loved this book! Men at Arms is the second Pratchett Novel I have read the first being Feet of Clay. I found everything in this book to be creative and hilarious the dog talking dog Gaspode especially. Prattchett and his wonderful creation discworld teach people that a story can be entertaing without dirty words and sex."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"\\"Men at Arms\\" is the fifteenth novel in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series and the second to focus on Sam Vimes and Ankh-Morpork's City Guard. Although its reputation may have raised very slightly, having rescused the City from a large and angry dragon, it's still not the fine and noble profession it once was.Sam is the Captain of the Night Watch, though he is on the verge of retiring and will soon marry Lady Ramkin, the noted dragon-fancier. It isn't entirely clear, however, whether or not he's entirely happy about either the retirement or his impending life of marital bliss. It's fair to say he's not your typical hero : he hates the Undead (some of my best friends are werewolves), Assassins (a perfectly respectable profession) and - in keeping with an old family tradition - Kings (not an ideal musketeer then). Sam's also trying to quit drinking and has taken up smoking cigars to soften the blow.The Night Watch has had a couple of new recruits since \\"Guards! Guards!\\" - largely at the insistence if the Patrician, the city's ruler. The recruits - Lance-Constables Cuddy (a dwarf), Detritus (a troll) and Angua (a woman, for most of the month) - have been selected to reflect Ankh-Morpork's \`ethnic makeup'. Although Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs are Sam's most experienced officers, the most capable is Carrot. Although born human, Carrot was raised as a dwarf and is an incredibly innocent character - he still hasn't figured out what seamstresses do for a living. He has, however, figured out how Ankh-Morpork works and has stopped trying to arrest the President of the Thieves Guild. The trouble begins when Edward d'Eath suspects that Carrot may be the rightful king of Ankh-Morpork.Edward is the latest Lord d'Eath, albeit a very poor one, following the recent death of his father. He was educated at the Guild of Assassins, where he became the first student to gain full marks at postgraduate level. His suspicions about Carrot are a little worrying, given that he wants to restore the monarchy. This will, of course, see the Patrician \`removed' from office - something that should be easier now that he has acquired a weapon that shouldn't exist.Pratchett's books are always very funny and this one is no exception. Despite being the second book to focus on the Night Watch, there's no real requirement to have read the first - the newcomer won't feel \`left out'. (However, I would recommend reading it, all the same !). Another big plus is Gaspode, Ankh-Morporks finest talking dog. Like Carrot, he's also devoted to Angua - though he's a lot less innocent ! Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Men at Arms reunites us with the stalwart defenders of our beloved Ankh-Morpork: the Night Watch. Along the way we also meet up with some of the Discworld's most distinctive secondary characters (including Foul Ole Ron and Big Fido), get a glimpse of affirmative action Ankh-Morpork-style, discover the identity of the rightful king (if Ankh-Morpork still had a king, which it doesn't, which isn't the fault of the shady characters in this book trying to replace the Patrician with the aforementioned heir to the throne, who doesn't want the job anyway), converse once more with Gaspode the talking dog, and - if that's not enough - make ready for the wedding of the year between Captain Samuel Vimes of the Night Watch and Lady Sybil Ramkin, proprietor of the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons and the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork. Captain Vimes is in fact retiring from the Watch, but his retirement involves much more than the traditional gift watch presentation from his men. A washed-up aristocrat named Edward D'eath takes it upon himself to restore the long-lost monarchy, a circumstance that can only come about over the Patrician's dead body. Even clowns aren't safe from this deadly conspiracy.The trouble begins with an explosion and robbery at the Guild of Assassins. Someone has stolen nothing less than the only \\"gonne\\" on Discworld, and a series of murders shock the town. OK, nothing's really going to shock the people of Ankh-Morpork, but the fact that people keep turning up full of holes where guts should be definitely stirs up the Watchmen. The Patrician is also less than happy about things, so he makes sure the Watch gets to the bottom of things by forbidding Captain Vimes to investigate. The Watch itself is growing; thanks to some new laws pushed through by the Silicon Anti-Defamation League, it has ethnically balanced itself with the addition of a dwarf, a troll, and a woman to the force. The woman, Angua, also happens to be a werewolf, and I don't have to tell you that dwarfs and trolls are natural enemies. Luckily, Constable Carrot, the 6'6\\" dwarf (he was adopted, you know) who is just so doggoned nice that people will actually listen to him and do as he requests, is there to keep the Watch united and performing its duty the way Carrot (alone) thinks it should be done. After a dwarf is killed and a troll arrested by the Day Watch (on the basis that any troll is surely guilty of something), there's an ever-present danger that the city's trolls and dwarfs will have a go at each other (and it won't be like last time, when both groups somehow managed to ambush one another at the same time).Constable Detritus really steals the show here. Watching a troll think is always entertaining, but Detritus really comes into his own as this story progresses. At first, he can't salute without knocking himself out, but by the end he's recruiting and training fellow trolls (in his own endearing way) and warming up quite well to his dwarf partner. He also manages to show us that, in the right conditions (such as the kind of very cold temperature you find in a pork futures market), trolls can be brilliant thinkers.People always die in Discworld novels, but there was one death in Men at Arms that really took me by surprise. A bit sad, it was. Don't be sad about Captain Vimes leaving the Night Watch, though. Furthermore, don't worry about the future of the City Guard, as it does not fall into the hands of Sergeant Colon or Corporal Nobbs (who, as we all know, has already been disqualified from the human race for shoving). I'm sure the men and women and dwarfs and trolls and werewolf of the Night Watch will be as ready as ever for the next threat that rears its ugly head in Ankh-Morpork; after all, Carrot's still on the job."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This is the greatest Discworld book there is!...You have to read it!...

Even more, I just loved Carrot (that combination of innocence and strength gets me every time!). Have also read Guards! Guards!, which introduces Carrot (as you can see I'm a bit obsessed here) and Feet of Clay which goes further into the Carrot/Angua thing. Anybody else who likes Carrot, please drop me a line. Also if you know of other Discworld books with Carrot in it. Apart from Carrot, this is definitely a book to read!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Now, I know a lot of people like Carrot, but the fact is, I've never liked typcial hero characters, they always come off too flat for me, and Carrot is a generic hero character. The worst thing is, he was a pretty good character in &quot;Guards Guards!&quot;, but he loses the innocent touch that made him endearing in GG!, and turns into a generic hero here. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the prescence of Vimes and the return of Gaspode (who is even funnier here than he was in Moving Pictures, his first appearance), and a slew of new characters, and other characters getting new dimensions to their character (like Detritus), and Nobby, but most of the book focuses on Carrot and Carrot only, and I can't say I liked that.It's a shame, because otherwise, this is a really good book. Someone gets his hands on a strange new weapon and is killing people with it. the Night Watch follows the case, with new members Cuddy, Angua, and Detritus, in addition to the older members, Carrot, Colon, Nobby, and Captain Vimes. Vimes, however, is going to be married to Lady Ramkin, Carrot follows the case. The other members tag along for good measure (although there are some good sequences with Cuddy and Detritus). Gaspode the Wonderdog shows up to help.The plot runs along smoothly for the most part, except when Carrot gets seriously involved, and the whole clown thing was kind of contrived. This is a mystery story, which is good. I like mysteries.Overall, if you can get over the prescence of Carrot (or better ye, if you end up liking Carrot, which many people did), you'll enjoy this book a lot. And that's all I can say, so have a nice day."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"O.K., some of the discworld novels are better than others, and I can't write a review on every single one. This one is my favourite Discworld novel.I loved the way the whole thing got something of amystery novel, (naturally in this point Feet of Clay is more rewarding). I don't know why, but only Terry Pratchett seems to be able to managethis kind of fantasy. The few other examples of funny fantasy I tried weren't hardly very funny at all.Other authors just steal from Tolkien, or (directly or via Tolkien) from some mythology.Well, Pratchett also does, the world being carried on the back of a turtle isn't his very own idea, but his way of using other sources is far more elegant than those of any other author I've ever read (except Tolkien perhaps, but you hardly can really compare other authors with Tolkien).Other authors steal, Pratchett hints.And within all the books there's a vast amount of moral, sometimes more, sometimes less, that would be boring with any other author, but with Pratchett it's just more fun.If the man's been able to write about 20 novels in the last years, that are that good, I'm quite confident, that he'll manage this some more years, and I'm always eagerly awaiting the next one.Yes, naturally, close up to Men at Arms there isGuards!

And this is hardly Pratchett's worst (that would probably be Soul Music or Maskerade). But, this book doesn't crackle and fizz with the subversive humor, satire, and insight into the human condition of his other books. This book is kind of, well, dull in parts.I have to confess that much of that might be my fault... this is a cop's story, a mystery, beyond all else. And, try as I might, I just can't care about mystery stories.However, Carrot and Vimes, two of the Night Watch's finest, are certainly engaging characters and Pratchett does manage to bring his wild humor into a rather mundane mystery story. He is still a sharp-eyed philosopher with a keen understanding of human nature. But I just can't help thinking that this could have been a better book. Maybe the Librarian wasn't in it enough... he can save even the WORST Pratchett book (as Soul Music demonstrates)."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I've listened to \\"Lords and Ladies\\" in the abridged and unabridged versions and can only recommend the unabridged.The person who did the abridging seems to have gone about it by discarding every other chapter from the unabridged book. The story jerked along so confusingly, I wasn't sure at the end what the plot had been about other than Elves coming back from exile. Tony Robinson's reading only added to the confusion, his store of \\"voices\\" consisted of \\"regular voice\\", \\"low volume hissed voice\\", \\"loud voice\\". LVHV was used for the Elf Queen and several other characters and was so hard to hear that I often had to back up the track, set the iPod's volume to max and repeat so I could figure out what the dialog was.Then I got the unabridged version that Nigel Planer reads and realized that \\"Lords and Ladies\\" is another triumph for Pratchett! Nigel Planer is a wonder! The witches have voices that sound elderly, female and distinctly individual. Dwarfs have deep gravelly voices and Trolls sound dimwitted and slow. Wizards, the Librarian, every character has his own voice. Planer's only flaw is that young women always sound adenoidal, but it's not jarring and I soon got used to it. Best of all, Planer's reading is always clearly audible.So, avoid the unabridged versions! I can't imagine what Terry Pratchett was thinking when he greenlighted these travesties. Maybe the publishers told him that people who demand books that can be listened to in one long setting don't care if the stories suck?"},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Okay. As a quick synopsis, the Ankh-Morpork City Guard (Night Watch) are having to deal with a very new and very, very nasty weapon. And this is a Bad Thing (TM) because the Night Watch in its entirety consists of a human who was raised as a dwarf, a dwarf with a nasty temper, a werewolf who holds long conversations with dogs, a really fat idiot, a recovering drunk, a troll who knocks himself unconscious whenever he tries to salute, and a.. well, we haven't quite worked out *what* Nobby is yet.This isn't exactly a *mystery*, per se, not in the same way that, say, The Fifth Elephant or Feet of Clay are, because we have a fair idea pretty early on of what the weapon we're facing actually is, even if the Night Watch don't. My personal favorite scene is the one starting in the sewers where Vimes gets the.. um.. probably shouldn't say it here.. anyway. I also like the bits with Leonard, especially when Vetinari's talking to him about the Watch and starts comparing people to clockwork (&quot;And sometimes you have to wind the spring as tight as it will go, and pray it doesn't break.&quot;) That was actually a bit creepy, really.."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I have read every Terry Pratchett book in the Disc book series.

First, as all other discworld novels this makes me laugh. City police try to struggle against crime and anarchy. However city guards aren't such &quot;normal&quot; police.

This novel is easy to read and very enjoyable where ever you are."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I read. Now I have 10 others.

I travel a lot by subway, and people just stared at me when my laughter filled the car.

A serious fantasy reader, is so relaxing to laugh with it."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"As can be seen from my review of it, I thought Guards Guards! was a marvelously funny book, and a great homage to the guards in most movies and books who have a very thankless job. Men at Arms, though, surpasses even that.First of all, the ranks of the City Watch are expanded, with Detritus -DON'T SALUTE, the Troll, Cuddy, the Dwarf, and Angua, a woman who's not all she appears to be. Dwarves and Trolls don't get along, which provides the meat to some very funny scenes between Detritus and Cuddy, including a great scene where Cuddy is teaching Detritus how to count. There are even more jokes in this one then there were in Guards Guards (or at least, I laughed at more of them).Captain Vimes is retiring in a few days, which doesn't give the watch much time to figure out who's responsible for all the strange murders happening. Never fear, though, Corporal Carrot is here! The character development in this book makes this so much more than just a funny fantasy. Vimes is really starting to second guess his life. Carrot is maturing greatly, even if he still is plain, simple Carrot. Even Nobbs and Colon grow as characters.In Vimes, you see a character agonizing over who he is and what he is becoming. He's not sure he wants to live the life that's staring him in the face. Yet he's still the take-charge guy he became in the first book. He's the emotional centre of the book and while he's not always involved, his presence is always being felt.All of this sounds dreadfully serious, but it's wrapped in a plot that goes from one hilarious event to another. There were three or four straight pages where I couldn't stop laughing as I read, and every other page had a treat (I just managed to stifle the laughter in order to not disturb my wife's sleep). The mix of comedy and character development is made perfectly. If you have no interest in serious stuff, you can ignore that aspect of the book and just revel in the jokes.I'm moving on to Feet of Clay now, and I'm optimistic. Pratchett hasn't missed with me so far. Do yourself a favour and try this series."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk.

So what ? &quot;Men At Arms&quot; sees Pratchett back with a vengeance, &quot;extracting the urine&quot; again with the style and wit he's gotten us used to. Shrewd as ever, he manages yet again to make the reader think twice ( or thrice, for that matter ) about the pool of cliches we wallow in, as well as to make us laugh like we did with Reaper Man or Witches Abroad. Pratchett also tears to shreds that silly notion that guns are something to be desired - hey, even the Guild of Assassins hate them ! - and, as always, pulls off a funny/teary eyed ending he's known for. A great book for those facial muscles you haven't exercised in so long - read it before someone else does and starts quoting from it."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Yet another really funny and original book by Terry Pratchett.He takes us back yet again to Diskworld and the saga of Corp.

Not only is there a continuation of characters, but new ones are added, and further developed. Terry Pratchett shows he is a REAL writer by his ability to interweave a funny, uplifting book, with true drama, a plot, and a mystery type story, of whodunnit? If you like &quot;buddy flicks&quot; and enjoy excellent humor, this is a must read. Even though it is a continuation from a previous book, the reader does not need to read Guards Guards! to fully understand the characters, for Pratchett's writing style allows the new reader to become comfortable with the characters within a few pages. The only warning i give to the reader is, not all books are completely happy go lucky, for drama is truly woven in with surprising occurences. Enjoy this book!

I love his disc world books and Men at Arms was not a disappointment. If you have been unfortunate enough to not visit this wonderful world filled with magic, wizards, and an occasional god then take the opportunity. The books don't need to be read in order but some of the characters make multiple appearances. You will fall in love with the place and the people. I find myself a little sad each time I finish a book. Pratchett has the ability to give you a well written story that mixes humor with drama and even an occasional love story. His books would fall under fantasy and can be read by teenagers as well as adults. I highly recommend this book as well as others."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This story was a bit slow at the beginning, but once it got started, it was an excellent read. Perhaps my second favorite Pratchett book behind Good Omens."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"When last we left our intrepid Ankh-Morpork Night Watch, things were looking up. This is a nice change from the gutter's-eye-view we had at the beginning of Guards! Guards!. Things have changed in the time between books. The Watch has a new headquarters, much nicer than its old one, thanks to Lady Sibyl Ramkin, the fiance of Captain Sam Vimes. She comes from an ancient and respectable family, has more money than anyone else in the city, and loves Vimes despite his deep-seated curmudgeonliness, if that is a word.What's more, the Watch is taking on new recruits, as ordered by the Patrician. Ankh-Morpork is a city with a very diverse population, and the Patrician believes that the Watch should reflect that diversity. Now we have a Watch open to anyone - trolls, dwarfs, the undead, apes, women - who wants to join, or who doesn't want to get their heads beaten in. Carrot Ironfoundersson has become a beloved figure in the city - he knows everyone and everyone knows him. All in all, things are looking up.But there are those who are of a mind that things would be better if only Ankh-Morpork had a king....This is a recurring theme in the early Watch books - the irrational need for royalty. Although, that's not entirely accurate. Pratchett is a British writer, of course, and he's got the Queen to look up to, but she doesn't have all that much real power. Certain people in Ankh-Morpork are looking for a sovereign - not to wave at them and make a Hogswatch speech, but to actually take over their city. They hope, in their hearts, that a king will solve everything. In that way, this recurring theme is not so much about royalty versus populism, but rather the ability to control one's own life versus allowing someone else to control it for you. The idea that one has responsibility for one's own actions and well-being is dominant in the Guards books, no more so than in this one.There is a man named Edward d'Eath, and he has a vision. He is the last of an aristocratic line whose power has declined in this age of guilds and merchants. He looks to the past and sees it as better, brighter than the future. He knows that, if he can just do one little thing, Ankh-Morpork - and he - will be restored to glory. That one little thing, of course, is to put a king on the throne.Not just any king, of course. The fools who thought to use a dragon to set up a puppet king showed how ineffectual that would be. No, this would only work with a real king, a descendant of the ancient kings of Ankh-Morpork. Find him, put him on the throne, and everything will finally be set straight.Of course, that doesn't work out nearly as well as Edward hopes. He steals a mysterious artifact to set his plan in motion - a weapon of such power and danger that the Assassins refuse to use it, and keep it on display as a message: beware things such as this. It is the Gonne, and the man who wields it has the power to change the world.Like I said, this book is all about making choices in life. Vimes is engaged to be married to Sybil Ramkin, and thus his days as the Captain of the Watch are numbered. He may be in a better position than he was in the last book - having someone try to kill you is always refreshing, after all - but he knows that the life he's giving up, with all of its pain and trouble and heartache, is the life that he needs to live.Corporal Carrot needs to choose how best to serve the city of Ankh-Morpork. He is an excellent policeman, probably the only man on the Disc who could get in the middle of an incipient troll/dwarf race riot and shame them out of killing each other. People do what he says - he is, in his own words, \\"good at being obeyed.\\" If he wanted to, he could run the city and the city would be glad to let him do it. But is that the best thing for the city?The troll Detritus and the dwarf Cuddy both have choices - will they conform to the ancient animosity that stands between their two races, or will they overcome it for the common good?And then there's the Gonne itself. As a weapon, it is frighteningly powerful - much more so than the standard-issue crossbow - and as a firearm, however primitive, it represents a vast escalation in the way violence is done. What's more, since this is a fantasy novel, the Gonne has something of a mind of its own. Its wielders hear it talking to them, convincing them that the only thing standing between them and what they want are a few simple deaths - something the Gonne can easily provide. It even uses the old NRA saw verbatim - Gonnes don't kill people. People kill people.But people have a choice, perhaps more of a choice than the characters of these books do. The Gonne controls them, the trigger practically pulls itself, and when you're holding it, you can easily understand how a simple shot, one simple thing, could change the world. For the better, of course - always for the better.Pratchett's views on guns and their efficacy aside, it's a very gripping book. There's the mystery of it, of course - who has the Gonne, and why are they using it - but it's also a story about characters and the choices they make for themselves. My absolute favorites in this are Detritus and Cuddy. Trolls and dwarfs have a famous antagonism, stretching back to the ancient battle of Koom Valley (the only battle in the multiverse where both sides ambushed each other) and it would be very easy for them to fall into simple, culturally conditioned roles.While it may be a cliche to say that they found common ground, learned to look past their own prejudices and learned to respect - nay, to like one another, that's exactly what they did. It is due to Pratchett's skill as a writer and as a creator of characters that we come to deeply care for this relationship, investing a lot of hope in it. We know that if Cuddy and Detritus can become friends, then maybe there's hope for everyone. This emotional investment pays off, and Pratchett reaches deep into our hearts at the end, showing that just because you start with a cliche, it doesn't mean it can't have depth.Of course, if you're not quite as analytical as I am, you can still enjoy it as a good murder mystery. Watching Vimes and company piece together the crime is always fun, because there's always a twist somewhere that you never saw coming. And Vimes really is one of my favorite Discworld characters - he's cynical and world-weary, but he still has enough idealism within him to carry him through those times that look like they're trying to kill him.All in all, a great book and one that's highly recommended. The earlier Discworld books are largely stand-alone, so if you've never read any of the series before, don't worry - you can pick this one up and you won't really miss anything. You may, however, find yourself driving back to the bookstore to get as many other Discworld books as you can. I'm just saying....---------------------------------------------------\\"Generally, I meet people before they're buried.

Like most of the Nightwatch stories in Pratchett's series, MEN AT ARMS is a great time for all; where we find the gruff and angry Vimes preparing to retire and then being thrust into what might prove to be his last investigation. This one has enough action, comedy and even the death of a copper to add a bit of pathos (Not too much however, as the deceased's responses to DEATH's inquiries are very funny) to satisfy any fan of the series."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I've been working my way through the Discworld series in the order of publication, and I must admit the City Watch novels are among my favorites. In \\"Men at Arms\\", Pratchett does a great job of transforming the rag-tag group of night watchmen into another Ankh-Morpork institution. I really enjoyed following Vimes and Carrot as they conducted their investigation, and the introduction of our new watch... people... promises more enjoyment in future installments.Above all, I enjoy Pratchett's ability to blend humorous fiction with poignant social commentary. Though some of these books are over a decade or two old, and perhaps written to juxtapose some then-current event or social dilemma, his novels have that lasting quality that makes them apt regardless of today's world issues. Even today we have problems with gun control and violence, and with this novel Pratchett does what he does best - pokes fun at everyone on all sides.This definitely ranks in my top 5 of the series to this point."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This is probably among the best Diskworld books Pratchett has written. It has it all: rich character development, an intriguing plot that actually kept throwing curves at me, some sarcastic social commentary, and of course, Pratchett's renound rapier-like wit. I'm still laughing at his concept of \\"retro-phrenology.\\"As with any Diskworld novel, this one is best enjoyed if you already have a grip on the setting, but if you're new to the series, you can start here with little problem -- though you'll get the sense you're not privy to a number of inside jokes.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"So many discworld novels, so little time. I love them all, but my favorites, at the moment, are the Watch Novels. Anyone who enjoys humor in their life should read Terry Pratchett. Enough said."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Of course, I've thoroughly enjoyed every Discworld book except the very first, so that wasn't very surprising. However, one thing that made this book especially enjoyable is that it is the introduction of one of my favorite recurring characters, Angua.Men at Arms is a Watch book, and I always particularly enjoy them because the Watch is full of such colorful characters. In this book we are also introduced to Detruis, the troll who's really smart when it's cold and really stupid when it's hot. Unfortunately, Ank-Morpork is almost always hot.As usual for Discworld novels, Men at Arms is full of satire, poking fun at everything from monarchy to violence to racism (or in this case, specism). The thought \\"Guns don't kill people; people kill people\\" is turned on its head when the gonne takes over the mind of it's wielder, making him kill people at random. It talks to whoever is holding it and even fires itself on occasion.The book starts out with new recruits to the watch being trained. Cuddy (a Dwarf), Detrius (a Troll), and Angua (both Werewolf and a woman) provide comic relief throughout the book as they attempt to adjust to the different procedures of the Night Watch.The real story, however, is the gonne that has gone missing just a day before Captain Vimes is scheduled to retire (he's marrying Lady Sibyl). Of course, Vimes has to find the gun and the culprit who is using it. Vetinari tells him not to, but that only makes him more determined. After all, he is a policeman; solving crimes is his job.As with all Discworld books, the best part of Men at Arms is the characters rather than the story. The story itself is all right, but it is the crazy character-extremely literal and valiant Carrot, hulking and slow Detrius, very odd but strangely loveable Nobby, Gaspode the talking dog, and stubborn and determined Vimes-that make the story. Without them, it wouldn't be nearly as funny or enjoyable.Pratchett has a knack for weaving stereotypes into believable, loveable characters, and it shows in this book. Carrot, the long lost king, is brave, valiant, noble, and honest. However, he's also managing to adapt to life in Ank-Morpork. While he doesn't lie, he doesn't ever tell the whole truth. Detrius is big and slow and stupid, but get him in cold weather and he's extremely smart. Every main character personifies a stereotype and then takes it further, turning it around and making it real and comical.This is definitely one of Pratchett's more amusing books. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a humorous read and all Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"I have all the Pratchett books, but this by far is the best of the bunch. Humourous, touching, clever, witty and highly readable this seems to be the peak of the discworld books. The Watch works well as a basis for the story, the members are developed into people, (or not as the case may be haha!) along with a few usual suspects, and the whole thing flows. After this i started to feel that the books were very same-ish, and lacked originality, but i have to say that Men at Arms will always be the one i recommend to people."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This book is the best! It is one of my favorite Discworld books. Terry Pratchett is a brilliant writer and I personally reccomend any of his books.

This book in particular is hilarious!"},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"Unlike the Hitchhiker's Trilogy from the late Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have managed to stay fresh and original through not a mere five, but 27 installments. The reason for this, I think, is that Pratchett uses the format to its fullest potential, creating several groups of characters that he visits time and again, never having any single group act as the star of the entire series, and using it to tackle diverse subjects without ever repeating himself.\\"Men at Arms\\" is the second Discworld book to focus on Captain Vimes and the men -- um... humans... er... beings -- of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (the first being \\"Guards! Guards!\\") and it has firmly cemented these characters as my favorite recurring heroes in the Discworld universe.Time is running out for Captain Sam Vimes -- because he's getting married. Furthermore, his beloved night watch is being tampered with by higher-ups calling for \\"greater diversity\\" in the hirings, forcing him to welcome trolls, dwarfs and women into the group. To make matters worse, someone has stolen a strange new weapon from the assassin's guild and is using it to kill people. Vimes, Carrot, Nobby and the gang have to find the murderer and save the day.Funny, yes, but also particularly poignant in light of recent events in the Washington D.C. area. I read this book a few months ago, before the unpleasantness began... this may be just the thing to help you cope."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"hollywood take notice!! a movie idea like this only comes along once a century. i have read nearly half of the discworld novels and each one has been better than the last. i would be hard pressed to pick a favorite, but men at arms would be up there among the top. great characters, excellent plot twists, and a host of unforgetable one-liners. but what impressed me the most as i read each page was what a great movie men at arms would make. i could almost see a cgi created acting constable detritus. if you are new to the discworld series make men at arms your next read."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels.

What could go wrong . . .Well, this IS Ankh-Morpork, a city so corrupt that if the gods took vengeance on it, no one would notice. Things get complicated when an exploding swamp dragon, a mysterious invention, warring guilds, and an assasin who is NOT killing for pay send the city into more turmoil than usual. Who can save the day? It's up to the flattest of flatfoots in the Night Watch, and their new recruits to set the city right, or at least not so wrong.There is the usual Pratchett wordplay and humor, as well as the thoughtful emotional interplays he has developed over the years. There's also an interesting mystery at the center of the whole piece, and some of his most interesting characters trying to deal with it.

Guards! As told in that volume, the City Watch saved the city from a marauding dragon and at the end of the book the Watch gained fresh resources from a grateful city government. However, it is still regarded as a joke, as Men at Arms makes clear.Pratchett once again uses the cliches and ideas of police procedurals to generate humour and satire, although this volume is much more of a hard-bitten (in some cases, literally) mystery novel. Sam Vimes is portrayed as the cynical, weathered old cop doggedly pursuing his case in the face of all opposition, whilst Corporal Carrot is his enthusiastic young sidekick. Of course, that would be a bit too cheesy, so Pratchett subverts this idea earlier on and takes the story in a more interesting and original direction.The city of Ankh-Morpork comes to life in this book more successfully than in any prior volume, to the extent that Pratchett's playwright and friend Stephen Briggs was able to use information in this book (and the prior ones) to map the city so everything tracked and made sense (the results can be found in the spin-off product, The Streets of Ankh-Morpork). The city's ethnic make-up, the political structure of the guilds and the office of the Patrician are all portrayed convincingly. In addition, Pratchett aims high with his characterisation, with the most affecting death of a Discworld character to date and some brilliant development for Carrot and Vimes. There is even a reasonably well-portrayed romance and some (tastefully off-screen) sex, a first for the series. Men at Arms is Discworld aimed at a slightly maturer level than arguably any of the previous books bar Small Gods.Which isn't to say that Pratchett doesn't bring the funny. The Colon/Nobbs double-act is excellent, the return of Gaspode the Wonder Dog (from Moving Pictures, but much better-utilised here) is genuinely funny and there is some fantastic material to be mined from the Cuddy/Detritus relationship.Men at Arms (*****) is Pratchett yet again firing on all cylinders, delivering a novel that is by turns brilliantly funny, genuinely thought-provoking and consistently entertaining. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"There's something to be said for reading a series in chronological order, but it seems somehow more in the spirit of Discworld to just read them however they come to hand. This one features the Night Watch (my favorite sub-series) on the cusp of becoming the reorganized and expanded City Watch. Carrot is presently a corporal and trolls and dwarfs are just being added to the roster in the spirit of affirmative action. Captain Sam Vimes is facing both imminent retirement and imminent marriage to Lady Sybil Ramkin, both of which have put him into a strange state of mind. And on top of all that, there has been a mysterious series of murders of guild members, committed with an unknown weapon. Carrot, a six-foot-tall adopted dwarf, gets a lot of play this time, with special attention to his special talent: Everyone likes Carrot because he truly thinks everyone is basically decent underneath it all. As always, Pratchett, a master of stealth philosophy, combines off-the-wall humor and bent puns with thoughtful and humane digressions on the nature of right and good vs. wrong and evil, and what makes a good copper."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"The discworld series is by far one of the most hilarious series I have ever had the privlege to experience. I have read pretty much all of the books in this series, and I love them all to death. If your new to the series, you dont have to read the books in order, but it does help in order to fully experience some of the character ties, growths, and extremely bizzare happenings.Men at Arms is the second book featuring the Watch, the first being Guards! Guards!, another excellent book. I absolutely love the characters in this book, and both the humor and the plot is very entertaining.So pick up this book and the rest of the series, and you'll soon be a Discworld lover like me."},{"Title":"Men At Arms","review":"This book is one my favorite and, I believe, one of the best of Pratchett's Discworld Series. I can say it in one word: Carrot! He is one of my favorite heroes on the Discworld (only Rincewind and Nanny Ogg compare with Death a close third). As usual, Carrot comes through with flying colors. There are just so many interesting things in this book: the plot about the \\"gonne,\\" Leonard de Quirm (and the way he acts with the Patrician), Cuddy the dwarf and Detritus the troll, the silly guildsand their ridiculous presidents, Carrot and Angua, I could just go on.Especially good was the troll-dwarf issue, the way they had to work together to interview the guilds without making complete fools of themselves and just basically get along. Also, it is funny how intelligent trolls get in low temperatures.The plot alos makes for a nice mystery story. Pratchett really worked on this one. We start out with a 4-man watch and end up with one over 60 people! The Watch really grows up and will add many laughs to future stories. One of the best: a must read."},{"Title":"Space cat and the kittens","review":"I also loved all the Space Cat books as a child.

While it is geared for the modern navy, a good many antiquated terms (from the age of sail) are in it as well, though not all.While the &quot;Naval Terms Dictionary&quot; is a great tool, I have found a few drawbacks to it. While it is set up alphabetically like a normal dictionary, it completely lacks any sort of pronunciation guide for words (some of those terms are pronounced funny) and a listing of what type of word it is (noun, verb, adj, etc). It also neglects to seperate different definitions for the words, opting to give both in a paragraph form. You can usually define the type of word it is from the definition, but it would have been a little more professional to write it in a standard dictionary format.Overall, despite its relatively minor flaws, this book is a great tool for folks who are in the navy, or read a lot of naval history and fiction."},{"Title":"With No Remorse: Murder and Mayhem in Our Schools - A Biblical Response","review":"Mr. Allen has an insight handle on such a tragic and sensitive contempory issue effecting our schools."},{"Title":"Picking Up Cowboys","review":"I remember snow cream from when I was a kid.

The book surpassed my memory of the book.Like life, there are unresolved loose ends and this is a good thing."},{"Title":"Local Anesthetic","review":"Eberhard Starusch has a number of problems. His teeth hurt. His dentist quotes Seneca constantly. One of his students is trying to come up with a dramatic protest of the Vietnam war. He has invented (or has he?) a number of events surrounding a mythical (or is he?) Field Marshal General who happens to be the uncle of Starusch's ex-fiancee, whom Starusch-- or someone else-- may or may not have murdered with a bicycle chain.Such is the platform from which Local Anesthetic takes its course. Throughout this novel, I was reminded almost constantly of Alain Robbe-Grillet's style in The Erasers and The Voyeur. Worthy of imitation, certainly, as those are two of Europe's finest contributions to twentieth-century literature. but hard to imitate. And, were Grass not a consummate novelist, this would have come off even worse than it did.One gets the feeling that, unlike Robbe-Grillet, Grass actually wanted the reader to be able to figure out what in the world was really happening in this odd, nightmarish world of late-sixties East Germany. But the only thing that reader can truly be sure of is the way that Scherbaum, the protesting student, is going to react to things. And Scherbaum's predictability, which would be a weakness in most novels, instead anchors the reader to some semblance of reality as the possibly-mythical Sieglinde Krings and her uncle weave in and out of the arguments the schoolteacher (Starusch) has with the dentist (who is never named), the arguments Scherbaum has with his sometime-girlfriend Vero, the debates Starusch has with his friend Irmgard Siefert, the wargames Sieglinde and the General conduct in a huge sandbox... you get the idea.Grass manages (almost) to carry this novel off with his trademark combination of wit, silliness, and political invective against both sides of the utterly stupid post-WW2 and pre-wall-falling German government. But there seem to be too many places where things wander off and are never really picked up again. Too many loose threads are left undone at the end of this novel, and there isn't the kind of evidence one would need to wrap it all up oneself.I'd recommend this particular Grass novel only to completists; for those who want to see an excellent example of this style of writing, check out the aforementioned novels by Alain Robbe-Grillet (the Grove Press editions) and be utterly blown away."},{"Title":"Local Anesthetic","review":"what can I tell ya..one great book..I read too far afield before this one..different kind of book..yes..more complexed..but this one is a litle tiny book compering to too far afield...Local is more then anything It will truly crack u up kind of book..at the same time..hey..Grass makes u think of any other current writer as being a schmuk at leat in his writing history and analyzing branch..some less then 300 pages..this book is a straight kick in the stomach...leave u breathless and thinking...whats was that little lady's number?Nadine Gordimer...Who cares...Long Live Grass !"},{"Title":"Rat Scabies and the Holy Grail: Can a Punk Rock Legend Find What Monty Python Couldn't?","review":"You can classify this book many ways: road trip story; buddy book; coming of age tale; psychic mystery; historical quest; hysterical slice of life.

Or is he just an excellent story teller, recounting his life in a small British town, where he is suddenly drawn into a fantastic treasure hunt across Europe by the kind of person we would all love as both a neighbor and a friend?What do you like in your books? Is it a good mystery, unsolved over centuries? How about unforgettable characters who pop up when you least expect them? Care for car crashes and attacks by killer bees? And do you like laughing out loud while you read?The author's greatest gift is his ability to see the events that unfold before him with a clarity that most of us lost when we were children. He describes people, places, and events in a way which gives the reader a chance to evaluate everything without the author's manipulation. Although the tale is sometimes earthy, it never loses its innocence.The book was a page-turner where I laughed at each new event and welcomed each new comrade on the journey. I really felt the friendship that was discovered during the trip.And I even learned some history about the Holy Grail along the way!We could all use a neighbor like Rat Scabies.

It's a real-life story about the famous punk rock drummer and a rock journalist attempting to solve a mystery along the lines of the DaVinci Code, but fear not, it's written for people who wouldn't read the DaVinci code in a million years.My favorite line (paraphrased) comes on a bus tour of \\"Rennies\\" (believers of the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery) and the author notes that Rat Scabies is the *least* odd person on the bus. That's saying something. It's really sort of a true-believer story, the author does a great job of debunking the legends even as he accepts them as truth, and of gently (maybe even subconsciously) mocking other \\"Rennies\\" even as he shows honest affection and camaraderie. He's never mean, and the friendly tone makes the story enjoyable even for someone who doesn't buy the legend at all.A less abrupt and vague ending would have won it 5 stars, though I dont' have any suggestions, ha!

It was so good, I read it again...and again...and again. To this day, I still remember every story line for line. As a matter of fact, since I am a teacher, I have adapted many of the stories for classroom lessons. This book has a polished charm that is missing in many of today's stories. There is a reason that these stories were passed down by word of mouth for generations before being written down: the stories are amazingly entertaining. The themes are universal, the characters vibrant, and the settings exciting. I am so excited that this book is available again.

The primary focus of the book is to document the status, distribution, and seasonal presence of the birds. Although color photos are included, the majority (45 out of 74) of these show the variety of habitats in the country as well as photos of eggs and nests. Only 29 species of birds are shown in the remaining photos.The color photos are of good quality and certainly show off the variability of the Azerbaijan geological features. The photos of the birds are of decent quality.The heart of the book is its text and maps. Each bird receives about 1/3 of a page composed of six categories. These are status, distribution, habitat, movement, population size, and breeding. The distribution receives a greater amount of attention and offers good geographic details that define the regional presence of the bird. The section on movements incorporates many references that provide date ranges for both the spring and fall migrations.Except for the rarer vagrants, each bird is accompanied by a decently sized map (3.5 x 2.5 inches) of Azerbaijan. The same template is used for each bird. This map contains helpful geographic details by including labeled rivers and cities. The bird's presence is marked in three methods. First, is the use of four different symbols that represent the following: confirmed nesting record, former nesting, summer sighting, and winter sighting outside the normal winter range. Second, three different shades of gray are used to show the ranges of wintering in the past, main wintering grounds, and other wintering grounds. Third, two types of arrows are used to denote the direction and spring/autumn migration of the birds.These maps contain very useful information, but they can demand a little more attention to sort out the busy markings of the map. This busyness is a side-effect of the geographic detail in the maps. For species with few dots or with small winter ranges, you need to scan around properly to make sure you find all the information.The book concludes with several informative appendices. These offer a complete checklist that includes the status of each bird for the seasons; 21 pages on important bird areas; tables and graphs on rookeries; and notes on the impacts of hunting, hard winters, and oil pollution.This book will probably be of interest to a smaller niche of birders, primarily the data and research oriented ornithologist and those with a more direct interest in this small area tucked in between Russia, Georgia, and Iran.I've listed several related books below...1)The Birds of Turkeyby Kirwan2)Songbirds of Turkeyby Roselaar3)Raptors and Owls of Georgiaby Galvez4)A Field Guide to Birds of Armeniaby Adamian/Klem5)Handbook of the Birds of Armeniaby Adamian/Klem6)Birds of Europe with North Africa and the Middle Eastby Jonsson7)Birds of Europeby Mullarney et al.8)Field Guide to the Birds of the Middle Eastby Porter et.al.9)Birds of the Middle East and North Africa: A Companion Guideby Hollom et.al.10) Birds of Fauna of Ukraine: The Field Guide by Fesenko (ISBN 966771022X)(written by Soleglad at Avian Review or Avian Books, November 2008)"},{"Title":"Birds of Azerbaijan","review":"This is a welcomed new addition to the avifaunal literature of the region.It is abit expensive but worth the cost.

True appeciation of the power of Oracle environment comes from comparison of PL/SQL collections and APIs provided by built-in packages (like DMBS_PIPE) - with host operating system IPCs.Now we can see the challenge of BUILDING INTELLIGENT DATABASES: the book starts from PL/SQL basics and proceeds to exception handling, interprocesscommunication and database integrity enforcement.In ch.7 we find discussion of basic PL/SQL constructs, datatypes and data structures (including index by tables, but without collections that were added later) are covered by ch.9. Exceptions (necessary to deal with built-in packages) are described in ch.10.Material of chapters 14-17(trigger methodolgy and procedural constraints) is, in fact, software life cycle discussion: development starts from finding out what concrete objects are to be encapsulated and in what way, proprietary integrity constraints are determined. Then certain PL/SQL code is developed and tested, results are re-assessed, more code is developed, etc. - all on concrete code examples. Discussion of Mutable Table situation is very helpful.Basically, BUILDING INTELLIGENT DATABASES shows two things: how one actually builds PL/SQL applications and how general terminology can be used in the process.An important practical suggestion here is to develop triggers as wrappers for packages which is very helpful - from C++/Java point of view.Ch.19 discusses basic package testing using DBMS_OUTPUT. Package methods are usually called from other components, for example, Pro*C/C++ applications. So it is useful to simulate actual calls by special PL/SQL testing wrappers.

White and I'm sure the person I bought this for will be happy."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"For years I have admired the writing voice of E.B. White. We are of two very different generations and times, him and I, yet his words so gently bind me to him and his thoughts; I feel as if I am sitting at his very side, listening with rapt attention to his every word.This collection of essays can be read out of order, over and over. That's how meaty the words are; you read and taste them every single time, no matter how often you have chreished the words. He writes of his everyday life, which can seem so simple and mundane, yet White is reminding us that these small daily occurences are what make us what we are. There are so many layers to White, and I think that makes him one of the most versatile writers to be published. Here is a man who enchanted us as children and adults alike with his children stories, and who can still drive deep into the hearts of men with these essays.If you have never read White, I fervently encourage you to start with this collection."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"This witty, light, thoughtful and altogether delightful read has a permanent place at my bedside.

This was one of our choices. I have been trying to pull out fragments of memory. What i recall most fondly is that E.B. White's observations were tinted with a certain innocence. Why did we become so jaded? The last 50 years have brought along a heightened level of cynicism, and it was refreshing to read a grown man's slightly nave comments.At the same time, after a while I became a bit bored with the simplistic remarks of life in the country. My own shortcoming, not the book's."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"This collection of essays is such a fine book; it deserves a much better commentary than it currently has here. And given the times we live in, its subject matter is particularly timely for American readers -- the period of history leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the early years of the war effort -- all told from the point of view of a thoughtful writer on a small farm in Maine.White had moved there with his wife and young son from New York, where he'd been writing for The New Yorker, and took up country living, turning his attention to the annual round of the seasons, farm work, the nearby seaside, and the company of independent rural people. Most of the essays in this collection were written and published monthly in Harpers from July 1938 to January 1943. In them, there is White's awareness of the ominous threat of fascism emerging in Europe, as well as the vulnerability that Americans felt as they found themselves facing prolonged armed conflict with powerful enemies. These were dark days, and they provide a constant undertone in these otherwise upbeat essays about rural and small-town life.And they are upbeat, celebrating the pleasures and gentle ironies of daily life with a few side trips into the world beyond -- the birth of a lamb, paying taxes, farm dogs, hay fever, raising chickens, Sunday mornings, radio broadcasts, civil defense drills, a visit to Walden pond, a day at the World's Fair, and unrealistic Hollywood portrayals of the pastoral. There is also here his famous essay \\"Once More to the Lake.\\"In many ways, the world he writes about is gone forever. But it's a world whose spirit remains at the heart of the national identity -- participatory democracy, individualism, citizenship, self-discovery, and self-reliance. Reading these essays, while they are often about seemingly trivial matters, you sense White's deepening faith in the American Experiment -- a belief in America as a work in progress.And, of course, there is the famous White style, both simple and elegant. Its language, sentence structure, and movement of thought convey both sharpness of mind and generosity of spirit, in a manner that looks and sounds easy, but it is very hard to imitate. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the WWII homefront, the essay as a literary form, and a curiosity about rural life before farm subsidies and agribusiness."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"Understanding E.B. White is not an easy task. He was a reserved man, very straightforward in his writing and simple in nature. However, White found that he was able to express himself with his writing, and none of his books is a more direct window into his soul than &quot;One Man's Meat.&quot; Written over the course of White's later years of living on a Maine farm, this book contains witty accounts of geographic novelty, reminiscences on the promise of youth, and powerful insights into the little things in life that can make all the difference. No reader of E.B. White can gain a full knowledge of what the man was all about without having thoroughly digested this book."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"E. B. White's essays are sweet and courageous. It's a rare and wonderful combination. They are also, to use that severely abused word, poignant, which means, painfully affecting the feelings. Consider the opening line to the essay, World War I: \\"I keep forgetting that soldiers are so young.\\" He wrote that line in 1939. I think of that every day in the context of Iraq and Afghanistan.One Man's Meat, first published in 1942, is the companion volume to the Essays of E. B. White. Both books include his classic, Once More to the Lake, an essay about taking his own son to the lake that made such an impression on him when he was taken there by his own father. There is minimal overlap between the two books.In 1940 he lamented the effects of the automobile on community life: \\"Everything in life is somewhere else, and you get there in a car.\\" This book also includes the best thing I have ever read about poetry. Poems must be short, he said, because, \\"Poetry is intensity, and nothing is intense for long.\\"One of the things that struck me most in this group of essays was his statement about writers, since I am one. He wrote: \\"In a free country it is the duty of writers to pay no attention to duty.\\" I love this man.I could rant on for hours about the joy of reading this book, but it's better that you spend your time reading his work instead of mine."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"For one who aspires to write well--the most delicious book I've ever read. The words &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot; come to mind, but poorly describe White and his work. Maybe, no words do with any degree of accuracy and right praise."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"An experience awaits you.(I recently overheard, or saw only in my peripheral vision, or almost read a comment by a professor of literature. \\"I would give anything,\\" he said, \\"for the pleasure of reading 'Romeo and Juliet' again for the first time.\\")That experience awaits you here. That experience and the companion experience that the sly, lively E.B. White is just behind you, just over your shoulder as you read. The words are that alive.Listen to Mr. White contemplate as he attempts to complete a government questionnaire: \\"Under JOB FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEST FITTED I wrote \\"Editor and writer.\\" Under JOB FOR WHICH YOU ARE NEXT BEST FITTED I wrote \\"Poultryman and farmer.\\" But I realize . . .it is hard to tell about fitness. Physically I am better fitted for writing than for farming, because farming takes great strength and great endurance. Intellectually I am better fitted for farming than writing.\\"That, for me, was the best of many extraordinary lines in one of many exceptional paragraphs in one of many excellent essays.I have a habit of dog-earring pages of books where I feel wisdom is revealed. No book I have read in the last few years has as many pages folded over as this book of essays.Read. Enjoy. Have that wonderful first experience. Allow in this avuncular Yankee; he will live in you forever more."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"E. B. White's One Man's Meat is an ode to life in the country, a reflection of the author's unease with various aspects associated with modern life, and a prelude to the years of \\"the second war for democracy.\\" The book contains the essays written during White's five years with Harper's Magazine (1938 - 1943), a time White referred to as \\"one of the most productive periods of my life.\\"Despite his move to Maine, White was not, in the strict sense, a farmer: instead, he owned what he often called \\"a private zoo,\\" an indulgence he maintained because he liked to \\"play with animals.\\" As White points out in \\"The Practical Farmer,\\" farming is \\"about twenty percent agriculture and eighty percent mending something...a glorified repair job,\\" and the would-be farmer is merely \\"a handyman with a sense of humus.\\"Some essays - \\"Walden\\" and \\"Once More to the Lake\\" - are well known. Others not so well known - \\"Report,\\" \\"Town Meeting,\\" \\"Compost,\\" and \\"My Day\\" - give a wonderfully individualistic view of the country and of country life. \\"The Wave of the Future\\" and \\"The World of Tomorrow,\\" on the other hand, show White at his critical and intellectual best. In addition, some of the remaining essays reflect White's unease with the coming war, but always in ways that are arresting, intensely human, sometimes humorous, and always accessible.In short, One Man's Meat, along with Essays of E. B. White, is White's tour de force. No one reading these essays is ever quite the same afterwards."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"I adore E.B. White, and what I was concerned about while buying this paperback edition was that the paper, cover, or the font of the text be of low quality and interfere with my enjoyment of the book. However, the book is a trade paperback, the cover being non-glossy and the paper and font being perfect. I fully recommend this edition to anyone."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"One Man's Meat, E.B. White [1899-1985]; Harper & Brothers (1938-42)E.B. (\\"Andy\\") White, although pleased that it sold well, in the same letter disparagingly referred to a collection of his best columns as \\"a clip book\\" - as if somehow, on a second offering, what he had written had somehow diminished in value. He could not have been more mistaken.Maine in the summer of 2012 had one perfect day allotted to it.Maybe it had more than one. But the day that my wife & I were on Deer Island had to have been the best of that summer, with golden sunshine finally besting a five-day state-wide rainstorm that had at its onset, I also remember, a distraught (& increasingly pathetic) Portland TV weatherman ready to move to Seattle.This was also the day that I found a vintage copy of OMM, of which I had heard about often enough but had never seen an actual edition. Well, there it was, on the bookshelf of a charming bookstore on DI, & there it went out the door in the hands of an appreciative new owner.***E.B., once fascinated by New York City, grew disenchanted with it & in the 1930s decided to move to Maine, where he would continue writing for The New Yorker magazine. His wife Katherine wasn't thrilled about the idea, but eventually, that's how things worked out.They moved to a house on Allen Cove in Brooklin, Maine, which soon both featured a barn full of animals & fronted various agricultural endeavors, the breeding & harvesting of both producing an occasional profit & plenty of complications that provided fodder, instead, for his columns (did you know that the word \\"smut\\" has an innocuous definition - that your harvested oats have been ruined by fungus?).For whatever reason, in the late 1930s, he left the New Yorker magazine (but not for long); most of the columns in OMM appeared in Harper's Magazine. There is risk in extracting quotations from the context in which they originally appear; they can turn into lifeless. disconnected, & unconvincing props (see - if you must - how this sterilized The Algonquin Wits, Robert Drennan, editor; The Citadel Press, 1968). Great care in this review has been taken to try to avoid repeating this mistake.If swayed by what you read below, help Jeff Bezos make ends meet. Order a copy of One Man's Meat.***Removal (1938)\\"Several months ago...desiring to simplify my life, I sold half my worldly goods, evacuated the city house, gave up my employment, & came to live in New England...\\"I recall a moment of particular desperation over a gold mirror, which, in spite of all our attempts to shake it off, hung steadfastly on till within an hour or so of our scheduled departure...\\"So I walked out the door hatless... & went around the corner to a junk shop on Second Avenue... the proprietor stood in the doorway... 'I'm nut taking it,' said the proprietor, who, for all I know, may have been trying to simplify his own life.\\"It is now impossible to imagine Life Without Television, but 74 years ago, this was all in the future, the gifts of which are not always beneficial:\\"The news of television, however, is what I particularly go for when I get a chance... television is going to be the test of the modern world... this new opportunity to see beyond our range of vision... radio has already given sound a wide currency, & sound 'effects' are taking the place one enjoyed by sound itself.\\"***Security (1938)White's initial farm endeavors oft went awry. Somehow, the cost of raising one (one!) turkey - according to his playful estimation of regretted expenses - was $402.85.(In 2012 dollars = $6,889, what you might end up paying for a turkey-club sandwich & a beer at Yankee Stadium, during a regular season game. Say hello to Minka for me.)\\"No doubt when I carve up this four hundred & fifty dollar fowl, I shall enjoy a momentary glow of self-sufficiency & thrift...\\"Escape from New York did not mean ignoring the world. With the Second World War in sight (erupting less than one year from the date of this column):\\"While the old wars rage & new ones hang like hawks above the world...\\"***Progress & Change (1938)White in New York commuted to work on the Sixth Avenue elevated (\\"el\\") railway, which by this time was showing its age (look at Sixth Avenue today. Try & imagine the street completely covered by track tracks fifty feet overhead, with the trains above roaring & creaking). Mercifully, not long afterwards, it was torn down.\\"Of course, I have read about the great days of the El, when it was the railroad of the elite & when financial giants rode elegantly home from Wall Street in its nicely appointed coaches. But I'm just as glad I didn't meet the El until after it had lost its money.\\"Maine meant roughing it, by the standards of his previous home. White welcomed the change, but some things on the farm had to be upgraded from what seemed to be War-of-1812 furnishings - something he did warily:\\"I have just been refining the room in which I sit, yet I sometimes doubt that a writer should refine or improve his workroom by so much as a dictionary; one thing leads to another & the first thing you know he has a stuffed chair & is fast asleep in it.\\"***Children's Books (1938)Katherine was too valuable for The New Yorker to lose & she continued to edit fiction for the magazine from Maine. The publishers mailed dozens of books for review to her address; for whatever reason, this includes crates of stuff for the kids. The house not designed to function as a library, they piled up & space ran out fast.White was a mild-mannered (but not unprincipled) man, but this increasingly rude intrusion finally got to him:\\"Among [us]... are review copies... they lie dormant in every room... I have naturally come to know something about children's books from living so close to them & gazing hatefully at their jackets.\\"The books often were donated to the area libraries. If you're in the Brooklin neighborhood, drop in at the nearby Blue Hill, Maine public library. I've been there twice, both times inspired by one of the loveliest libraries in America & its staff. Yes, even by some of its customers - cranky, lanky, fussy sorts banging out their polemics on early 90s laptops whose keys & associated parts are so ancient, they'd be better off with the equally noisy electric typewriters (also known as \\"Els,\\" giants that also towered over the taxicabs of Sixth Avenue in the 1920s, before the construction of Rockefeller Center led to the sad same disappearance of the above-ground trains & typewriters).***Movies (1939)\\"There is no movie house in this town so I don't get to many pictures; but I keep in touch with Olympus by reading Motion Picture magazine & the daily papers... There is something else which Hollywood had done & is doing. By its adherence, over so long a period of years, to a standard of living well in excess of anything known in the lives of its audience, it has at last communicated to its audience a feeling of actually living in this dream world & a conviction that the standards of this world are the norm...\\"In [\\"Dark Victory\\"], a wealthy young girl named Judith, played by Miss Bette Davis... goes to dwell peacefully in Vermont... 'Here I have nothing & am happy...'\\"At the moment of making [this] remark, she was standing in a kitchen which had been modernized at considerable expense... with her... were two domestic servants & two English setters... Now let's look at the rest of this set-up which Miss Judith tossed off as 'nothing.' \\"And so he did, presenting an entertaining yet serious-minded list of annual individual expenses which would accumulate were one to live in the Style of Judith, amounting to $11,693.00Do you happen, today, to be able to spend $181,573 each year on a housekeeper, a cook, heat, pets, food & taxes? Then you, too, have nothing & should feel as free & as easy as Miss Judith.***A Boston Terrier (1939)His neurotic dachshund, Fred, has \\"innumerable obsessions. His particular study (or mania?) at the moment is a black-&-white kitten that my wife gave me for Christmas, thinking that what my life needed was something else that could move quickly from one place in the room to another.\\"(Later, in \\"Fall,\\" an unidentified pet achieves a sly immortality by being described as \\"my ex-cat.\\" Tonight, my wife is having kittens in the next room, watching the Kentucky Wildcats being temporarily befuddled by the South Carolinian ex-high schoolers.)***Walden (1939)\\"As I wandered along, the toc toc of ping pong balls drifted from an attic window.\\"***Second World War (1939)The romance of farming, sustained romantically in the imaginations of those living amongst asphalt, is easily cured. Buy a farm. See what happens when you try to make it work - at the same time that you're listening to the news of military conquests, expressed with an infectious stentorian political lingo:\\"Now, a whole year later, with four times the number of birds under my protectorate, I make no bones about culling.\\"***First World War (1939)From his adolescent diary of 1918, ruefully re-examined as World War II has erupted:\\"On August 31st I wrote a poem strongly advising myself to get killed in action.\\"***Poetry (1939)\\" 'I wish poets could be clearer,' shouted my wife angrily from the next room... a poet dares be just so clear & no clearer; he approaches lucid ground wearily, like a mariner who is determined not to scrape his bottom on anything solid.\\"***Report (1939)Robert Benchley's \\"Treasurer's Report\\" may be more famous (& was infinitely more lucrative as an act on Broadway woven into a burlesque), but I think this is just as dead-pan funny & an equal achievement. White went through his town's annual budget, drolly:\\"In all, it cost the town about $2,400 to support the poor. Some of the towns in this county in recent years have unloaded some of this burden onto the Federal government, but in our town we have walked alone. Our first selectman does not approve of the Federal government as now constituted & has never participated in any of its gay & mischievous adventures in which Washington puts up a dollar & the town matches it with another dollar.\\"\\"There were seven marriages in our town in the fiscal period. Of the fourteen individuals implicated...\\"***Fro-Joy (1940)\\"Today, this town hasn't even a doctor... for movies you drive twenty-five miles. For a railroad junction, fifty. For a mixed drink, twenty-five... Everything in life is somewhere else, & you get there in a car... the automobile is at the bottom of every plot.\\"***Farm Paper (1940)White's penchant for the mail delivery that might include his \\"The Rural New Yorker\\" magazine reminded him of when, as a younger man, he submitted items to columnist Frank Adams of the New York World, whose column was generously receptive to such original submissions by many aspiring authors:\\"And there was a period, later, when I felt the same anticipatory emotion for the morning 'World' & those tense midnights when I would approach a newsstand & squander a nickel on the early edition to turn with secret torment of suspense to the 'Conning Tower' to discover whether some noble nubbin of [my] poetry had achieved the decent fame I hoped it deserved.\\"***Town Meeting (1940)In 2010, after decades, I returned to Maine, for a vacation with my wife. But I didn't have to wait to get there to see a word, which surfaced in the reading of Walter MacDougall's wonderful \\"The Old Somerset Railroad, A Lifeline For Northern Mainers\\" (Down East Books 2000), that set me instantly on edge:\\"Vacationland.\\"I'm not saying that \\"Vacation or Die\\" (if trying to top New Hampshire's state motto is your thing) is a good alternative. Let EBW explain it:\\" 'Vacationland' is a loathsome word, assembled by a person of drab, untrustworthy mind... the residents of the State of Maine do not regard their state as a vacation land: they know from bitter experience that it is a place of hard work & long hours & tough weather.\\"The last thing in the world either one of us, that day on Deer Island - or on any other day when we visited Bingham & Bar Harbor, Sanford & Alfred, Skowhegan & Corea - was to feel as if we had been ushered into the insincere & artificial oasis of a \\"Disneyland\\" (although at the rate they're asphalting & thus asphyxiating Ogunquit, the town might be issuing ESPN stock dividends before long).At any rate, the town meeting was the time & the place for a standoff between two acerbic debaters:\\"Both men held the floor without yielding... it had the heat & turmoil of the first Continental Congress without its nobility of purpose & purity of design.\\"***A Shepherd's Life (1940)Farm doors don't necessarily close as quickly as you would like them to:\\"We don't encourage animals to come into the house, but they get in once in a while, particularly the cosset lamb, who trotted through this living room not five minutes ago looking for an eight-ounce bottle.\\"***Compost (1940)Poland is gone. France, although White would have no way of knowing this, is next.\\"The most honest book that was ever written was Mein Kampf, & nobody gave it a second thought... Diplomacy reached its lowest ebb at Munich, when a conservative Briton carrying an umbrella entered a cage of live Panzers.\\"***Freedom (1940):France is gone. White is amazed & disgusted that some Americans think it is now necessary to get along by going along with the German conquerors of Warsaw, Oslo, Copenhagen & Paris.\\"I believe in freedom with the same burning delight, the same faith, the same intense abandon which attended its birth on this continent more than a century & a half ago... I am in love with freedom & that it is an affair of long standing & that it is a fine state to be in, & that I am deeply suspicious of people who are beginning to adjust to fascism & dictators merely because they are succeeding in war.\\"***The Practical Farmer (1940)\\"My publishers have presented me with H.A. Highstone's book Practical Farming for Beginners, the sly inference being that I have much to learn. Publishers are on the whole well satisfied to have their writers disappear into rural circumstances...\\"\\"Mr. Highstone... knows one importance truth about country life: he knows that farming is about twenty percent agriculture & eighty per cent mending something that got busted... the repair aspect of farming looms so large that, on a place like my own, which is not really a farm at all but merely a private zoo, sometimes months go by when nothing but repair goes on.\\"\\"Mr., Highstone proposes to lick plumbing with a pipe vise. His is the manly approach. But I know my limitations. The practical way for me to lick plumbing is not to have any.\\"***Maine Speech (1940)\\"For lift, the word is heft. You heft a thing to see how much it weighs... Ewe is pronounced yo... Hunting or shooting is called gunning... tackle is pronounced taykle. You rig a block & taykle... persons who are not native to this locality are 'from away'... you've got to be born here - otherwise... road is pronounced rud. The other day, I heard someone call President Roosevelt a \\"war mongrel\\"... Library is liberry. Chimney is chimney... the word dear is pronounced Dee-ah. Yet the word deer is pronounced deer... the final word 'y' of a word becomes 'ay.' Our boy used to call our dog Freddie. Now he calls him Fredday.\\"The Maine Dictionary, by John McDonald & Peter Wallace (Applewood Books; 2000) has a great deal more of this gold mine, & it's even funnier (Mainers, relax. They mock people from Massachusetts. Bosoxers, calm down! The book satirizes the Not-Aways).***Intimations (1941)\\"As I write, this is the third day of the war [December 11, 1941]... Along with this... goes the feeling that it is nip & tuck now, with mankind on earth... the canny & careful reconstruction of barbarism, against the defense of old liberties & ideas...\\"The whole history of the war so far has been the inability of people in the democracies to believe their eyes & ears. They didn't believe the Rhineland or the persecution of the Jews or Poland or France or any of the rest of it. That phase of the war is over. Now, at least, we can see & hear.\\"***And with that I call it a good night."},{"Title":"One Man's Meat","review":"For the grown ups who enjoyed reading Charlotte's Web, Stuart Little to their kids.

This is a film buff's dream book. Truffaut was a great filmmaker - his 400 Blows is one of the most beautifully told simple stories of adolescence ever. A sensitive, personal film. His film criticism, if possible, is better than his films. Truffaut had such a love for cinema, and this passion comes across in his writing more so than in his films.This book is great to just dip into. It is a collection of essays, published and unpublished, expressing his opinion in a playful, fun, yet always intelligent way, of various individual films and entire careers. Included are pieces on the body of work of Chaplin, Welles, Jean Vigo, Jean Renoir, Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, John Ford, Fritz Lang, Frank Capra, Bunuel, Bergman, Fellini, Rossellini, plus many short subjects on individual films by many French new wave filmmakers (Resnais's Night and Fog and Muriel, Vadim's And God Created Woman, Godard's My Life to Live and All Boys... Patrick, as well as some Bresson, Guitry, Tati, Melville, Dassin, Becker, Clouzot and a few others) and American directors of talkies mainly from the 40's and 50's (including Billy Wilder, Elia Kazan, Kubrick's Paths of Glory, Laughton's Night of the Hunter, Lumet's 12 Angry Men, Barefoot Contessa, Bounjour Tristesse and more).Truffaut died in 1984, and this book was published in 1975 in english, but it doesn't talk about any movie after 1960 (i think), so bear that in mind - this is a chronicle of that period of cinema, which i wasn't that interested in when i bought the book, but it very quickly cultivated an interest in me. So even if you don't know much about movies before 1960, you'll find this book fascinating, and perhaps even inspiring."},{"Title":"The Films In My Life.","review":"A film critic and director, Francois Truffaut, brings the reader into an almost literary expositon on films and how they affect us. He takes film beyond its bounds by noting the joys and sorrows directors have put into their creations. Truffaut, as a great director himself, discusses directors and actors like Hitchcock, Renoir, Bergman, Kazin, Welles, Wilder, and many others. What impressed me about the book was the compassion Truffaut has for film making. He brings out the nuances that I failed to notice in great films. For instance, in his discussion of Citizen Kane, he brings out the parallelism between Charles Foster Kane's mother and his love for Susan Alexander by saying Alexander was areplacemnent for his separated mother. And of course rosebud and the snow dome create the crux for such parallels to show uo. In his review for Kane, he brings out such nuances that only a well-carved critic and director could do. Those out there who enjoy film and all its! ! complexities will enjoy this book. A Frenchman discovers what made such films great in so many people's eyes: Rear Window, 8 1/2, The Seven Year Itch, and many other great films.

My only complaint is that this is a book for serious film fans who have already seen the movies he reviews. If you haven't seen the films, his comments aren't referential enough to include you.

And while Scott's mistakes were exposed for the world to see, the leader of the Karluk expedition, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, was so successful in covering up his that he was lionized after his return by the National Geographic Society and no less a personage than Robert Peary. This book was written some sixty years after the fact by a survivor of the expedition, and while the execution could be better, this is an interesting tale that provides a useful counterpoint to the story of the Endurance. While Sir Ernest Shackleton, through his courage, self-sacrifice, and leadership saved every one of his men when the Endurance was crushed in the ice and sunk, when the Karluk was similarly beset the vile Stefansson left his men to die."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"Unliked the other reviewers thus far, I have not read other accounts of polar expeditions, never found the subject intriguing enough when there were so many other histories clamoring for my attention. I'm still not sure what persuaded me to buy this little book, but I am SO glad I did. I found it sufficiently detailed to give me the progressive pictures of ineptitude, boredom, labor, frostbite, incompatibility, isolation, hunger, despair, et al, without becoming bogged down in tedium. By virtue of having waited so many years to pen his account, McKinlay is probably more even-handed in the telling than he would have been otherwise, and makes the book a moving experience rather simply a bitter one. Kudos to the man, he was indeed a canny Scot, and has related a story worthy of being captured on film."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"A totally gripping true-life adventure, written in 1976 by an 88-year old Glasgow schoolmaster who, prior to serving as an officer in WW1, was one of the survivors of a horrifically mismanaged Arctic expedition. The &quot;Karluk&quot; was one of three vessels involved in an exploration of the Canadian Arctic in 1913, master-minded by one Vilhajalmur Stefansson, a monomaniac fixated on the idea of the Arctic as a friendly environment in which abundant food could be soured. In the event however none of the expedition members received any relevant training in survival skills before setting out. The ships' crews did not expect to winter in the Arctic while the scientific staff, of whom McKinlay was one, were almost all young men straight from University, with no previous Arctic experience. Steffanson's callousness in deserting the Karluk once it was ice-bound, and starting an independent five-year exploration journey without making any attempt to arrange rescue of its crew, almost beggars comprehension. McKinlay's story of misery, squalor, sickness, death, cowardice and heroism over the following year is at times depressing reading, but is always gripping. Of the Karluk's complement of twenty five, eleven died following the break-up of the ship in the ice north of Siberia, in the attempts to reach land and during the subsequent struggle to stay alive under conditions of extreme privation. That any survived is due to the heroism of the Karluk's captain, Robert Bartlett, who with one Eskimo companion managed to reach the Siberian mainland to seek help while the other survivors attempted to eke out an existence on the bleak Wrangel Island. The author's account is understated as regard his own role but it was obviously critical in maintaining morale and cohesion in an ill-assorted group with no real basis for camaraderie and discipline. It is the lack of these two factors that McKinlay found the great difference with his later, albeit terrible, experiences in Flanders, making the Wrangel Island episode incomparably worse. The writing is simple, spare and elegant and sweeps the reader along. It is the narrative of a decent, courageous man and it deserves to live on as a classic or adventure and exploration."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"This superb little book is a well-kept secret on polar expedition literature. The ill-fated tragedy of the Karluk and her crew has never achieved notoriety, bacause its return ocurred right at the time of the stupefying return of Robert Scott's last expedition survivors, and also because Mr. Vilhjalmur Stefanson was proficient in concealing the veridical facts. If the usual clamour is that Scott's 1910-13 expedition was confused and wrongly conceived, what to say about Karluk's ? Three overloaded ships, but no man aware of which equipment was in which of them; the main ship tiny and fragile, predictibly crushed by the sea ice; a bunch of men without the essencial feature to survive the shortage and the wildness of nature in high latitudes: comradeship. The sixty years between the start of the journey and the writing of this book work as a filter, allowing the maturation of the author's memories and emotions - but it may have obstacled this astonishing narrative of endurance of turning itself into a classic. Nevertheless, it's never too late to rewrite history."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"I purchased this book to send to my son who teaches history. I decided I would read it, first. The author was a teacher and was honored that he was selected to take this exploration voyage with so many distinguished scientists. This book will show you what the body and spirit can endure when it has the ardent desire to live; among the survivors is the Eskimo family with two children, ages eleven and three, and a cat. This happened in 1913-1914. It will make you wonder if today's people still have the endurance and the will to survive as seen in this era."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"This is the story of a scientist who joined the ill-fated Karluk expedition organized in 1913 by V.Stefansson. Poorly organized and ill-equipped,he tells the story of his survival extremely well. This book is very readable and you have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real and not from Hollywood. Arctic expeditions are dangerous enough- but pre-W.W.I they were even more so. That anyone survived this experience is truly amazing. Mr. McKinlay goes into great detail about their day to day struggle for survival. He writes extremely well, considering he was a scientist. I wish I could have met this man. Great Book!!"},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"The author was a member of Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Arctic Expedition of 1913, and was on board the main expedition ship Karluk when it was frozen into the ice north of Alaska before the expedition was truly begun. The Karluk (abandoned by Stefansson early on) drifted west almost to Wrangell Island before the ship was crushed.The only ones aboard with Arctic experience were the ship's captain and an Inuit family, including two girls ages five and three. Two men were veterans of Shackleton's 1907 attempt on the South Pole, but land ice and sea ice are two different kettles of lutefisk, and their conviction that they knew more than the ship's Captain just made things worse.After leading the men to Wrangell Island, the Captain and one Inuk went ahead to Siberia to seek rescue. Without the Captain's leadership the remaining ill-assorted, inexperienced men fought, stole food from one another, became ill, and generally had a dreadful time. Eleven men had died by the time rescue finally arrived.The author blamed Stefansson's lack of organization and foresight for making the plight of the Karluk worse than it needed to be. In later years he gathered evidence to debunk Stefansson's image as one of the great polar explorers. He twenty-five when he took part in the expedition and was in his eighties when he wrote this memoir."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"I am a fan of shipwreak tales, and this true story is a fine example of the genre. Written by a survivor of this 1913 disaster, the book does an excellent job of describing the suffering the untrained Arctic explorers went through during their months of isolation. However, one major fault is that it is difficult to identify with individuals; they tend to be a jumbled comglomerate. I think this is because the author gives very little personal data about anyone, therefore they are little more than a name and an undescriptive phrase. What compounds this fault, is that two of the shipwreaked crew were from Shakelford's Antarctic shipwreak. It would be interesting to see how their previous experience affected them psychologically. Further, the captain of the Karluk left his ship stranded; an entire book could be written about him. Yet we are given little here to understand his motivations. These real individuals, as well as other crew members, deserve more attention and description. (Book review by Tom Bruce)"},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"If you are interested in Polar survival stories, The Last Voyage of the Karluk is a must for your collection! This is a thought-provoking book on why some people survive under catastrophic conditions and others go under. Not only is it interesting to read for its own merits, but it makes a fascinating companion piece to Lansing's Endurance. Here was a ship stuck in the polar ice where things did not turn out well. Uncertain leadership, class differences, and extreme conditions led to great suffering and loss of life. The author was quite elderly when he wrote it, but the writing style is anything but antiquated. Clearly and gracefully written, The Last Voyage of the Karluk speaks with humor and pathos about a little known episode in the annals of polar exploration."},{"Title":"The Last Voyage of the Karluk: A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster","review":"Geat time reading !I still have 2 questions :1.

He approaches the subject sarcastically serious with a proposal to turn this highly violent landscape into America's newest national park, one which I would be the first visitor.

Reeve's disclosures on what it was like growing up as a Lindbergh tie all the rest of the books about the family together. The passages concerning the kidnapping of Reeve's brother are haunting, and for the first time, you see this child as someone's brother, not a subject of a newspaper account. The similarity between Reeve Lindbergh's writing style and that of her mother's is striking and quite poignant."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"Somehow you just imagine that children of the famous are well taken care of and have a choice of things to do with their lives. Being a student of the Lindbergh writings and accomplishments for more years than I care to admit; I gave little thought to the children of Charles and Anne. If you read the writings of Charles Lindbergh you get a sense of a life well ordered and possibly ridgid, of a disaplined mind and a man who requires disapline around him. It never gave me cause to think about what kind of father he would be, but I had my suspicions. It was refreshing to read about the good times as well as the bad with her Father. It eases the mind to know that he wasn't a &quot;Daddy-dearest&quot;, however he had his quirks. Reeve paints a story about a life before and after losing her father that is rewarding and taxing, just like our own. About loss and gain, but mostly loss. However after losing people close to you, it's hard to not focus on the loss. I finished this book and was emotionally drained, Reeve takes the reader on a roller-coaster emotional ride.. much like her Mother's writings. When all is said and done I had answers to questions I had wondered and learned new things I had not known before. What more could you ask of a book?"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"Caught the author Reeve Lindberg on the Oprah show recently when Peter Jennings was her guest.During the brief time she spoke impressed me greatly that I went out and brought the book.It is an intimate detailed biography of growing up with a famous dad who wasnt there most of the time.She only talks little of the kidnapping as she was not born at the time.I liked that for all there fame John and Anne(who is still alive)were determined to give their kids a normal childhood.One of my ten best biographies for the decade."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"Previous reviews are accurate about the quality of this book and the content, but neglect to mention that it is an extraordinary work of literature. Ms. Lindbergh has composed a series of memory-reflections (she consciously eschews hyphenations like that but I don't know how else to say it), connecting each to the next like a string of pearls. The prose is beautiful, the depth of detail always just right, the psychological observations and self-reflections are compelling, and though her book is more thematically focused, I would rank it with Arthur Miller's &quot;Timebends&quot; among brilliant autobiographical essays. A little-known gem of a book. And look at that cover photo!"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I did enjoy reading this book, but the writing seemed to be &quot;too&quot; much like poetry. I would have liked more interesting facts, and less posturing to be relevant for every thought and feeling. I also did not get a good sense of Reeve's feelings regarding her sister until the middle/end of the book. If she was as crucial to Reeve's life (as she seems to infer at the end), why does it take so long for Reeve to write about her? But this is a good, interesting reading experience . . . just have patience with it."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"Reeve Lindbergh tells stories that we want to hear about everyday life with her famous, complicated father and her intelligent, artistic mother. Reeve's delicate, precise prose is reminiscent of her mother's style of writing. A reviewer said of Anne Lindbergh that she \\"combed\\" her life for meaning and the daughter seems tuned into that same compulsion. It helps that she writes with as much insight as did her mother. The passage that describes the hours mother and daughter spent together after the death of Reeve's child is heartbreakingly revealing of the private Anne and her anguish after the kidnapping and death of her own child. Reeve's reminiscences of flying with her father (she was not an enthusiast) and her longing for her enigmatic father are poignant. She does not avoid discussing Lindbergh's perceived anti-Semitism; she does not attempt to defend him but rather keeps her emphasis on the effect this controversy had (and has) on her connection with him. I challenge any daughter to read Reeve's account of her visit to her father's childhood home without weeping."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"There can be no doubt that Reeve Lindbergh's memoir is the most touching book about that family that I have read. Through her eyes we go beyond the covers of other books and see what it really meant to be a Lindbergh.They were almost a closed society onto themselves, yet they still experienced the same joys and sorrows as the rest of us. We find the man who was depised as an isolationist to be a concerned and loving father who read to his children.We dine with the children at their grandmother's house and we soar above the Connecticut house on Saturdays. The famed aviator at the controls and a bored child in the rear seat.After reading this book I felt very attached to this famous family. Being the same age as Reeve herself, my only knowledge of the Lindbergh's was the famous flight and the kidnapping as I read in history books. Now, after this book, I feel as though I have become part of them.It can only be summed up in one word, wonderful."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I have nothing to add about this fascinating, well-written book. But I do want to urge people who have read Under A Wing, and other books about the Lindberghs, or by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to also read Reeve's novel, The Names of Mountains. It provides another side of the story of this family. A fictionalized account of growing up Lindbergh, it provides insight into Reeve's experiences and her relationship with her mother, and the sorrows and joys they shared."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"Through Reeve's gifted writing, readers get to know what it was like to be part of the Lindbergh family. At last, we find out what has happened to the Lindbergh's since the kidnapping. Reeve described a bedside visit to her dying grandmother, when her father &quot;administered communion to three generations (grandmother, Charles, Reeve) with malted milk tablets.&quot; Anecdotes such as this, plus an honest recollection of childhood years, make Under A Wing a good read."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I have read lots of books about the Lindbergh's, including A Scott Berg's, also All of Anne's diaries and always wondered why she did not continue after the WAR WITHIN.

It increased my admiration of Anne Morrow Lindbergh and her strength as a wife, woman and mother."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"This book is a very well worth the read. Deeply insightful and telling, brings us beyond ourselves to reconsider greatness both pitfalls and triumphs."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"There was much more to this book than just the life of Charles Lindbergh.It was the story of aviation, America's history, changinging times, changing atitudes, and the love of a family. It was a magnificent story, wonderfully woven by A. Scott Berg. I am disappointed in some of the negative on-line reviews. Some are criticizing Mr. Berg for saying nothing new, or for being &quot;approved&quot; by the family. To the contrary, he has told the story in the terms of American history. I had to constantly re-evaluate what I thought the &quot;old days&quot; were like. I was able to personalize them and see what it was like for someone to live during those days. It's true that Lindbergh, wasn't your ordinary person. He went through extraordinarry events. But maybe how he handled them was as an ordinary person. His faults, weaknesses, and shortcoming were as yours and mine, but he handled them with conviction, purposefulness, and concern. He wasn't fualtless, but he made an effort to improve things - aviation, the environment, and the world's future. Before one criticizes, how many &quot;boxes&quot; of your life would A. Scott Berg have to look through? What would he find? What would other say about it? What have you done?"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"There are many interesting subjects in this memoir for the reader to be curious about - Charles Lindbergh's prewar anti-Semitic speeches, Reeve's painful loss of a 2-year-old son in 1985 to encephalitis, the peculiar relationship Charles Lindbergh had with his own mother, as well as the obvious question of whether Reeve resented the fame that came with being the offspring of wealthy and famous parents. These are all fascinating subjects that the author had no problem discussing. In fact, she has already revealed most of this in her previous book The Names of the Mountains. This memoir's disturbing portrayal of life with a sadistic and inhumane father would make a wonderful subject for Stephen King. However, for shock value, nothing compares with the startling observation, on page 45, that the Lone Eagle was hard of hearing and would never have admitted such a frailty! This is astonishing information! What I would like to know, and Reeve never explains, is if Lindy had a hearing problem when Reeve was a young child in the 40s could he also have had that hearing problem a decade earlier when, in 1935, he perjured himself at the Flemington NJ courthouse by swearing under oath, to an adoring jury, that Richard Hauptmann was definitely the man whose voice he heard two and a half years earlier in a cemetery in the Bronx, while he had been sitting in a car half a block away with the windows rolled up! In fact police records show that Lindbergh gave several different versions of what he heard the &quot;kidnapper&quot; say. It is not a human attribute to be able to &quot;recognize&quot; someone you have never met two years after you think you heard them yell something - even if it had been from a very short distance Yet, now we discover from his daughter's memoir that he may never have heard anything at all! And so , the readers of this memoir might be saddened , not only for Reeve's heartfelt losses related in her memoir - her son, her sister, her father - but also, for the little boy who never had a life with his father, Richard Hauptmann, because a famous hero heard absolutely nothing in a cemetery on April 2, 1932."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"There was much more to this book than just the life of Charles Lindbergh.It was the story of aviation, America's history, changinging times, changing atitudes, and the love of a family.

I also have come across references to Mr. Lindbergh in many histories of WW II. Finally, I have read about the trial that followed the death of their first child.The book's cover is telling and comments made by Ms. Lindbergh about her Family seem to fall into 2 categories, her Father, and everyone else. Mrs. Lindbergh clearly was the parent to whom credit for the children of this Family must be given.What does it say when a family feels &quot;relief&quot; whenever the Father leaves. Ms. Lindbergh expresses the same feeling at his death. Her sense of relief did not read as though she was happy his sickness was over, rather relief he, or part of who he was had gone.Her awareness of her Father's anti-Semitic speeches, and his role as spokesperson for America First, slammed into this woman in College. It was not a minor discovery for her. Her Father may have been the first man to make a given flight, and for that there is nothing to detract from. His conduct after the celebrity set in was anything but well handled. As a Father one other reader described him as a tyrant, I believe his kids were terrified of him, and one Son's story she touches upon sheds light on the issue.The book was a little light in presentation, just like A. Scott Bergh's book was. But even that book described a man who built a wire enclosure outside and instructed his first child be placed in it, mid-winter to &quot;fend for himself&quot;.Ms. Lindbergh shares much although not necessarily in the sharpest of focus. What I would love to read are the writings of Anne Morrow Lindbergh if and when they ever are released. Some have been, some have not.This was not Jimmy Stewart playing Lindbergh, this was the real man, and he was seriously lacking.Mrs. Anne Morrow Lindbergh played herself, and from all I have read, that person was someone very special."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"This beautifully written book tells what it's like to grow up as one of the Lindbergh children. What otherwise was a most private family, Reeve opens the door to their New England home and lets us see the personal side of Charles and Anne. She writes honestly, though at times it must hurt, and does address the subject of the kidnapping head on. If you've ever had an interest in any facet of the Lindberghs' life, do not miss this important book."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Reeve Lindbergh has written about her parents, Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, with empathy and love. I was very moved to read about the present problems with her mother, and about the shared experience she had with her mother when her own child died at the same age of her famous brother. I was also very moved to read about Charles Lindbergh as a loving father, and sad that he was also a bit of a tyrant with his wife and children. I remember reading another book about the Lindberghs where someone said of Charles Lindbergh; &quot;You can't be a hero to the rest of the world and a mouse at home,&quot; and I think that was a large part of what drove Reeve's father to be somewhat difficult as a parent. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Lindberghs."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"What a tribute to Reeve and her siblings of the wonderful memoirs of parents, deep love and desire of normalcy for their children. Learning the expectancys of being self reliant and a never ending quest and love for learning both academicly and in their personal goals of achieving their interest. Love of family imediate and extended is so very prevalent, treasuring childhood and adult memories of fun and reprimands though one should reasure love after such so as those being the receiver, not esteem the authoritarian his enemy. A reminiscence of my own childhood of twelve siblings and parents similar in caliber as Reeve's."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"What I especially like about Reeve Lindbergh's memoir is its candid and utterly sincere tone. This is not a dusty historical treatise; it is a simple sharing of thoughts and experiences. The reader is drawn into the life of a young girl with remarkable and famous parents. We already had an idea of what it was like to live with Charles Lindbergh from the diaries of his wife, Anne Morrow. Now Reeve's book gives another view, helping to round out the picture. Along the way she presents us with snapshot images that offer glimpses into his character. Charles Lindbergh wasn't an easy man to understand; and if he is difficult for us adults to get a handle on, what was it like for his offspring? Reeve tells us in her straightforward and heartwarming manner. This book should be an essential part of any Lindbergh fan's library. I highly recommend it.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I don't usually read memoir's, but I'm so glad I did read this one.

Kathleen Wyatt"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I have more than a passing interest in the Lindbergh family, living not far from the site of the kidnapping and death of the baby Charles. So I was eager to read this memoir by the youngest child of the family.It was interesting to note, as Reeve Lindbergh does, that the five children who came after that baby of course did not have any knowledge of him or memories of family life while he was living. Her parents never even spoke of him. So, Reeve and her siblings had to get their information as the rest of the world did, from the press. (As it turns out, they also knew nothing about their parents' affairs and Charles Lindbergh's secret lovers and children in Europe, three women and seven children in all.)This is a well-written memoir. The writer is a very perceptive person who parses the personalities of her parents well. From the way the book begins, though, with all of Ms. Lindbergh's complaints about her father, I thought the book would be primarily grousing. It was hard to make the transition with her when she finally starts elaborating on Charles Lindbergh's better qualities and gives her forgiving take on his isolationist views and seeming anti-Semitism.My reservations about the book, though, concern her writing about her mother. She says very little about her, except that she was emotionally unavailable at times. Most of what she writes about her mother concerns her present state of frailty and dementia. (And I see she's written another book about her mother's last year,No More Words). Why do writers feel they have to write in detail about their parents' decline? After all of Ms. Lindbergh's talk about how their parents valued their privacy, she just barges right in and violates it. I had the same complaint about Christopher Buckley's book,Losing Mum and Pup. Perhaps she sees no value in obsessively trying to maintain matters of privacy, a view she might as well take, now that so much has come to light.For those who remain fascinated about the kidnapping, Ms. Lindbergh includes a chapter with her theory of what exactly happened. The only parts of the book I skipped were the long descriptions of the family home, its grounds, its rooms and their contents. Pictures would have been more useful, as readers just can't follow the writer around and put it all into place, nor do we need to in order to appreciate her world."},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","review":"I really have enjoyed reading Reeve's memoir of her family. She has an amazing memory and can describe details of any past situation like it just happened minutes ago. I am always amazed by people who can do that (especially since I am not one of them). I come from a famous family too and enjoyed reading this book because I have always been fascinated at hearing about someone elses recollections of the past. Reeve's family experience isnt much different than my own family's and in some cases I laugh because some of the stories she has told (i.e. burping a fountain pen) is the same as my familys. My grandfather, who's stories are much the same as Charles Lindberg's, was also raised in Minnesota (St. Paul & Hallepin) so I was delighted to hear Reeve inform the reader of her father's recollections of this same period and place.Reeve writes her book in a way which makes you feel like your her best friend. She opens her soul to you and pours out all that makes her happy and sad. Although I am confident that this book will be considered one of the best memoirs of its time, I am sure that her family will be very glad she wrote it because she has unearthed the legends of her family's past and how it made them who they are.

Neglected emotions do seem locked into muscle tissues and when we do not want to feel them we withdraw life force from that area and it has a harder time regenerating itself, until it gets an illness and starts to suffer.

It is true that a lot of the music is close but not quite. That said, it is an intermediate guitar anthology. The way The Dead play(ed) the music is beyond advanced. I enjoy playing from this book knowing that I am not playing it exactly as Bob does. I actully think this is one of the best Dead anthologies available. If I found a book that had the music as it is played I would have perfered it though. I am still searching for a complete anthology, if anyone knows where I can find it please respond to this review."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead Anthology: Intermediate Guitar/Tab","review":"This book stinks! I would not expect a book of this type to capture the intracacies of the various riffs and solos of the Dead's songs, but the basic melodies in most instances aren't even close.Most of the tablatures do nothing more than follow the lyrics. This is supposed to be a guide to playing the guitar notes and chords, not for singing along. Occasionally, as if by accident, the chords are correct. But listen to either the studio or live recordings of the selected songs, and the tabs provided don't even come close.There is no indication the Dead approved of or sanctioned this publication. It was simply issued by Warner Brothers with no background information at all. This could account for the inexcusable lack of accuracy.Save your money - this book is no better than some of the incorrect tabs you can find online for free."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead Anthology: Intermediate Guitar/Tab","review":"I have been playing the guitar for about seven years now and i love this book. I would recomend it for all levels; it is in also both tab and notes so it would be great for beginners too.

The first is that both of its authors are British. Hence it skews to the right of the Atlantic. Not that I don't feel myself, that British Rock has produced some of the best acts of all time, but for instance there are more entries on and photos of Gary Glitter than Alice Cooper. Gary Glitter? This is just one example. Some one in a review here mentioned the happy inclusion of Yes. If you look through the entries for that band you'll find at least Two mistakes saying that Fragile was their third album, (it was the fourth) and that Owner of a Lonely Heart is from Big Generator (it wasn't). This may seem like nitpicking but these are just the equivalent of what might be found on one page. It makes one wonder how many more of the presented \\"facts\\" are not trustworthy?

You'll find some of the most obscure and some of the most well-known facts, on the same page. Incredible.The main thing I like about this book, is that it's much different from these types of timeline books. Rather than saying \\"this happened, then this happened\\", it does that and provides much more information by giving background stories of many of the artists, and also providing a lot about the impact the person or band had. Also, it's great how the devotes entire pages to show the significance of some important events in rock history. This does a lot to show why some of the greatest bands of all time are considered some of the greatest band of all time. So after reading this, you'll never wonder why again. The bold type really helps out too, if you're looking for someone imparticular. Also if you're a Beatles fan, the only thing you're not likely to find out is how many times they went to the bathroom each week.

What is impressive about this book is how it is able to bridge the gaps between the generations and make them seemingly come togther (Beatles reference!) to make Rock 'n Roll seem like a continuing saga. I dislike most 90s music (and 00s music), seeing it as crass, rude, commerical, lacking heart, overly vulgar and shocking. I hate the fact that Eminem has to share a spot with other great artists from the past, but maybe that's the whole point of rock 'n roll. Our parents didn't like our music and THEIR parents didn't like their music and so on. You can see the controversy brewing in rock from the time it began. But rock is more than just controversy. Artists and genres of all stripes get the billing here. Some see rock as chart oriented, so there's a chronological listing of each #1 for the US and the UK charts, but also gives ample coverage to artists who mainly stayed off the charts but were nonetheless hugely influential. Rock is inherently chaotic but what I love about this book is it brings order out of chaos. From todays preteens and teens to 20somethings and 30something GenXers to Baby Boomers and even graying 60-something beat generationers will all want to spent hours leafing through this fun and informative book.

It gives you boring little snippets of trivial information about events that happened on particular days in rock history. The info in this book is really not interesting. It's actually very dull. There's no interesting storytelling to tie it all together. It's just these little dull factual snippets. This book still leaves you knowing very little about all the musical artists. It doesn't give you their biographies. It doesn't tell you their stories. Also the pictures are not pretty. Most rock stars look scummy and that's how they look in this book. I would have tried to find prettier pictures of them to use since this is a coffee table book, which is supposed to have attractive pictures. Apparently they didn't try to select pictures that look good. This book is too big and heavy. It's unwieldy to read. It weighs a ton. Even so, there is very little info about each band, since it covers so many bands and much of the space is devoted to pictures. You can find out a lot more about specific musical artists by reading wikipedia. I'll have to find some other book(s) about rock & roll history since this one is a failure.

She says she liked it."},{"Title":"Las Cuerdas Vivas de America (Spanish Edition)","review":"To be honest, when I purchased this book in Buenos Aires, I was afraid of being disappointed. The topic was too ambitious: to narrate the lives of five paramount figures in Latin American folkloric music: Atahualpa Yupanqui, V&iacute;ctor Jara, Chabuca Granda, Violeta Parra and Daniel Viglietti. The main absence is Alfredo Zitarrosa that would have been the sixth chord of this musical journey throughout Latin American social voices. The author's motive for not including Zitarrosa is a valid one though: he dedicated an entire book to this central figure of Uruguay's folk music.To make the story short: when I started reading this book, I could not stop. The image created by the author of the five Latin American voices is credible because it shows the human, imperfect side of all of them. Yet, this adds up to the enormous admiration that one has to all of them. Sometimes the anecdotes are too heavy and do not add to the story but that is the author's style. My favorite parts are Violeta's and Atahualpa's stories. However, I still believe that the book intentions were too ambitious: the lives of these referential musicians cannot be constrained to a couple of hundred pages.In closing, this book is a must for those who want to learn the basics of Latin American folk music with a social consciousness."},{"Title":"Corvette","review":"This book is most excellent with many great pictures of Corvettes in their golden age.

The book is a murderously grim yet fanciful and at times hilarious account of the author's growing up in a Paris slum, then going to boarding school in England, then finally apprenticing to a baloonist and inventor in the years before the First World War.

Celine certainly shouldn't be criticized because I can't read French when there are so many other good reasons to criticize him! I've heard Celine's influence on Bukowski commented on several times, and I can only assume that this is because of Bukowski's admission of having read Celine, since the two authors are connected in no other way. Whereas Bukowski's HAM ON RYE is a timeless exploration of what it means to be a youth in America, Celine resorts to self-pitying and annoying drivel. Celine displays none of the youthful self-examination that lends beauty to the horrible events of Bukowski's life. Instead, all misfortune is blamed on those Celine comes in contact with, begging the question: If all of the characters are horrible thieves and liars and the author/narrator is a whining, sniveling self-apologist, then where is the sympathy of the reader to reside? It is because of this lack of compassion with the people of the book that interest is lost quicly. After that loss of interest, the book is simply one anecdote after another from the life of a man bathing in his own self-pity."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Ignore the undeserving pseudointellectual hype surrounding this book. It is nothing but a displeasureable collection of banal observations and anecdotes, not the dark comedy which others profess it to be."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"'Death On The Installment Plan' is a raging animal of a novel that eclipses even Celine's own 'Journey' (though, it must be said, not by much). Structurally it's a shambles, but the unbelievable energy behind each & every sentence is enough to propel the reader straight through the 600-odd pages. What few of the other reviews have pointed out is how gut-bustingly funny this book is. A laugh a line with Celine and no mistake...More than that, 'Death...' contains absolutely the funniest sex scene ever written, bar none. While 'Journey' is tighter and harsher and the later works are more crazily surreal, 'Death...' is the shot of pure Celine that literature needed when it was first published and which the literate world could use another dose of now. And that's no Cambridge lie."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"First, let me ask you: have you read 'Journey to the End of the Night'? If the answer is yes (and if you liked it) then my response to you is go ahead and read Death. Death is very similar to Journey, only Death takes place earlier in the life of Celine/Bardamu.Plot (yes, there is one...kinda):The book begins with a grown Bardamu, practicing medicine in the suburbs of Paris. Soon the action flashes back to his childhood, which is what the rest of the book is about. Like Journey, this book follows the narrator as he moves around to various destinations, including a number of apprenticeships in Paris, boarding school in England, and a farm. There are developed characters besides Bardamu; there are his parents, his uncle, and (best of all) a crazy Inventor who takes young Bardamu under his wing.It was Bukowski who pointed me towards Celine. He praised Journey, but he said nothing about Death. Death was unavailable to me, and after I was done with Journey I tried to read Guignol's Band. I couldn't read it though due to the frequent incoherent streamofconscious rants (and perhaps because it wasn't a Manheim Translation). But then I moved and found Death on Credit (same...Credit is just the UK title, whereas it's installment plan in US), read it, and liked it even better than Journey. There are one or two short parts of surreal/hallucinatory sequences. Even those are short; 98% of the book I would describe as concrete events written coherently.Celine has changed his style a little with his second book. Ellipses are used much more often here than they were in Journey. But I found this to work quite well, both in terms of readability, and in terms of emulating actual speech and thoughts. Also, there are no chapters in Death.Every thing else is what you'd expect from Celine after reading Journey. The bipolar nature of the work--it will make you laugh, then twenty pages later you'll be crying. There's plenty of humor. There's plenty of sexual escapades. Plenty of other little adventures that you'll enjoy reading about.Oh yeah...also, there is less blatant philosophizing in this book. In Journey he'd go off on a rant about how people are terrible, and how society is evil, and how he believes in nothing. Don't worry! Those themes/ideas are all present here, he just doesn't come out and say it, rather, he shows them.So...if you've read Journey and liked it, I strongly suggest you read Death.If you haven't read Journey to the End of the Night, I suggest reading that first. It's not completely necessary. I think that you'll enjoy this book more if you've read Journey. Journey is perhaps the more readable of the two (at least the more traditionally readable). But if you want to read this and then do Journey be my guest, let me know how it goes."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Dr. Destouches, Louis-Ferdinand, whatever you want to call him, this man is the essence of 20th century spleen, frenetic overkill, hyperbolic, high-velocity anathema. He covers all the bases. Nothing is sacred. Everything known to man and then some is fair game for his unhomogynized, vituperative rants. And yet it is not hatred of mankind that informs his venting, it is a weird kind of love. Dr. Destouches was actually a man who would not turn down a poor patient. He had a sincere love for his wife and for his cat. He is the preeminent 20th century answer to Swift and to Pope. He holds mankind up to ridicule. He lambasts the foibles and the rot of civilization. Yet he also displays vestiges of love and of understanding beneath the ravings. He abhors the human condition, yet strangely sympathizes with its common plight. We are all actors in a ridiculous farce. Life is indeed a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing, but we are brother actors, victims of central-casting. There has never before been, nor will there ever again be, such energy displayed upon a page. The man had a vision of hell on earth and was never affronted by it. He was always willing to laugh in response to the pain. His is the consummate howl, the absurd grin, the &quot;barbaric yawp.&quot;"},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"I'm not sure if you're supposed to read this book or Journey to the End of the Night first, I have a feeling that one is a continuation of the other but it doesn't really seem to make any kind of difference. The other book I think might be more of Ferdinand's experiences in the war and as a doctor, while this book deals more with his childhood. It can get confusing actually because the story starts off with Ferdinand as an adult and then without warning switches over to his childhood. The novel then mostly follows his growing up and the various stages of his life, growing up kind of poor in Paris, then going to England for schooling and finally being apprenticed to this quasi-crazy inventor/balloon operator/con artist fellow. This is a funny book but not a happy book, both disdain and love for humanity crackle off the pages and Celine's prose is blunt in its eloquence. His style is bracing today and must have seemed bizarre back when the book was first published, having had most of a century of post-modern writing his techniques don't seem as off-putting as they must have originally but his constant use of ellipses is actually a crucial part of the novel. I think earlier translation had taken them out but they need to be here because they set the pace for the reader, forcing you to pause right when he wants to (Pynchon did the same thing in Gravity's Rainbow and I wouldn't be surprised if this novel gave him the idea) and giving the sentences a broken, staccato feel, somewhere between a crazy man ranting at you and a very intense friend sitting across the table from you telling you exactly how it is and how it's going to be. It doesn't hurt that Celine holds nothing back, his feelings are poured out onto the paper, at no point do you really have to ask, \\"So tell me, how do you really feel?\\" because it's all there. He rages at life, at people, at the world in general in the most excoriating language that the printed page can hold, no swearword is left unspoken, no coarse description left untouched. Everyone in the world hates him and he hates them back, the words coming in clusters, like he's spitting them out through clenched teeth. The situations range from being darkly depressing to darkly hilarious (sometimes both, especially in the scene where one character offs himself) and there sure isn't a lot of hugging going on but Celine is being so honest about the human condition that you don't really mind. And when he goes to get poetic, he manages to take the blunt language and turn it into something grand, a ragged plea for things to not be the way they are. No matter how terrible things get for Ferdinand, no matter what life piles on top of him, he forges onward anyway, spitting and screaming but he never gives up and he never slows down, using the words as a scythe to cut his way through it all. By turns tragic and comic, bawdy and touching, blunt and subtle, it's a big book and a lot to slog through but reading it in small chunks so as to absorb it better is probably the best way to go about it. Not for the faint of heart but those willing to dive into it will find that the rewards are pretty decent."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"This is, quite simply, the best novel I've ever read (and I've read quite a few). At times hilarious, at other times poignant to the point of inducing tears, this book is a roller-coaster ride through the range of human emotions, human foibles, human triumphs. There's more insight on every page here than in most full novels. Far better than &quot;Journey to the End of Night.&quot; A masterpiece. (Read ONLY the Manheim translation.)"},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"The greatest novel of one of the greatest novelists of all time.You would have to write a book longer than Celine's novel to do any justice to analyzing it. Thus I was shocked to find the Wikipedia article about this book was about five sentences long. I dropped what I was doing and spouted off a slightly-edited paragraph about the themes of the novel. It's a flawed and cursory view of a book that is difficult to put into words, but I'll offer it here.\\"It offers a profound vision of the nature of individual human existence: rooted in loneliness, pettiness, and inertia. The antiheroic genius of Bardamu's search for a livable life in early 20th century Paris forms a direct literary metaphor for modern humanity: to search and search again for happiness and meaning in a complex world and to oftentimes come up empty. Or more precisely: to find words, stories, experiences, and ideas that stretch the boundaries of consciousness while providing little or no structure with which to assign any meaning to life as a whole. Life becomes merely a subjective personal experience in the midst of madness and savagery: beautiful in itself but with overtones of profound suffering and a lack of moral prerogatives, and at the mercy of the strange human forces that are both within and without. We become our own history, and our own suffering, and as as such we live: accumulating the pain, happiness, confusion, and death that life allows us to have on installment. Even if it will all be repossessed at the end, when it becomes less than a dream. And that is a moment we all live for.\\"The modern world belongs to Celine. As it more closely conforms to his vision of a future with little hope, a past with veiled lies and atrocities, and an incredible yet painful and ephemeral present, we see that his vision has only become stronger when referring to the world beyond his immediate comprehension or even prediction.This is a fascinating work of art by a writer at the height of his powers. It belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who has ever cared about the realities of human existence."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Everyone who is something in the 20th century writing, has crawled fromunder the master's long overcoat (from Queneau to Thomas Bernhard).

Yet as brittle and tragicas anything out of Euripides or Aeschylus."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"I did not like this book much. I even hate it, and probably would not read it again.But I admit it. I laughed at some of the quirky passages and occurrences, but not at the book itself. DoIP is very vitriolic and vituperative; it is very caustic and corrosive. Beneath its acerbic nature and dark humor, though, lies a very pertinent reflection of the lower depths of reality and man. And although Celine was not one who you would call positive, his book still has that glint of idealism, that belief of happiness, that belief in the virtues that some men possess. Amidst the score of idiots and devils in the novel are some people trying to be scrupulous and generally good even while wallowing in the maw of evil surrounding them.DoIP is Ferdinand's bildungsroman, a story of his development, and of his persistence to live amidst a brew of difficultiespervading in his life. Of course he has degraded morally, emotionally, mentally and spiritually in the course of the novel;but what would you have expected with his circumstances? In the end, though,we see that he is just a child trying to live inthe reality of the world, in pain and in suffering. Yet amidst this he manages to persist, to live, and this is whatultimately Celine tries to preach in his novel (as I have seen it): that one should persist amidst the difficulties, that oneshould live amidst the pain entrenching them, that one should live amidst everything.This may be a dark book, but it has something that light-hearted books could probably never portray: the truth."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Really there is very little to say other than I read it every couple of years and still find other fiction wanting compared to it.

Underneath all his mis- this and anti-that is novel full of deep understanding, forgiveness and love of humanity."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Well, its been about half a century since old Ferdinand croaked and he's still viewed as a contentious devil. There's not too much doubt about his enduring position in French literature (supposedly, he's the most read French author after Proust), but his odious anti-Jewish and pro-Fascist proclivities were fully indulged in during the war years and, as a result, C&eacute;line's ass was booted from the pantheon. So, as for his inclusion in the current \\"liste des c&eacute;l&eacute;brations nationales\\"...pas encore mon vieux!!C&eacute;line made his literary mark with his first book, \\"Journey to the End of the Night\\" which was a biographical work, though considerably embellished. Due to its lacerating prose and profligate use of des mauvais mots (gasp!) proper French literary society was taken aback. The follow-through was \\"Death on the Installment Plan\\" (\\"Mort &agrave; cr&eacute;dit\\"). If inclusion in \\"the List\\" was based on the use of ellipses...well, old C&eacute;line would have it... made! Nonetheless, the author's footprints are, so to speak, on every book by Bukowski and plenty of other modern masters, too.In brief, C&eacute;line's book can be divided essentially in half. In the first part, the young d&eacute;bauch&eacute; suffers mightily at the hands of his petty bourgeoise parents. He languishes in their shop...screws up in school...offends the neighbors...creates mayhem...doesn't say much...is sent to school in England to learn the language (he doesn't)...has many absurd adventures...lazes about (a louche character, indeed!)...moves in with a comical inventor (and self-proclaimed polymath)...has many other sordid, bizarre and absurd adventures...and that's it. Clearly, the intent of both books (\\"Journey\\" and \\"Death\\") is to present a somewhat unstructured (but not \\"steam of consciousness\\") presentation. That device is intended to convey the emptiness of the search for meaning in life as is lack of any evidence of agency by the protagonist, Ferdinand. The young Ferdinand is meant to be a symbol of the helplessness of the individual at the mercy of strange internal and external forces.\\"Death\\" is overly long and could have benefited from judicious editing. This would have been a really punchy read at around 400 pages as opposed to the nearly 600 in the Manheim translation. While I am very fond of \\"Journey\\" and equally taken with \\"North\\", \\"Castle to Castle\\" and \\"Rigadoon\\", it seems to me that C&eacute;line capitalized on the \\"Journey\\" theme and its success and created a derivative work in \\"Death\\". That's not to say \\"Death\\" isn't worth reading, rather I'd recommend starting with the others first.So...anyway...\\"Death\\" is another installment (pun intended) in the anti-hero life of Ferdinand/C&eacute;line. Life does stink...there's little we can do about it...there's not much meaning...and I suspect the reader will know all that by page 300. \\"Journey\\" conveys the same message...but adds much useful detail on C&eacute;line himself and his other career (physician). I found his nasty characterizations of patients in \\"Journey\\" particularly engaging and the development of secondary characters much more complete, to the point where the reader develops sympathy with their plights and disgust for modern (well, 1930s) French society. Not so in \\"Death\\"."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Andre Gide said of Celine, &quot;...he writes not about reality, but of the hallucinations which reality provokes&quot;...this is most evident in Mort, Celine takes us into his early bourgeois childhood and in so defines it as 'stale, petite and engaged with episodes of merde and vomit'...it's a hillarious romp through life's false mirror..."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"He kept my attention with his descriptions of every place he was in, how he felt about what was happening to him and what he thought about his surroundings."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"Still reading this but it is classic Celine.

His passages on a childhood filled with with petty soulessness ring true even in our time, and his never wavering cynicism reveals his most subtle quality; compassion, or, more accurately, an empathy for those who do not fit and yet struggle to live the best life they can under the immutable, spirit-crushing reality thay are born into. In a few words, a transcripted nightmare we all share. A wothy companion to &quot;Journey&quot;, although its long-windedness makes it salighty inferior. And that's still a high compliment.

Here we find more auto-bio text, this time concerning Celine's childhood, but as with &quot;Journey&quot; it is assumable that much of this was symbolic. Celine's descriptions of his family, his schooling, his brief career in jewelry sales, and his appreticeship for a mad genius are all so eloquently written as to bring tears. Each character is full and rich, and each motive is perfectly carried out. Superbly essential reading for anyone interested in what makes humans tick"},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"I find Celine's stuff difficult to get through without losing the very little sanity and serenity that I've struggled to hold on to my whole life. Misanthropic readers, beware...you may find yourselves even more enraged by the 'idiocy of society' during and after reading Death On the Installment Plan (that goes for the rest of his novels as well. Although progressively, his novels lose their power to build up your hatred for humanity while making up for that evaporating pot of piss by amplifying their power to drive you to the brink of madness)...Now to address/warn all the happy-go-luckies...If you're looking for a story that holds even the slightest bit of optimism, you should disregard Death On the Installment Plan.It's a near 600-page novel so a whole hell of a lot happens, but there is one thing that remains consistent throughout: the futility of life. It's the semi-autobiographical story of a boy growing up in France among an impoverished family that sees him as nothing short of an incorrigible pest. It seems like the gods conspire to work against our protagonist, Ferdinand, as he struggles through his childhood years, trying his best to please his parents, but always falling short. Ferdinand learns, at a very young age, to keep his mouth shut for the better, but at times what seems like for the worse. In that sense he reminds me of Charles Bukowski's alter-ego, Henry Chinaski; both seem to keep to themselves because, in both their situations, speaking out doesn't seem to do any good.Bukowski spoke highly of almost no other writer than himself, with Celine being one of the very few exceptions (and for a good reason too).

No one quite knew whether he was a monster or a genius. He began his vitriolic attacks in his first novel, 'Journey to the End of the Night', which was an instant success, continuing in a similar vein with 'Death on the Installment Plan', first published in 1936. Apparently bitter after being wounded in the head during the First World War, he stated: \\"I got it served up on a plate defending my country.\\" 'With his sliced phrases of poetry and muck, his choppy punctuation of exclamarion marks and triple dots, Celine succeeded in his attempt to make print gurgle to the inner ear, to set down the language of guts and tripes and deep festering hates.' Lacking any sense of modesty, he raved: \\"It's my genius, my stroke of genius ! not thirty six possible ways!...\\"He was entirely self-centred in his fantasies and annihilations, almost parodying Proust when he wrote, \\"I know something about the last century, I saw it depart. It disappeared along the road to Orly ...\\" Celine reserves his 'utter hatred' for all bosses. Although seeming to lean towards the left, readers failed to see the fascist implications and anti-semitism in his earlier writing. He had been classed at that time with Joyce and Kafka as one of the three most important writers of this century, but his political aberrations have diminished his stature since then -specifically due to his anti-semitism. 'As Gide pointed out, \\"how could anyone take seriously a man who accused Cezanne, Picasso, Maupassant, Racine, Stendahl and Zola of being Jews?\\" Celine was even too extreme for professional Jew baiters among the Nazis, and his books were banned in Germany. After the war the French authorities tried to extradite him from a Danish prison and execute him - but they failed. His last ten years were spent in Paris at Meudon. His death was announced on the same day as Hemingway's suicide. In short, Celine wanted the total destruction of humanity - and that remains his epitaph!Despite the despair and disillusionment inherent in everything he wrote, in all probability influenced by his wartime head wound, Louis-Ferdinand Celine's writing remains an important, if bizarre, contribution to world literature.The Learning Process: Some Creative Impressions"},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"A constant humming in his ear (an old warwound from the First Worldwar...) drove C&eacute;line mad, as he says...

The portrait of the young Fernand's childhood in working-class Paris slums is shattering in its filth and despair, but one gets the feeling that the wily young scamp likes it that way. Death on the Installment Plan approaches the pain of sexual awakening, the struggle to make a living, and the need to leave a mark with a sly wink - after all, as the author subtly reminds us, the slate is wiped clean in the end"},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"The subject's line meant as a compliment, for those who can take the frenetic style and unrelenting pace of this, his \\"prequel\\" to the more somber Journey to the Edge of Night. Because it deals with adolescence rather than the horrors to befall \\"Ferdinand\\" the author's alter ego in Journey, this book makes for a lighter and more entertaining read. The first half lists the smells and sights of the Passage where he grew, the toil for his parents and then working peddling the Gorloges' \\"manias of a whole insane asylum served up as trinkets\\", ensuing bad sex with the Madame G., off to England for a twist on the Dickensian orphan-cum-Edwardian schoolboy saga. Then, back to France for first Paris and then the sticks as Ferdinand works and swindles alongside the des Pereires couple. He's a mad scientist obsessed with tellurically grown tubers, she's a manic counterpart crazed by her own and her husband's hot air--in more ways than one.The pace moves this book very quickly. Compared to the later Castle by Castle, you can see in Death the origins of the elliptical, staccato style of his later, post-WWII novels. Yet, lacking the despair if not the pessimism of the 1950s efforts, Death still carries a sassiness that makes it an easier read and less bitter to savor. Compared to the earlier Journey, the freshness of youth carries the reader more nimbly through the passages relating wonderfully the stench of being seasick, starving, pants full of excrement, stealing, and sexually randy. This book lacks the gravity of the other works by Celine, but would probably, more than Journey, be the place to start.Yes, the constant negativism does drag the book down if you're an optimist, but then, why would someone who always looks on the bright side of life be attracted to the dark side of comedy anyhow? The narrator, like the author, knows he's a jerk, little better than the rest of failed humanity. The hundreds of pages spent with Courtial des Pereires, in their manic schemes and unrestrained rhetoric, speak of the joy of the crazy dreams we all harbor and their manipulation by those just a bit more avaricious and crafty than the rest of us. The human comedy Celine sketches here, in riotious crowd scenes and gustatory excess being at his most accessible, makes for a spirited encounter with the world, just before 1914 changed it--and the narrator and his author--all again."},{"Title":"Death on the Installment Plan","review":"This was Celine's second novel afterJourney to the End of the Night, and effectively acts as a prequel to his first novel, as this focuses on Ferdinand Bardamu's (Celine's fictional alter ego) troubled childhood and youth in Paris.What matters most, when you read Celine, is experiencing his incredibly intense emotional and intellectual viewpoint of his often desperate, existentialist, awful - and always unsolved - conundrum - of the human condition. From that, Celine wrote and described, there was - and is - no escape. Celine saw humanity as pathetic, disease-ridden, without hope; his only consolation was to grasp a few moments of joy in a life of poverty and hardship. It is a story that is powerfully told, and you can't help but be overwhelmed by it. His style of writing was also still regarded as revolutionary at the time this novel was published: in fact, its intensity, use of ellipses and often hallucinatory sequences written as matter of fact can only be compared to his first novel; there was, at the time in the 1930s, no one with whom to compare him or to match him for the depth, complexity and violence of his negativity in his impoverished world.At the same time as being drawn in and compromised by the narrator's viewpoint, anger and loathing about his life, his constantly argumentative father, his desperate situation, his own hatred of his poverty and the poor in general, you also can't forget that in real life Celine later qualified and practiced as a doctor in the poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods of Paris (which he writes about so effectively in Journey to the End of Night), and was himself effectively and always a persona non grata before and after his \\"profession\\"; and you are further troubled by knowing that, besides he also lost his reputation as a writer - shunned by the literati of Paris - in his own lifetime because of his fascistic views (even though in practising his medicine, he attended to everybody, irrespective of whether the person was Jewish or otherwise).And while Celine and Bardamu both hated \\"humanity\\", both were always specific, explicit and thankful for those few individuals that made a difference in their lives, including the wonderful characters of certain women, who plied the trade of prostitution, Violette, Lola (in 'Journey'), and others. It is a compelling novel, and in some ways is even darker and more troubling than his first, and most famous novel, but if you were impressed by 'Journey', you will be all the more so by this prequel."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I picked this one up on a whim. I had never heard of Mr. Smith, and I certainly hadn't read anything by him prior to this. Talking, walking alarm clocks? Roving bands of coffee makers? Is this book for real????? Luckily I continued reading despite my initial reaction to the story. I am so glad I gave this book a chance. It is bizarre, it is surreal, but somehow it all works.Hap Thompson narrates this story about how he came to be employed as a dream and memory receiver, and how this line of work quickly puts him in danger. On the sly, Hap decides to accept a memory (which is illegal work) from a client who then refuses to take back the memory; Hap is in danger not only of going to prison for life but of being killed for this memory. He then sets out on a roller-coaster adventure that addresses ethical, philosophical and theological issues....but it's done in such a tongue-in-cheek, film noir style that it avoids being preachy.The setting is sometime in the future in a world where humans share space with appliances that not only talk but have attitude. Surfing the internet takes on a literal meaning in this story, and computer hacking is central to the plot. This is a quick, funny, suspense story, and I enjoyed it immensely. Sometimes I'm totally surprised by a book....this one surprised me by how much I enjoyed it. I described it to a friend as Mickey Spillane meets Alice in Wonderland meets the X-Files meets Brave Little Toaster."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I had this book pressed upon me. My friend gave it to me far to early one morning. Every time I met him he asked me if I was reading it yet. Eventually I started it. And was thoroughly confused. The opening is utterly preplexing, but intriguing. It draws you in. Then you get to the premise, and that's it. Forget about stopping, it's not really an option.Sure, many of the ideas may not be original, but frankly, there's not much originality out there. The genius is in the mix, and Michael Marshall Smith get it just right. He does something that doesn't seem to be widely expected in the days of 5-second attention spans, he makes you think. And wait. The anticipation of an explanation for the various events that shaped Hap's life are what drives the book along. When I finally got to the bank, I was remarkably excited about it (actually, to such an extent that the more detached part of my mind was really worried about me), but it was quite an unusual experience.Lastly, I have to comment on the humour in the book. I think that's why my friend was so insistent on my reading it. The humour of the book is brilliant. I haven't laughed reading a book so much in quite a while. Jingo, by Terry Pratchett, perhaps. That was 1997.

I love Smith's knack for twists on technology - the talking appliances (also seen in Spares but less developed) add quite a bit of humor to the reading. Smith also has a fabulous way of describing the ordinary that will make you chuckle.I found myself drawn in throughout the book in a similar way to the first two. I say one only must read it once as a comparison to Only Forward, and even Spares. With Only Forward, I immediately turned back to the first page and started reading the entire book again, having so many questions. What drew me in was Smith's ability to make you think - and though there are signs of it in One Of Us, it lacks some of the power in Only Forward. Still, it is a complete book and one I would highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"One of Us follows two amazing books, Only Forward and Spares. I liked it, but it doesn't compare well to the previous two.Smith seems to be developing a pattern to the plot in his novels. Lots of mystery, interrupted by the occasional talking applicance, followed by some weird reality-bending concepts toward the end of the book. One of Us has a more intricate plot than the previous novels, and a more solid grounding in conventional reality, but I would have liked to see him break out of the mold entirely.The characters seemed somehow less alive. The ruminations of the protagonist lacked a certain something.The book is considerably less gory than his earlier works; whether that's an improvement is a matter of taste.I've come to view this book as Smith &quot;lite&quot;. It's an easier introduction to his writing than, say, Spares, but it just feels like there's something missing.I should finish by pointing out that, although this review is generally negative, it's only so because I loved his earlier works so much more."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"The spine of this book labels it as \\"suspense,\\" and it certainly does share some aspects of that genre. It is also, however, a science fiction, mystery, fantasy, speculative religious thriller. This is both the joy of the book, and its curse. The joy is simply reading it for the excitement of not knowing what Smith is going to throw at you next. The curse is wanting it to coalesce into something besides the ephemeral pleasure of a roller coaster ride, and being disappointed when the coaster car simply comes gliding back into the station.Hap Thompson is a petty con man who has fallen into the less-than-savory business of being a dream-washer and memory-holder. This would have likely been fine, except for his character flaw of being able to turn down wads of cash hovered virtually in front of him. He agrees to do a side memory job for a client so as to see all of the cash rather than just the skimmed bit given to him by his employer, REMtemps, and instead finds himself holding onto the memory of the murder, and if he doesn't get rid of it soon, LAPD will be on him. It doesn't matter that he didn't commit the murder--just having the memory is enough to set him up for life.Smith hovers between writing like Raymond Chandler and William Gibson, and the result isn't as unpleasant as that match might seem (in fact, I've long thought Gibson's style of cyberpunk fit the early noir of Chandler, and only needed the psychological edge of James M. Cain to really perfect it). The book breaks down towards the end, however, when Smith starts trying to channel either Benny Hinn or Joseph Campbell. This is similar to the macguffin in Neal Stephenson's work, where he actually tries to make sense of all the fun and all it sounds like is pseudo-scientific claptrap.Smith's an interesting enough writer to watch, however, and there are a number of science fiction/mystery novels that don't even come close to being as engrossing as One of Us. You could do much worse for pleasure reading, and there's not much better being published today."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"A gripping yet belivable read. Profound, humorous in style, keeping in line with his previous publications..Only Forward and Spares.Eagerly waiting for the next title..."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"It's refreshing to read a novel containing future technology that's written by someone who understands current technology! The quirky aspects of this book, like the talking appliances, made it stand out from a crowd, and the observations of our hero regarding the world around him truly cracked me up. Good characters, good story, and a view of the future that I could actually fathom make this an excellent read."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I enjoyed Michael Marshall Smith's latest quite a lot. A lot of post-Neuromancer books go overboard on hip, futuristic dialogue and lose hold of the characterization, but he is able to create very human, appealing characters. The only let-down was the metaphysics lesson at the end, I would have preferred for Smith to have let God and the 6 Angels remain more of a mystery."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"Firstly, all claims that this is 'Only Forward' revisited are entirely justified. The book follows exactly the same trend of Original Ideas, tension, humour, gore and cats.(only one cat this time actually) All Michael Marshall Smith books so far have been pretty much along the same lines and brilliant because of it. The only reason you shouldn't buy this book is if you haven't yet bought 'Only Forward' &amp; 'Spares'"},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"As always Michael Marshall Smith shows staggering creativity in One of Us. I think One of Us matches Smith's first book, Only Forward in vision, but he is much more understated and well developed. An *exellent* book for anyone who likes fantasy that makes you think."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Michael Marshall Smith. I thought that Only Forward was the greatest read of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate, however, that his latest novel, One of Us, fails to achieve the transcending greatness of his first two novels. Mr. Smith continues to beat the &quot;not so distant future&quot; horse to death, and unlike the brilliant (almost poetic) vision of this future in Only Forward, One of Us seem to be grasping for a definitve vision that just isn't there. Frankly, I found the last half of the novel difficult to read. It tries so hard to be a complex, moral thriller that it loses it's sense of a tight, well concieved plot. Please, please, please, Mr. Smith try breaking some new ground. Your talent is too great to be wasted on novels like One of Us."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"Mr Smith's superb story crafting shines through yet again, in another future world noir thriller. After the quality of Spares, I was not expecting his next book to be able to match it, but One Of Us does so easily. A superb book, and I would recomend it to anyone..."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"By 2017, science and technology have evolved to the point that gadgets can now convert dreams into a form of electromagnetic energy.

Only Forward had me gripped and laughing, Spares had me imagining an unmoving sea and it was with pleasure that I sat down to read One of Us. I was not dissappointed and you will not be either. His story is intelligent, funny, even touching at times. Yet he still keeps up the pace and spins the plot in so many different directions you don't know what to call the story, thriller, drama, sci-fi babble?? Who cares as long as his books keep coming out like One of Us I and many others will be very happy.Just one last thought to leave you with: Where do you want to go tommorrow?? Michael Marshall Smith can take you there."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"A very funny ride through the life of a low rung criminal. That encompasses everything from aliens to intelligent household appliances and even the afterlife. Very well written and would have got 5 stars if it were not for his first book, the amazingly funny and well written Only Forward. All in all this is his second best book and I can't wait for the film version."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I read &quot;Only Forward&quot; and thought it was a cunning book with levels within levels. This isn't quite as convoluted but is enjoyable nonetheless. Mr Smith's mind seems to live in a world at 90 degrees to the rest of us, and leaves you thinking &quot;Would you live in his world?&quot; I'm really looking forward to his next!"},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"Following the brilliance of 'Only Forward' was impossible, as 'Spares' bears witness, but this is a great read and puts MMS firmly back on track."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"This book is a damm good read but it's got a few problems. Firstly it's got a plot thats been written by a computer. Its, like a pick and mix book. All the ideas in the novel seem to have come from another book or film (eg the memory storage - William Gibson) The second problem is the Mr Smith appears to have sold out. His first book, Only Forward, is in my top five but his subsequent novels seem to be following the wel worn Crichton model of writing books that can be turned into a film Having said this I still recomend any Sci-fi fan to buy this book."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"Place this book in the fridge between readings - it's that hot. Forget the Oxford English Dictionary - this book has all the words you will ever want to read - and in a much better order. Michael Marshall Smith may one day be regarded as the one of the most important authors of the twentienth century - or history may dictate he is remembered only as some bloke who was always going on about cats. Either way - this book will shove an egg whisk into your senses and froth up your whole outlook on yourself, your friends, and shiney things in general. I for one - am hugely impressed. And no mention of Bison - how does the lad do it? Terry Alderman"},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"M.M. Smith still has something to deliver... After adorable &quot;Only Forward&quot; I was a little bit dissapointed by &quot;Spares&quot; however &quot;One of Us&quot; has brought back belief that M.M. Smith may become a very good writer. Probably the biggest problem of this book is overextension and duplication of some ideas from previous books althought it is still a pleasure to read it and there is no so much blood like in &quot;Spares&quot; and humour's level is closer to &quot;Only Forward&quot; tops. I like this book, however if the fourth book will be an scifi action thriller in the 3 level universe again I will offer for Michael to take some rest."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"just have to say that this is the best book i have ever read BUY IT NOW!"},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I must be getting more critical as I get older, but in &quot;One Of Us&quot; MMSmith has taken liberties that I can't comprehend or forgive.I did thoroughly enjoy his main character, Hap (actually hapless in this tale) Thompson, his friends and associates, and I found the language and style most engaging.I was put off by the walking talking alarm clock at the start of the book (not unlike Jimminy Cricket in another familiar fantasy), and found the concluding attack of the appliances to be much too great a stretch. I also felt Smith's exposition on the nature of God and the angels to be overdrawn and yet another grasp for a way out of an interesting but failed plot.Mind you, I did like the writing enough to just order 2 more of Smith's earlier and highly praised works, but I'd recommend letting this sleeping dog lie."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"I was given a copy of &quot;Spares&quot; as a present and really enjoyed the pace, moody characters and dark plot. So I rushed to get a copy of &quot;One of Us&quot; and, boy was I disapointed. Credit is due to the well defined characters, vivid imagery and attention to details but as the space-aliens appeared in the tired and un-mellifluous detection story I was insulted. Could movie deals have killed this writers integrity? Perhaps a re-read may change my mind but after forcing myself to read the last third of the book, instead of putting it in the trash, that change of mind will never happen."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"But not like them AT ALL! For one thing, the writing is not on a par with that of the afore-mentioned writers. Also while the subject matter might well have been &quot;borrowed&quot; from some more famous and balanced works, it is not in any way new or inspiring.I'm getting tired of over-hyped and patently misleading book blurbs. Save your money, there are far better Sci-Fi works out there. &quot;One of Us&quot; Is dull, derivative, and pretentious. I could forgive that if it was a fun read, but it's not."},{"Title":"One of Us","review":"You know from the moment the talking alarm clock appears, and you have to stop your car so washing machines can cross the street, you're in for a very different read. But, ho hum, what a tremendously boring book! It's &quot;film noir&quot; atmosphere is lame and convoluted; the premise, while interesting, is about as original as Spam; and the characters merely cardboard and as interesting as &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot; I hate this book, because it insults us with so many bizarre images, and expects us to find it amusing. The inclusion of God as a focal character is just too much poetic license. A real drag; don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The naked city (Dell first edition)","review":"For those old enough to remember \\"Naked City,\\" it was an acclaimed show from the Golden Age of television. And it deserved its acclaim. At first a half-hour drama, it later expanded to a full hour, with different key characters in the same basic roles. In both incarnations, many of its finest stories were written by Stirling Silliphant.He may not be as well-remembered today, which is a shame, because he was right up there with Rod Serling at his peak. And just as Serling wrote short stories based on the teleplays of his \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes, Silliphant did the same for \\"Naked City.\\" The result is this slim paperback original, adapting eight episodes of the original half-hour version.They might have been turned out quickly, to capitalize on the success of the TV show, but they were solid work. Silliphant was a thoughtful, philosophical writer, utilizing the genre format to tell unique slice-of-life stories. If the tone is sometimes a touch heavy-handed by contemporary standards, the content is usually of greater depth. He was trying for entertainment AND intelligence.For example, in his adaptation of \\"Line of Duty,\\" examining the emotional toll taken after an idealistic young policeman's first killing of a criminal, the older partner says, \\"All our lives long, we're born and reborn. Constantly hatching out of one egg into a bigger egg, until finally we either break out and have a long wide look at the universe or we give up and settle for a view of the shell. And all the time we're trying it, all the time we're trying to break free, guilt keeps snapping at our heels, guilt that we're smashing the egg that sheltered us.\\"Now, it's likely that very few police officers actually spoke quite like that, so it isn't all that \\"realistic.\\" But he's saying something many of us have felt at some point, so that we recognize it & think about it. Not unlike the image of the bird breaking free of the egg in Hesse's \\"Demian,\\" in fact!While some of the hour-long episodes have been released on DVD, the half-hour episodes are still unavailable. And this tie-in book is nearly 50 years out-of-print now. But if you should ever stumble across a copy somewhere, it's worth picking up. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism","review":"You probably don't know this, but in 1920 Upton Sinclair self-published arguably the first ever structural criticism of the corrupt and broken press system in America. Not only did he self-publish it-at the height of his fame no less-but he refused to copyright it, hoping to pass through the complete media blacklist a book like this faced. It went on to sell more than 150,000 copies its first year. Take that, Cory Doctorow! Though the book has been almost entirely forgotten by history, it's not only fascinating but a timeless perspective. Sinclair deeply understood the economic incentives of early 20th century journalism and thus could predict and analyze the manipulative effect it had on The Truth. Today, those incentives and pressures are different but they warp our information in a similar way. In almost every substantial charge he leveled against the yellow press, you could, today, sub in blogs and the cable news cycle and be even more correct. In fact, the reason that most newspapers could escape this criticism is that over the last 50 years they have instituted many of the important changes he asked for."},{"Title":"Christianity in a Revolutionary Age. Vol. V : The 20th Century Outside Europe; the Americas, the Pacific, Asia and Africa, the Emerging World Christian Community","review":"Kenneth Scott Latourette (1884-1968) was an American historian of Christianity, who had been a missionary to China in the early 20th century; he is also the author of the comprehensive 1953 history,A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)andA History of Christianity, Volume II: Reformation to the Present. This volume was first published in 1962.He observes that \\"In the United States, the 'folk churches' of Europe became denominations, while the 'dissenting' ... of Europe became 'folk churches.'\\" (Pg. 18)He notes, \\"The record of what was called the social gospel was ambiguous... the social gospel arose in the latter half of the nineteenth century in an attempt to combat the ills which were associated with industrialization ... Many laymen, whether in liberal or conservative churches, objected to sermons by their ministers on social issues. They declared that the pulpit was moving outside its proper domain and was speaking on questions in which it had no competence.\\" (Pg. 110-111)He admits, \\"Whether in the mid-twentieth century Protestantism was more deeply or less deeply rooted among more peoples than was the Roman Catholic Church would be difficult to determine. The ecclesiastical structures of the two branches of the faith were so different that reliable comparisons were impossible... In Protestantism the absence of any acknowledged central administrative authority permitted a large and growing number of movements sprung from the soil...\\" (Pg. 273)He notes in his conclusion, \\"Nor did Christianity save the Roman world. By the time the majority in the empire had assumed the Christian name, inner decay had been obvious for some time. Then and in the later centuries caustic critics attributed that decay to the contemporaneous spread of the faith.\\" (Pg. 517)This series is a very helpful supplement to Latourette's 'A History of Christianity.'"},{"Title":"Making Home Work: Domesticity and Native American Assimilation in the American West, 1860-1919 (Gender and American Culture)","review":"This is a compelling exploration of the efforts made by US government field agents in the last quarter of the 19th century to \\"domesticate\\" Native Americans: to teach them how to live and work Euro-American style, in nuclear rather than extended families, in square houses rather than round teepees, and within patriarchal gender relations and divisions of labor. The really interesting thing is that these field agents were very often women, for whom the value of \\"women's work\\"--its economic as well as its moral value--occasionally became destabilized even as they insisted upon native adoption of it for its \\"civilizing\\" influence. Simonsen gets at all of this (and more) by examining an array of evidence: popular domestic literature of the time, photographs taken by ethnologists and amateurs alike, and model homes run by graduates of such Indian schools as Virginia's Hampton Institute. A terrific, must-read for anyone interested in the history of domesticity, of labor relations among American whites and natives, and of western settlement."},{"Title":"Once off guard (Popular library)","review":"Great to to get the original copy after so many years. In very good condition. Very interesting to read as a background to Fritz Lang's &#34;The Woman in the Window&#34;."},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","review":"The way I see it, the \\"Chord Progressions\\" book/CD is a great companion to the main Musician Institute book for Rhythm Guitar, the \\"Complete Guide\\". While the \\"Guide\\", another excellent book, builds your playing technique and chord vocabulary and can be used as the main \\"course book\\", \\"Chord Progressions\\" provides dozens of realistic examples of rhythm guitar as applied in popular music.\\"Chord Progressions\\" is a great value for the money! It is useful for the beginner and intermediate guitar player, as it lays out smart chord progressions and includes 100 well-recorded tracks covering most styles in American popular music, from folk rock to heavy rock, from country to new wave, from soul & funk and reggae to classic rock ballads. Believe me, there are lots! And the guitar sounds right on every track.If you are a well-rounded music lover that enjoys different styles, particularly from the '60s to the '80s, this book will have something for you. As for me, I am committed to learning ALL of the progressions. I found the music fun and they are a great source for songwriting and jamming inspiration.Playing the tracks in enjoyable in its own right, but the greatest benefits will come from studying the progressions (rhythm, harmony and melody) and relating it to the famous and worthy music that guided the making of this book.The author introduces EACH progression with very welcomed info on harmony, suggested playing technique, tricky parts and what makes the track effective. Do not overlook Mr. Kolb's comments as they clarify the \\"lessons\\" you should take from the exercise.As a final remark, please note that the level of difficulty DOES vary from track to track, but NOT in a gradual way. Since the exercises are separated by style rather than difficulty, you might be stuck on a tough \\"country rock\\" lick, but if you move a few pages ahead you might find a rock ballad that is much easier. That is just an example, but the message is: browse through the whole book - there are lots to enjoy. Some tracks you might be able to play right away, others will take considerable practice to sound right... But in the end, by the time you master this fine book, you will be ready to join most bar bands in the world! OR perhaps write a hit song based on a \\"classic\\" progression."},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","review":"I've been doing these progressions in order though you don't have to - but doing so really gives you a feel for how different voicings and sometimes different keys can flavor the same style and make it sound fresh. I had gotten in a rut, droning on in practice trying various voicings for chords and needed something to make such practice more productive and efficient. I tried this book based on the reviews here and found that this guy had done all the work for me in writing out and recording a collection of useful progressions that sound great and really mix up the voicings.Descriptive narratives are provided in the book for each progression sample. These are really great because they point out the main concepts in a nutshell - things you might already know and understand but might not really talk about in such a well summarized way.I use the cd that demos each sample to loop the progressions and play along, changing from rhythm to lead back and forth so I am ending up getting more then double my money worth - the rhythm guitar practice is great and then doing lead practice against each progression helps get you comfortable making up rifs and melodies for each style against the various voicings... I can't believe the price point on this. It's so little for so much - get it before they catch on to what a deal this is!Bottom line: This book is fun, and it helps train your ear and improve your playing. Mastering all the samples will add a lot of variety to your tool kit of sounds - a great collection of voicings to encorporate in your own creative efforts."},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","review":"I love this learning to play guitar book because it includes ALL kinds of music: rock, country, fusion, bepop, punk, and on and on. Each chapter is a different style of music, so you can flip around to your favorites and learn a bit of everything! As a beginner, I thought the difficulty level was perfect. I learned a lot of new techniques. Only a few of the music pieces (each one is short - not a full song length) were too hard for me. I felt like I improved a lot especially with barre chords and different styles of strumming."},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","review":"The book has a lot of usable progressions even though I personally am not into Folk or Country, all the progressions help to increase speed and in most cases can be used in a variety of styles.The first part of the Rock section is very disappointing as I personally cannot comfortably stretch across 5 frets (from 3 to 7) just to hit a two note power chord.Also some of the cd tracks don't match the Tabs exactly, but close enough that you can figure itout.Some of the reviews call this book cheesy or contemporary, and I am not sure exactly what these people are after, as this book is obviously to put together simple chord progressions to build up chord change speed; which it does very well.This is actually my second (modified) review of this book, as once I gave it more time, I was actually pretty impressed.As Chord Progression books go, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","review":"Tom Kolb prepared a unique book: chord progressions in different styles. it is surprising that there few books about this topic, what makes this one so special.
