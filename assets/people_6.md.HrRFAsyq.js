Of the 10 books in the series thus far, Flashman and the Dragon offers one of the most intriguing settings: the Taiping Rebellion, in which a self-proclaimed messiah led an uprising against the Manchu rulers of China, a conflict that racked up more casualties than the First World War. Fraser's description of the British sacking of the Summer Palace (a punitive gesture that became an excuse for vandalism and plunder) is memorable"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Having been an avid reader of the Dand McNeil-stories and of the early Flashman novels, I lost touch with the series for a couple of years. Returning to it through the services of Amazon.com, the change in style I noticed is quite remarkable. The earlier books use historic fact loosely as a backdrop to great storytelling; now I find a Notes-section that would be a credit to any PhD-thesis on the subject. Mr. Fraser seems overly concerned that we might doubt the historic accuracy of any person, remark or fact he describes. In such a context the love/lust-story between Flashman and the First Concubine becomes almost irritating, being of course not only historically totally incorrect as well as utterly improbable to anyone with even a fleeting knowledge (or suspicion) of Chinese imperial court life and culture of that time.In my humble opinion one should either try to be an entertaining popular historian or an entertaining writer of historic fiction. Mr. Fraser now tries to be both at the same time and I find the result a mixed blessing. And instead of having to constantly refer to the back of the book to see what all those 1234 notes are about, I would rather have seen a short closing chapter containing the relevant historic facts.Of course hardcore Flashman-addicts will heartily disagree. But try re-reading &quot;The general danced at dawn&quot; or &quot;Royal Flash&quot; and maybe you will get my point."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"RIP George MacDonald Fraser, 1925 - 2008\\"We raised not a line, we carved not a stoneBut we left him alone with his glory\\"- Charles Wolfe: On The Burial of Sir John Moore: after Corunna\\"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away\\" - Douglas MacArthur\\"Come Bacchus' sons, be not dismay'dBut join with me each jovial bladeCome booze and sing and lend your aidTo help me with the chorus\\"- Garryowen\\"Sang Kolinsen! That woman and her child are under the protection of Her Majesty's government! I speak for Lord Elgin and the British army, so ... back off! You dirty dog, you!\\"This is just one gem from a rollicking tale of adventure, derring-do (and don't), lechery, boozing, twaddle, old China handery, scuttling for cover and disappearing over the sill.The British officer is a great admirer of your warlike \\"race\\" and he likes Mongols, Sikhs, Gurkhas and Boers as friends and enemies. But as your typical British officer, Flashy has no use for the philosophical Chinese.It's only a pity that Fraser will never contrive to have Flashy's angry ghost at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong rogering Princess Diana at a suite in the Peninsula, cadging a light for his cheroot from Chris Patten in the smoker's circle out back, breaking wind during Charles' stem-winder, or letting the air out of the tyres on PLA staff vehicles behind the Prince of Wales barracks.Nor shall his great-great grandson, Harry Paget-Morrison, at least in Fraser's inimitable tales, scuttle through Afghanistan, nor liaise with General David Petraeus in hopes of a soft billet while rolling his eyes as Yank officers above flag rank ignore the obvious, obfuscate the simple, simplify the complex, and get chaps killed, American officers below flag rank invite him to come to Jesus (an invitation which he of course declines), the sergeants booze with him in the Humvee, and the enlisted men wish to G-d that they were Quartered Safe Back There.In his last book, Fraser expresses mostly incomprehension at the modern world. But it is doing its damnedest to regress to Victorian times courtesy of pompous Yuppie thugs bawling Hosannahs in church while a working class generation deprived by the mad woman, Thatcher, of jobs in mines that are now returning thanks to the price of oil (showing the folly of the 1980s deindustrialization of the North of England) fights for the chance to join the Army and go to war as opposed to the more sensible choice, which would be to live in London upon the earnings of an whore.I shall miss the appearance of new adventures in the Flashman series in the shops, but I do hope that no Grub Street hack gets it in mind to continue the story as above. No one can tell the tale like Fraser could, and all we need is a Collected Works in the old style, on India paper, with small type."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"I began reading Flashman novels on the recommendation of a librarian in 1984. Flashman introduced me to history as enjoyable bedtime reading. This last month, in 2009, I began reading Flash again. I marvel at characters and incidents related so vivaciously and accurately. Making dragon ladies sexy, prime ministers klutzy, and generals comedic helps connect history to humanity. And Flash is funny, direct, and entertaining in some very dramatic settings and events of the 19th century. Rare are the opportunities to be successfully appealed to emotionally and intellectually. The sex is good, too. Long live Flashman!"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"The title is unfair because all of the Flashman series is great but the character is always at his best when there is some type of war situation going on. The way in which the best anti hero of the Victorian age gets caught up in the Taiping rebellion and other such events in china is very true to form.At some points a tragedy and at other times a total laugh riot. The historiography as always is excellent.Overall-The only sad part is that with the death of the author we will now never know the exact route Flashy took from China to the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Typically fantastic Flashman novel- hilarious, politically incorrect, unpredictable, historically informative, and a page-turning, ripping great read. The only thing you know for sure is that our yellow-bellied anti-hero will end up with the girl, the medals, the credit and the loot. As usual, we learn about a historically significant, but generally forgotten chapter of history- the Taiping Rebellion (bloodiest civil war in history and second bloodiest war ever, after WW II) and the Anglo-French expedition to Peking, resulting in the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, one of mankind's most impressive artistic/architectural treasures. Great book."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Flashman is a colonel in the British army. He is sent to China to investigate the Taiping revolution in the years 1840-1860. Flashman gets himself into impossible predicaments, managing to extricate himself just in the nick of time. He is a real man with the ladies and takes every opportunity to consummate every encounter. This a great blend of historically accurate story telling through the eyes of an engaging rouge. He does everything that I would want to do if I just had the guts"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"This isn't the perfect starting place for readers unfamiliar with the Flashman saga-really one should start from the beginning-but this is damned good fun and excellent history from MacDonald Fraser,who's chronicaled Flashman's career from young thug to titled poltroon. Flashman isn't really a lovable person-he literally has no concience-but he does exactly what every reader's baser instincts urge him to do in every instance. The novels' premise is that Flashman is the villain of the Victorian novel, \\"Tom Brown's School Days\\",the brutish bully expelled from Rugby Public School for drunkenness. He is a drunkard, a cad,a bully,a coward, a seducer, a cheat,a sadist-sort of a modern Id let loose in the gigantic Super Ego of Victorian society. In these novels Flashman \\"comes clean\\" and tells the astonishing true story of his life. Flashman is cunning and intelligent but he's also amazingly lucky and no matter how cowardly or despicable his actions, he's always able to twist the truth in the end and add to his heroic reputation. This installment finds him involved in the Taiping Rebellion (no,I'd never heard of it either). As Flashman points out,because he's regarded as a hero he's expected to throw himself into every conflict and to volunteer for every dangerous mission that comes along, so staying out of danger can be a dicey matter-his reputation doesn't allow him to simply refuse and so he's usually in the soup. Completely against his will Flashman finds himself serving as the contact between the Taiping Rebels, who wish to overthrow the corrupt Chinese Emporer's court, and Great Britian, which is ambivalent in the matter. There's more,of course-Flashman beds various fascinating women and survives unspeakable dangers-by doing literally anything he has to, including kow-towing to a Chinese noble and engineering a killing-and in the end he wins yet more undeserved accolades. It is a crime that these novels are not better known than they are-I've read all of them and while the quality naturally varies a bit there isn't one of them that I haven't re-read at least once. MacDonald Fraser should be knighted. Do you know how your kids feel about the Harry Potter series? That's how a lot of us feel about the Flashman books."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Another one of the great books on that Cad Sir Harry Flashman VC. Mr Fraser is to be complimented on his wonderful editing of the old soldiers memoirs ! I just hope that he finds the time to keep up the excellent work!"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"The thing that sticks with me a fortnight after finishing this book is the wire jacket. Eurgh! It makes me squeam to think about it.GMF adds another episode to the life of Harry Flashman that takes our (un?)fortunate (anti?)hero to China during the Taiping Revolution and the shenanigans at the Summer Palace. As always, Flashman sees history occuring onhand, and barely escapes with his life. He's a coward and he's a liar: he calls himself a monster and he is, but he's also a public hero and his Victorian counterparts can't prevent themselves lauding everything he does.Don't know anything about the history? Don't let it put you off. In fact, it should encourage you to read this book. As much as I've enjoyed all the Flashman books, the greatest legacy they've left me has been a far greater understanding of 19th century history. Little facts are sprinkled in along the way, such as when the americans fight alongside the british for the first time in their history.Without giving too much away, the plot is a bit straggly: we start with Harry getting mixed up with the Taipings, and then spending some time at the Summer Palace. To me it seemed like one short story and one novel spliced together, but this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.It wasn't the greatest in the Flashman series that I've read, but it was great fun and I would recommend it, although I'd suggest starting with the original &quot;Flashman&quot; as reading the books in order has added to the value I've gained from them."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"... and altogether a lot of wasted opportunities for a really good novel. Flashman's encounter with Frederick Townsend Ward sets up the possibility of a truly dynamic historical interaction, but then Ward is sidelined, forgotten, and Flashman gets to spend the bulk of the book in sybaritic captivity again. The Caleb Carr book about FT Ward -- Devil Soldier -- is a much better read than this somewhat uninspired cliff-hanger.If you're looking at reviews of Flashman and the Dragon, it's almost certain that you already know what you want from George MacDonald Fraser, that piquant blend of odious sexism and nauseous racism with delightful irreverence toward historical figures. In this installment, however, one beautiful woman after another gets the better of Flash, uses him and tosses him away you might say, including the most famous woman in the history of China. The dalliances aren't especially lurid, alas; Flash mentions the various 'pleasures' known only to imperial concubines, but he doesn't depict them. The racism, of course, is as rank as ever, but addressed against the Chinese chiefly in terms of their cruelty and treachery. I found it rather tedious and inapplicable even to hostile stereotypes. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my Chinese friends except the singer Randy Wong, who can appreciate any dark humor if it's snarky enough. The historical figures of the Taiping era get tepid mistreatment from Flash; the most famous of them, Chinese Gordon, is no more than a walk-on.What's good, then, about F and the Dragon? Oddly, I'd say the best of the book is the description -- of the opulence of the Summer Palace, of the hollow might of the Imperial Army, of the squalor of backstreet Shanghai and Canton. I'd almost say that Fraser has evolved, in this book, into a travel writer."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Nothing out of the ordinary for Harry Flashman. Seducing a clergyman's wife is just a start to an adventure that includes such minor events as the Taiping Rebellion and the march on Pekin. As his fans all know, he'll emerge with quaking bowels and new honors."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"I don't know that much about Chinese history, so what better way is there to learn about it? A Flashman adventure is, of course, a textbook you'd never be handed in school, as Flashman philanders his way through both sides of the Taiping Rebellion, the world's bloodiest civil war.Flash Harry, waiting to sail back to England and his lusty Elspeth after a couple of years abroad, signs on for what he thinks will be a quick and easy voyage guiding an opium shipment up river, somewhat incongruously, for a missionary couple. Then he twigs to the ship's real cargo -- guns for the Taiping rebels, a diplomatic risk to British neutrality as they meanwhile pressure the Manchus over trade.Flashman escapes only to be ordered inland again to dope out Taiping plans for attacking Shanghai with its large foreign presence. Flashman's boat is attacked by pirates, but he is rescued by an Amazon bandit leader who, after screwing him silly, transports him to Nanking. There, he meets the nutcase Taiping leader and his saner advisors, whose court intrigues Flashman uses to Britain's advantage.Later Flashman is attached to the expeditionary force escorting British diplomats to Peking. Captured, freed, and captured again, he emerges in the innermost sanctums of the Manchu court -- as the concubine of the emperor's favorite concubine, for whom he has to perform while meanwhile wondering if he'll at the end be executed anyway in some hideous Chinese fashion.It's as good as any Flashman novel. It's all here: the history, the language, the attitude, the unashamed cowardice, the scheming to keep his reputation intact, the unforgettable bed partners and a fascinating view into the forgotten splendor of the Manchu Dynasty. More and more divorced from reality, its leaders couched in unimaginable luxury while millions lived in poverty around them, it still regarded itself as ruling the world until this joint Franco-British force proved otherwise."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"To say that this book makes history come alive will probably put off all potential readers, but really, I mean it in the best possible sense. As a novel, it's OK, although the plot's a mess. It's the historical bits that are fascinating - someone wrote that late 19th-century China attracted the largest ever group of eccentrics and scoundrels, and they are all here!Who is weirdest? - the cello-playing English general who later inspires an aria by Gilbert and Sullivan? the mercenary soldier from the American Deep South who defects to fight for the Chinese Taiping Christian rebels? the evil Empress Tzu Hsi, later known as Old Buddha? Even more fascinating (and moving) is the description of Lord Elgin (&quot;Son of Marbles&quot;)'s expedition to enforce the Sino-British treaties. The author has researched this thoroughly, and much of the detail comes from the narratives of H B Loch, one of Elgin's assistants. The descriptions of Chinese torture and the gruesome results may be found in Loch's &quot;Personal Narrative of Lord Elgin's Second Embassy to China&quot; - do whatever you can to find a copy of this, it's worth it!The great thing about this story is that the excellent historical notes allow you to make up your mind about the rights and wrongs of the whole affair. This book really ought to be included in Amazon.com's listing for &quot;Taiping Rebellion&quot; - it's certainly more engaging and readable than Jonathan Spence's tedious &quot;God's Chinese Son&quot;."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"FLASHMAN AND THE DRAGON is the third &quot;Flashman&quot; book I've read. Previously I had read ROYAL FLASH and FLASH FOR FREEDOM. Of those three, I liked FLASHMAN AND THE DRAGON the best. The historical setting during the Taiping Rebellion and the British/Mancho conflict is fascinating. Compared to the other two Flash Harry novels I'd read, this was heavier on the history, a &quot;HISTORICAL novel&quot; if you will, while the other two were more &quot;historical NOVELS&quot;... and FLASHMAN AND THE DRAGON it is better for it.If you have never read a Flashman novel, by all means read one. Better yet, I recommend listening to the unabridged audio versions read by David Case. I listen to 25+ books a year and David Case is one of the best. Since I am an American Yank, it helps to hear Case's perfect Brit accent flesh out the English colloquialisms... they read funny on the page, but sound even funnier on tape. If you've only read Flashman, check out an audio version at your local library... it will add a whole new dimension to the Flash Harry experience. Long Live Flashman!"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Make no mistake, Flashy's still the spineless poltroon he always was, but for me the most interesting feature of this book is the way in which he has evolved into a more calculating coward. His bowels still turn to water at the merest hint of danger, yet he has honed his fiendish cunning and learned to wear the mask of cool calculation. Thus, when threatened with death, dismemberment, or exposure, he can present a collected front while all the while his mind is feverishly plotting an escape.Let's just say he's learned tactics and no longer panics, soils himself and flees... He's learned to use his entirely undeserved heroic reputation to advantage instead of bolting from one horrendous situation to the next. Still lucky, he now modifies his chances through judicious posturing and careful shaving of the odds. A real treat to see him mature, if that is the correct word. Still a despicable cad, but one who has learned the art of survival with style, if not grace.Amusing to see that even cads, bounders and cheats are suceptible to character development. Well done to Mr. Fraser for allowing Flashy to grow a little - and not improve one whit!"},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Maybe. I don't care and you won't care.

As with other Flashman stories, there is much historical truth, liberally peppered with Fraser's witicisms and Flash's typcial bawdy and cowardly behaviour. The story line draged a bit about 2/3 of the way through (I thought the diversion from the march to Peiking was a bit overdone), but true to form, Flashman finishes strong. A very fun read."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"I could barely put this book down from the time I opened it. Hilarious, interesting and entralling.Not only did I get to learn about a part of history I previously had no knowledge of, but I got to laugh and laugh and laugh while doing it.This is my second Flashman book and I cannot wait to complete the series."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Another cracking good piece of historical fiction from Fraser: hilarious, well-researched, compelling. The rogue Flashman finds himself in China, 1860: running guns, meeting the Tien Wang during the Taiping rebellion, with Elgin on the road to Beijing and even brought as a prisoner before the emperor. An amazing book, as all the Flashman entries I've read have been. An erudite, bawdy adventure yarn, masterfully plotted. What's really impressive is how Fraser puts a human face on historical figures and events, giving concubines, princes and rebels distinct, believable personalities and motives. And he adds Flashman as an historical mover and shaker, to boot. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Tricked into making what he perceives as easy money on an opium run, Flashman finds himself in the thick of the Taiping Rebellion. Once again Fraser takes a major event in history and plants his anti-hero right in the midst of it. A fascinating account of the development of the rebellion and its eventual defeat is the core of this book and Fraser does a great job of explaining the events and the principles making this a particularly satisfying Flashman adventure. The cast of characters are true eccentrics in many cases and make for humorous and exciting reading. This is one of the stronger Flashman novels I have read and maintains a nice balance of history and adventure."},{"Title":"Flashman and the Dragon","review":"Necessary disclaimer: I am a huge fan of the Flashman series and George Macdonald Fraser (check out hisMcAuslan in the Rough). I've now read eight of the Flashman books (in chronological order 1-4, 7-8, 10 & 12). Nonetheless, I struggled to fully enjoy Flashman and the Dragon - in large part because of its questionable historical accuracy.Having narrowly escaped personal disaster whilst running 'opium' to Canton, Harry Flashman finds himself unhappily engaged in the British service on a couple of errands as an intelligence officer. First, Harry sails up to Nanking where he meets the leader of the Taiping Rebellion, a Chinese gentleman claiming to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ. Along the way he manages a vigorous romp or two with Triad bandit leader Szu-zhan.After another miraculous escape, Harry heads north with Lord Elgin and the closing chapter of the Second Opium War. Flashy again manages to get himself captured. This time he's imprisoned in the Forbidden City where the Lady Yehonala (better known as the Dragon Lady or Dowager Empress Ci Xi) makes a nocturnal visit - just to have a peek at the barbarian - with predictable results. Harry escapes one final time and arrives back in 'Pekin' in time to witness the final negotiations to end the war and then the release of Harry Parkes as well as the discovery of a number of murdered British prisoners. Elgin decides to burn down the imperial Summer Palace as payback.All well and good for a typical Flashman tale, but I found myself distracted by the grotesque way in which the book portrays the Chinese and the Manchu. This distraction came not not only from Flashman's 'papers, but also to the end notes. I expect Harry to express broadly, if cynical, pro-British Empire 19th century views, but expect a little more intellectual honesty from Fraser.The Chinese and Manchu are presented without exception - either singly or in combination - as devious, deceitful, sexual deviants, weak, opium-addled, and immune to normal human feelings of honor and shame. While the story does hit many of the historical highlights, the record is so grossly distorted that the reader will be forgiven for not recognizing that the Second Opium War was started by the British on a pretext in order to open yet more Chinese ports to more foreign trade, including the importation of opium, and otherwise extend its influence.The burning of the Summer Palace is presented as an act of British restraint. The reader would never guess that the propriety of this act was hotly disputed between Gladstone and Palmserton and derided by Victor Hugo (not to mention the Chinese and Manchu reaction). Lady Yehonala is falsely portrayed as a wanton sex- and opium-fiend. According to the end notes, Fraser based his story in part on the thoroughly discredited forger and con man Edmund Backhouse. See Hugh Trevor-Roper'sHermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse (History & Politics)and Sterling Seagrave'sDragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China(published after Flashman).Learning history from Harry Flashman should be undertaken with great care. Perhaps the better approach is to avoid taking the history too seriously and read them for the pro-imperial but humorous tales of the delightfully detestable Flashy. Flashman and the Dragon is best read as an entertaining period piece reflecting the prejudices of an earlier era."},{"Title":"SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT, BABY (INTRIGUE S.)","review":"The Montana Confidential miniseries continues with book two, \\"Special Assignment: Baby.\\" Agent Court Brody returns to his hometown to infiltrate a dangerous militia group. He doesn't expect to find an old love there. Sabrina is someone he loved and left behind. Now she's trying to keep her brother from falling under the militia's influence while guarding a precious secret from Court. Will he discover what it is?Debra Webb's writing is excellent as always, but it's not enough to save a fundamentally boring story. \\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" is as predictable as Intrigue gets. This is a story that hits all the expected notes and offers few, if any surprises. Primarily a romance with a little (very little) suspense, it is hard to tell how this book is romantic suspense and not a regular long contemporary. There is neither much danger or suspense for most of this book nor any mystery. It's hard to understand why books like Suzanne Brockmann's, which contain more action than this, are considered long contemporaries around RITA time while this is considered romantic suspense. Compared with the nonstop action of Ms. Webb's previous Intrigues, this was a bore.\\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" also suffers from a weak and stupid heroine. You would think that any intelligent person would question an FBI agent suddenly signing up with a militia group. Wouldn't she at least wonder if he's undercover? Of course Sabrina's too dim to think of that. Worse, the heroine is completely separated from the intrigue element. Unlike most Intrigues, which involves the heroine in the Intrigue at its premise, most of this book moves between Court dealing with the intrigue and Court romancing Sabrina. Sabrina never knows what's going on and for most of the book never seems to be in any danger. Most of her scenes are dull and drag badly.\\"Special Assignment: Baby\\" also has something in common with Webb's previous secret child Intrigue, \\"The Bodyguard's Baby.\\" This is a book where the story ends but the book does not. It continues past its natural ending. The plot has a good climax that signals the story should be coming to an end. It doesn't. Webb stretches it out with another two chapters with filler that does nothing to advance this story and, after a long while, sets up the next book. Finishing this book became a chore.Webb's voice is too strong and her writing too polished for this to be a bad book. Had this been an Intimate Moments or Superromance I may not have had as much of a problem with it. But \\"breathtaking romantic suspense\\" this was not. Romantic, yes. Breathtaking or suspenseful, no."},{"Title":"SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT, BABY (INTRIGUE S.)","review":"SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT: BABY is another great installment in Intrigue's latest continuity series, Montana Confidential.

The love scenes are hot, the bad guys fearsome opponents--but this undercover agent takes it all in stride with a lot of close calls and questionable outcomes that kept me turning the pages.I love connected stories, and Ms. Webb has peopled her story with other characters who are intriguing and three-dimensional, not just tossed in as background.

Although the character's are well drawn and interesting, not having the primary suspense element (Brody verus the militia) have a direct link with the romantic plot hamstrings the book and makes it unfold in a segmented fashion.

He was there to ask Verdi to set two libretti he'd written on Shakespearean subjects to music. The request was, indeed, a great shock to both Boito and Verdi. Boito had, for many years, insisted that Verdi's work, in light of Wagner's innovations, was no longer of any importance. Yet with these libretti, Boito recognized the truth. Simply put, Verdi, and only Verdi, could compose these operas, and if Verdi would do so, the results would be monumental. Boy, what an understatement. Otello drips with innovation. It takes Wagner's techniques and applies them to Italian opera in an Italian way. The chromaticism, the leitmotifs, the thick orchestration, they are all there, but with an Italian sensibility. It also testifies not only to Verdi's great love of Shakespeare, but his depth of understanding Shakespeare, as well. This score &quot;roars loud, and thunders in the index.&quot; Dover's edition is a reprint of an early Ricordi editon. Ricordi is the best source for Verdi, indeed all late romantic Italian opera, simply because Ricordi specialized in late Romantic Italian Opera, and understood the composers' wishes vis a vis their scores. For example, Giovanni Ricordi and Verdi, were good friends. The Dover edition is well crafted, easy to read, and printed on acid free paper, so it is resistant to fading. The score may be too big, and this book too small, to make it useful for the podium. Still, for the student and lover of opera, it is the non pareil."},{"Title":"Otello in Full Score (Dover Vocal Scores)","review":"Clearly written music. Well labled.

I deeply regret not heeding the comments of the online reviewers. Mainly because, I was raised on Chilton manuals and have never been disappointed until now. This manual is lacking in critical information for your most basic repairs. The layout is extremely confusing. Chilton has dropped many of it's covered mechanical repairs and I can find no information on chasiss electrical, or engine electrical. I have a ASS in Automotive Technology and a ASS in Electrical Technology. I am also ASEcertified. There is no way I can purchase another Chilton manual From Amazon.Com. I must now preview it at the bookstore first. If there is anyway I can replace this so called comprehensive manual with another I will and return this book.A reader from East Norwood WI , May 5, 1999 I WAS SHOCKED ! Got my new &quot; SHOP EDITION&quot; Chilton book. What a joke. No Fuel Injection Diagnostics, No ABS Diagnostics, No Emission or Driveability Diagnostics, No Leveling Control Diagnostics, No Cruise Control Diagnostics, No Cooling Fan Diagnostics, No Traction Control Diagnostics, No Steering Column Exploded Views, No Dash Guage Diagnostics, No Diagnostic Flow Charts, No Ignition Troubleshooting Charts. I guess a &quot;Shop&quot; doesn't need this information.A reader from dallas,Tx , April 15, 1999 Good reference tools, reasonably priced Gave me the info I needed and I didn't need to spend the $200 that Motor charges.A reader from Wallingford CT , April 4, 1999 NOT FOR ANY TECHNICIAN I KNOW! How could they claim this book was wriiten with the technician in mind? I had used CHILTON PROFESSIONAL books for years. This poor excuse for a Chilton book has no information for a Pro or a &quot;Backyard Mechanic&quot;. Other than some specifications and some generic procedures, there is nothing in this book of any value that you couldn't figure out on your own. Professional Technicians beware.A reader from Rocky Mount NC , March 29, 1999 Wish I had heeded the reviews You guys are right. Chilton used to be synonomous with quality. What a useless product. Cars have become so complicated how could I have beleived Chilton could have covered so much information in so few pages. Well they didn't and couldn't so I would like a refund.A reader from Clinton IA , March 24, 1999 Why is AMAZON marketing this book? In all the years as a weekend mechanic I have never seen a book with more sketchy information. They would have been better off focusing on one model than trying to cram every vehicle from 1995-1999 in one 1400 page book.

I have read it several times since then; specifically, whenever my memory starts to fail me, and I start to think about how good I had it in the Army.Like the Army itself, Yancey's War is short on actuall combat scenes and long on abject misery. Although the story takes place during the Second World War, it was just as relivant in 1971 as it was in 1945. And I suspect that a GI reading it today would relate to most, if not all, of the events in the book. No book that I have ever read captures the essense of just how bad it bites to be an enlisted man in the US Army, the way Hoffman did with this book.

Taciturn Swedish sailor,fervent Wobbly, possible murderer, victim of conspiracy and, ultimately,willing martyr - all these aspects of the legendary Trade Unionist areexplored in an effort to get to grips with the &quot;real&quot; Joe Hill.Stegner has tried to penetrate the conventional IWW mythology around Hill, refusingto accept the simplistic interpretation of an innocent man fitted up by the law.Instead, the Joe Hill he writes of is human, multidimensional - possiblyguilty but a flawed hero nonetheless. Stegner explores the creation of a martyr andthe creation of amyth. Reading the story of Hill adds a poignancy and human dimension to theformulaic elegies of folksong and syndicalist tradition."},{"Title":"Joe Hill, a biographical novel","review":"Of course it's not factual history! All these reviewer smashing the book because they didn't get history out of it need to look more closely. The front cover states that the book is \\"a biographical novel.\\" And if you read the back cover, it says that the author is \\"blending fact with fiction\\" to tell a good story. In other words, it's not history, it's a fictional story based on a true story. So it never claims to be a history. It's not the author's fault the readers are oblivious to the clear subtitle of the book indicating it's a \\"novel.\\" As a novel and a story, it's pretty darn good."},{"Title":"Joe Hill, a biographical novel","review":"THIS IS, CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE REVIEWS (ONE WONDERS IF THEY ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK) A SUPERB HISTORICAL NOVEL AND QUITE CLOSE TO THE REALITY OF WHO JOE HILL WAS. AT BEST HE WAS A TERRIBLY CONFUSED MALCONTENT, AT WORST A PREDITORY PSYCHOPATH USING THE LABOR MOVEMENT THE WAY CRIMINALS OFTEN USED THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND OTHER GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS FOR THEIR OWN DESIRES. THE AUTHOR ACTUALLY IS MUCH EASIER ON HILL THAN GIBBS IN HIS BOOK AND ONE IS NEVER QUITE SURE IF JOE WAS GUILTY (HE WAS, WITHOUT A DOUBT). THE BOOK IS WELL WORTH READING."},{"Title":"Joe Hill, a biographical novel","review":"If you want to know about Joe Hill, this is not the book for you. Readers curious about Stegner's career might be interested in this early effort, but after this first impression, I have little curiosity about the author's later efforts, despite his reputation as a master teacher. Writing about a legend is difficult because the temptation to reduce the Myth to human terms is great. In the process of putting feet of clay on the immortal Joe Hill, Stegner creates a hoodlum-poet, an angry, alienated legal alien with a father complex, a stiff upper lip, and a penchant for violence. The occasional descriptions of his songwriting seem facile and psychological. One senses the author's precious regard for his own words and images struggling with his need to be macho and tough-minded. I couldn't help but feel that Joe Hill was being cut down to make room for Wallace Stegner, the real artist. As for the revolutionary, the Wobbly, the visionary, the author makes that persona seem like so much hype and rhetoric. There's a nice description of a labor camp full of suffering and the potential for organization, but most of the labor scenes are sprinkled with so much violence that one gets little sense of the idealistic nature of the enterprise. Anyone interested in the truth needs to see both sides of human behavior, but Stegner's penchant for the small, trivial, and mean outweighs any vision of the lasting and good, despite his creation of a doubting minister. We have a few opportunities to see Joe at his best in this novel, but those moments are consistently undercut by awareness that his words will be memorialized by self-aggrandizing union leaders and deluded idealists. After over one hundred pages about his trial and death, the reader is sick of Stegner's malaise and bad spirits. If you want to know Joe Hill, sing his songs."},{"Title":"Joe Hill, a biographical novel","review":"Stenger believes Hill is guilty from the start and tries to make him out to be a common criminal. While Joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. Little is known of Hill's buddy Otto Applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. Not the ... son of a Swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. An immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the American dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. Not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. If you want a balanced book about him get Joe Hill by Gibbs Smith. \\"Don't Mourn - Organize!\\" - Joe Hill 1917"},{"Title":"History of the Reformation: A Conciliatory Assessment of Opposite Views (Mentor-Omega Books, MQ 712)","review":"Dolan's work is worth tracking down. His approach is very good. It is one that is truly concerned with the history of the reform movement, which is not confined to the Protestant Reformation. Dolan begins his presentation of the Protestant Reformation with the understanding of reform in the Early Church Fathers, which was something much more personal or individual. As the Church grew and became more involved in society, reform became more ecclesial and social. At this point we see the so-called Spiritual Reformers, which consisted of the Orders, e.g., Cistercians, who sought out moral reform in a Church that at that time was anything but moral. They believed that moral reform was more fundamental than institutional reform. The former would bring about the latter in their eyes.The next wave of reform came with the Conciliarists of the 14th and 15th centuries, who sought to enact a \\"papal reformation.\\" They saw the Papacy as having gained too much power over the centuries -- and not always by legtimate means! -- and wanted to get back to the Early Church's conciliar framework, one wherein a more conciliar enjoyment of the Church's power existed yet without removing the Papacy altogether. In this section dealing with the Conciliarists, Dolan gives abundant primary source citations from the writings of the Conciliarists. This is of huge benefit because the writings of the Conciliarists are not all in English, not even many of them.The next wave of reform came in the 16th century with the Protstant Reformers who, while standing a long line of tradition of reformers who did not want to get rid of the Papacy, felt forced to jettison the Papacy because of its vehement resistance to yet another wave of reform.For the juicy details of the these various reform movements, you must read the book. You'll read about Beranrd of Clairvaux telling the Pope that he is the successor of Peter, not Constantine. You'll read about the Conciliarists reaching their goal making Ecumenical Councils the ultimate authority, but then giving way to a renewed and more powerful Papacy. You'll read about Luther appealing to an Ecumenical Council to hear his case, even being accused by Cajetan of being a \\"Gersonist\\" (Jean Gerson was a Conciliarists!). This is a very exiciting story about a long tradition of reform movements and a long tradition of an ever-growing Papacy."},{"Title":"Cool Restaurants San Francisco (Cool Restaurants Guides)","review":"COOL RESTAURANTS SAN FRANCISCO surveys the interiors of San Francisco's best restaurants, focusing on design options and providing well over a hundred color photos - and recipes - from some of the city's most notable establishments.

Indeed, author Leon Wolff's brother Perry had produced the television series. This is the 1991 \\"Wings of War\\" reprint.The first book on the raid, it told only some of the tale. There are only a few of the stories of horror and heroism over the target. \\"Low Level Mission\\" did not have inputs from the German and Romanian defenders. The flak train and the stories of the American POWs in Romanian captivity are not included. It lacks detailed maps of the attack as planned, and as executed.Still the book has its virtues, and it needs to be read by anyone studying the attack. The prose is wonderfully vigorous. The introduction by Colonel John R. \\"Killer\\" Kane addresses some of the controversies, and it is a moving tribute to those who flew the mission. The maintenance preps for the mission are very well told. Wolff's evaluation of the mission's effect is even-handed and hard-headed. There are chapters on the subsequent 1944 high altitute attacks on the same target.The long early chapters on the growth and development of air power are not an uncritical paean to the founding generation of the Air Force, and they have a lot to say about shortsighted American politics, civilian and military, between the world wars. With the final chapters evaluating the mission, Wolff gave us a spirited essay in air power historiography.And -- looking at the arts of printing and binding -- this is a very handsome book to hold in one's hand, and to have on one's shelf.-30-"},{"Title":"Show Jumping for Fun or Glory: A Training Manual for Successful Show Jumping at All Levels","review":"This is a great book for anyone who (like me) would love to ride in grand prix's some day.

His passion for the story he tells is easy to see on every page of this big book. It moves along and keeps the reader turning pages to see what happens next. That really is not all that easy to pull off in writing history.\\"Every Man a Speculator\\" is subtitled \\"A History of Wall Street in American Life\\". Some subtitles are throwaways. However, this subtitle actually tells you more about the focus of the book than the main title. This is more about the history of public perception of Wall Street. Mr. Fraser is especially strong in telling us about novels, plays, magazine series, and eventually about movies and other popular notions about Wall Street.The book does not provide any analysis of how Wall Street works and seems to casually dismiss academic models as simply intellectual opinions rather than providing analysis of their merits or deficiencies. The book focuses on so many scandals over the centuries and the characters that caused them that the reader would be hard pressed to understand that anything other than bad actors and suckers ever bought or sold anything in the financial markets. This is, of course, not true. But since the focus of the book is more about the perception of Wall Street in American life, well, maybe there is more merit in the approach taken here.However, I think the modern reader could benefit from a deeper and more considered approach. This book can certainly stand as a needed corrective for all the rah-rah boosterism that Wall Street has received for the past couple of decades. However, six hundred pages of one perp-walk after another can distort reality as well, no matter how much fun scandal and malfeasance-meeting-comeuppance can be.The book also suffers from the occasional lapse in accuracy as well. For example, on page 309 he recounts the old canard about James Hazen Hyde charging his sumptuous \\"French Ball\\" to the Equitable and letting the shareholders pay for it. Yet, just last year Pamela Beard's \\"After the Ball\\" (also a HarperCollins book) demonstrated clearly that this charge is false and made up by the men who were trying to wrest control of the Equitable from Hyde. The author also seems awfully focused on J P Morgan, who was supremely influential, but I am not sure he deserves the opprobrium showered on him here. Nor does J D Rockefeller deserve as little attention as he received here.Anyway, this was a fun read and offered some colorful anecdotes as well as some insights into the literary influence of Wall Street that I did not know anything about.If your politics lean to the left a bit you will almost certainly enjoy this book even more. It seems to me that if the adults I knew when I was a child were to read this book, given their devotion to the New Deal and their suspicion of all bankers and investments, that they would have agreed with everything bound between the covers of this book.Four stars because in my rating system I think it would be enjoyed more by those already interested in this topic than a broad general readership."},{"Title":"Every Man a Speculator : A History of Wall Street in American Life","review":"In July, 1849, the arrest of a local confidence man attracted national media attention.It seems the con artist, one William Thompson, genteelly dressed would approach his marks discreetly flashing a handful of cash. He would confide to the mark that he intended to invest the bundle in a sure fire business deal. He offered to invest the mark's cash in the same deal if he would demonstrate confidence in the deal by pleading his money and gold watch. Thompson promised to return the next day with the watch and even more cash.Of course, he never did.Throughout history, Americans have held ambivalent views of Wall Street. One moment they see it as one huge casino. The next, they see it as a cloister of scholarly seers who possess a mystical secret for instant success.Steve Fraser has written a Wall Street history that explores that dilemma's impact on the American psyche. Americans remain preoccupied with the sins and virtues of the financial markets. On one hand they remain committed to their ancestral values of hard work, play, equality, well-being and national purpose. Yet, they are still magnetically drawn to promises of instant wealth and success.This well-written, thoroughly researched history explores this chronic tension. Through the colorful tales of confidence men and aristocrats, he offers the reader unique insights into our collective view of American Capitalism and its changing culture."},{"Title":"Every Man a Speculator : A History of Wall Street in American Life","review":"A person can spend a lifetime attempting to understand the world of finance. Or he can read this book. It puts into perspective all the sludge oozing out of CNBC, Greenspan, Snow and Company, Kudlow and Cramer and, of course, the Mary Meekers who have begun to surface again after, I suppose, a four year vacation on a private island. For those of boundless faith and small capital, it provides a healthy dose of sanity. If you are victimized by excessive wealth and thus forced to protect it by what is called investment but amounts to speculation, read this one along with The Death of Money, by Kurtzman.In the world of limitless electronic money, the price of any asset is determined solely by crowd psychology. Every time it changes those numbers on the screen go up and down, and for people buying at the asked and selling at the bid it is a tough game.For those worried about the country as a whole, Fraser explains in language anyone can understand how enterprise has become a bubble on a tide of speculation, returning us to a condition not experienced in America since the Twenties. The same tired arguments for Wall Street hegemony which history exploded in the Thirties have been resurrected by the financial elite and their acolytes in the media and economics profession. Will history repeat itself? Recent crashes have been reversible by massive injections of fiat money. In the absence of political will it is hard to imagine alternative solutions."},{"Title":"Every Man a Speculator : A History of Wall Street in American Life","review":"The author has done an excellent job showing the inevitable negative impacts that result from speculative behavior.He also shows that a fundamental error made by economists is to confuse enterprise and entrepreneurship with speculation.The idea that speculative behavior is entrepreneurial in nature is the basic error that lies at the heart of both the libertarian-Austrian school of economics(Ayn Rand,Murray Rothbard,Ludwig von Mises,etc.) and the University of Chicago economics approach(Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas,George Stigler,Gary Becker,etc.).This fallacious belief is then propounded by pseudo conservative Libertarian organizations ,like the Olin,Heritage, and Mellon Foundations ,and the American Enterprise Institute,to be an example of free enterprise.The foundation for these misbeliefs is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis(EMH).This hypothesis only holds when applied to consumption goods markets.There is not a shred of evidence,historical or statistical, that the EMH applies to investment markets or financial markets over time.The EMH is based on the empirically refuted claim that all of the time series data for price changes in financial markets can be modeled as being normally distributed.Benoit Mandelbrot demonstrated in the late 1950's that the financial market time series data is not even close to being approximately normally distributed.There has not been a single goodness of fit test provided by EMH adherents (Milton Friedman,Robert Lucas,Arthur Laffer,Eugene Fama)over the last 120 years that demonstrates normality.Empirical work overwhelmingly shows that the time series data is best modeled by the Cauchy Distribution.Friedman's Ptolomaic-like belief in the EMH explains his claims that all bubbles are rational(i.e.,there is no such thing as a speculative bubble)and the following assertion, quoted on p.540 by the author: \\"Speculation has come of age;it can sit quite comfortably side by side with investment;and it is as legitimate and necessary as the securities markets themselves \\". This is an excellent demonstration of the confusion one finds in the economics profession concerning investment in long run,long lived,durable physical capitalformation, aimed at producing goods/services for a possible future economic profit and short run ,banker financed, debt leveraged financial speculation aimed at extracting an economic profit without the production of any good or service.I have deducted 1/2 of a star from this book because the author ,unfortunately,has no discussion of the EMH in the book.The author does demonstrate that J M Keynes had correctly showed that the basic problem accounting for major downturns in economic behavior was speculation(pp.457-458).Keynes proved this on pp.304-306 of chapter 21 of his General Theory(1936).However,he overlooks the far,far more extensive demonstration made by Adam Smith, in his The Wealth of Nations(1776),that banker financed speculation will always lead to the waste and destruction of the savings of the depositors(See pp.260-340,Modern Library(Cannan)edition,Max Lerner Introduction).Smith demonstrated that the primary responsibility of a central bank is to control the private commercial banking system so as to prevent them from lending to speculators or engaging in speculative behavior themselves. The author shows that President Andrew Jackson never absorbed this lesson.Unfortunately,Jackson,while a major opponent of speculative behavior himself,failed to put aside his personal grudge/disagreement with Nicholas Biddle,the patrician head of the Second Bank of the United States,who was trying to stop the massive speculative behavior of the state \\"Wild catter\\" banks,and prevented the banks charter from being renewed in 1836.This lead to one episode after another of banker financed speculative behavior that was supposed to be controlled with the formation of the Federal Reserve System(FRS) in 1913.Unfortunately,the private commercial banks have dominated the FRS,except in the time period of 1938-1952.The author provides overwhelming historical evidence that every single speculative wave of financing in every country in history over the last 400 years ends up leading to a panic,crash,and economic collapse that leads to a recession or depression.He overlooks one individual who should have been included in his discussions of famous speculators who caused economy wide collapse-Andrew Dexter,Jr.,who, working out of Boston in the 1806-1808 time period,single handily created a depression all along the Eastern Seaboard during 1809-10.Dexter is important because he realized the best way to finance speculative behavior was through the control of banks .Overall,this is an excellent history of what has happened in the past,not only in the USA but worldwide, over the last 400 years, when speculators,masquerading under the false claim that they are engaging in free enterprise in free markets,are able to engage in leveraging their debt positions a 100 fold and sell many different types of very dubious 'financial services' to an unwary public that ,unfortunately,periodically \\"buys in\\" to the speculator serenade that this time ,it will be different and the bubble will go on expanding indefinitely into the future.Americans are now going to have to pay a horrible price for allowing the banker speculators and private equity firms to put their schemes across over the last 30 years."},{"Title":"Every Man a Speculator : A History of Wall Street in American Life","review":"Mr. Fraser has written a detailed and intimately researched tomb covering the history of Wall Street back to its earliest beginnings. This book is similar in theme toManias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Wiley Investment Classics),Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation, andExtraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.Here is what distinguishes Mr. Fraser's book:- The focus on solely the American Experience, as opposed to including European.- The period of history covered is much greater than the others. Mr. Fraser begins with a great tale of Alexander Hamiton and Thomas Jefferson. I found this especially valuable and unique.- A broad focus. The author focuses not only on the financial, but on how Wall Street influenced the arts, popular culture, politics, et al.I recommend this book if you want a broad, in-depth history of Wall Street. It is the best I have found in covering the pre-1900 period of American finance.Because the book is a history, it compresses hundreds of years as you read it in a few hours. This allows one to see the boom/bust cycles of Wall Street with clinical detachment.

It is a regurgitation of stories told about Wall Street figures, stories told by other people much better. It assumes you already know what Wall Street consists of and the difference between what Wall Street actually is and what people assume is Wall Street. I won't go into what I had hoped this book would be and failed utterly at because that would be unfair.

Without doubt, the new standard work on these aspects which reveals how the term &quot;collaboratioon&quot; did not necessarily mean full identification with the Reich's cause. The author's purpose does not include detailed treatment of the Resistance, nor will you find much discussion of the Liberation and its consequences for the collaborators. However, the account of Petain, Laval, Darnard and the rest is riveting if you want to understand all the twists and turns which accompanied the Vichy administration in its four tramatic years."},{"Title":"France Under the Germans: Collaboration and Compromise","review":"One of the most bizarre and unexpected ironies of modern history was the capitulation, collaboration, and compromises made by the French to the Nazi forces that so quickly overwhelmed them with the blitzkrieg assault against Western Europe in the summer of 1940. In this thoughtful, scholarly, and compelling book, noted historian Phillipe Burrin examines the issues surrounding this otherwise puzzling twist of national fate that so contrasted with the patriotic fervor and courage the French had displayed during the exhausting confrontations of the First World War. The issues are indeed troubling to historians, ranging from the quick and nearly bloodless capitulation to the shocking enthusiastic collaboration in the systematic arrest, torture, and elimination of so-called \\"enemies of the state\\" to the compromise of so many of their values, cultural traditions, and social customs. How and why did this happen?The outlines of that troubled time is fairly easy to determine; from 1940 to 1944 the French adapted in a variety of ways to extraordinary existential situation presented by the fact of total military domination by the Wehrmacht. This work is a definitive study of that period in France, and of the choice made by French citizens in face of the circumstance of Nazi occupation, and the stunning degree to which they indeed collaborated. Of course, not all the French capitulated or cooperated. Some joined a very active and energetic underground resistance movement, one that was effective and energetic right up to D-Day. Others fled as best they could, trying to avoid the hell on earth they feared France would become when dominated by the Nazis. Yet others did cooperate, collaborate, and participate in the unspeakable violence the Nazis visited on the non-Aryan members of French society.While this book lacks the kind of thoughtful retrospective look at the forces within France leading up to the war and placing the Vichy regime in historical perspective described so brilliantly by William Shirer in \\"The Collapse of the Third Republic\\", it is a terrific examination of life inside the Nazi regime after the fall. The author employs a number of previously unused sources such as French business archives, those of the Vichy police, and records of telephone conversations to document the degree of French collaboration. His findings are stunning and shocking. Burrin reveals, for example, that French heavy industries became key partners contributing significantly to the production of Nazi war materials, devoting ever-increasing percentages of its total output to war support until it became virtually an exclusively war-oriented activity by the end of the war.Burrin also reveals, in a scholarly yet absorbing narrative, just how complete the eventual degree of betrayal to self, country, and any meaningful notion of right or wrong became under the occupation. This is a compelling analysis examining the ways in which ordinary people respond to the extraordinary pressures of such a horrific set of circumstances, and how they then surrendered to the seductively self-serving (and easier) answers of collaboration and denial of personal responsibility rather than withstand the very real dangers of active or passive resistance. This is a fascinating book, a tome destined to become the standard reference for all future study of the French collaboration with the Germans during WWII, and one I highly recommend. Enjoy."},{"Title":"France Under the Germans: Collaboration and Compromise","review":"Having a fascination with 20th Century European history in general and World War II in particular, I was looking forward to learning about the French experience under Occupation. This book, however, is a tedious and ponderous journey through the author's own meandering thoughts. I read 125 pages and cannot recall any clear facts; everything the author writes is airy and speculative. Granted he writes well and has a masterful understanding of French politics, people and culture during this period. But for anyone looking to understand the colorful forces and figures which contributed to both French Occupation and subsequent Resistance, this is not the book for you. This book might be better suited for a Doctoral student or a French historian...but not for the average student of History."},{"Title":"France Under the Germans: Collaboration and Compromise","review":"The amazing theme of this book is that it really gets to the basic psyche of the French. The old adage of \\"The only thing necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing\\" is the ultimate lesson of this book. There are numerous examples of how the French really aided and abetted the Nazis, with a political landscape of real chaos and a kind of moral relativism which has only gotten worse since WWII. While there were a few courageous members of the resistance who were very active at the beginning of the war, the movement really did not take off until it was obvious that the Nazis were going to lose. But the Vichy army killed thousands of Allied troops who were fighting the Nazis in the French colonies, and they were not forced to do so under the gun. The silly references by the French to their support of the US revolution ignores other more important and recent attacks on the US by their installation of Maximillian in Mexico, their duplicity during the Cold War, their bribery by Saddam, and many other stabs in the back. Their opportunistic support two hundred years ago is really irrelevant to today's world.For anyone suffering the delusions that the French are a friend of the US, this book will go a long way to setting the record straight."},{"Title":"The Big Five-Oh! : Facing, Fearing, And Fighting Fifty","review":"I was beginning to wonder if all the ailments, annoyances, shortcomings and memory lapses were only happening to me.

My kids loved it. We are now looking for other books by Molly Burkett."},{"Title":"Foxes Three (Piccolo Books)","review":"Foxes Three. What can I say? IT'S THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD. Here's how the story goes. A family called the Burketts runs this really cool animal rehabilitation center. One day this farmer gives them three baby foxes to raise. Two were vixens, one was a male. The male was called Tom. He never would have made a pet. He did not tolerate beig handled. The largest vixen was called Fred. She tolerated being handled but she did not enjoy it. The smallest of the three foxes was called Jenny. She absolutely LOVED being pet and handled and she never would have gone to the wild instead of living with the Burketts. The Burketts let the other two foxes go, and they tried to let her go, but of course she didn't want to go. Anyway, she became one of the family, and she loved John even more than the dogs did. She just loved the Burketts so much. But nothing is forever. What I mean by that is . . . Jenny wasn't forever. One day Jenny, Puppy, and Susie (the two dogs) were in the garage now. Before Jenny, Puppy and John had shared the bond that was now between Jenny and John. At first, it was clear that Puppy didn't like Jenny, but she didn't wish her any harm either. Let's just say, things changed, Puppy did something to Jenny in that garage that changed Jenny forever. She no longer liked John. She went back to the wild."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is the intelligent man or woman's bible. It shows just how morals came to be. How they have dictated our lives ever since they have been created. How they have changed our society, and especially how they have silenced the common man. Nietzsche is, for lack of a better word, brillant. His writing never ever loses its passion. He believes in what he writes and he supports it even more, with not just what Christians call \\"athiest dogma\\" but with theory and evne fact.He outlines how \\"Good and Evil\\" really came to be. How what we define as good is only what the people in power (the rich and people of religion) tell us is good. They only share with us the good that keeps us in line, not what sets us free. This is what Nietzsche outlines so very well. This book is brillant, one of a kind, and possibly one of his most important novels.No matter your race, religion, or creed, I hope you check this book out. It is worth your time, trust me. What he talks about affects us all and should be shared in the public. It really is a shame that even today, long after his death, his words still have not had the affect they should have had."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This particular piece of Nietzsche's writing is a marvelous work - it is interesting and lively, much as Nietzsche's own writing and tendency toward the dramatic was noted by his contemporaries.Nietzsche's father was a Lutheran minister, but he died five years after Nietzsche's birth in 1844. Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of the text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.In another edition, Walter Kaufmann states that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.'The Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse. This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays. The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods. The third essay concludes the work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.In his book Ecce Homo (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life. Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold. His own idea of 'The Genealogy of Morals' can be found in this piece as follows:'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far. Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche. However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good volume."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"... for a very cheap price! If you are looking for a fancy edition with notes, comments, and whatnot then this is not for you. But if you just want to read Nietzche's book as it is, then with 3 dollars or so, there you have it!"},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Nietzsche is one of the most interesting philosophers of the 19th century, with The Genealogy of Morals being one of his most interesting works. Viewed as history, Nietzsche's eloquent defense of the aristocrat-barbarian and withering dismissal of priestly values clearly highlights a major shift in society--one which Nietzsche was apparently very troubled by. It's a compelling read, if at times infuriating to modern sensibilities.However, as a treatise on morality, Nietzsche's &#34;insights&#34; have not aged well. Eschewing the careful analytic style of most philosophers in favor of impassioned rhetoric is a hallmark of Nietzsche, but this has left his arguments riddled with holes; assumptions are not clearly spelled out, so it is at times difficult to understand how he could expect anyone to believe his claims. In particular, The Genealogy of Morals is so strongly influenced by Nietzsche's view of contemporary (to him) society that it no longer offers much insight into human morality. If one is curious about the fundamental underpinnings of human morality, one is vastly better off reading a modern work with a more experimental bent (if less solidly directed at understanding human morality)--The Tangled Wing by Melvin Konner or The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, for instance. Alternatively, analytic philosophical treatments of morality by Kant, Hume, and others, at least pose timeless questions."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is an excellent philosophical and philological tract that explores several fundemental characteristics of society and morality. I recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"What Socrates tried to build troughout his whole life, Nietzsche almost destroyed in couple of books. Said like this, it seems simplistic enough, but it is far from that. To understand Nietzsche, one has to reach much deeper than Nietzsche's words suggest. One has to know Schoppenhauer, has to now french philosophers, contractualist, and most of all one has to know greek philosophy. And greek culture. The place where it all began. At least for the westerners. Nietzsche was also great admirer and critic of Indian, Vedanta tradition, so to understand Nietzsche one will eventualy have to travel even to those horisons, which are in itself something completely different.Why am I saying all of this?Because it is often proven that it is too easy to misread Nietzsche, calling him an emerging point from which Nacism rose, and putting him, with Plato in a place where inventors of fascist state sleep their eternal sleep.One has to be careful when reading Nietzsche. It is too easy to insert meaning which are not present in the text. And in that manner, it is easy to create philosophy totaly alien from its author.If one wants to travel deep inside the Nietzsches core, one should start his journey with this book. It seems to be the most grateful for begginners. Not to mention that it is excellent for trying different approach to history of morals, approach that is in a way revolutionary if we were not customed to it nowadays. But in time of Nietzsches life, this sounded outrageous.It may stand as constant reminder, if some of you forgot that, how radical criticism is not looked upon with kindness.These are just few words which doesen't explain a thing in fact, but if you are at least interested in history (or geneaology) of morals, and conceptual problems which rise from it, you should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Nietzsche, like no other philosopher that I have read, has changed the way that I see the world. This is a book to read if you want to learn something about yourself. Nietzsche may have gone insane and had delusions that he was God, but he revolutionised modern thought. There is a special place in hell for German philosophers, but it's a place that's worth visiting."},{"Title":"The genealogy of morals, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is a REAL HIGHLIGHT out of the last \\"creative period\\" of Nietzsche, dating from about one and a half year before he fell in that cruel mental illness (NOT syphillis, as is told in the streets...), that lead him to his death: HE WROTE THIS BOOK IN ONE BREATHE, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, IN 3 WEEKS: FROM JULY 10th UNTIL JULY 30th OF 1887 !!! In his \\"Genealogy\\" we find back some basic concepts, principles of ethics as there are \\"GOOD AND EVIL\\", \\"GUILT AND CONSCIENCE\\" and \\"THE ASCETIC IDEAL\\". These subjects stay central anywhere in the book. But the author DOES NOT AT ALL \\"TREAT\\" these notions conform to their normal usage in the philosophy of morality. He is NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY (the morals) MEAN, or in THEIR VALUE in whatever kind of morality, NOR in their NORMATIVE VALUE OR MERIT. Instead he is in search of their \\"BIRTH\\", their \\"ORIGIN\\" and in how they \\"FUNCTION\\" in an organised society.Again, it is NOT IMPORTANT to Nietzsche what is the VALUE of this or that action. WHAT IS REALLY OF IMPORTANCE HERE IS THE VALUE/MERIT OF THIS OR THAT VALUE ITSELF. As he wrote (and said so many times): \\"WE NEED A CRITICISM OF MORAL VALUES: FIRST OF ALL, THE VALUE OF THESE VALUES MUST BE QUESTIONED.\\" As to him there doesn't exist anything like a linear, progressive development of morality: the latter is the RESULT of the eternal combat between \\"masters and slaves\\", between \\"those who govern and those that are being reigned over\\". Each of these \\"GROUPS\\" tries - ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE - to acquire as much power as possible versus the other.MORALITY (\\"MORALS\\") IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT - IF NOT BY EXCELLENCE - IN THIS FIGHT, THIS COMBAT, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF THE DRIFT, THE PASSION OF EACH MAN OR GROUP: THE WILL FOR POWER.This MASTERPIECE from the giant German philosopher DOES NOT READ like a novel. BUT THE BOOK IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE THOUGHTS, THIS HIGHEST-LEVEL THINKING of this genius concerning morals which he describes, even DISSECTS here. \\"Not an easy read\\" DOES NOT MEAN that it can't and/or shouldn't be read! ON THE CONTRARY: THANKS TO THE ENORMOUS LITERARY TALENT OF NIETZSCHE, THE THEMES AND THOUGHTS THAT TOUCH, AFFECT ALL OF US EVERY DAY, THIS WORK \\"NEEDS\\" OUR ATTENTION (and vice versa).TO EVERY READER WHO KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF INTROSPECTION, AND WHO WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF \\"OUR MORALS\\", I RECOMMEND THIS \\"GENEALOGY\\" (OH YES, HE CHOSE THE RIGHT WORDS...) OUT OF MY HEART AND REASON. NONE OF YOU WILL EVER REGRET HAVING READ THIS SO \\"MATURE\\" MASTERPIECE, WHICH TOUCHES ALL OF OUR BEINGS AND SOULS."},{"Title":"The court-martial of George Armstrong Custer","review":"This historical novel asks: what if Custer had survived the Battle of Little Big Horn? It uses historical characters in a late 19th century setting to tell its story and educate you about details of times long forgotten. People were much as they are today, but different. You may be entertained as much as by other novels from that long-ago time. The author must have studied many books and newspapers of that time to gather the details needed to create this story. The book explains the politics involved. Custer had testified during the impeachment hearings of Secretary of War Belknap early in 1876. Custer was favored by the Democrats, while Grant was the Republican President. Sherman's brother was an important Republican Senator (Sherman Anti-Trust Act). [Does this remind you of recent events?] Custer would be tried for what he did before he split his command; they had witnesses (p.74). Jones must have searched many old records to recreate the setting for this court-martial on Governor's Island.The crux of the charges are on page 90: Custer did not determine the size and strength of the enemy that morning. [Other books say the Indian warriors would defend against an attack while the women and children escaped, and then would join them. Waiting would let them all escape, so Custer attacked at dawn.] &quot;But all the Sioux had fled&quot; (p.152). While Custer was criticized for engaging the enemy on the 25th, a day earlier than planned, Colonel Gibbon's forces did not arrive until the 27th, a day later (p.156)! Page 175 tells how politicians were paid to appoint a post trader. (Does this still occur today?) Page 185 tells of newspaper rivalry over the trial. Page 191 says the Massacre at Little Big Horn caused Congress to loosen the purse strings. Page 213 tells of the training problems: unfit pack mules, sparse mounts untrained to gunfire, not enough ammunition to train recruits. Custer's forces were to rest that day, and attack the next day. Their discovery by Sioux scouts changed that plan (p.219). The troops would form battalions in line to locate the enemy. The scouts were as far ahead as possible (p.221). Prior to June 17 the Plains Indians did not attempt a pitched battle; it was strike and run (p.223). Nelson Miles would have done the same as Custer (p.225). Custer's talents are summarized in a left-handed way (p.253). Page 262 has Custer's lawyer guessing about the voting.You should be knowledgeable about the events to appreciate this novel. This book lacks a bibliography of sources that could provide an education. While fictional, it explains the events of June 25, 1876 to the general reader. Most of all, it absolves Custer by pointing out that if he did not attack until June 26 (the original plan), then the same result could have occurred since the other troops didn't arrive until June 27, a day late!This book implicitly raises the question: was Custer set up? Did they withhold information on the number of Indians who left the reservation? Custer testified against the corruption of the Grant Administration; did Sherman plan this payback by first putting Custer back in command, then ordering him on a mission known to be extremely risky?"},{"Title":"The court-martial of George Armstrong Custer","review":"Brian Keith and Ken Howard as the defense council and prosecutor are fantastic in this alternative history. William Daniels as always is fantastic as Maj. Reno. It is logically presented answering the question what would have happened if Custer had survived. Blyth Danner as Libby Custer is both extremely attractive and powerfully presented. It is beyond me why this little gem of a film has been hidden for so long."},{"Title":"The court-martial of George Armstrong Custer","review":"Perhaps it's a case of, \\"It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing\\", but I can't say that I liked this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as \\"having more intrigues than the Arabian navy\\", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead."},{"Title":"The art alphabet","review":"I have used the principles in this book without having read the book .

I understand and appreciate that doing a complete monograph of a particular artist with a large output can be daunting. There is no excuse, however, for the poorly photographed images that were used for some of the paintings. I have been an amateur photographer for over 20 years and I can say with great confidence that a cheap \\"point-and-shoot\\" camera had to have been used on at least a few of the paintings. Poor color quality, washed out areas caused by the flash, bad lighting, extremely grainy images. This is basic photography 101. Some of these problems could have been taken care of with photo manipulation software as well. This does not appear to have been employed either. I know that some of the same paintings are reproduced in other art books in much better quality, so good photos do exist. I do, however, give it the benefit of the doubt in my rating, for the rest of the book. If not for poor quality control this would be highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mel Ramos Pop Art Fantasies: The Complete Paintings","review":"If there's ever a hall of fame opened for pin-up artists, Mel Ramos is sure to be a first ballot inductee. Pop Art Fantasies is the ultimate book for fans of Ramos as it collects all known existing paintings and watercolors by the artist, 480 in all collected within the pages of this beautiful, over-sized hard cover book. The book contains a foreward by Ramos himself and a lengthy essay on the artist's career by art critic Donald Kuspit. In his essay, Kuspit takes perhaps the most in depth look yet into Ramos' work, comparing his pop imagery to such other artists as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and delving into the ironic contradictions in his work over the various stages of his career. While Kuspit at times is a bit guilty over analyzing Ramos' work, the essay is nevertheless informative.The book displays Mel's art by subject matter beginning with his early 1960's paintings of heroes and heroines such as Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman, Green Lanter, Dr. Midnite, and The Spectre. While not his most polished work, it's certainly interesting to see these rather fannish paintings by a guy not noted for this type of work. His painting of Batman entitled \\"A Sinister Figure Walks\\" has a notable Bob Kane influence to it. His paintings of early pulp and comic heroines like Sheena and the Phantom Lady would begin to set the tone for his future pin-up work.Next we move into the two areas where Ramos truly made his mark as both a pin-up artist and a pop artist as we look at his peek-a-boo art and his consumer advertising art. Influenced by the great Gil Elvgren, Ramos's playful peeks into women's bedrooms through keyholes are the stuff of legends and capture that spunky yet still innocent era of the pre-protest 1960's. Ramos's advertising art is even more interesting as he places his nude models with logos for such products as Velveeta cheese, Colgate toothpaste, Valvoline oil, AC spark plugs, and Coca Cola. His Chiquita banana paintings are especially fun as the girl stands in for the banana, unpeeled, or stripped in a not so subtle sexual suggestion. Ramos did the same with his women and candy bar ads as the wrapper to an Almond Joy is peeled away to reveal a beautiful, naked woman.The section on Beauties and Beasts is rather amusing as the models seem wildly out of place with the animals they are drawn with but I think that's exactly what Ramos was going for. He has his women riding zebras, sitting in the laps of panda bears, cavorting with seals, and posing playfully with gorillas and bears.Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the section on Lost Paintings. These are paintings that were started as concepts in the mid-1960's that were never finished. Ramos has now gone back and finished some of these classic product ads but with women painted in a more modern, 21st century style. Once again Ramos makes use of popular products like Cracker Jack or Planters Nuts to display his phenomenal women. What I love about Ramos is that even with his later work he was always painting real women with real curves, not exaggerated females with rail-thin waists and abnormally large breasts. These women truly were the girl next door types.Kuspit provides a detailed biography on Ramos as well as lists of his public collections, solo and group exhibitions and magazine and book credits. A remarkable book and a must have for pin-up fans.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Avengers","review":"Kaewert's novelization is the best fictional Avengers book I have read.

Her work influenced both the Unity School of Christianity and Religious Science movements. High Mysticism is arguably the &quot;centerpiece&quot; among her writings on religion.Ms. Hopkins, like all the best of the New Thought writers, was a synthesist of orthodox and heterodox Christian ideas, ideas from the eastern religions, and a number of ideas seemingly spawned anew in the &quot;can do&quot; America of the late 19th and early 20th Century.High Mysticism, as its title suggests, advocates a mystical and metaphysical approach to problems of faith. The language is almost self-consciously &quot;religious&quot;, as Ms. Hopkins tries to clothe her ideas in a spiritual language appropriate to their serious purpose. Unfortunately, while the result is always readable, it sometimes seems a bit stilted and high flown, in the way that 19th Century novels of the fantastic could be. Ms. Hopkins differs from other advocates of new faiths in her era, though, in that Ms. Hopkins advocated an intersection between the metaphyscial ideas with which her work is preoccupied and the mundane everyday in which we all live. In some ways, her work, though it speaks of arcane mysteries, is trying to communicate an accessible spiritual practice. In this way, Ms. Hopkins arguably deviates from the &quot;secret initiations&quot; of theosophical and other similar movements.Later writers, Ernest Holmes and the Fillmores in particular, would take Hopkins' ideas and express them in much more reader-friendly language. But High Mysticism is a must read for anyone who wants to see the &quot;missing link&quot; between Quimby on the one hand, and the modern &quot;positive thinking&quot; faiths on the other hand. I give this 3 stars because it is not for everyone,but it is consistently interesting, as Ms. Hopkins' ideas dance across the pages."},{"Title":"High Mysticism","review":"One of the most influential books of my writing and ministerial career. This book must be read, not with the mind, but with the soul, a feature that may prove difficult for some. Mrs. Hopkins fans the embers of the spiritually awakening consciousness in a way that is rare among writers. All her works should prove to be of great interest to the seeker of a deeper reality, but High Mysticism has the uncanny ability to impart a degree of that lofty realm Hopkins so eloquently elucidates.J Douglas Bottorff, author of The Whisper of Pialigos."},{"Title":"High Mysticism","review":"This book is spiritual dynamite. Do not read it unless you want to see an earthquake in your deepest self. Sure, it's written in archaic language--it's old! But the Truths it relates are as new as your next breath.If you're bold, read it. It will change your life."},{"Title":"High Mysticism","review":"By all means buy this book even if it sits on the shelf until it is time to read it. I thank this publisher for making High Mysticism available again as it has been out of print.This book is the culmination of Emma Curtis Hopkins long career as a teacher, healer and founder of New Thought. It was not written in 1888 as stated in another review. Looking at her other writings show there was a growth in her consciousness that places this book as being completed after the turn of the 20th century. Most of her writing includes quotes relating to the science of the day which was mostly chemistry. This book mentions radio, atomic theory automobiles and other scientific advances after the turn of the last century. Emma was always at the forefront of what was going on in the world. She had trained over 50,000 people by the end of her career, including the founders of all the current New Thought organizations around today.This book requires a dedication to your spiritual life, and patience to follow \\"her special line of reasoning.\\" It would be good to read some of her earlier works such as \\"Scientific Christian Mental Practice\\" (Mental Science) or \\"The Gospel Series\\" (Spiritual Science) which to me, after studying her teachings for 15 years, is the book that goes right to the heart of Truth. For an easier way into her teachings look at \\"Unveiling Your Hidden Power: Emma Curtis Hopkins Metaphysics for the 21st Century.\\"All of her earlier works state, \\"deny the unreality of what is not Good or not God, and to affirm the Truth that is the Good or God.\\" In High Mysticism she goes beyond this to say \\"just know the Truth and it will set you free.\\""},{"Title":"High Mysticism","review":"Excellent reading, great guidance. My life is so much fuller and wonderful from following the contents of this book. Recommended for both novices and veterans of the science."},{"Title":"High Mysticism","review":"Item being reviewedHigh MysticismThis book is transformative. I love it."},{"Title":"Apocalypse Observed: Religious Movements and Violence in North America, Europe and Japan","review":"If you are fascinated by the extreme measures that have characterized the \\"cults\\" that the media has highlighted for us, this book is a great corrective. It provides details about the events surrounding the violence you saw/heard on screen--for Jonestown, Waco, Aum Shinrikyo, Solar Temple and Heaven's Gate.What could we have missed? For example, and this is a major premise of the book, the fact that the anti-cult coalitions, government agencies, and media played a huge role in the intensification of events leading to the climaxes of violence. In other words, all factors involved in \\"cult\\" violence are not only internal factors (eg. psychotic leaders brainwashing victims into compliance). Conflict is exacerbated, accelerated and even initiated often from the outside.Whether this book \\"overcorrects\\" is debatable. But it certainly adds to understanding the complexities involved in new religious movements that go up in smoke."},{"Title":"A Mother at Heart (Stealing Home Series #2) (Love Inspired #94)","review":"I really liked this book. When Miriam Spencer returns home she runs into her long ago boyfriend, Jake Steele. As the story unfolds the reader learns what drove the couple apart. More importantly you learn what brings them back together. This is the 2nd in the Stealing Home series. I liked it just as much as the first. The way Jake and his brother Simon grew up explains much about the men they became. This thread isn't the theme of the book but it does provide wonderful background. I like the growth and change in Miriam."},{"Title":"A Mother at Heart (Stealing Home Series #2) (Love Inspired #94)","review":"Was a great read, and a great addition to my collection, will most certianly read this one over again and again!!!"},{"Title":"A Mother at Heart (Stealing Home Series #2) (Love Inspired #94)","review":"This is the second book in the series, and it's as good as the first!!! This book is about Jake, Simon's brother. Jake had a better outcome to his foster homes. He found a mom and dad to love, and they wanted to keep him for life. After ten years, Jake was taking over the family farm. Miriam, on the other hand, had come back to sell her family farm in order to help cover some of her overwhelming debt...Again the romance was wonderful. There are a few VERY PASSIONATE kisses. I LOVED them!!! The issues that faced this couple were realistic, and I felt the characters connected wonderfully!!! I was also happy to see that the answer to the main problem wasn't as easy as 1-2-3...Miriam and Jake had to make sacrifices to make everything work out. I higly recommend this book!!!One thing I really like about this author is that you wonder how will these two people ever get together? I read through and when it happens, it's believable! This author is talented!!!"},{"Title":"Luther: A Play","review":"I have not seen the 1974 and 2001 filmed versions, or a live stage performance, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading the playscript. Yes, it is a didactic, Brechtian piece, and good for it. I enjoy reading plays because in my mind the action and visuals and voices are so good!\\"Luther\\" is an excellent skim-through of an important era, and its ramifications started long before Luther, and have continued up to today. I'd recommend this as a kind of quick history of the reformation. GB Shaw could have written one of the sharp lines spoken by the papal investigator, when Luther demands that the authorities prove his errors via the Bible: roughly, \\"Martin, you run to the same place as all heretics do, to the Scriptures.\\""},{"Title":"Luther: A Play","review":"Osborne, the popular enfant terrible of British drama in the 1950's and 60's (then ignored once his politics became unfashionable in artistic circles) won several awards for this play, an interesting but hardly comprehensive portrait of Martin Luther's career. The title role (originally played by Albret Finney)is challenging for an actor, and intriguing for the reader. The second act--in which Luther fights the Catholic Church--is strong and well-written; the first is also dramatic in its attempt to explain why Luther did what he did; the third, however, by viewing Luther at the end of his life, disappoints because we are only TOLD about his accomplishments rather than sharing them.The scope of the play is too large--it tries to cover too much time rather than concentrating on one (or a few) specific events. But it is a curious and fascinating play; few are written about religion any more, and for that alone it is engrossing."},{"Title":"Luther: A Play","review":"I was excited to learn that a play existed about the life Of Martin Luther. When I look at this book in the literary sense, it is actually pretty bad. The long diatribes in an actual performance must be tedious and downright painful to the audience. These sermons take the place of any real story about the life of Luther. When I look at the play in a historical sense, the work is important in that it gives readers a very concise look at Luther's work and the significance of him standing up to the Catholic Church hierarchy. The facts that are mentioned about Luther's life are very sparse.John Osborne had a good idea in trying to write the play. Unfortunately, there realy is no story. There is no action. Some lines go on for an entire page. As an actor, this certainly is not easy to perform with zest. The basic idea behind Luther's work is told. Beyond that, I can gage little more about the man. Although Osborne would have us believe that Luther had some serious issues with his bowel movements."},{"Title":"Luther: A Play","review":"He strikes an interesting balance between the various Luther mythologies: the \\"Oak of Saxony\\" of ideolized Protestantism, the \\"Devil's Spawn\\" of reactionary Catholicism, and the mentally disturbed creature of speculative psychology.It doesn't break any new ground or make any brilliant points, but it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Luther: A Play","review":"Not only have I read Luther, but I have performed in the play. I played the Role of John Tetzel, the Dominican monk who sells indulgences. I found the play rather boring. Tetzel's scene in Act 2 scene 1 is one of the few entertaining bits of the play though a 4 page monolouge is a lot to memorize."},{"Title":"Tracy Austin: Powerhouse in pinafore","review":"I remember Tracy Austin appearing on the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson shortly after she achieved her first major success in tennis. She said that the reason she used two hands on the racquet was that when she first started playing she wasn't strong enough to handle it with one. Rather than waiting until she was strong enough, she found another way to play. This book is about her life, how tennis, school and family are all important to her. She was just as proud of her straight-A average as she was about her success in tennis. This is a strong message to young people, especially girls. No matter what else you do in life success in school will always be rewarding.The book is written for the young person and there are many photos of her playing, studying and just being herself. It also demonstrates the value of hard work, like nearly all successful athletes, Tracy practiced for hours, paying particular attention to a perceived weakness. There are many lessons for young people in this book and I recommend it for anyone, especially young girls, who need to be placed on the path to success."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"This is by far the best Rush/Rash concert of all time. The beginning video bit is worth the price of the bluray. Great quality sound and video."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"In my opinion Rush is the greatest power trio ever. I have seen them live numerous times and they never disappoint. This new offering is great. Just hearing all of Moving Pictures is worth the price.The blu-ray transfer is good but not perfect. The show starts off a little slow, the band has some tempo issues, and one of the cameras used on Geddy is not as sharp as the other. I don't remember what song it is but you notice Alex talking to Neil about the tempo being too fast or slow and you clearly see Neil say \\"I know\\". The surround and stereo mixes are very good. Great set-list and the comical videos are a bonus. The video editing at times is too abrupt for my tastes and some of the overhead shots of Neil are out of sync. Also, do we really need to see Neil's feet? Not much on bonus material but how often do you watch bonus stuff anyway?For me, I still like Rio the best. Yes the sound was not as good but the band was on fire and Geddy's voice held up better. Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan and I hope they continue to rock out as long as they can."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Rush has never been great at video. Their DVDs are always a little pedestrian. This one is no exception. The editing is not very fancy, the extras seem more like an afterthought, and the packaging is pretty unremarkable. What is remarkable is the music. These guys sound better than ever. Now that they're bigger than God, they have the money and technology to make their sound huge and expansive. Technically, they've never been better. The setlist is excellent, but it is clearly aimed at songs that are easier to sing, and pitched a little lower. It is pretty clear that while Geddy's bass playing is still amazing, he's a little old to be screeching like that banshee he once was. He barely makes it through tracks like Spirit of Radio and 2112. Still, its Rush, and who knows how many more chances we might have to see these guys live. Rush's music is the soundtrack to my life, and when they finally hang it up, a little bit of me will die."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"....But this is the next best thing!

I just finished watching it. Great all around Rush show. I saw some reviews on I-tunes about Geddy's voice..Noticed nothing here..He sounds strong, very strong on the Blu-ray. The heart stopping pause rewind part for me is the encore. La Villa and Working Man are incredible. Alex throws down. Amazing stuff. I saw this show live but I have to say the Blu-ray captures Alex in a way that shows how capable he is on the guitar and how funny he is on stage. Amazing Blu-ray.

I've had the pleasure of attending more than a few RUSH concerts in Chicago and in San Diego. This disc brings home the excitement of watching a top band perform flawlessly LIVE (without needing ear-protection) AND they played all my favorites. Other reviewers have successfully dissected the performance, song by song, so I'll skip that. The clever 'time machine' theme in the stage settings as well as the imaginitive vignettes(featuring the band members)add an element of humor that makes this performance by these 'old-guys' laugh-out-loud memorable. ANY fan of RUSH will completely enjoy this disc."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"An old friend of mine went to this show.

If you are a bass player and you haven't listened or seen Geddy Lee..Get A Move! Alex and Neil are of course excellent too. This one solid unit. My favorite group since I stopped buying KISS albums in the 1970's when I was a kid. For such an intellectual band they have a genuine humility and sense of humour."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"One word: Fantastic.

It was a great show, but like all concerts, where you sit has a direct effect on how you hear the music. I didn't have the best seats in the house so the sound mix, while I am sure it sounded great in the headset of the front of the house mixer, was not the best from my vantage point. Watching the DVD and remembering the show as I saw it live allowed me to hear everything I missed at the live performance. That being said, for Rush fans this is a must see. They played Moving Pictures in its entirety, included 2 songs from their upcoming album (BU2B and Caravan), plus revived some previously retired performances (Closer to the Heart) and some that I believe may never have been played live before this tour (Presto). In true Rush style and with an incredible sense of humor, they included some skits with that are sure to tickle your funny bone.One of the things I like best about the live show was seeing fans as young as 8-9 years old attending the show with their parents. But not just that they were there, they were really into the music. It is nice to see older Rush fans introducing their children to this incredible rock band.Strongly recommend this to all Rush fans. Sit and enjoy it with your kids and let them experience the awesome music of Rush."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"What can be said here.

Waves tour. I've seen them 10x, twice on the Time Machine Tour (2010,2011).No Blu-Ray will ever substitute for being at the show live. But this is a great momento of that tour. The audio is fine and the videography is VERY fine ! It is so much better than Rush In Rio, which I think is a visual disaster. The boys are right on the money with their respective playing. My only negative comment is Geddy's voice: it's not able to meet the demands of the early work, and at times, it's just not good. He slurs lyrics like Elton; if I didn't know the words, I'd have no idea what he was saying. Time waits for no one, so give him a break on his vocals and instead, enjoy the tight riffs and the genuine commaraderie shown between the three of them while they are playing. Best Buy has this in stores right now for $19.99.

I have seen then about 50 times, begining with the Moving Pictures Tour. I like this DVD alot. These guys never skimp when it comes to production values. The Video is as crisp as it can be, and the 5.1 stereo is great if you have the equipment to play it.I enjoy shutting off the lights and my phone and watching the performance, it is the closest to actually experiencing being at the show.I really enjoyed some of the obscure stuff like the Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs.I think this would be a good way to initiate some of the youngsters, which I do see at the concerts with their Dads.My only complaint (and I use that term very lightly) Id Gedd's vocal performance. It seems better on the DVD than on the CD. He cracked a few times, which most people wouldn't catchBuy the DVD Buy the CD and anything else with the Rush brand on the cover"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I am mystified as to why the person who wrote the most \\"helpful critical review\\" had such a problem with the sound mix of the fantastic Blu-Ray. As Rush has progressed over the years when it comes to releasing their concert video's, they really started to hit the nail on the head when the released R30 a few years ago. Since then, every concert video to date...Beyond the lighted stage, Snakes and Arrows, and now \\"Time Machine\\" has been excellently produced, both in video and audio quality. The video especially is wonderfully done, showing different camera angles that I had never seen in a prior Rush video. The audio mix, is amazingly balanced, a lot of good punch on the low end from Geddy's bass and Neil's drum kit, and the high's of Alex's guitar soar through the video. I don't consider myself an audio file, but I play various instruments, so I feel that I have a pretty good ear. Maybe the prior reviewer doesn't have the greatest sound system, or maybe he has his settings off, but I couldn't really tell that there were any really noticeable audio adjustments throughout the video. For me, it was off the hook the entire concert and as of yet, I haven't found a pause in the video like I have seen in a lot of other productions. Compared to \\"Rush in Rio\\" this DVD blew that one away, as I stated before, that the band and their crew have really learned how to put together a wonderful concert video.My biggest question is why Amazon is not releasing the Blu-Ray version until late December, when other store(s) have already put it on the market for sale. Unusual, since Amazon always seems to release titles along with their competition at the same time. So that makes me scratch my head a little. But I will continue to use Amazon, since I can find anything here that I need, and usually for quite a bit cheaper price.In closing, this DVD is a MUST for any Rush fan or casual fan......it just blew me away!! And it is a nice memory for me, since I wsa fortunate to see them on the first leg of the \\"Time Machine Tour\\".Thank you Rush for many years of great music and for documenting this amazing concert. You really out did yourselves this time. I can't even imagine how you could top this show.

They just keep defying their critics and defying the odds.The production on Blu Ray is top notch.

Normally on release day, I'm chomping at the bit but this time I was a little put off by the whole \\"how many times do I have to pay for Moving Pictures?\\" As more time went on, I kept reading reviews and youtube posts about how Geddy can't sing anymore and that the show was terrible. After watching, I have to disagree. I bought this because I wanted to support the band, and since no one buys the new albums anymore, this is the way they're staying in the game. I'm also a fan of Rush's sense of humor so their little skits are always worth the 17 bucks to me. I'm really happy I bought this. I watched the whole thing in one sitting and never did I get bored or think \\"dear god not this song again\\" I was smiling ear to ear as the boys got to jam out on parts and their usual stage antics. I thought the first set was great, and well put together. You can tell Rush has some heavy enthusiasm for the new material as BU2B was upbeat, and aggressive. Neil was playing on top of the beat and a little faster than the recorded version. Marathon was a little too fast, and to me seemed to have lost it's groove, but some impressive open handed playing by Neil in the second verse. The second set is what it is. Moving Pictures and some gems. I was disappointed to hear the new arrangement for The Camera Eye. Killer version of Witch Hunt, Alex just owns that song. Great rendition of Caravan. I'm giving this 4 stars because the audio could have been a hell of alot better. The use of surround is subtle at best and the biggest use was hearing the audience behind me. That's pretty weak. It's also compressed a bit too much. Geddy's bass can be a bit tame at times. To all the critics out there who say Geddy can't hit the high notes anymore, or even worse, can't sing anymore, I have this to say. Geddy Lee sounds amazing on the newer songs, and songs with mid to lower registers. He also nailed the high notes in freewill and alot of other songs. Faithless was flawless. The guy can sing and his voice has matured very nicely over the years. That being said, He doesn't sound like he did 30 years ago. No one over the age of 50 sounds like they did when they were 30. If you want to hear that, then please go put on the original recording or Exit Stage Left and stop complaining about the impossible. The guy is on tour for 6 to 8 months out of the year, has to sing challenging songs for 3 hours, so he has to pick his battles. I can't even say he blew the notes, he just sings it different with a \\"live feel\\" The songs that suffered the most were songs I've heard a thousand times anyway. You go to a Rush show, or buy their concert DVD because you want to watch these guys entertain you, not to hear the album versions. This concert rocked my socks off when I expected it not to. They have fun, can play their asses off, great versions of the tunes, and show love for their fans.

AWESOME SHOW!!! These guys SHRED IT live - every song, note for note, just like on the albums! And don't ask me how three guys can generate such a wall of sound - we were on the LAWN, well up from the stage, and STILL couldn't hear each other talk! Simply amazing! My wife had heard Tom Sawyer, Limelight, and Free Will and liked those songs well enough but she became a TRUE Rush fan on this night! Sadly, I've only caught the boys in person twice but have scarfed up EVERY live DVD they've released.

Plenty. I was in the second row in front of Lifeson. I have seen Rush numerous times since 1984's Grace Under Pressure concert and this was Rush at their finest. Not only was the band in top form but the crowd was pumped as well. There was plenty of energy in the air at this show. Cleveland was a great host for Rush to record their first American concert film. Cheers to the city; Boos to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of F(Sh)ame. Buy this concert, you WILL NOT be disappointed. I also saw them play at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mt. View, CA earlier in the tour. Oh, yeah I almost forgot- Moving Pictures performed in its entirety.

Digging further, I found a true sense of song with Caress of Steel via \\"Lakeside Park,\\" \\"The Necromancer\\" and \\"Didacts and Narpets.\\" While many (including the band) regard 2112 as the passe-partout without which Farewell and Hemispheres would not have come to be, I found 2112 inspirational, whimsical and ambitious with Overture, Bangkok and Twilight Zone.With my $8.50 general admission ticket in hand, I went to my first show in September, 1980 (the original Moving Pictures tour). I was absolutely blown away with the sound of the band live: note perfect as if I had dropped the needle on a pristine vinyl album. The original \\"Atari Road\\" (not listed as part of the warm up tour, but was played) for Red Barchetta was scintillating, Xanadu amazing, and La Villa Strangiato for dessert. While I do not recall The Camera Eye as part of the set, it is possible I missed it while chasing a skirt (or 4).I did not see them again until 1983 in support of the Signals album (which many regarded as the Kilroy Was Here (Styx) for Rush). Although awash with hard synth sounds and composition, I found the album stood firmly on its own. Everyone knows Subdivisions, but few know Chemistry, Losing It, The Analog Kid and Digital Man; all strong pieces on their own. Grace Under Pressure brought its own onslaught of great composition as did Power Windows (Afterimage, Kid Gloves, The Enemy Within; Marathon, Manhattan Project, Territories).While Hold Your Fire and Presto had a greater mass appeal, the coup de grace for the effort of commercial appeal fell with Roll The Bones. Make no mistake, all of these are great albums (Prime Mover, Mission; Anagram, Available Light; Ghost of a Chance, Bravado, Heresy), but it was good to see the guys get back to brass tacks and hard roots with Counterparts, Test For Echo and Vapor Trails. While I was privileged to see the band twice on Snakes & Arrows, I've yet to truly GET the album (not surprizing; took me two years to get Test For Echo).Nonetheless, I have NO DOUBT in my mind that this will be a release of Epic Proportions: Moving Pictures Live; Front to Back. I can't wait to see the guys back in action celebrating 30 years of one of my favorite albums."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I ordered this dvd as a gift.

The only thing that didn't need to be done was for Geddy to apoligize for the 'reckless indulgence' comment at the end of 'Leave That Thing Alone' because I believe it to be one of thier best songs and I personally groove on it when they play that instrumental. I always wanted to know what the inspiration was for that song.All of Rush's DVD's are good in one way or another especially the early stuff when they were starting out (the black and white stuff is facinating to see compared to the newer produced stuff but as they say it's progressive rock music and some of it can be construed as being a bit on the metal side of things, they should be commended for that alone but they have seen plenty of success) I still love the CD called Counterparts and it's one of my favorites! I saw them live on the Hold Your Fire tour years ago in Dallas Texas in 1988 and they lit the three balls on fire from the ceiling of the Reunion Arena and then dropped balloons all over the stadium, it was an awesom show, I still remember the lasers at that show seemed to reach out into the audience or looked like they did, I even have a DVD by them that I bought online that's called Tastes Like Chicken from a concert that was filmed by the audience and it's an awesome show even if the camera did move around too much, I trust the fans more than I do the professionals sometimes because it gives a different perspective on things."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I'm 29 and I don't see me rocking 30 years from now like these guys do.

This show is great. A truly class act."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Within the last decade there has been no shortage of full-length concert DVDs from Canadian progressive rock supergroup Rush. There was \\"Rush in Rio\\" in 2003, \\"R30\\" in 2005, and \\"Snakes & Arrows Live\\" in 2008, as well as 2011's feature-length documentary, \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\", produced by filmmakers/Rush fans Sam Dunn & Scott McFadyen and their company Banger Productions (VH-1 Classics' Metal Evolution, \\"Iron Maiden: Flight 666\\", \\"Metal: A Headbangers Journey\\".) It's a testament to Dunn & McFadyen's camaraderie with the band that when the time came to document this 2011 performance at the Quickens Loans Arena in Cleveland Ohio, the job went to them. It's a good thing, too. While I've been impressed in varying degrees with all of the aforementioned concert DVDs (\\"Snakes and Arrows Live\\", in particular) I must say that this new DVD seems to be better filmed, with more of an eye towards detail. From close-up views of Alex Lifeson's guitar techniques, to Neil Peart's feet stomping out a particularly tricky bass pedal rhythm, to all the set pieces, visual jokes and video screen presentations - it's pretty obvious that this was produced by people who know and love the music.Now, for a band with so many live DVDs on the market, does \\"Time Machine\\" offer anything that Rush fans haven't seen and heard before? For those who care about Rush beyond just their 'greatest hits', the answer is definitely yes. One thing that makes Rush's live shows superior to many other bands still surviving from the 70s and 80s is that Rush actually shakes-up their set-list a bit from tour to tour. Of course they don't (and shouldn't) leave out their most well-known FM radio staples (Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Closer To the Heart, Working Man), but for this tour they even went a step further, including a complete performance of their most popular album, 1980's \\"Moving Pictures\\". For fans of that particular album, the performances and visual presentation of these classic tracks are all top-notch and alone worth the price of the DVD - particularly the showstopping rendition of \\"The Camera Eye\\", which easily surpasses the power of the studio version. But, believe it or not, the 'hits' only makes up about half of this 3 hour show. For me, and I suspect a lot of other Rush fans, the real treat with these marathon concert DVDs is hearing some of the newer material live, and finding out which lesser-known album tracks from the past will get dusted-off for rediscovery. Keeping with the \\"Time Machine\\" theme, the set-list is cobbled-together from all of the band's various eras or \\"phases\\". \\"2112 Overture/Temples of Syrinx\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" represent a taste of the 70's 'concept album' period, which no doubt ushered many-a-proghead onto the Rush bandwagon. The 80s 'synthesizer' period is nicely-represented here by \\"Time Stand Still\\", \\"Marathon\\" (a personal favorite of mine) and powerful \\"Subdivisions\\", which serves as an emotional climax to the opening set. The title track from 1989's \\"Presto\\" is an unexpected (but very welcome) inclusion, providing a subdued contrast to the show's heavier moments. From 1993's \\"Counterparts\\" we get the tasty instrumental workout \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\", featuring some wonderfully nimble-fingered bass work from Geddy Lee, as well as a raucous rendition of \\"Stick It Out\\" which rates as one of my favorite performances on the entire DVD. 2007's \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is represented by a trio of tracks, \\"\\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Far Cry\\", & \\"Faithless\\". All of them come across excellent in the live setting, but \\"Faithless\\" is a particular treat as it's wasn't included on the DVD of the \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" tour. There are also two nods to the future with \\"BU2B\\" and \\"Caravan\\", previews from the band's next album \\"Clockwork Angels\\", due in 2012. Both tracks are incrediblely gripping live, and are full to the brim with monster heavy riffs and dark atmosphere - proving that Rush's post-70's output has not always as \\"soft\\" as some of the band's critics like to claim.While much could be said about the huge stage production found here (with video screens, explosions, towers of flames, comedic film skits, and even a guy in a chicken suit), the real 'show' comes from the three musicians themselves. Their on-stage energy, whether clowning around or intensely absorbed in a musical moment, is palpable and a true joy to behold. At a time when many other vintage bands only seem to tolerate each other for the sake of money, it's obvious that Lee, Peart and Lifeson are still friends with a lot of mutual respect for one another.From a technical standpoint, their are two sound-mixes to choose from - 2.1 Stereo or DTS. I don't have a DTS system, so can't comment on that version, but the ordinary stereo mix sounds quite full and dynamic, whether using headphones or speakers. However, I must sat that the previous DVD, \\"Snakes and Arrows Live\\", had a clearer 'separation' effect when listened to with headphones - at least to my ears.All in all, this DVD should not be missed by anyone who calls themselves a Rush fan, and it certainly whets the appetite for the new album, coming later this year."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I am a HUGE Rush fan and I loved this Blu-Ray.

I have to say this concert was AWESOME to see this in Blu-Ray. I have been a RUSH fan for 30+ years and I have enjoyed all there live concert DVD's. The concerts are even better when you see them in Blu-Ray. A suggestion, when watching the Rush Time Machine Blu-Ray, have your home theater system set-up for true surround sound. don't use any theater enhancement setting like Music Video, Concert Hall, etc. It takes away the sound quality of the Blu-Ray. In true Dolby Digital Surround Sound the concert sounds great!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Yes, it's a pretty geeky sounding title, but that's really what one should be looking for in a review. If you like Rush, you don't need me to tell you that they're great. If you don't like them, you probably aren't reading this review, because you're probably not shopping for their DVD's.Let me get the bottom line up front--this, by far, is the best sounding and best-looking of the Rush live DVD's (and I own all of them). Rush is a band that has been hit and miss on the sound and video quality for their live performances. Going WAY back to All the World's a Stage (which had very good audio, particularly for 1976/1977) to Exit Stage Left (which sounds and looks like it was recorded in a fog) to A Show of Hands (excellent sound, average video quality for 1987), they could really get it right, or really mess it up. When they returned to live video's with Rush in Rio, they began to get the video nailed down pretty well, but the sound wasn't great--the noise from the enthusiastic crowd in a stadium detracted from the DVD. Snakes and Arrows Live was excellent on both counts, but Time Machine is where the band finally manages to get everything pretty darn close to perfect. Having seen them in Birmingham, UK, on the tour, this was the best sound quality I've seen them have live, and they managed to capture that on the disc. All the instruments show up perfectly in the mix, from the rumbling bass of \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" to the meaty synths at the beginning of \\"Subdivisions\\" for the low end to Neil's cymbals throughout the DVD and Alex's guitar on \\"La Villa Strangiato\\". The video quality also is top-notch; it really does replicate the experience of being there live (or as close as you can get).I've seen a few reviews criticizing a perceived \\"jumpiness\\" in the video editing. That's somewhat justified; I'd describe the editing much like I'd describe the band's music--hyperkinetic. Not enough to warrant dropping a star from the review, but I do wish that they would have stayed with a single camera view a little longer during some of the solos.The closest thing to a criticism (and this isn't why I purchase a DVD), the \\"extras\\" are a little scanty compared to previous DVD's like Snakes and Arrows.To sum everything up, if you are a Rush fan (or are looking to purchase this for one), you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I love the potential of blu-ray to offer high resolution audio and fill the void left by dvd-a and sacd. Unfortunately, that hasn't materialized. However, the live concert \\"movie\\" is an excellent opportunity to see and hear what blu-ray audio could be. So far I have not found many discs that wow, but the Time Machine concert is certainly one of them. It's not as tight or as \\"clean\\" as say Jeff Beck at Ronnie Scotts (which is maybe the best on blu so far) or as sonorous as David Gilmour's Remember that Night but it's Rush and it Rocks. Video is generally excellent, but I buy these for the audio and this disc doesn't disappoint. The sound is clear, the bass is strong and Geddy's voice is not buried nor is it out in front of the music. My only complaint is there is a bit more audience noise than I'd like. This is a live concert and that is to be expected and for the most part they do a great job of suppressing the audience during the music, but this was recorded in a huge venue so there is the occasional yell or whistle that makes it's way to front (no where near as bad as Rush in Rio). If you are a fan of Rush and have a system that can take advantage of the DTS HD Master Audio then you should pick this up and then crank it up.

I like picking myself out in the crowd shots. I was close at the U2 360 tour Rose Bowl show and U2 Vertigo tour - Chicago. I saw the Time Machine tour five times; three times on the first leg in Milwaukee, Chicago and St. Louis, and again in Chicago and this show in Cleveland on the second North American leg. I was sitting in the first row of the upper section next to Alex and wore an LED equalizer shirt that lit up and had a built-in mic that reacted to the music in my continuing shameless attempts to appear in concert videos. I could see me here and there in the video, just under the circular LED lighting truss over Alex.Rush took a calculated risk filming this show. Most concerts are filmed over two nights. They shot this in one night. Good move - I think it kept them on their toes. They were on their game for this performance. Probably one of the tighter shows I saw this tour. Saw it this past week at the local multiplex and was pretty impressed. One of the better Rush performances captured on video.The crowd was energetic. They had a grid of wedge-shaped lighting trusses mounted over the entire audience, which were lit most of the show. Think \\"Show of Hands\\" on steroids. More light thrown on this crowd than other rock shows I've seen filmed. Adds a new dimension to the show on video as the moving lights over the audience were in sync with those over the stage. The editing was done at reasonable pace.My personal favorite was \\"The Camera Eye\\". I read somewhere that Geddy thought the song was \\"too dated\\" for inclusion in previous tours. He was surprised to find that he really enjoyed playing it on this tour. This song got a strong response from the crowd each time I saw it played. I think it is personal favorite of many Rush fans. Juxtaposition of the rear videoscreen cityscapes intercut well with the live performance. They really nailed it here. Geddy knew it too when he let out a yell and threw his hands up at the very end of the song. Lightning captured in a Blu-ray bottle.They had a camera mounted underneath this motorized mini-blimp they flew around the venue. The camera is lower resolution than the other hi-def cameras and made for some interesting shots. Hand helds running around the audience captured one amazing air-drumming performance after another. Many songs end with a wide shot taken from the nose-bleed seats in the rear upper deck. The venue was small and it makes for a nice panoramic view they return to often.Highlights include a blistering bass solo by Geddy to finish off \\"Leave that thing alone\\". Geddy also hits the high notes of \\"Freewill\\" as if it were 1980 again. The \\"Moving Pictures\\" section works well as each song is framed and intercut with their backing video.Every conceivable angle of Neil's always-excellent solo is covered as he amazes us mere mortals with his awesome display of muscle memory hyperdrive.Geddy is shown mouthing along to various dialog samples he triggers throughout the show. I never really noticed many of these live, but it's pretty funny in the video. You can always tell how well a Rush show is going by the looks they give each other on stage and the faces they make when they flub something. Alex is once again quite the mugger on camera this show as he thrashes through the setlist with his usual intensity. Neil never misses a stick.I thought they had a great light show this tour. Everything looked and sounded great on the DLP video projection system I saw it on, so crank it up sit back and experience rock nirvana as the LED chase patterns streak across the undulating spider-like legs of the main rig during \\"Vital Signs\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" - It's a beauty way to go."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Having been a fan of Rush since the early 80s, I've had the pleasure to see them multiple times live. As much as I enjoy any concert video of a group I like, I usually find those videos lacking. It never really feels like the concert, which of course, is simply the reality watching something opposed to actually being there. I saw Rush in Atlanta (really Alpharetta, GA) on the Time Machine tour, which was about 6 months before this show in Cleveland was filmed. After watching this Blu-Ray, let me tell you something friend, this is as close to being at the show as I think you can get. It's as much like being there as you can get, minus all the negatives. The picture is amazingly clear, even for Blu-Ray. (very glad I waited the extra time for the blu-ray release) I personally don't have a 7.1 or even a 5.1 sound but for regular old flat screen speakers it sounds really good (it even gets a bit loud at times). I believe the band kept the same set list through out the concert, as this was the same one I saw and read on the Rush web boards. Why Cleveland you may ask? It's a nod to the first US town to play Rush (\\"Working Man\\") back in the day. Care to guess the song the wraps up the encore?As Moving Pictures is my favorite Rush album, this disc holds a special place in my heart. I had hoped to catch the band a second time as they came close again, but was unable to. Now, I feel like I can catch this magnificent show any time. If you are a Rush fan, you simply must have this disc. If you are a boarder line fan, I still recommend you picking it up. Oh, just a last note, as this seems to bother some people. The Moving Pictures album was released in early 1981, some 30+ years ago. Since the band members are the same, they have obviously grown 30 years older. Geddy can't quite hit the high notes that he could back then. He's not as bad as say Roger Daltry doing \\"Baba O'Reily\\", but you can tell. Just something obvious that apparently needs mentioning.If I were to give one slight negativity, the special features are a bit slim. They exist (2 long lost songs), but that's about it. I hope that one day soon, we get a Rush concert that has multiple angle selections that would let you watch each individual band member. That being said, this is one fine blu-ray. If you've read this review and are on the fence, just do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Saw this concert film in its theatrical release on October 26, 2011.For guys pushing 60, the boys in Rush have the enthusiasm and stage energy of guys half their age. Their enthusiasm is infectious, with the band and the audience feeding off each other.This is a remarkably high-energy show, and the numerous cuts to the crowd show fans of all ages obviously having a wonderful time (as evidenced by the near-constant smiles on their faces). For such a large arena show, it feels surprisingly intimate.The band mines the depths of their extensive catalog with the setlist, including the title track from the album \\"Presto\\", and pull a suprising amount of energy out of \\"Marathon\\" from the album \\"Power Windows\\". I don't think they did any songs from \\"Grace Under Pressure\\", but IIRC they may have hit almost every album from \\"2112\\" forward, plus \\"Working Man\\" as the final encore.In both the concept videos and the live show the band plays around with the arrangements of a few of their best-known songs: listen up for brief polka, disco, and country arrangements of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", among other treats.The lighting rig above the stage resembled spider legs at times. It looked expensive and elaborate, but for all its mobility I didn't notice a marked visual impact on the stage or show itself.The cameras capture the three performers having a great time playing jovially alongside each other, and even a few instances where they appear to engage individual members of the audience for a moment and a laugh. I can't recall ever seeing another band enjoy their time onstage together as much as Rush does, and they've been at it for nearly 40 years (current line-up).Neil's drum solo occurs about midway through the second half of the show, and despite some slight inconsistency in the rhythm of his hi-hats (an observation, not a criticism) he delivers on the promise of his reputation as one of rock's finest drummers. He once again ends with a nod to the Big Band era.Geddy's bass work still impresses: his improvisational \\"fills\\" sound intricate and effortless at the same time. Too bad his vocals get a little buried in the sound mix (unless that was due to limitations of the movie theater's sound system).With the concept videos, the concert runs darn close to 3 hours -- but never drags for even a moment. The DVD and Blu-ray feature some additional concept video footage and some archival concert footage from the 1970's.Highly recommended viewing, even if you can't watch it on a 30 foot-high screen like I did."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Just came from seeing this on the national theater release night. In my case it was at the Arlington MA \\"Regent Theater\\" - a theater that has shown Rush rocumentaries in the recent past (and hosted the excellent Rush tribute band \\"Lotus Land\\" who opened last year for the \\"Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" screening).For tonight's screening of \\"Time Machine 2011: Cleveland\\" the biggest Rush-celebrity not in the band Donna Halper was there and took stage before the show to share stories of having been at the Cleveland concert as a VIP and of her continuing years being a friend of the band & vice verse (she's from Dorchester MA originally and seems to reside here in Boston again). Donna was well received and she noted Rush fans are loyal and friendly like no others. Donna also made special point of sharing the guys in the band are not only exceptional musicians but are the most genuine nice guys she's known and that's over a long 40+ year career in media/broadcasting having meet all sorts or rock-stars that have come & gone. Of course she was preaching to the choir tonight but hearing from multiple sources that they're great guys off stage somehow makes it that much more enjoyable seeing them do their thing so well on-stage.Was an excellent and long show (the concert & some Rush theatrical extras I won't spoil) with us having an enthusiastic theater crowd to take it in.Notably it's the band's first live concert filmed in the United States and along with other very new and old tracks they performed Moving Pictures album live in its entirety (but possibly not in origial order).I intend to preorder the Blu-ray edition to add to my Rush vid collection.Conform or be cast out!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I bought this Rush DVD because they play the entire \\"Moving Pictures\\" album! I have every other Rush DVD and have to say that Geddy's voice on this DVD just sucks! Maybe the long tour got to him, maybe he was sick, maybe he's getting old??The Band played great as usual, the camera angles were great, over all the whole DVD was excellent but for Geddy's vocals. They were really bad to OK throughout the DVD. He often shouted instead of sang. Real shame too as I love Moving Pictures and hope they do another DVD and play it though again but that prob wont happen."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Had pretty great seats. They filmed my little section of friends but I guess we ended up on the cutting room floor. It was great live and it was great on DVD. What else is there to say. They just keep rolling along. But wait, I didn't see the Paul Rudd segment on the DVD? Is it hidden or just not there?"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"This DVD is a lot of fun, right from the beginning, which starts out with the classic, campy \\"Rash\\" satire. We saw this same show live earlier in the tour, and I am enjoying the DVD of the Cleveland show every bit as much as the live act we caught in VA. The audio is so clear, you can see/here everything so well, in that sense it far surpasses the live show. So many of our favorite tunes are here, and the playing is simply superb. My son plays bass and he is crazy about Geddy (naturally!), and I play guitar and love all of Alex's work. And we are both in awe of Neil! Can't go wrong with this, it's a phenomenal tour de force from beginning to end. There will never be another band like Rush!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"It was awesome to hear Moving Pictures live in its entirety.

Overall, this is a must for any Rush fan."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"This is a really solid title and I would highly recommend it for any Rush fan's library. These guys are just so musically talented it is pure pleasure watching them perfom. I missed a chance to actually catch this show live, so it was a no brainer for me to at least buy the disc.I will agree, however, with some of the other reviews that the sound quality does not blow me away - hence the reason I only gave it 4 stars. The band and the overall concert is a 5 star performance all the way.I'm no audio expert, but in my opinion the Snakes & Arrows blu-ray has a much better mix and overall sound quality. That being said, the content is great and well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I have to agree with the poor reviews of the audio cd of this concert, but somehow that miraculously goes away when watching the video. Of course, concerts are also meant to be seen, so maybe only listening gives one a hyper-critical assessment of any flaws. Watching this live performance blows that attitude away and you are swept along as if you are there. Geddy and Neil are just killing it and have gotten way better over the years. It's Alex that has gotten a bit sloppy in the live aspect. Great camera angles, super songs and wonderful concert experience. Forget the CD and buy the video, it's a rockin' good time!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"This was a really good concert; the sound and video were excellent and it goes in the player whenever things stink on TV (which is more and more these days...) A great buy if you're a Rush'ian and if you aren't initiated yet, I suggest you prepare yourself - the guys are a bit off from a socially acceptable/cool perspective, but that is just part of the package with this monster group of musicians. Fabulous (although a BR version of Rush in Rio would top this concert in a flash, $0.02 IMO..."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Canadian power trio Rush's brand new DVD (and off-shoot double live CD) Time Machine Live in Cleveland 2011 is a must for ALL RUSH FANS!Recorded and filmed in Cleveland, Ohio at Quicken Loans Arena in April of 2011 just as the second leg of the Time Machine Tour was underway and sees Rush capturing a majestic show (the first time a live DVD came from a US performance although some bits of 1989's A Show of Hands album were recorded at shows in the US) into a stellar DVD.I must confess, even as a longtime Rush fan (solid Rush fan here since 1990 and are my favorite band alongside Pink Floyd and Genesis), that some fans are starting to complain that Rush is releasing too many live DVDs and live albums (like Iron Maiden and post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and also David Gilmour) but such as life. Then others complaining about Geddy Lee's voice being off for this show (he might have either been under the weather or whatever for the show, then there are the bellyacher reviewers who must be either Britney or Gaga or Katy Perry fans). Despite Geddy's voice feeling under the weather (the 1978 portion of Different Stages in 1998 had Geddy singing with a bad cold and his voice struggled) his always excellent bass guitar playing and keyboards here more than make up for it. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is excellent as always and Neil Peart's drumming hasn't lost a step.I'm not complaining about Rush releasing yet another live album/DVD. Thing was, I missed the Time Machine Tour due to the economy being at an all time low (and it's not getting any better folks believe me) and also Roger Waters was touring with The Wall so I went to see Roger perform The Wall in Boston (I was living in south Florida in 2010) but knowing Rush very well (and being a 20 plus year fan), I knew a live CD and DVD would come from the tour (this is the first tour I missed since the Roll the Bones Tour in 1991/92). In my view, it's a great live disc and even superb DVD and gave me a chance to hear what I missed (my father bought me the DVD this past January along with a replacement copy of the CD for my 36th birthday this past January).There are some new tunes performed here like \\"BU2B\\" and \\"Caravan\\" which are from their forthcoming Clockwork Angels album (due in May of 2012 and cannot wait for it) but both tracks are performed much better here than the studio versions out on download (the MP3 sounded like crap). Neil's constantly evolving drum solo spot this time called \\"Moto Perpetuo\\" and Alex's acoustic instrumental called \\"O Malley's Break\\" are also excellent new ditties.The band pull some lost nuggets out of the archives on this new live album like \\"Presto\\" (which had not been played live ever until the Time Machine Tour and during the recording Geddy goofed on the words but were able to fix from another show), \\"Time Stand Still\\" (which was last performed on the Counterparts Tour in 1994), \\"Stick It Out\\" (last played on the 1997 Test For Echo Tour), \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" (which had not played since 2002's Vapor Trails Tour, unique to hear without it segueing into a drum solo), \\"Faithless\\" (which was not performed on the Snakes and Arrows Tour) and \\"Marathon\\" (which was last played on 1990's Presto Tour).You also get classics that have appeared on previous live albums but done well (the opening \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Freewill\\", \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"Closer to the Heart\\" (performed live for the first time since the one-off for Rio in 2002 with almost an Irish breakdown jig sound for the third verse rather than a by-the-numbers rendition), \\"2112 (Overture/Temples of Syrinx)\\", \\"Far Cry\\", \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" (this time with polka induced intro) and a unique take of \\"Working Man\\" which is done in a reggae beat for the first verse and part of the second verse and then goes into its normal take before ending like on Rush in Rio this time with a teaser of \\"Cygnus X-1\\" at the end) and all are perfomed well.The real treat here is the whole of 1981's Moving Pictures album played start to finish. You have the staples being Side 1 of the album which had all been released on most of the live albums since 1998's Different Stages and done well (\\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Red Barchetta\\", \\"YYZ\\" and \\"Limelight\\") plus \\"Witch Hunt\\" (which they had resurrected in 2007 on the Snakes and Arrows Tour), \\"Vital Signs\\" (last played on 2002's Vapor Trails Tour) and the best tune from the album \\"The Camera Eye\\" finally on a live album (last played in full on the 1981 Moving Pictures Tour). The ending of \\"The Camera Eye\\" features samples from Mike Myers as Austin Powers (\\"yeah baby yeah\\") and classic Monty Python movies (Eric Idle's \\"BRING OUT YOUR DEAD\\" from The Holy Grail and John Cleese's \\"machine that goes PING\\" from The Meaning of Life) thrown in for a hilarious touch.The DVD was brilliantly filmed by Sam Dunn (same guy who brought us the Rush documentary Beyond the Lighted Stage) and in addition to the show also comes with the screen films that were played at all shows. The first one that precedes the show with Geddy as a waiter/cook, Alex as manager Ray Ganniels and Neil as police officer O'Malley watching Rash who were dressed like Rush's 1970s selves performing polka versions of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" before a device switches the band to play disco, country (hilarious) and the classic studio version before the machine goes bonkers then the band hits the stage. Then another which takes place in 1980 with Alex as manager of Rush, Geddy as Cecil the British director (complete with bad teeth) and Neil as Percy the cameraman plus a horde of beautiful German women carrying pitchers of beer and trying to shoot a video for \\"Tom Sawyer\\" with the Time Machine device altering every bit. The Paul Rudd bit isn't here but who's complaining (replaced by the band as they were in the first sketch performing a polka version of \\"Closer To the Heart\\"). Then you get outtakes from the two aforementioned films plus a performance from Rush with original drummer John Rutsey playing \\"Need Some Love\\" and another from 1976 with the band performing \\"Anthem\\".For Rush fans who are hardcore fans and who like to have a souvenir of every tour, like myself, scoop this live album up! For those who don't either like it or don't want it then stay clear.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"These guys have just gotten better with time. It's fantastic to see them ripping into a song like \\"Freewill\\" which was recorded so long ago, with this much passion, precision and commitment. Rush is a band that, love them or hate them, is what they are. And, now, 40 plus years on, are more who they are than ever. The new material, like BU2B, sits perfectly along side the other tracks. The audio quality is amazing, and Geddy's voice is clear unlike the last couple concert video releases, and sounds so good. He can hit the high notes, but it has a depth to it that has grown over time. You can tell the video edits were carried out by true fans... the camera follows the focus of the music. Love the steampunk theme too. Two very small complaints: the show starts off a little mellow, and I get the feeling that they worked over some of the tracks to correct bum notes. There's not a freaking off note in the whole show. Maybe they nailed everything that night, or maybe it's been dressed up a little. Anyway, that's just my producer brain yacking. 2 marks. And the next question goes to Denis Norden."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"the best video already released by rush excellent productiondirection of the show in charge of the big producers Sam Dunn and Scott mcfaydencompulsory item for any fan of rush congratulations to the band and all production"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"It's Rush, enough said as to the quality of this DVD.

The band continues to perform at a level that most other bands can only dream about. The video quality is high (although there is some digital distortion from time to time) and they tried to shoot from different perspectives than previous concert videos. So there are some refreshing shots. The sound is excellent (as one would expect). The video is a snap shot of this particular tour, and by its nature some of the songs have appeared in every other Rush concert video. My favorite songs are those that they pulled out of the vault or changed around some. The hits (while performed well) have been released too many times. I'd tell them to pull out a few more songs from the vault and leave the hits off the next one. As much as I love the songs, how many times do I need to see Tom Sawyer or Limelight live? The bands video skits are comical and it is nice to know that they do not take themselves too seriously. The back ground video of the chimps playing Tom Sawyer and the polka Spirit of Radio makes this worth owning."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"An excellent video of the band's latest tour.

They weren't, they just knew good freaking music!! Missed the Moving Pictures tour...but caught Signals and have been hooked ever since.

I was fortunate enough to be at the world premier of Beyond The Lighted Stage and can tell you Scot and Sam know what they're doing and have a certain reverence for it.Paying tribute to the first city to play their music, the show was filmed in Cleveland and I can tell you the crowd and the band were feeding off each other all night to make it one to remember! This is also the first Rush show to be recorded and released in the USA so make sure you grab this important piece of Rush and music history! My wife and I had floor seats in the center section and there was a camera about 30 feet behind us so, when you watch the video and see the back of the bald guy's head wearing the white baseball jersey with the 11 on the back and Rush above the number, you can say \\"Hey!

I was very lucky that I married a Geddy Corn (Google for explanation) and she and I have raised kids that love Rush. We saw the Time Machine Tour in 2010 and it was simply awesome. Getting to see the whole Moving pictures in its entirety was great. Getting to see the camera eye performed for the first time was a great as well. This band has literally written the soundtrack for my life and I have great musical respect for them and their fans. The most loyal group of fans in the music industry today.Bottom line The Time Machine Tour was awesome and I can't wait to see this DVD!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I took my son to the White River show in 2010 and the last show of the tour at The Gorge at George in Washington State. I told my son after the first show that if a DVD came out that it would be a definite \\"buy it\\". I saw the Trio for Permanent Waves and Moving Pitchers (Pictures) and lost track of them in the eighties and nineties.After watching several of their Rush in Rio and R20 DVD's I thought to myself, \\"Wow, these guys are better now than when the last time I saw them\\", I got to see them.We had the pleasure of getting 6th row seats for White River Show in Seattle and was totally blown away.I have read some negative reviews of The Time Machine Tour by some fans who did not like the set list or some other reason. I say nay nay to the nay sayers.This is a band that plays a three hour set and still has another thirteen hours of material they could play. They have been together for over forty years and their body English says that they still they enjoy playing in front of fans and being together on stage. They may have changed their sound through the years but returned to the basics and have never changed their musical ethics.The bands video presentations, smart camera angles, pyrotechnics, sound mix, lighting and musicianship made the two shows I went to memorable.The DVD is coming out and I have pre-ordered it. Why? Because every time I hear Spirit of Radio I think of \\"That piece of garbage. That's not garbage, that is a Gefilter, an invention of musical genius\\" and get goose pimples.For you who have never had the pleasure of watching the Toronto Power Trio in action this DVD will the next best thing.

What a show the Canadian power trio puts on. This video has the amazing audience of Rush in Rio, and the quality of R30 and Snakes and Arrows Live. It all starts out with the humorous intro during the tour that reviews the history of a Canadian band named Rash. Then exploding on the stage with The Spirit of Radio the band and crowd are in perfect sync. Second is Time Stand Still which is what you what time to do while watching this DVD. The first set continues with songs old and new including old favorite Freewill and with drum fills that may even top Tom Sawyer the new BU2B. The second set includes all of Moving Pictures, Caravan, a Neil Peart drum solo, Closer to the Heart, 2112, and Far Cry. For the encore they play La Villa Strangiato and Working Man (My favorite version of it so far.) So as you can see if you are a huge fan of Rush or have just heard some of their songs on the radio this is a good investment of 3 hours and $20."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Recorded in Cleveland, this DVD is perhaps the best that Rush has offered in terms of video quality, stage theatrics and camera work. If you did not see Rush on the Time Machine tour, this is a highly accurate representation of what you could expect to see if you had. Objectively, the set list choice was a decent one and certainly one where classic numbers are going to be included, e.g. \\"Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"YYZ\\" and \\"Limelight\\". Therefore, if you were just watching this DVD, having never seen \\"Rush In Rio\\", \\"R30\\" or \\"Snakes and Arrows (Live)\\", it would be all brand new. Realistically, on the other hand, it is no different than seeing Rush in concert, 10 or 15 times.The musicianship is excellent and despite reports of Geddy having a cold that night, he delivered a very respectable performance for a highly demanding job. There was much more \\"looseness\\" and clowning around among the three during the show. I suspect that this was recorded at/towards the end of the tour, noting Alex mouthing \\"halfway\\" to Neil Peart during Subdivisions, which marked the halfway point in the show.Clearly, in this performance, Rush exemplified their love for not only their music and fans but the bond between them onstage/off. The comedy skits at the beginning of the DVD, intermission and end are all priceless. Everyone knows that Alex and Geddy can be pretty hysterical on their own....but this time, 'ol Elwood joins in on the fun. Yes, Mr. Peart, everyone knows that you did not lose your sense of humour in life and that you have been able to smile again...most likely because of The Blessed Event mentioned in Far and Away: A Prize Every Time... It is definitely a worthwhile experience to see Neil take part in this.Personally, if the set list was up to me, I would have diversified it a little more. Although I really liked \\"Camera Eye\\", parts of it that were recorded in the studio were just too complex to reproduce live on stage, without using a lot of sequenced parts. I would also say that nearly every album was covered but not all. I also think that Rush has....and this is only constructive criticism, overplayed some of these songs in the last four \\"live\\" albums because four out of the last five albums WERE \\"live\\"....There were two new tunes, BU2B and Caravan which were included on this DVD, which were pretty good. Hopefully, Rush will complete that new album soon and tour again.Another high note for this DVD and huge crowd in Cleveland is the diverse age range of Rush fans. There were many younger people there as well as people who grew up with Rush in their adolescence. It's remarkable to see just how many people have been touched by their music.I recommend this DVD and give it a high-five stars. If you wanted to see Rush on this tour but couldn't....or have just never seen them, you need to have this."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"After watching the Time Machine DVD, I was impressed once again with the band's unbelieveable musicianship. Rush is spot on musically here - I don't think their playing has ever really sounded better in all the time I've been going to see their shows. Some of the usual live Rush humor is there, but it's mostly contained within the \\"history of Rush\\" segments at the beginning and middle of the show. Unfortunately the characters from \\"I Love You, Man\\" don't show up at the end like at the show but this is a small detail.Highlights for me include Freewill, La Villa Strangiato, Leave That Thing Alone, and Caravan. Naturally there are plenty of good things to say about Moving Pictures, but most of them have been said already.The setlist is pretty aggressive, which is a definite credit to the band. I quite like the way Rush has been recording live performances as of late, which is to include the entire performance rather than to select certain songs for inclusion onto the album. Of course with that come a few rough edges, but that's to be expected sometimes. I saw Rush twice on this tour and Geddy sounded better vocally to me on those occasions than this one, but it's still an excellent momento of the tour.One thing I was not clear on is in the sound set up area of the dvd. It looks like you can choose between 5.1 and Dolby, but after you select one it doesn't really look like you've made a selection for sure. I'm sure it does what you tell it to do but it just seemed a little bit ambiguous to me.Overall, a great DVD...recommended."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"AWESOME CONCERT VIDEO!!! I was lucky enough to see this concert twice on their tour, including this live in Cleveland! The TIME MACHINE tour is the BEST Rush concert ever!!! Moving Pictures in its entirety is awesome along with all the rest of the set list!! Seeing Villa Strangiata played live is worth crossing the planet for in itself!! Turn it up, sit back, air drum and ROCK OUT to the holy trinity!!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I saw this show performed live in Boston, and was simply astounded that these guys can still go after all this time. In fact, this band seems literally ageless, and are arguably more popular than ever. This disc in particular highlights their popularity, as the boys played their most popular album, \\"Moving Pictures,\\" front to back, in addition to some new material never heard before.Obviously, one disc cannot fully capture the energy and excitement of seeing Rush live, but this disc is a close second. If you're reading this review, you probably are a Rush fan, anyway, and knowing Rush fans, you are probably considering buying it anyway, so I say go for it. But if you're simply a fan of music, and great live music in particular, you could do a lot worse than checking out this disc. It is an example of what great musicians can do, without crutches, without other ham-and-eggers joining them onstage. It is an absolute spectacle."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"A must for any RUSH FAN!!

Blu-ray vid through Oppo 93 and 60\\" plasma looks excellent. Very ...very good quality.My only complaint is that the song selection sucks! Coming from 40+ shows going back to Hemispheres I'm sick and tired of everything on MP but Camera Eye. Come on guys. Get rid of every \\"hit\\" and give us a B sides live. Please!It rocks, it's Rush. If you have a good blu ray player and sound system....buy it."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"The Time Machine tour was highlighted by the celebration of the Moving Pictures's CD 30th Anniversary. The band played the entire cd at the beginning of the second set. Also they decided to play back some songs that have not been play for a long time, like \\"Marathon\\" and \\"Time Stand Still\\". For the first time, we can hear the song \\"Presto\\", live. The rest of the set contains classics songs covering all the decades, including the two new songs; \\"BU2B\\" and Caravan\\". The playing of the entire Moving Pictures cd was a opportunity to hear for the first time in 30 years, \\"Camera Eye\\". But at the same time, we have to endure again the same songs that the bands put on all his tours, i am talking about \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\", who are favorites among the majority of fans, but not for me. The two new songs are not great songs, but had to be put on the set list here.For the performance, the band was full of energy, happy to be there, if we take a look at the cameras that was catching the looks and funny faces that each member through at each other, especially obvious in the song \\"Free Will\\", with Neil and Alex. The editing filming is excellent by giving us some camera shots at the right spot and at the right moment.The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is very good, maybe not as good as Snakes and Arrows, but this is not a issue here. The DTS-HD sound is excellent with a full surround sound and a clear mix of all instruments. As for the extras, it's rather short and not memorable. I would have prefer to see more recent footage instead of some old archives stuff where the picture quality is poor, like they did on Snakes and Arrows.So this Blu-Ray is excellent, because it's made by a great band that have survived together all these years with a impeccable musicianship. I can only be a little fussy about the set list, that's what happened when you listen too much to a band's music... Recommended!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I'll keep this brief since most other reviewers have touched on every aspect of what I am going to say. It's time that bands realize that if they are recording a concert intended to be released on Blu Ray, they NEED to have the audio mixed well and the video quality needs to be top-notch - is there really an excuse for that not to happen? There is no excuse for anything less, especially if we, the fans, are expected to pay Blu Ray prices.As for the performance, it is painfully obvious that Geddy is incapable of hitting those high notes anymore. Sometimes I would cringe because his voice was so strained and pitch was so off. I was perfectly happy with the musicianship of all the guys, but Geddy's (lack of) voice made this Blu Ray a 1-time-watcher for me."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"As a 50 year young RUSH fanatic, having seen them live 45 times in 4 states since 1977, I have come to expect a lot from Geddy, Alex, and Neil in terms of their music and their live concerts. This is one classic rock band that has raised the bar for many others in terms of their quality music, studio perfection, and killer live shows. This 'Live In Cleveland' show is no exception. It delivers in every way! There is the very humorous 'time machine' vignettes that are part of the live show, that are seamlessly intertwined with the live music, and the infectious smiles and banter between the band. The audience was 'on fire' and clearly enthused and entertained. The DVD editing is superb, with just the right dose of great closeups of the 3 maestros performing magic on their instruments, the animated audience, and whole stage and arena shots. There are also a few 'extras', mainly a vintage video of 'Anthem' being performed at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ way back in the stone ages, and out-takes and bloopers from the 'time machine' vignettes. If you like Rush, this is a 'must own'. If you don't like Rush, this is a 'must own' as well!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Rush is a strange phenomenon...and has been for decades. Whether you love or hate their music you can respect the band members as utterly talented instrumentalists who (publicly) mock themselves. Prog rock is always criticized as being \\"pretentious\\" but Rush turns that characterization on its head. They perform dazzling music while appearing to enjoy and laugh at it. Name me another band that is similar...The audience likely isn't quite aware of the skill required to perform at the level they do. To bake in the added humor only demonstrates more-so the fact that Geddy, Alex, and Neil are very humble folk with very uncommon talent.At nearly 60 years-old these guys energetically outperform their grand-kids.Live in Cleveland is a lesson in youth/aging we can all learn from. Remarkable."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I saw the Blu-Ray of this show last night. This was projected using a Panasonic theater-grade projector (the logo came up before the showtime) and the Blu Ray was the consumer version that will be released in December (I know this because the menu came up before the showtime). This review will be based on what I saw, and since I have no control over how that theater calibrated their projector, I cannot say with certainty if any of the flaws were due to the Blu Ray itself, or the projector/sound system. But here goes.Sound-wise, things don't start out that impressively, but get progressively better as the show progressed. At first the sound was a bit flat in terms of dynamics and a bit soft. The bass lacked punch, and I didn't feel like I was at the show, but watching a show. The sound was clean, I could hear no feedback or hiss, and I could hear the spaces between the sounds. Eventually the sound mixers at the concert must have made some corrections because the sound improved from \\"okay\\" to \\"very good\\", at least for a live concert. There wasn't any obnoxious use of sound imaging, just some ambient crowd noise, nothing flying from one speaker to the next. Instrumentally, Geddy's bass and Alex's guitars sounded the best--dynamic, never shrill or piercing. Solos aside, Neil's drums were just a tad undermixed--perhaps this was intentional as his drumming style can be so dominant. Overall, the sound level definitely got louder and louder as the concert progressed--several people remarked on it after the show.Picture wise this was excellent, but with a definite bias towards blue overall. Flesh tones looked as natural as they can under the \\"limelight\\". I saw no evidence of edge enhancement or processing, this was probably just directly loaded from the HD cameras without much interference. Some of the longest shots (and the occasional \\"blimp\\" shot) were of slightly lesser picture quality, but this could have more to do with the slow build-up of smoke in the venue. The opening and end credits were of low quality and jagged edges were visible. The non-concert film clips were pretty much perfect, with some minor smearing during intentionally hokey special effects segments involving the time machine tranformations.Overall, this was an exciting, involving show that had the theater crowd cheering along with the projected crowd. The sound started out iffy but steadily improved to very good. The picture is likely the best we have seen in a Rush concert so far."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"CHANGE TO DOLBY SETTING -- RUSH POSTED THE FIX!! Anyway I was so excited when I received my TIME MACHINE DVD as I had something new of RUSH to run to on the treadmill .. I had previously worn out Snakes & Arrows, A Show of Hands & Exit STage Left.. I know what you are thinking what about R30 or RIO - Well to me the sound on RIO is awful - not RUSH but what recorded them and I know the story of how RUSH didnt get a chance to do a sound check - R30 - ALEX is in a bad mood most of the show, GEDDY tries to get him out of it - and he doesnt until Red Barchetta - so to get back to the point TIME MACHINE is an amazing gem from THE greatest band of our time. ALEX LIFESON is just ridiculously funny!! When I put the DVD on and started it up - the mini movie at the beginning - ALEX as Slobowich &lt;sp>FARTED - OMG I almost fell off the treadmill laughing.. bruised my arm - but its all good... The Tom Sawyer cast video - RUSH is just too flipping funny - GEDDY spinning sticks, ALEX and NEIL goofing as the other.. too funny. It was also sweet to see GEDDY & ALEX flirt with girls in the audience and goof around with each other and NEIL- its just so cool to see that they are not just brilliant musicians and song writers but they really enjoy what they do and entertaining all of us... Yes I said Girls in the crowd - still to this day not sure why ALEX said RUSH has no female fans.. maybe as a challenge for us to come out of hiding.. Who knows.. All I do know that this is a fantastic DVD from the greatest band of our time.. you will NOT be disapointed..!!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Having been listening to RUSH since the first self-titled album RUSH, my first live show I watched them during the Signals tour 1981? I have caught every tour show since then as I have grown older and moved from Indy to KC now to Portland,with career and pursuit of happiness this band,its members never fail to inspire me in my personal goals as well as in my career goals to achieve as much happiness doing what I love more than any other type of input from people, books, or film. The crowds include so many people that truly value the musicianship , entertainment RUSH has always delivered equally and if not more than myself. Geddy's vocals are better than ever , Alex in particular on this tour really brings out his guitar master playing with some very cool classical guitars, and old acoustic folk instruments ( lead in on Closer to the Heart in particular). Neal as we have been so honored to always witness astounds us, with his drumming , deep thought lyrics , and what do you know the guys can act too ;)Funny Funny Funny Intro short films and Intermission Films I actually ordered this DVD because I new these comedy skits were on this so so worth it."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I wanted to wait for the Blu-ray version but I cannot imagine having better picture and/or sound quality than the DVD. I saw them at Madison Square Garden during this tour and they were fantastic. Watching the concert on this DVD they blew me away again. The 5.1 DTS version is magnificent. I haven't listened to the stereo version and I don't think I ever will, but I'm sure it is very good too. Rush = quality.If Amazon had 10 stars I would give it 10 stars. No need to describe the concert, others have done that already. The way they play music so intricate and complex is close to mayhem and disaster, yet song after song they nail it, while making it look easy. Chaos controlled!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"To start with: the sound and video quality is fine. But the booklet and bonus section is for he birds compared with the bonus material of RIR or R30 (DVD). What bugs me is nearly the same revolving set-list over the last 10 years of live performing. Joining Rush since Exit stage left, I never missed a show in my local hometown arena Frankfurt Festhalle in Germany. But I am afraid that Rush has lost a little bit of their creative musical spirit ending up after T4E era. Thereof excluded are the composition of >R30 Overture&lt; which is state of the art and the highly energetic instrumental >Malignant Narcissim&lt;.In the last decade of playing live, Rush was always focused on nearly the same stuff combining it with 2-4 songs of \\"new\\" material (here BU2B and Caravan). The latest shots of Red Barchetta, Camera Eye and Vital Signs are excellent, but Far Cry and Workin\` them Angels among others were just filmed on Snakes and Arrows before. And from my point of view >Stick it out&lt; and >Faithless&lt; are nothing to write mother home about if you think about the excellent and diversified track record 40years down the road (e.g. Manhattan Project, Territories, The Weapon, Analog Kid, Prime Mover, Test for Echo, Cut to the Chase etc.). Also a live performance of &lt;Where is my Thing?> would have be a great replacement for >Leave that thing alone&lt; which was already released on Different Stages and RIR.I know - all in all - it\`s always an individual issue. But one is for sure: I don\`t need CD and/or DVD compilations with nearly the same stuff again and again (see also release of >Working Man best of Rush Live&lt;) when there is such a huge and fantastic material existing. Songs which never had been played and/or released as live versions.It is hard to criticise an Icon, but I hope that there will be a real (!) change of the set-list some sunny day. Nevertheless, Rush still rocks ...!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"It was with mixed feelings that I awaited the delivery of my Blu-Ray of Time Machine 2011: Live In Cleveland. I had purchased the CD/MP3's from Napster the day it came out and was a bit underwhelmed. Geddy's vocals were a bit lacking and I thought that age had begun to caught up with him. I thought the CD was a fine momento for those who actually went to the show and little more. I had seen this show at the end of the first leg, and I thought the performance in West Palm Beach was better than what I was listening to on my I-pod.I gave that CD three stars basically saying that those who wanted a souvenir of the tour, it was worth the cash, but on it's own merits, there was better live versions of most of the songs out there. I still stand by that review. Many others as well reviewed the CD similarly so I know I'm not alone in that thought.My Blu-Ray arrived a week later. Ok, I thought, you know what it sounds like, but at least you'll like the visuals. My expectations were definitely lowered.I was blown away. Don't get me wrong, this is the exact same tracks that are on the CD's. There are a few seconds of dialog missing from the CD and the CD is broken up between Limelight and Camera Eye, whereas the Blu-ray keeps the intermission intact. I certainly can hear some of the same weaknesses that I heard on the CD. Time Stand Still has some cringe inducing moments. But for some reason, maybe it's the DTS surround mix, Maybe it's watching them play as well as listening to the content, but for whatever reason, Geddy's vocal weaknesses are not as apparant in the Blu-Ray as they are in the CD.I am not an audiophile by any means, so I can't really critique the \\"mix\\" or any other aspects others here may be able to critique more effectively.As a Rush fan, I simply love this Blu-Ray. I have both Rush in Rio and Snakes and Arrows Live on DVD. Rush in Rio is a great concert video but the camera shots are too short and don't seem to linger on the band long enough and seem almost random in their cut aways. Snakes and Arrows Live is a much better show. It's looks and sounds much better, though the crowd in Holland can't compare to 40,000 brazillians, however the Snakes and Arrows Setlist is not one of my favorites. The Time Machine tour show is simply amazing. The concert is filmed brilliantly and the shots are logically situated, focusing on a band member at the appropriate time. Whether it's Neil doing a fill-in, Alex doing a solo on the Mandolin, or Geddy performing a bridge on the synth, the camera tracks whatever band member is dominant at the time.Overall, his Blu-Ray provides a completely different experience than the CD. I'll continue to listen to the CD as it is a portable version of this fine show. But as far as an over all experience this Blu-Ray just blows the CD and most other Rush Concerts I've seen filmed out of the water. So much so, that I barely notice that Geddy is not at his prime vocally. Musically, the band here is in top form.If you went to this show then you'll want to pick up both the CD and the Blu-Ray/DVD as you'll want a portable version of this show to listen to in the concert, or while working out, or wherever you are.However if you only want to buy one version of this show, then this Blu-Ray is the only way to go. It is amazing. And finally, if you already purchased the CD and were somehow disappointed, then I suggest you buy the video. It's hard to figure out but it's on a magnitude better than than the audio only version. Someone tell me I'm wrong. I just can't believe that I'm listening to the same performance. And yet there it is, the Blu-Ray/DVD blows the CD out of the water and I have no idea why.A definite must have!!!!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I've seen Rush many times over the years and they have never disappointed.

I still think that RUSH is the best Rock band ever.This DVD disapoints me. The venue is less attractive, The cinematography and editing seems to have been done without any real heart into it. The songs rush through with what seems to me like haste. At one point Alex nods to Neil that they are half way. Like they can't wait for the concert to finish! Rush seems less professional.

He has to strain to hit the high notes that were a constant for him years ago. 2nd, both Alex and Neil are showing their age and their limitations that come with it.

I have always loved Rush's music, even if I didn't agree with the lyrics and (lack of) beliefs. However, let me tell you, this concert DVD was more than enough to win me, or any other serious music fan, over time and time again. From 'Faithless' to 'Marathon', the sheer skill, intensity, and joy in playing the music just radiates off all three of the boys throughout the DVD's setlist. The chops are as solid as ever, the synths and guitars sound the best they ever have, and Neil's performance is simply stellar throughout. During the concert, it's so great to see Geddy and Alex interact with each other, Neil, and the audience. They create this kind of energy that lets you KNOW that they are the best rock'n roll band in the world.My only problem with the DVD was (just as it was in the concert) are the Time Machine themed movie shorts. I never quite get Rush's quirks or humor; maybe it's just me. It was simply a let down for me, I suppose. It's true that their music and lyrics and sophisticated enough that the movies serve as a sort of 'comic relief', but it just doesn't work for me. I actually liked the seemingly stoic (well, relatively speaking) A Show of Hands VHS and DVD. Having said all of this, if you are into Rush's humor, then the Time Machine DVD will not disappoint.The sound and quality of the DVD seem reasonable. I played the DVD through a 42\\" HDTV without surround sound, so I cannot make too many comments about the technical merits of the DVD. The concert presentation of lighting seemed very, very good; just being able to see the gear and Geddy, Alex, and Neil's hadn and foot work, respectively, made for the best visuals. Again, though, I was not into most of the concert backdrop visuals, aside for those for maybe Subdivisions. The Moving Pictures figures just seem odd.Thanks to this DVD and my memories of the 2010 tour, I just can't say enough good things about Rush."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"A maior banda de rock progressivo do mundo.

You get the best of Rush side by side with songs that you would like to fast-forward through.Truly, Rush are a nostalgia band. Seeing them on the Snakes and Arrows tour, I thought it was an hour too long.But, the band is doing what they should be doing - touring new material, otherwise they wouldn't have much reason to continue.Go see them live and buy the Blu-Ray to see the close-ups of what you may have missed.

I wish I'd been at Cleveland to see this show. It's a great set. The only Rush Shows I've seen lately have been at Red Rocks, so Snakes and Arrows twice and Time Machine twice. If you're a Rush fan and you haven't heard the audience recordings of the Time Machine shows at Red Rocks, you're missing out on some treats. I've read the critical comments by other reviewers here and I see it differently. Great performance, great A/V. Is it like a studio recording? Of course not! Rush has processes they use when writing that can give a certain snap-shot view of a song that very well might have progressed by the time it gets to your local venue. During the Time Machine tour, you could hear it by listening to Caravan from the studio with what it had become by the time they reached Denver. It was alive! You simply have to see Rush live - and often. People have been reported to behave inappropriately if deprived of their Rush fix. Get this and laugh a little, smile a lot.

Very disappointed, I am trying to find another manufacturer to buy this from."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I've been a Rush fan since 1976 (yes I'm that old!) and, like everyone, my outlook on life has changed considerably during the intervening years.Having always been an admirer of their musicianship, song writing and arranging skills, they are the only band/artist that I've kept up with and really listened to consistently. Sure, I still listen on the odd occasion to AC/DC (I mean, that's an exciting sound when the time is right!), but on the whole I've left bands like KISS, Judas Priest, Saxon, and Iron Maiden behind many years ago. So, that's a little background, now on to this DVD...Rush very rarely put together new collections of material these days. There is the forthcoming album \\"Clockwork Angels\\" to come, but I'll get to that a little later (albeit in a short form as it's not due out until May apparently).They have toured a lot in recent years though. \\"Vapor Trails,\\" \\"R30,\\" \\"Snakes & Arrows,\\" and now \\"Time Machine\\" were all very successful jaunts and Rush have become one of the hardest working bands around and fair play to them for that. They are taking their music to the masses like never before and are experiencing a renaissance as a result. Good for them.I don't have a problem with the amount of DVDs they put out either. I think it's great that fans who couldn't make the concerts have a chance to see the show, even though it's through camera lenses. After all, to get to see the gig you missed over and over is a great trade-off for just under $20, right? Of course it is.What I have a problem with is the attitude coming from the band these days. \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" was musically one of their best ever. Producer Nick Raskulinecz had Rush playing how most Rush fans had been yearning for them to play for years. It was a nod to \\"Hemispheres\\" (that chord!!), \\"Permanent Waves\\" (the end of \\"Far Cry\\" continues, for me at least, to remind me of the ending of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\") and almost made it to the heights of \\"Moving Pictures.\\" Almost.Lyrically, it was pretty angry, but not pretty. Neil Peart's lyrics have often come in for a bashing over the years. \\"2112\\" was called \\"crypto-facist\\" by a moron at the NME, and have been called various unsavoury names by countless journalists who have long since embraced obscurity. Rush have kept on rolling unabated as has Peart.The lyrics on \\"S&A;\\" were a vicious broadside at religion (but mainly Christianity). Peart has become an acolyte of British, and long since discredited anti-intellectual atheist bigot Richard Dawkins, (and I say discredited because someone who peddles hatred like that immediately loses any argument they may have had - and millions of atheists are completely embarrassed by his vile nonsense). Even the new album, by all accounts, is lyrically along the same kind of lines.So, it's a shocking development, that Peart has \\"come out,\\" as it were, in such a nasty way (on his blog he even mentions the pathetic \\"skygod\\" epithet...never thought he was a childish name-caller, but there you go). He always seemed like such a reasonable man, willing to take all things into consideration and give space to things he didn't agree with. That is obviously not the case, that's if it ever was at all.But, finally, on to this DVD. On the special feature section there is another particularly telling moment of how ugly Peart has become in his elitism and crushing dislike of all things he doesn't agree with or like.During a humourous intro video (Gershon's Haus of Sausage looks like a must-visit to me!), part of the script stood out as nothing more than a childish aside by Peart. During various versions of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" (including a a pretty groovy 70s disco version), there is a country version. Geddy Lee's character rolls his eyes, but after \\"Rash\\" (the pretend house band in the video intro) finishes that version, Peart utters the sentence \\"music for morons.\\" Unfortunately, this is typical of Neil Peart these days. He has fast become a man that dismisses entire swathes of populations as \\"morons\\" or \\"stupid\\" because they believe in certain things or listen to certain music.Over the years, I have listened to country music and enjoyed some of it. I listen a lot to Alison Krauss & Union Station, Faith Hill, and many others. So, the questions begged Neil are: Am I a moron? Is everyone that listens to country morons?There is a nasty elitism that Peart is infected with. He obviously feels, as does the rest of the band (or they wouldn't allow these lyrics and attitude to stand), that anyone who doesn't buy into their belief system is a \\"moron.\\" It's inarguable as it's right there in front of us, in colour, front and centre and it's big time ugly and bigoted (and I feel so sad about it, but it can no longer be denied or ignored).The performances on this DVD are fine, but not spectacular, efficiency personified. Yes, I know, I've left it long enough to talk about the performances (great to see \\"The Camera Eye\\" performed again after so many years, and it's a stand-out for sure), but certain things needed to be said, so I said them.As for the next CD, I'll have to hear it before buying it (and that's never happened to me before with Rush). Quite frankly, however, I'm sick of being insulted for my beliefs, as well as my likes and dislikes because they don't line up with Neil Peart's or the rest of the band.I'm probably going to get hammered by the Rush Patrol for this (\\"don't feed the troll,\\" \\"you don't have to buy Rush products\\" yada yada), but I expect nothing less. Or maybe I should say, I expect nothing more.Some of you will disagree with me vehemently, and I support your right to do so. Some of you may even agree with me, but you will be few and far between. I'm off to listen to Alison Krauss now, as a fully paid-up, card-carrying member of the \\"Moron Club\\" should.

And 16 more that we've seen a few times. Six of these tunes have appeared on at least 4 other Rush DVDs. This makes appearance #7 for Spirit of Radio and Tom Sawyer. This is what happens when you release a complete show to DVD. You wind up including all the hits that have to be played on nearly every tour. Just once I'd like to see them make a DVD focusing on deep tracks and avoid the classic songs that have appeared so many times already. Time Stand Still and Stick It Out are great choices. Now how about great songs like Tai Shan, Nobodys Hero, How It Is or Chain Lightning?

Cleveland was the perfect setting to shoot the film in and I am indebted to Rush for choosing the location, even though it is smaller than most large metropolitan areas, as in New York or L.A.The concert itself was simply fantastic. Moving Pictures was played all the way through and the rest was an awesome mash up of greatest hits, fan favorites and the newest singles material. Neil, Alex, and Geddy were astounding as always.

I must have been oblivious to Geddy Lee's vocal performance in that show - I just didn't notice anything different from any of his other performances in the past. Well, when I first played this live set, I was immediately aware of an ugh-factor in the vocal \\"talent\\" of Mr. Lee. Yikes. I know Geddy has never been the prototypical lead singer, with the soaring voice and expansive range. But we Rush fans had grown accustomed to his banshee-like shrieks over the years and appreciated his window of ability that was uniquely his own. Sadly, those days are over. Now, he simply sounds like and old man who has lost what he once had and is still trying to hit those high notes again. I really want to love this cd set. Moving Pictures is a classic album, played complete for the first time ever on tour. I love the song Camera Eye, as well as the two new tracks from their next album (if they ever finish it) Clockwork Angels. I want this to be musical perfection. Unfortunately, due to the embarrassing efforts of a certain lead singer, it isn't. Rush fans - take heed. This is not the same Rush we grew up with.

Not shure what happed as most of the same people who did S&A; did this recording, except that Alex was Not involved in the mix of Time Machine. The recording lacks dynamics, air, and the detail. If S&A; was the 2nd row vantage point sonically, Time Machine is row 57. Neil makes sounds w/o impact or dynamics, his set sounds glazed over, processed & compresed & distant. However Alex guitiars sounds good and retains dynmaics & edge.Cant recommend given the much better sounding S&A; made just a few yr ago, it also has better non moving picture song selection than time machine.What happeded from a audio production standpoint?. Does anyone know? . video ,who cares rush was never a visual band & I would trade off a bad video production for better sound quality any day.Rush time machine tour was highlighted by playing the entire Moving pictures record, which was the main draw for many of the die hard fans who finally had a chance hear the camera eye & vital signs, which are some of rush's best songs but rarely played since 1982 live.Unfortunately inorder to get to the best part of the show fans had to endure awful songs like bu2b & faithless, leave that thing alone, stick it out & other questionable selections. At the same time no songs were played from P/G and one song from power windows.However the torture will not need to be repeated on the blu-ray as fans can now FF over the dreck to the good parts of the show, and since they just released S&A; blu-ray a few ys ago one can combine the two into one real best of show."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Short & Sweet: The video quality is terrible. I know there may be a lot of smoke in Cleveland, but not as much as this video shows. During the dark passages from afar in the arena you can see some king of \\"Matrix\\" like effect in the background of the picture. It looks like it was already ripped to Xvid and posted to the web then upconverted to DVD. I can't wait to see the Blu-ray version.

I did see several concerts there while I lived in Cleveland (Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins, The Who, Tom Petty, Roger Waters), but those arena shows are all the same.

Yet Rush has capitalized on the USA and here we have them paying homage to the hometown who gave them their start. Well how unselfish of the three of you to acknowledge that the very people who have made you rich (people like me),don't ever deserve a begging hand or someone with a bleeding heart who will only cry out for more.So keep on living for yourselves,as there is no one more worth living for and keep sucking the money with live albums and DVD's that keep Geddy collecting baseball goodies and Alex purchasing golf courses and I am sure that Neil needs another fleet of BMW's or motorbikes.After all we are just the working men you claim should just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and yet spend a whole weeks pay for a concert ticket!Why don't you all,Take off to the great white north and stay there.Former rush fan................."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Watching the rock band Rush in concert is a very entertaining, enjoyable experience.

This is the fourth Rush DVD I've purchased and I'm FINALLY happy with the audio quality.I'm running a new Yamaha 5.1 receiver, Polk 12\\" subwoofer & center speakers, Carver Amazing Loudspeakers for fronts and huge Pioneer \\"old school\\" speakers for rears. Needless to say, I would upset the neighbors if I wasn't hunkered down in my theater room downstairs.If you want a Rush DVD to give you the \\"I was there\\" look and sound, this is it.All the other Rush DVD's lacked true low-end bass, but not this one.I'm only about an hour into it and can't wipe the cheese-eating grin off my face.N-Joy!"},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"My love of Rush began with Hemispheres, so I have seen and heard it all. I just saw the theatrical release of this movie and it's a step up from the quality of their concert films of late. It's always boggled my mind that a band that has cut such a definitive and noteworthy swath for themselves has really dropped the ball when it comes to their concert films. In general, the editing seems to follow the lyrics instead of the music. While there are many parts that cut to the appropriate member for their requisite riff/solo/transition, there were at least 4 times where they cut away from Neil's full riff. Even when they stayed on the appropriate member for their riff, why do they feel the need to cut to a different (often inferior) angle right in the middle of it? There's some comfort in the fact that we know Neil's solo will get center stage, but the camera work in general is not superior. Overall the cutting is too \\"energetic\\", and I'd love to see a cut of a concert film that lingers a bit longer here and there instead of succumbing to MTV editing.There are many great moments on this disk, though. I counted numerous goosebumps, and I got particular pleasure from the shot of kids in the audience who really seem to be enjoying themselves. There's a special magic about the band that comes from almost 40 (!) years of following their hearts, and that energy comes through in their performance. There are some spectacular moments here, chief among them the jam on Working Man in the encore. While the guys may have thickened a bit over the years, there's no other band that rocks as hard and as true as these guys. Also, their newer material comes across particularly well, probably since it's more within their current habits and vocal ranges. BU2B and Caravan are both blistering. But old standards sound great, with Freewill and Subdivisions really shining. Honestly I could have done without parts of Moving Pictures, like The Camera Eye, but since this was a historical inclusion, there it is. Witch Hunt was surprisingly solid, and the lyrics fit now more than ever).If you love the band, you'll likely love this movie. There are also some very entertaining bumpers featuring the band (it makes so much sense that Neil is the cop) and a couple of very funny \\"oom-pa\\" versions of Rush songs.I'd always give 5 stars to the band, but this video gets 3-1/2."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"Excellent production, great concert.

Lots here to love for fans including the coolest steam-punk stage set-up. Neil's drum kit is BEAUTIFUL!! I want to own it & I'm not even a drummer. I first saw Rush in 1977(I'd already been a fan for a couple of years) & lastly in 2011,a span of 34 years so the Time Machine theme seemed so very appropriate to me. I love the acting bits they work the concert around. Priceless stuff, especially for those of us who where fans from the start. The complete Moving Pictures? Great idea.Wonderful idea.Next tour please do Signals(or 2112, or Presto, or...). Better yet just keep touring(& making blu-rays)till you do them all!

A long time ago, some decades to be precise, I discovered this band. How could only three skinny guys from Canada play so loud? As mentioned by Jack Black in the documentary \\"Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" released in 2010, the opening track of that first album is a killer song. And I agree. As for this concert, which I had the chance to experience when they came to Sao Paulo, Brazil, it is espectacular! Professionalism taken to the extreme level, with a generous amount of light and sound! Experience the RUSH hour. Better, make it almost three hours and be delighted. This DVD is a must buy."},{"Title":"Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland (Blu-ray + XL \\"Rash\\" T-Shirt Box Set) [Blu-ray]","review":"I'm a huge Rush fan...so I'm going to totally ignore the entire issue of whether Rush really needs to put out a concert DVD & CD after every tour. As far as I'm concerned, the answer is YES. If you're NOT a fan, why would you care how many they produce. And if you ARE a fan, you're probably a big fan...and thus, the more the merrier.So how does TIME MACHINE compare to RUSH IN RIO, RUSH 30 and SNAKES AND ARROWS? Well, each of those prior releases had issues. RIO had some very sketchy sound mix issues, particularly in the early going...but it also beautifully capture the enthusiasm of that giant crowd. The set list was very nice as well...I'm always happy to have \\"Natural Science!\\" The 30th anniversary show is, IMO, the weakest of the bunch...partially because the show is incomplete (no \\"Between the Wheels!!\\") and partially because the German audience is lackluster at best. SNAKES AND ARROWS was of excellent quality, but for me, the set list was not the strongest. I'm not a huge fan of \\"Spindrift\\" or \\"Armor & Sword.\\"TIME MACHINE has a primarily very solid sound mix. Occasionally, there are issues, such as the nearly missing guitar in the opening third of TOM SAWYER...but overall, it's very good. Geddy's vocals are spotty...on \\"Temples of Syrinx\\" he is pretty much unintelligible. I understand the high notes he hit in the \`70s are tough now (aren't they for all of us who were in high school at that time!), but it's still a bit unpleasant to listen to. On the other hand, more current work such as \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Faithless\\" really showcase Geddy very nicely.So from a quality standpoint, TIME MACHINE is right up there with the best of the other shows. So what about the set? Here is where TIME MACHINE really wins the 5 stars, in my opinion. First of all, the complete MOVING PICTURES? Are you kidding me? If you saw the show live, perhaps you got chills like I did when \\"Camera Eye\\" started, finally, after all these years. What a great 45 minutes of concert-going that all way. And the discs have captured it very well. Other great choices to hear include \\"Presto\\" and the under-rated but fantastic \\"Marathon.\\" And having \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" is always a huge plus, in my book, and they knock it out of the park. They also have some good reggae fun with \\"Working Man\\"...more than in the past, so that was a treat too. The only minor grumble I have is that Neil's drum solo isn't as exciting as some in the past . (Don't get me wrong, he's still a miracle-worker.)So the above commentary works for the CD (which I own), the DVD and the blu ray (which I own.) I was going to post in the CD section, but now it appears that a posting to the CD also ends up with the bluray and vice versa. So, here's additional thoughts on the blu ray: it's great! Great visuals (Rush's light show has never looked better on video) and outstanding sound. I wish the bonus materials included the show finale with Paul Rudd and Jason Segal reprising their I LOVE YOU MAN characters, but I hear there were contractual things preventing that. Otherwise, you might be amused at some truly vintage videos from the early \`70s of Rush performing \\"Anthem\\" (why don't they bring THAT song back to their set list!) and \\"Need Some Love.\\" Also, watch through the closing credits of the concert to see and hear a Polka version of \\"Closer to the Heart.\\" Hilarious!So that's my humble opinion of Rush's latest offering. If you love this band, you already own this anyway, I'm guessing. So all I can say is: Not in the Rock \`n' Roll Hall of Fame?? Are you kidding me!?!?!"},{"Title":"Boots & Saddles or Life in Dakota with General Custer.","review":"Althought the opinions of Custer and life with the calvary are viewed through (very) rosy glasses, Mrs. G.A. Custer is a witty and prolific writer. She also gives little-known insight into everyday happenings in life on the prairie and how women survived the journey. Particularly interesting are the dynamics of relationships between women when living literally in the middle of nowhere, surviving the harshest of climates, with few friends, the same friends, for extended times. Also interesting is the relationship between people of color and the white soldiers. Custer is an enigma, and readers should read this book but also others (&quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; is the best thus far) to get a glimpse at the man. Libby Custer falls into poetic verse at times, but this can be refreshing - there are not many writings of women in these times available."},{"Title":"Boots & Saddles or Life in Dakota with General Custer.","review":"This is the first of three books George Armstrong Custer's widow Elizabeth Bacon Custer (EBC hereafter) wrote about her life with the General. It begins with Custer and the 7th being assigned to North Dakota, and ends with the expedition which led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. EBC is a good writer within the limitations of the \\"style\\" of 1880s-1890s nonfiction. One has to allow for the fact that for her, G. A. Custer was the tallest, strongest, smartest, wittiest, bravest and most omnicompetent man alive. [It's worth pointing out that she often also describes all the troopers riding with Custer as \\"physically perfect, absolutely splendid specimens of manhood in its prime.\\"] Also following the style of the period, EBC almost entirely omits the names of those she writes about. But otherwise her word-portrait of the life of an officer's wife in the utter desolation of the frontier forts during the Plains Indian Wars is effective, vivid and often moving.There are so many good stories here I don't want to spoil any by hinting at them. The most famous is EBC's account of \\"Old Nash,\\" a Mexican laundress who earned several small fortunes with her expert sewing and tailoring, was much sought-after as a marriage partner despite her dark complexion and broad shoulders, and who turned out to be the best midwife around... despite....A few of the many things that impressed me with EBC's powers of observations--- When the great chiefs and warriors of the plains came to visit Custer, she noted that they (contrary to modern stereotype) were physically almost completely undeveloped, with geek-like pipestem arms... and she understood the reason: that males among the Plains indians did essentially no physical labor whatsoever. Another fine passage involves the relationship between Custer and his favorite indian scout, the famous Bloody Knife. According to EBC Bloody Knife was relentlessly sarcastic concerning the skills and abilities of white men, and Custer in particular. When on a hunting expedition with Custer, Bloody Knife would keep up a running narrative of belitting remarks concerning Custer's unfamiliarity with and incompetence with firearms. As soon as Custer got off a good shot, Bloody Knife would fall silent and express his admiration with a brief smile, which Custer obviously treasured far more than many sentences of insincere and overdone flattery. It reminds me a bit of a comment supposedly made by Wyatt Earp about his great friend Doc Holliday: \\"He can always make me laugh!\\"There is no gossip about Custer's notoriously poor relations with many of the other officers and men of the 7th Cavalry. EBC defends this by saying that Custer deliberately did not tell her of feuds and enemies, because he wanted her as hostess to treat all members of the 7th with equal courtesy. However, this excuse is contradicted within the book by extracts from letters written to her by Custer, which refer to feuds and enemies in ways that would have made no sense if EBC were not fully informed,Recommended for anyone curious about the life of Cavalry officers, troopers and their families on the \\"rim of empire\\" in the 1870s."},{"Title":"Boots & Saddles or Life in Dakota with General Custer.","review":"There are so few well written and personally lived books about the people of the northern great plains, but this is one of them.

Same goes for the dozens of Web Design Firms he cites as success stories (Most were bought by companies like IXL, USWeb (Which became MarchFirst), Homestore and where all know where these have ended up.I could continue about the lack of flow or organization in the book itself but I feel the description of lack of useful content is plenty for this review.

Consider this book the antithesis to such &quot;get rich quick&quot; manuals. It focuses on real issues that should be handled while building a profitable internet business. The chapter &quot;Planning Your Business&quot; was particularly helpful with its twelve steps in starting a business.

That may be so, but his examples -- a computer that can beat the world's best Othello player, automated underwriting of consumer loans -- are less than persuasive because they deal with relatively simple problem sets (winning a game based on probability, making a loan based on a few easily defined credit characteristics). The profile of a successful startup contains many, many hard-to-quantify attributes (including luck) and they are often mutually exclusive. For example, as an investor do you look for a charismatic CEO like Steve Jobs or a reclusive techno-genius like Seymour Cray? The answer is both. I suspect we're a long way away from a reasonably reliable system for predicting startup success. (Witness the stock market, where the majority of professional fund managers fail to outperform the averages even though they have a wealth of data and modeling technologies at their disposal.)But this is just a quibble, and an irrelevant one at that.

The art is quite nice, and although the book is not fully explicit (like a Manara)the scenes are well executed (albeit brief). There is also a great deal of humor which is properly pulled off and won't leave the reader hanging (unlike Manara, on occasions).

Luckily for him, Galipettois a first-class carpenter that makes his living carving toys. Using a tree that collapsed into his shack, Galipetto creates a wooden woman.

Galipetto learns about this amazing transformation when Pinocchia, nude but for shoes and an apron, brings Galipetto breakfast and asks if he is her papa.Some local police stop by and ask if anything is damaged after the storm, to find a nearly nude woman rushing from the back room, and hugging her \\"papa.\\" The police take them to jail.While in jail, Pinocchia, nude but for a mutating coat (one minute a green coat, the next a green dress), ends up going down on one of the men there in jail. As the police do not have anything on Pinocchia, they release her, but keep Galipetto in jail. So, the barely clothed woman wanders down the street and is picked up by a man in a car.The man takes her to a party, where a woman helps Pinocchia change clothes (and who ends up fondling Pinocchia). While the women are otherwise occupied, two men peer into the room, and eventually lead Pinocchia away from the party and, at the first opportunity, prostitute her. The rascals run off with Pinocchia's pay, and without leaving her any money to pay the hotel bill. While Pinocchia begins to \\"pay\\" for the room with her mouth, the hotel owner's wife runs in and spanks Pinocchia with a wooden object. Pinocchia flees the hotel.In the meantime, Galipetto is released and he wanders along in his night clothes, attempting to return home. Along the way he ends up at the same house Pinocchia wandered up to and entered after she fled the angry wife. While his creation is screwing around with a man up on the second floor, Galipetto is offered the position of gardener. The gardener was just fired and thrown off the premises for sleeping with the maid.Running away from an attempted forced and unwanted bath, Galipetto runs across his Pinocchia, who has reverted to wooden status. Galipetto \\"revives\\" her, is caught . . . and the tail continues its twists and turns for another 25 pages (and in those 25 pages? visit to a circus, underwater brothel on a submarine . . .).In the Pinocchio story, there was a certain punishment rendered upon him when he lied (his nose grew). Well, in this case, when Pinocchia lies, her breasts grow (and she doesn't lie, apparently, until after page 35; though, at one point she purposely lies to save herself in the water, and ends up with massive breasts).Overall, a very good little graphic novel, with great artwork and a good pace. The book includes a small amount of bondage, a small amount of whipping, and a certain amount of public nudity . . .The kind of book that leads one to want to read more by these authors, but unfortunately, I haven't found anything else by them."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Fitness: It's Amazing What a Dumbbell Can Do","review":"As the owner of both this book and \\"The Great Dumbbell Handbook\\", I recommend the latter book, and strongly recommend against buying this book.By my count, the main exercise description section of this book contains approximately 30 exercises, and the main exercise description section of \\"The Great Dumbbell Handbook\\" contains approximately 45 exercises. Some of the dumbbell exercises that I regularly do, such as the Shoulder Shrug, and the Deadlift (and more) are not included in this book.The formatting of the exercise description section of this book is a disorganized mess. It's common for an exercise description to begin at the bottom of one page and continue on the next page, and sometimes there is a page turn in between the two sections. The photographs that accompany the exercises are poorly organized, and sometimes inappropriately placed.As one example, the description of the Leg Curl starts in the middle of one page. Below the description of the Leg Curl are two photographs of Lunges. To view photographs of the Leg Curl, you have to turn the page.As another example, the description of the Single-Dumbbell Triceps Extension begins at the bottom of one page. You turn the page, and at the top of the page are two photographs of the (double-dumbbell) Triceps Extension. Below the photographs of the (double-dumbbell) Triceps Extension is the rest of the description of the Single-Dumbbell Triceps Extension, and photos of that exercise.Rather than being labeled by exercise name, the photographs are labeled by number, such as Figure 2-5, Figure 2-6, etc.In at least one case, the photographs do not match the exercise. The photos that accompany the Seated Bent-Over Lateral Raise are of the Standing Bent-Over Lateral Raise. To make matters worse, the text states \\"Performing this exercise in a standing position places too much stress on the back.\\" The end result is that the book contains two photographs of the unsafe-version of the exercise, and no photographs of the safe-version of the exercise.In my opinion, compared to this book, \\"The Great Dumbbell Handbook\\" offers more exercises, better exercise descriptions, bigger and better exercise photographs, and vastly better organization and formatting. \\"The Great Dumbbell Handbook\\" even does a better job of discussing the pros and cons solid hexagon dumbbells versus adjustable dumbbells."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Fitness: It's Amazing What a Dumbbell Can Do","review":"First of all, this book looks like it was photocopied instead of printed.

Perseverance is Tess' strongest trait"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles, by Thomas Hardy, is a wonderful novel, which tragically and poignantly follows the ill-fated life of its heroine, Tess Durbeyfield. Through his exquisite use of imagery, his reflection of Tess in nature, and the continuing thread of tragedy which he weaves throughout the novel, Hardy is able to present to us one of the most memorable figures in English literature. Despite her sincerity and integrity, Tess is forever destined for disappointment, and Hardy's immensely lucid and descriptive writing allows the reader to appreciate this. I would recommend this tremendous piece of fiction to any readers interested in reading the work of a brilliant Victorian author, or for those who appreciate the paradox of sadness and beauty represented in the figure of a strong protagonist."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy employs nature as a tool in helping him depict and develop the tragic nature of his protagonist, Tess. At least two aspects of nature are central to achieving this end: First of all is the establishment of a correlation between Tess's mental state and natural settings. Second, the use of natural phenomena as a prediction of Tess's own fate. Hardy has fully exploited the use of nature to illustrate that Tess is the victim of her uncontrollable and predetermined Fate.Hardy establishes from the beginning the notion that the world is a mere &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; (Hardy 101). One can, therefore, deduce from this &quot;fact&quot; that nature, as it is seen through Tess's eyes, is only the physical image of Tess's inner emotions during a particular period of time. It is during the intercepting period between her devastating seduction by Alec and her encounter with her future husband, Angel, that Tess feels most deje! cted. &quot;The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary&quot; (Hardy 100). Indeed, Mother Nature is the only place where Tess can attain &quot;absolute mental liberty&quot; from all her worldly troubles (Hardy 100) and where she can find her peace of mind.After her seduction by Alec, Tess gathers her strengths, recollects herself, and starts a new life as a milkmaid in a quiet countryside at a farm called Talbothays. This is a deliberate attempt on Tess's part to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of another event on such a castatrophic scale. Now, working closely with nature (cows to be specific), she has succeeded in &quot;shunning mankind&quot; (Hardy 101), and truly believes that she is laying a new foundation for her future (Hardy 124). Surrounded by serene natural settings, this &quot;fresh and virginal daughter of Nature&quot; (Hardy 137) finds tranquillity in her surroundi! ngs despite the fact that she is in the midst of misery. In! Tess's eyes, nature is beautiful because it brings her joy-- and because it is where she belongs to.Angel comes from a very religious and educated family. Although he would never think of &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity for religion (Hardy 284), he is in actuality a very convention-bound individual. The moral code and the &quot;arbitrary law of society&quot; (Hardy 297) that accompany religion are deeply rooted in Angel's thinking. His presence at Talbothays disturbs the natural settings with the social customs he brings into the village &quot;which had no foundation in nature&quot; (Hardy 297). Hardy introduces Angel into the novel in order to signal a transition in Tess's life. Unfortunately, it is a transition for the worse. From this point on, as Tess' and Angel's relationship grows, Tess's relationship with nature, which has come to symbolize all that is good for her, has declined in proportion. Tess has allowed her relationship with the society (Angel) to take prec! edence over that with nature (by falling in love with and marrying Angel).&quot;Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer, as a lover&quot; (Hardy 368). Angel's passion for Tess in the summer does not carry beyond its boundary. Tess's dream of a happy life is shattered into a thousand pieces when her worst nightmare comes true-- Angel is unable to accept her past. As Tess's mental state changes, so does her perception of nature. The beautiful scenery at her once cherished village of Talbothays is no more. &quot;The gold of the summer picture was now grey, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold&quot; (Hardy 269). In the place which Tess had once thought of as a place of rebirth after her disastrous experience with Alec, she now sees only the dullness and helplessness of a dead winter. Tess's view of nature is purely perceptual. What should have been natural-- fallen leaves and bare tree branches-- have become depre! ssing and unpleasant. These natural phenomena are, in truth! , nothing more than physical manifestations of her sadden and broken heart. Nature has taken on a melancholy outlook not because it is indeed melancholy but because Tess is projecting feelings upon it. This is Hardy's so-called &quot;psychological phenomenon.&quot;Another important method besides relating Tess' feelings with natural phenomena is the use of imagery to mirror Tess's own fate. In two instances, long before the end of the novel, the stage for the final act of Tess's life has already been inauspiciously set up. In the first instance, Tess is symbolized by different animals being hunted down in a field :&quot;[U]naware of the ephemeral nature of their (the animals') refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day, when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together... till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks! and stones of the harvesters&quot; (Hardy 103).Hardy speaks of &quot;doom that awaited them later in the day&quot;; Tess knows exactly what awaits her. &quot;She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day&quot; (Hardy 212). Tess, like these animals, is unable to defend herself from the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Tess's attempt to escape her fate in her &quot;refuge&quot; (Talbothays) proves to be futile. Without any question, Angel and Alec are the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Although they do not kill Tess in a physical sense, they must bear the responsibility of forcing her into the &quot;horrible narrowness.&quot; What is this &quot;horrible narrowness&quot;? It is the only option left for Tess to liberate herself once and for all from her past-- the killing of Alec (Hardy 406). Tess has done just that; and this is the fatal act t! hat destroy not only her past, but also her own ephemeral e! xistence.In the second instance, Hardy presents to the readers, in a graver tone, an even gloomier setting in which Tess is symbolized by pheasants-- also being hunted down: &quot;Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-- all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more&quot; (Hardy 296).One must admit that this scene best reflects and symbolizes the horrible experience Tess has gone through in the whole novel-- her struggle for survival, her indescribable agony, and finally, her &quot;luck&quot; that nature is unable to sustain her painful existence any longer. Hardy notes that the hunter of these birds has a &quot;blood-thirsty light in [his] eyes&quot; (Hardy 296). He is, however, civil and gentle for most! of the year-- except in autumn and winter (Hardy 296). This is where the change of seasons takes part in Hardy's shaping of a predetermined fate for Tess. Angel is &quot;civil and gentle&quot; to Tess during summer; but one also must also note that his rejection of her comes during winter. One can fairly say that Hardy leaves his readers no other choice but to convict Angel as the killer of Tess. He presents the end of Tess in his bloody account of the pheasants. In doing so, Hardy has revealed the unshakable destiny of his protagonist.Hardy is able to make use of his materialization of both the mental and fatalistic elements in the novel through his clever descriptions of nature to draw a portrait of a great tragic heroine. In the face of unbearable misery, only nature testifies to the sad story of this simple country girl. The speechless speaks for the inside of Tess. And the readers have been given a chance to realize that what will come is predetermined and inevitable.!Reference: Hardy, Thomas. Tess of the D'Urbervilles. New!

What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

It definitely was a well written, very interesting and thought provoking book. I really liked it. Now I can see what my best friend has been raving over for so long.It really gives an in depth portrayal of the character's feelings, thoughts and desires . When Angel finally repents and sees how he is wrong, it is too late. Tess has already fallen back into sin with the man who caused her to fall many years before. Once she finds out Alec has deceived her, she not only despises him, she kills him. I just thought it was a good way to say that there are always consequences for our actions. I kept wishing the whole book that she had told Angel about her past before she married him. It would have spared them a lot of grief. I think he would have handled it better and hopefully been man enough to forgive her. It would have saved a lot of the grief that came later. What was really bad was how hypocritical Angel was when he confessed his own sin, she forgave him; yet when she confesses hers, he cast her out of his life.

Infantile criticisms by teenagers (who might change their minds later) disrupt the rating system used by Amazon. The fascinating aspect of Hardy - in this work, as well as in others is the manner that Charaters and setting intertwine. Relationships are seemingly established but what renders Hardy a literary tragedian is his capacity of substantiating the relationships into pre-determined moulds; the ending is somewhat predictable but the psychology leading to it and how it is developed is the interesting part. My only problem with Hardy is how he characterizes Brazil - Curitiba and then follows with him being in Rio de Janeiro. I would have liked to see more written about the actual experience there - but that is a minor complaint. PS - for some of the readers out there: Brazil is NOT just a rainforest.

She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I did not lose any weight, however.

A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles, written by Thomas Hardy is a classic novel set in the countryside of England at the turn of the century . It reflects the lifestyle of the 19th century-- women didn't have many rights back then, men being superior in every aspect. Communication was not very fast and effective, increasing social and personal isolation.The main character, Tess, is a very credulous and naive daughter of a poor cottager. At the beginning of the book, the cottager learns that he is a descendent of Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles. The cottager instantly thinks of himself as a rich man because of the money his relatives have, and celebrates the great news by going to a bar to drink. When their dad doesn't come back from the bar, Tess and one of her many younger siblings go to get their dad from the bar with their family's horse, Prince. On their way to the bar Tess and her brother fall asleep and lead Prince to a near fence with sharp nails, causing Prince to stab himself on the chest with the nails and dies. Tess, feeling guilty, agrees to go to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles so that she can work to help the family. It turns out that the 'relatives' living there were just trying to build position for themselves and had bought the name\\"d'Ubervilles\\", a secret that no one knows until too late.While working at the D'Urberville Tess meets Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her endlessly until he gets what he wants. Tess goes back to her home village and learns she is pregnant, but soon loses the unwanted baby. Trying to make a new start, she goes to a farm where she makes a few friends and learns basic farm work. She falls in love with Angel, the son of a minister, who chose the peaceful farm life in hopes of running his own farm some day. It seemed like Angel did love Tess, but didn't want to really know her. Tess then gets into a self conflict where a part of her wants to tell Angel about her past, but the other part just hopes to keep it a secret. They get married, and that same night, Tess makes up her mind, thinking that Angel will accept her past if he really loves her because he had been in a similar situation before. But, unfortunately, Angel refuses to give her a chance and leaves to another country. This episode describes a traditional, but altogether hypocritical, male attitude towards females.The character development is realistic, Tess gets stronger and more mature as her life gets harder. At the beginning of the book, Tess was this a fragile and somewhat responsible girl who cried very easily and as the book ends, she shows her strong side where she can actually defend herself. In my opinion, she was a good daughter who cared about her family even though they used her as a source of money. Her parents, in contrast, are selfish, trying to earn money the easy way.As one reads this book, the impression emerges that Tess' love for Angel was greater than his love for her. Angel wasn't 'innocent' when he married Tess, yet he was disgusted by her past. If he hadn't left her, then she wouldn't have gone to Alec to help her family and she wouldn't have died a tragic death. Thus, this insensitive man was actually responsible for the tragedies of other innocent people. I believe that Tess' love for Angel was somehow 'greater' because even after Angel leaves her for months, she accepts him back and even kills someone to be with him. In this way, Hardy suggests that women are actually are actually more steadfast and strong in their love.Tess' death was unfair if we think in modern day terms. Alec had pursued her, ruining both her marriage and her entire life. The books describes how Alec and Tess get into a fight when Angel comes back for her. Tess killed Alec for both revenge and self defense, but British justice did not acknowledge that and executed her. Again, we have a criticism of social rules and practices which treated women unfairly.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a tragic novel which will make readers feel gloomy, sad and upset for quite a while. It is definitely not the best read for summer, or in that case any other time of the year if the reader seeks pleasing entertainment.It will, however, make readers think deeply just how different the whole system of justice and society operated in the past and how much has changed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm not going to write a long, flowery review.

Without a doubt, this is the most probing and moving novel I have ever read in my entire life. It hit areas of my heart and mind as no other book ever has, especially in terms of being a woman. It was never required reading in any area of my schooling, even college. Yet as a former administrator, grade advisor, and mentor in a private school, I now realize that many of the students were required to read this book, but I never thought of reading it to discuss it with them; what a mistake. Had I known, this book would have been an invaluable tool for bringing out the horrors of the double standard.Every man, woman and child alive should read this book to find out the true sentiments of a woman who is brutalized sexually and mentally and shunned, not only by the man in question, but by the community, her family, the clergy, and ultimately, the man who claims to love her. How she deals with a \\"shame\\" that has been thrust upon her is crushing, and brings to mind that even in this 21st century, the double standard has not changed one iota, not even in the biggest of cities, regardless of what we see and hear in books, films and music. Go into any neighborhood, in any town, and in any city, and we see that this still exists. Tess of the d'Ubervilles walks among us even today, for she is still whispered about."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A very good story once you get used to the old English language.

It follows the story of a young girl who, in an attempt to help her struggling family, makes a series of mistakes that result in a loveless affair, an unfortunate pregnancy, the loss of a child, an estranged marriage, and ultimately murder. I was so caught up in the injustice of it all, that I scribbled responses to Hardy in the margin. In addition, the beautiful descriptions of 19th century farmlife in Britain are amazing. At times, this book seems hefty and longwinded, yet it is one of those rare gems that you suffer through only to find at the end that you are surprisingly satisfied."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires \\"cousin\\" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just \\"confessed\\" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a \\"bad woman,\\" but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now \\"impure\\" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess is typical of Hardy heroines, pathetic/victim. She is good and beautiful, but gets raped, rejected, pilloried, and ultimately hanged. With no control or strength of character, she is as helpless as a wet noodle.

I wish he had a written a dozen more novels, even if only half as compelling as this title."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is truly one of Hardy's best books!

I only hate that Tess has to pay for her wrong doing as it is so hard to sympathize with Alec or to find anything redeaming in him. I love some of the passages in the book that show Tess's ideals, compassion, and proud nature, like when she takes sympathy on the injured quails by puting them out of their misery. It is odd but it shows part of Tess's selfless nature and endears her to the reader. The story also has much to say about hypocrisy with out being preachy. It is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I love Thomas Hardy's characters because he allows them to be fallible, allows them to be unduly influenced by the rigid thinking of the time in which they live. They make bad decisions, and suffer for them, and we suffer along with them. How refreshing!This book is incredibly rich, and there would be much to discuss in a class or book group. I actually think one of the most interesting characters is Alec d'Urbervilles. He is utterly contemptible, of course, but he goes through such changes in the book that he's fascinating to watch. A great bad guy.Not surprisingly, Tess's and Angel's theme, the Double Standard one, shows up all over the place. I caught 3/4 of Sweet Charity on TV last night, remember that one with Shirley McClaine? Great dance numbers. She confesses her past in a fit of passion, and guess what happens? A scene certainly as heart-wrenching as the one in the crumbling d'Urbervilles mansion.If you love classics, what are you waiting for? It's worth it, as are Hardy's other novels. If you are new to this sort of thing, reading it for a course or a class, you have a treat in store. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel makes a heroine out of a simple girl. Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a nearly extinct noble line, leads a life of heavy responsibility where her impoverished family is concerned. At the behest of her parents, she seeks assistance from the D'Urbervilles who are, supposedly, relatives. This assistance yields disastrous results and Tess feels compelled to find work as a milkmaid where she meets Angel Clare, the son of an evangelical pastor, who is gathering experience in order to become a farmer.Hardy does a splendid job of illustrating Tess's strength as she goes from innocent girl to pure woman. Though she is not as educated as Angel, in terms of theory, her experience with Alec Stokes D'Urberville has given her a deeper knowledge of life and acceptance. Ironically, it is this experience which captivates and, predictably enough, repulses Angel.Hardy's narrative is a powerful one in this particular tale. It is clear that this is Tess's story and we, as readers, witness her painful journey. Through his subtle and understated use of irony, we come to realize the hypocrisy of Angel and wonder about the diabolical nature of Alec.What Hardy does emphasize in this novel is the unwavering hand of Justice which allows the novel to come to a bittersweet end and lets no one escape its strong, yet objective, sense of judgement."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the \\"average customer rating\\" was only three stars. So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English. It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero. It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology. It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies. It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does. It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes.The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure. Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work. Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first. Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of \\"Wessex\\" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison. Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation.Hardy's style is like no one else's. It is not snappy, as Dickens can be. It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's. It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either. It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as \\"modern.\\" Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest. Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions. Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere. The effect is not pretentious but timeless.There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here. Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience. I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best stories I've ever read. Its characters, especially Tess herself, are so alive and memorable that they stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. That being said, though, it's also not a novel for the casual reader. This book is so thought-provoking and, ultimately, heartbraking that it can't be easily forgotten, and will more than likely leave you with an overwhelming sadness for a long time afterward. I read a lot, and material with very different subject matters, so I'm not being melodramatic when I say that this book left me extremely choked up, and almost on the verge of tears. For a guy in his mid-20's who never gets emotional, I think that's saying quite a lot. It certainly left me with a lot of respect for the author. The reader comes to care so much about Tess, and agonize over the way her life turns out, that it becomes almost unbearable at times. For a fictional tale to have that effect on a person is quite incredible. Difficult or not, anyone who is interested in reading a brilliant and moving story that deserves to be called a classic should read Tess of the D'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Recently, my brother and I were discussing the \\"poverty penalty,\\" the concept that the poor pay more for what they must buy because they have no bargaining power to invite competition, which drives down prices. This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of her life of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"When Thomas Hardy first had \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" published in 1891, the controversy that surrounded it ensured for him financial security and status as one of the most popular authors of the time. The novel's scandal was concerned with the plot itself, in which an innocent young maid is seduced by an aristocratic cad, and pays for such an indiscretion with everything she holds dear in her life. In Hardy's journal (as recounted in Margaret Higonnet's introduction in this edition) he records that one of the Duchess of Abercorn's dinner parties ended in an argument between those who believed that Tess deserved her fate, and those that sympathized with her plight. However, by today's standards (in which premarital sex barely registers an eye-blink) one can't help but wonder if such a novel is relevant anymore.I'm going to argue, that yes, of course it is - if not simply to illustrate how lucky we are to no longer live in a world where a woman can be utterly destroyed through the hypocrisy of the society she lives in. However, there's considerably more to it than that, particularly as the remnants of this ideology remain to this day; and since one of the central themes of the novel is the negative effect of past traditions on the present, this bears keeping in mind.Tess Durbeyfield is a simple country lass, easily manipulated and with a limited education, but with a keen intelligence and insight into human nature. However, when her foolish father is casually told by the village minister that he is the offshoot of a once-noble family, Tess is thrown into her parent's ambition mechanizations. Made to leave her home and younger siblings, Tess begins work tending chickens at a relative's house whilst attempting to ward off the unwelcome attentions of her devious cousin Alec D'Uberville. However, her resolve slips one night when she is alone with Alec, lost and (as the text suggests) intoxicated, and he takes full advantage of her vulnerability.Having borne his child and lost it soon after (all without Alec's knowledge) Tess seeks employment elsewhere, and finds a sense of peace and security as a milkmaid in a neighboring village. That is, until she meets the parson's son Angel Clare, a very different kind of man from Alec D'Uberville. Falling in love, (along with every other girl on the farm!) Tess finds herself in a new moral crisis. Should she reveal her secret to Angel? Would he accept her if he knew? Her family (not to mention her common sense) warn her to keep her mouth shut, but can any relationship last if it is based on a lie? Shouldn't she have faith in Angel's testimonies of love to her?However, you've probably already guessed that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and this is a tragedy in the old grand tradition. When young Tess is seduced by a man her fate is sealed. She is a fallen woman, carrying the shame of her indiscretions throughout the rest of her life. However, the novel is remarkable because of Hardy's ability to find light amongst all the grimness. In the depths of Tess's drudgery and despair, we feel her moments of tranquility and appreciation of the beauty that surround her. Likewise, in moments of joy and peace, there is the underlying dread of the secret threatening to rare its ugly head. The emotions stirred in reading this novel are relentless - not to put anyone off from reading this novel, but I was in a constant state of agitation and discomfort in reading; that's how vivid the circumstances of the novel were. I mean that as a good thing of course; books these days are like movies - you sit, you watch, you more often than not feel nothing. But I was truly moved by \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" and her story; and I can't remember the last time I became so invested in a character and her happiness. Despite the pain it brought me in reading it, \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" was worth every agonizing word.In many ways this is a feminist novel, and although I would hate to put too modern a spin on it, it is very easy to see that Thomas Hardy's sympathies lie with Tess, writing in a letter: \\"I lost my heart to her as I went on with her history.\\" It is impossible not to feel a swell of indignation when Alec D'Uberville makes Tess swear not to tempt him anymore (as if his lust for her attractiveness is somehow *her* fault!) and a sense of bitter frustration at Angel Clare's inability to accept Tess's indiscretion, particularly when he himself is guilty of the same crime. When his lofty image of Tess as his pure \`child-bride' is taken from him, you can't help but feel he's doing it just as much out of injured pride than any sense of propriety.But this propriety is all-powerful in the novel; a heavy weight upon Tess that destroys her life. Hardy brings forth the idea that this is indeed a fallen world, but that it is so because of mankind's own structures of tradition and circumstance, rather than any divine ordination or original sin. To be free of some of them is a great release, though there are plenty that remain in this and other cultures around the world. The story is one of endurance; enduring the condemnation of others, the physical trials of manual labour, the suffering of a broken heart, the terror of encroaching death. We cannot control any of these aspects of our lives - all we can do is endure them, as Tess did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm many years out of college and thought I should start reading some more of the classics. Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, \\"Pay attention to ME!!!\\" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read \\"mind candy\\", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist. When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man. But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household. (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.) Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose. Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel. Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy. Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love. Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess. He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences. Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige. He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony. The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements. Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully. Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood. An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results. The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I see \\"Tess\\" as the story of how a beauty is wronged by evil and by arrogance.But oh, what a story. Hardy's novels read like poetry. Tess is so lovely, innocent and good, Alec so relentlessly hideous, and Angel so pathetically self-righteous, that I find the gradual destruction of Tess (with whom I empathize) at the hands of these two men, to be difficult to experience again, line by line!What a masterpiece of the human condition, and I'm told, of the female experience. Hardy's bitterly honest portrayal of the worst and best of human behavior is as powerful as any I've found in literature.When I need a Hardy fix and I don't want to be depressed, I turn to \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"(Warning: Tells Plot of the Story)Through many revisions and editions, Tess of the D'Urbervilles A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented By Thomas Hardy still holds readers captive over a hundred years later. Tess's plight though childhood innocence to womanly revenge is similar to other fairy tales and classic novels. It is said to be a love story for young girls or an adults' treasure of allusions and serious themes. Tess grows up fast, having to deal with the wrongs of mankind, her social class, a noble lineage, and the renewal of her true self. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel that can surpass the ages as a heartbreaking tale for any reader who believes in redemption and compassion for the all-encompassing heroine.In 19th Century Britain, Tess searches for a little pleasure out of her wronged life. Through many novels, Thomas Hardy has told the stories of characters and flaws. Hardy's insight to a woman's life is remarkable. He shows the injustices women have received and the stereotypes that follow women still today. Without knowing the narrator to be a man, it could easily have been a woman who told this very feminine tale. The book was very controversial at the time of its release in 1891. Parts were censored and seen as obscene because of it's sexual views. Hardy continually revised the story, changing the interpretations of the main characters. He did this through including information on some facts and removing statements on others. Alec D'Urberville could be seen in one edition as only the antagonist, not the villain he is in this version. His alterations lead to the 1912-13 edition that is usually the book available now.Hardy focuses on many themes throughout the book, mostly on the feminine role and social class. Tess Durbeyfield realizes her social struggle when she caused an accident to happen sending her family into financial need. With the recent discovery of their family's lineage to be that of the once very prominent D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent off to her wealthy relatives. The relatives in reality are not D'Urbervilles, only a family that had taken the name because questionable activity was attached to their old name. Alec D'Urberville realizes Tess's financial need and uses it against her to join him at his mother's estate. Gender roles are brought up when Joan Durbeyfield, Tess's mother, believes that \\"her face\\" (53) is her one advantage. Only D'Urbervilles advantage is greater. He holds the blackmail of economic need over Tess's head until he eventually takes advantage of her. \\"An immeasurable chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm\\" (74). The pregnant Tess, as an unmarried woman isolated from others, escapes home to have her baby. Tess tries her hand as a field worker where women \\"were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature\\" \\"A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field\\" (87-89). Roles are defined by gender again as women being earthly and beautiful, men having no goodness, and in the end the man still gets the better of the woman.Tess's baby dies, leaving her to start over at Talbothay's Dairy. Finding real love in Angel Care, he convinces Tess to marry him. She tries to tell him of her past only to have him refuse to hear her each time. After their wedding, Clare admits his previous sexual experience asking for forgiveness and receiving it. When Tess relates her story, he can no longer be with her, claiming that \\"forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another\\" (228) \\"the woman I have been loving is not you\\" (229). Men's double standards are shown. Clare leaves her for Brazil to decide if they could fix matters. During his long extended absence, Tess is reduced to farm labor. Her father dies and her family is evicted from their home. Her economic welfare falls again into Alec D'Urbervilles hands. His advantage persuades Tess to be his wife because her real husband was never coming back, according to D'Urberville.Clare came back to find his wife living with D'Urberville. Tess, in a moment of revelation, avenges the wrongs of D'Urberville by killing him. Clare and Tess have a few days of paradise together before she is taken away for D'Urbervilles murder. Tess understands that this is how it has to be. She will be able to die before Clare can despise her again. She dies a fulfilled woman, \\"'I am ready,' she said quietly\\" (396).Besides being a wonderful tale, Hardy's strength in writing merits the book to be an excellent read. Hardy achieves his goal of relating the story of an innocent girl whose life was simple before the villain D'Urberville comes into the story and nearly perfect after he is out of the story. Hardy portrayed his \\"Pure Woman\\" with brilliancy and faithfulness. Social class issues are displayed though Tess's country girl nature yet noble lineage. If her family had not been in economic problems, her tragic flaw would never have occurred. She could have lived as a farmer's wife and lived a simple life. The feminine stereotypes and generalizations are represented by the actions of others upon the poetic Tess.Hardy's background in poetry gives the novel a lyrical quality missing in the books of today's generation. Hardy alludes to several other works of art including Greek mythology, Shakespeare, fairy tales, and the Bible. He utilizes imagery as well. His uncanny imagery creates the entire world of Tess for the reader, down to the little window reflections upon a dress. The extremely detailed and well articulated descriptions can easily be seen in the readers mind. These literary elements are well used and fit the tale accordingly.Enjoyment would be received from Tess of the D'Urbervilles by those hopeless romantics who value depth to a story and appreciate the British setting. Gender roles and social class issues are blatantly raised with no subtly. Love story or social issue awareness, the beloved heroine, innocent, strong, loving, and pure will reach into one's heart and capture it forever in the world of fairy tales and happy endings."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Man... I thought that The Return of the Native was good...Tess of the d'Urbervilles by the Great Thomas Hardy was a very long novel for me. Hardy's scope and incredible projection of Wessex was very admirable and how he presents Tess as a person is very beautiful.The novel begins with Tess' father learning that his family, the Durbeyfields is descended from a long gone ancient regime, the d'Urbervilles. I really love how Hardy makes you feel like this is the ultimate cross for Tess and her family to bear. How Tess grows to hate this fact. After the Durbeyfield's horse is impaled, yes impaled, when Tess and her brother are trying to deliver something that her father is too ill (or too drunk) to deliver, Tess blames it all on herself and is sent to work on the manor that her parents think that her \\"cousin,\\" the cruel Alec d'Urberville resides in. A great Hardyan lustre of that element of the story is that Alec d'Urberville's father just bought that name after lookin it up in some book, so Tess falls into a trap of fate and is continually punished. Tess' whole life is told through the novel and is filled with very tragic scenes, so if you like feel good books, stay away from this one.This novel is full of beautiful and moving tragedy, incredible projection of Victorian rural life, and just about everything Hardy can give you in one novel.Definatley essential Victorian Literature, definatley essential Thomas Hardy, and without question one of the greatest novels ever written....Only a poet could've written such a beautiful novel..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This book is wonderful for many reasons and especially for its portrayal of Tess. It raises questions (still pertinent today) about women, reputation, and sexuality in society. Hardy was certainly ahead of his time in pointing out that we do as much harm to women with prudishness and double standards as we do with physical and sexual violence. Don't miss _Jude the Obscure_ and _The Mayor of Casterbridge_."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I don't think that Tess of the D'Urbervilles is to be considered a realistic portrayal of life. It is more like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean tragedy. The characters are larger than life and the events of the book mythic in scale. Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel. The characters are complex and deep, and the reader ends up caring about them. That's why this book is a classic.

Never again be whisked into this particular world so far removed from my own and yet so heart-wrenchingly close. Never again turn the pages of Tess of the D'Urbervilles with baited breath and a longing ache that realistically shouldn't stem from mere fiction.Phenomenal, this work of Thomas Hardy's is.Not since reading Jane Eyre have I been so totally immersed in the life of a character, so in tune with her sufferings and joys, so hopeful yet fearful for her future. Tess seems so real, sometimes pathetically so, but always wishfully so. Her story is a sad one, but it brings with it its own reward.I almost wish I could have stopped reading at a point before the ending, so I would be free to imagine my own perfect conclusion. Or better yet, so Tess could live on, could still have that elusive chance at fulfillment and lasting joy. But Mr. Hardy's ending is the best one, the most fitted to the rest of the book. Still, I was shocked. I think the ending just increases the tantalizingness of the book though.So anyway, this book deserves at least seven stars, but only five are given, so. . . read it for yourself.

It is a book which has intense atmosphere, character development, romance, an interesting storyline and yet still gives us much food for thought.At the start of the book our beautiful heroine Tess is a teenager of a poor family with a father who is an alcoholic. She is a young woman who always tries to do the best for her family which lands her in trouble. Tess is eventually raped and gives birth to an illegitimate child. That she remains a good person who still tries to do her best and is a heroine of a book was shocking at the time of publication.In many ways it is obvious that Tess' story is going to end tragically. Even while we root for Tess and grow to admire her courage and perseverance we are aware that it is against all odds. This then provokes interesting questions about how the story would appear in today's world and the moral questions involved in contemporary society.Growing up as a farm girl, I enjoyed all the interesting details about the various types of farming in the late 19th century England. I loved the descriptions of the walks and travels by coach across the rural countryside."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"'Tess' is a beautifully-written classic that kept my kindle dictionary busy. It is a story about how painful and unfair life can be, and especially to those who are by-nature the most loving, kind and sensitive. You will fall in love with 'Tessy' and wish only the very best for her. Be forewarned, however, that Hardy wrote very little of the 'best' you will wish for Tess into this story. As a result, you may want to delay reading this book until you feel 'up' for reading a very sad and tragic tale. That caveat aside, 'Tess' is an exceptional work of literature, and a book you aren't likely to forget.Caution: Amazon has posted an editorial review that gives far too much of this book away.

The short scene before her death at stonehedge just emphasises this woman's (how do you say) weakness? I can't describe how wonderful this book is.Tess of the Durbervilles is Thomas Hardy's equivalent towards The Ambassadores by Henry James. Both are flooded with metaphores.

When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end.

If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses. There were parts of this book I enjoyed: Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme. Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born. I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly. I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say. Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time. For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame. Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way. There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear. D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville. I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it. It was an involvement that went further than just feeling like a barnyard."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it.

I'm sure I could spend years dissecting this book and finding new allusions, hidden references, and coincidental parallels. In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \\"get\\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \\"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text?

Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction.

And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy is an extraordinary writer; though his writing is poetic, and includes on point historical references, he is an imaginative and thoughtful storyteller. Hardy reveals Tess's soul with such care and regard that she is irresistibly complex; delicate and strong willed, deeply loyal and obstinately independent, yet submissive and capable of extreme violence. So well did I come to understand her that, over time, I could predict her reactions and decisions -- though I hoped she would decide otherwise. Once a preacher reveals to Tess's father his connection to a long lost prominent family, Tess's is life is set on a seemingly unalterable path. Used, manipulated, misjudged and shamed, she struggles on, grinding out a living in unspeakably harsh conditions, while resisting with all her might a man who had already stolen her innocence and would shamelessly destroy her soul as she waiting for the man who had abandoned her. I found myself wincing at her pain, hoping she would receive what she deserved rather than what life seemed intent on doling out to her. Perhaps the best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \\"simple,sensuous and passionate\\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \\"a fine and handsome\\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \\"blighted\\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\" and \\"The Starry Night\\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \\"Tears of Heaven\\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \\"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \\"the ache of modernism\\"in the novel.This abyss of \\"the ache of modernism\\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \\"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \\"a cottage-girl, his young wife\\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \\"little fool\\".The fate of an unassuming girl \\"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is \\"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Probably Hardy's most famous work and definitely containing his most sympathetic heroine. Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue... Supporting characters are as vivid as the main ones... This may be Hardy's most complete and upsetting story. He really puts the players (thus the audience) thru the ringer."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"it truly is an amazing story of love, strength, passion and second chances.

Whilst reading the 50 Shades Trilogy recently, I noted the references to Tess in that book and it perked my interest in this book. I decided to re-read it as I really couldn't remember it much and wondered how I would interpret it now being more mature and experienced. Well suffice it to say that this book is devastatingly excellent! The language is hard to get at first (having not read a Thomas Hardy in a long time!).... it's a Thomas Hardy novel so you know he's very detailed and it's going to be tragic as he doesn't do happy ever after! The novel is set in Victorian England and features its heroine Tess a very poor country girl. It details her journey from innocent young girl on the cusp of womanhood to womanhood. It is essentially a love tragedy but not in the manner of Romeo and Juliett, its more, more real, more realistic. Its speaks to just how tragic life can be when the right man doesn't meet the right woman at the right time, about missed opportunities, and, depicts how the biggest of injustice and violation often happens to the most vulnerable and undeserving of persons. It speaks to how morals and society's beliefs can cause us pain and sorrow and often to punish those undeserving of same. But that was life then and its still so today. Suffice it to say that this book is 100 times better than the 50 Shades Trilogy and has impacted me so profoundly, I just can't understand how I didn't see the monumental tragedy it is when I was 17 years old. As a result I've taken to re-reading most of my literature books.

Besides the fact that it is a classic - and I think that every teenager or young person in one's twenties must read it - I learned that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a pretty controversial novel when Thomas Hardy first released it. As we know from history and from literature courses, the Victorians considered themes such as sex, religion, the condition of women or the lives of the peasants taboo subjects. Fortunately we are more open-minded today and we don't make a big fuss of what's moral or not in books such as this one. I guess that Thomas Hardy had the intention to open the peoples' eyes - though it is a fictional story - that unfortunate things were happening to innocent girls during that time.The story is very realistic and the characters are complex.Tess is a free-spirited girl until her destiny changes and becomes more difficult. Tess swings between strength and weakness, between reason and her heart. I admire her capacity of dusting herself off and decide to find another place to work, in order to help her poor family. Although Angel is far away, her hope that he will come back someday does not leave her. I didn't like the fact that she constantly blamed herself for the first bad episode of her life which led her to other complicated situations. She felt guilty for something she wasn't aware of or she wasn't taught to avoid.The book also gives us a glimpse of how were the lives of peasants, and the depiction of the landscapes will appeal to those how love nature.I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin your reading.Therefore read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because you can enter in Tess' world and learn more about her troubles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I must admit that this is one of the few classics that I have not read, so when I found a free copy for my Kindle, I immediately downloaded it.

Hardy's characters are brought to life and you feel as if you could know someone with these same characteristics in the here and now. The ending of this story, for me personally left something to be desired, but I really could not put it down. If you have not read this story, yet, please do!On a side note, I would love to see a contemporary adaptation of this story and see how the characters would interact with each other, as social standing, money, love, and betrayal are certainly themes worth examining in this day and age."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Should not be made into an afterschool special.

Thus, like many other of the reviewers on this page, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read. I must admit that at first the reading was quite tedious. It must have taken me two months to read through the novel. If I had written a review after this first encounter with Tess I might well have given the novel a two star (**) rating. I believe one of the explanations for this lack of enthusiasm is that I did not get along well with my English teacher and I felt that I could not allow myself to enjoy Tess, lest I let my teacher score an important victory.As the exam period itself approached I read Tess four more times with increasing enjoyment. The last few readings were truly enlightening. I knew exactly what I would encounter on the next page and yet I shuddered with anticipation, reacting to the words even before my eyes caught them.It seems clear to me now that the reason I enjoyed Tess so much was not only the familiarity bred by multiple readings but also the dissection of the novel in the classroom. I must confess that although we had problems getting along, my English teacher was excellent.The only advice I can give those of you who doubt Tess' greatness is to muster some courage and give the novel another chance. Tess is on my all time Top 10 list along with The Grapes of Wrath, which, incidentally, I was &quot;forced &quot; to read in my high school English class."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result.

It is a beautifully written novel about one wopman and her struggle to find love and her duty to her family.Tess was a child who sought to right her wrong by working for her &quot;cousins&quot; she hoped that by doing this she could become a productive member of the family particularly as the eldest child. She was required to take care pof most of the chores as her siblings were too young to help the family. As a daughter she was taught that it was her duty to marry wealth so that her family would not have to live in squallor. In her attempt to do this she was taken advantage of, but not raped, and she was made pregnant. She could not abort the child, and she could not properly carry the child to term without being married. She did the latter of these because she hated the childs father. Many times she wished that the child would die so that it would not have to live with the bastard lable. She felt that it was best that the child be taken from the earth to make her and her child's life easier.Tess soon finds that there is a doiuble standard for pre-marital sex in Victorian England. Her husband, on there wedding night admits that he has been promiscuous, Tess is greatly relieved by this because she thinks that he will be more accepting of her situation when she tells him, this is not so. Angel, her husband, walk out on tess and leaves her to fend for herself, an unloved and un cared for woman. This novel ends sadly with Tess' death after Angel comes back to her and they live happily for a number of days.This novel is an excellent example of social commentary in the form of literary art. This novel is a poinient dipiction of the life of a young woman in Victorian England.

I understand this book was written in an era when women were not strong but still...couldn't Hardy have given Tess some common sense?? This book put me to sleep more than once with its long descriptions of the same valley...and can anything else happen to Tess at the end of this novel? I think every bad thing that could happen to a woman happened to Tess...a bit melodramatic, maybe? I don't know how this book became a classic...was it classic for its ability to put somebody to sleep...or how about sending someone into a depression or fits of anger because Tess is a moron? If you want to read classics read Crime and Punishment or even Madame Bovary...I also had to read those this summer and I actually enjoyed them...so don't go saying to yourself the only reason I don't like this book is because I was forced to read it...I was forced to read those other books and I liked them. In short, I pity anybody who has to read this book...and I don't know how anybody in their right minds could have given this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A few years back I was forced to read &quot;Tess&quot; for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on &quot;Tess..&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The whole tragedy is in the fact that I was NOT forced to read this book but actually picked it up because I WANTED to read it (or so I thought at the time). I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \\"Tess\\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it. I know I would applaud such a great ending!In short: steer way clear of this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"fascinating story of an ancient civilization"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \\"delicate sensibilites\\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

And check out the A&amp;E movie, because it's excellent - better thatn the book, and that's weird. Perfect casting and adaptation. Ok, that's all."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is truly a classic. Hardy's use of vivid imagery to evoke emotion was magnificent. His ability to bring life to the scenes of the novel made the comprehension of the story much easier. The sad story of Tess' demise was provided with a great deal of emotion, which made the novel incredible to read.We follow Tess throughout her life, experiencing all the emotions associated with her horrific teenage years. We are able to see the progression of her character and the emotions that drove her all the way towards the end of novel. It was evident that Hardy used his keen ability to address his opinion of the imminent will.Hardy has done an outstanding job, and though Tess' story, he has addressed serious problems with society that have transcended to even this era. An outstanding job! To see that the only a few people have given this novel five stars amazes me! Tess was an extraordinary novel; the power of this work of literature is unlike any other. It is unique and a must read for any high school student. I'm proud to say that this novel was enjoyable and an interesting read. From start to miserable finish, Hardy kept my eyes glued. His vivid imagery and interesting diction proved to be a great addition to an already interesting plot."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A must read. Thomas Hardy's diction is unforgettable. Just like a Shakespeare play, every sentence must be savored. Despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of detail included, the novel is extremely readable. All this detail allows the reader to have vivid pictures of each and every scene painted in their minds. From the action filled beginning to the somewhat predictable but nevertheless fantastic ending, the reader will be on the edge of his or her seat, wondering what misadventure Tess will fall into next. The protagonist, Tess, can easily be classified as a heroine of the Victorian era. Her character is impossible not to love, tragically selfless, humble, and beautiful inside and out. The events of the novel make one feel an anger towards not only some of the characters, but towards what they represent and the society which they live in. From the misogynistic, deceitful character of Alec to the well-intentioned but foolish character of Tess's mother, even to our main character, the wide eyed, innocent, ever altruistic character of Tess, every character has a statement to make about the world that Hardy places them in. And with Tess's fatal flaw, one can't help but think of how applicable it is even in today's time. Making bold statements on gender lines, social status lines, and the inevitability of fate, this novel transcends time. A quick recommendation-though at times the book may seem to drag out, it is certainly worth it to continue reading and finish the novel. Also, as the novel progresses, the wording certainly gets easier to understand."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The stories and the characters may seem simple and dramatic, however, of the classic nature of Greek mythology, consistent with other books by the author, such as The Return of the Native, and the Mayor of Casterbridge. The essence of the book seems to me, is about the tragedies humans suffer, caught in the conflicts between nature and culture. The nature is harsh but straightforward as love is, but the culture presents hypocrisies and judgment, separating people between splendid star and blighted one. Whether to worship the sun, or to worship the standards of Judeo Christianity? There are different judgments in wealth vs. poverty, religion vs. spirituality, men's honor vs. women's purity. And there is plenty of ambiguity in all of them but ultimately, the \\"anachronism of love and chance\\" leads the characters to classic tragedies in the end. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The title character Tess journeys across the rural English countryside amidst a stark voyage of discovering exactly who she is. Her story is one filled with various sorrows, cathartic or otherwise, punctuated by only fleeting amounts of peace and happiness tossed somewhere in-between. It's not an easy read--nor is it meant to be--for a few reasons. Hardy thrives on description, some of which might seem unnecessary to the modern-day reader (particularly the extended glimpses of the dairy farms), though we do need to understand the Victorian world we're in. Consequently, the author wants to garner as much support as he can for his protagonist, who loses her innocence quickly and spends most of the book scraping up the pieces of a wreckage that was never her fault in the first place. And these glimpses into her troubled consciousness ache and resonate with us a century on. So if we understand the atmosphere she has to contend with, we begin to understand Tess--and sympathize with her plight and misfortune along the way.When the meat is torn off the skeleton, it's a solid (albeit lengthy) read about the meshing and clashing of various characters in nineteenth-century England. The choices of some of the characters throughout, some of which might be construed as twists, are not entirely believable though add definite color to the work, especially the last two \\"phases.\\" These culminate in a conclusive ending that is both haunting and beautiful. This won't be for everyone, though if you can withstand some archaic language here and there, you might enjoy this tragic tale about love, loss, and a stringent society that tried so desperately to dictate both."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is a great book. The desriptions are beautiful. I was shocked to see how many people trashed it.Look, Thomas Hardy was portraying the tragic struggle of a simple country girl living in the 19th century. Women weren't treated well, let alone poor women. In my opinion, he spoke of Tess with tenderness and compassion. He was not trying to say she deserved all that anguish, but the reality is that that's the way it was. If anything I think he was trying to advocate respectful treatment of women."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. It has been a few years since I was a teenager, to say the least, but it will always stay with me as one of the \\"best books I have ever read\\" that is for sure. Among many wonderful attributes Hardy brings alive the English countryside so incredibly well. Tess struggles and loves so deeply and I wanted so much for her to be happy. I understand why and how she came to do what she did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This review is for Amazon.com - don't read if you don't want a spoiler for the ending. I loved this book - it had great character development, a truly elegant writing style, and a plotline that kept me enraptured right up to the end. Hardy's forte was capturing the irresistability of temptation even with the most staunch of intentions. However, I'm quite irritated at the amazon.com editorial review that gives away the entire ending. What's up with that? Thinking that Amazon of all places wouldn't be so daft as to give away the ending in the review, I was expecting the ending in the middle of the book and was sorely disappointed to learn that WAS the ending and that I had known it all along. Please update the editorial review and remove the details of the story ending.As for the ending itself, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending wasn't quite as expected. While the plot of the ending wasn't unexpected (especially having read the editorial review), the turn of events and seemly strong character traits of Angel and Tess appear to have evaporated in an instant. While Angel had to spend a year away from Tess to work up to his acceptance of her prior transgression, he doesn't seem to think more than a blink of her having killed a man. And Tess holds such a strong belief in her own low self worth, that she is unwilling to marry the man she loves for disgracing him. And then, kills a man without as much thought as deciding to boil a cup of tea. So, even though the writing style and the majority of the book were fantastic, the ending is the spoiler and the reason for only 4 stars. This book is still very much worth a read simply for the enjoyment of the journey."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Just a fantastic novel. The larger issues it addresses, as is the case with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, are the very largest that we face. But the detail is also there, all the way down to every scent, sound, and emotion of the daily commute of a young milkmaid in Victorian England. That such strikingly detailed imagery sits easily atop the largest issues of our existence is a marvel. An amazing, important novel. One of the best."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels.

Readers who like Tom Clancy will probably find Hardy too slow. Readers who like James Joyce will probably find Hardy too old-fashioned. The more time I spend in Hardy's world, the happier I am, even when the outcome is unhappy, as it is with Tess. It's hard to pick a favorite of his books; they're all so wonderful, but if I had to choose only one to take to a desert island, this would probably be it (though a tough choice between this and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\"). My husband and I dream of going to Dorset because of Hardy. I hope one day we make it. You simply can't do better than Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking people were not sophisticated 2 hundred years ago, but they were and had difficult issues in which to deal within their cultures. As the author was an Englishman, there were loads of vocabulary learned with reading this book, but it was fun because it's so easy with the Kindle to look up a word.

What at first appears to be a story of a young woman becomes a symbol of nature versus the mechanical world, love and hate, and good versus evil.The pure, sweet, young Tess is at odds against the world and in seeking to aide her family in their struggle to survive she becomes entrapped in a new world of deciet, betrayal and pain. Her quest to ask the aide of recently discovered, distant kin leads Tess unwillingly into the arms of Alec her &quot;cousin&quot; and from this action her life falls into a spiral of difficulties. Her misdeeds and those of others lead again and again to trials in her life. Hardy creates wonderful full-bodied characters and sets into motion one of the greatest stories of a woman of all time. Ideas of love, hate, betrayal and the nature of the world all mingle to make a superb novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Tess of the d'Ubervilles&quot; is the story of a young and innocent woman who wants nothing more than to live a happy life.

I always wondered wether if Tess and he would get together throughout the entire novel.Boy was I surprised!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is a tragic, timeless story. I was in awe of Hardy's ability to flesh out this woman, Tess Durbyfield, and just give her total realism. The other main character, Angel Clare, is also brilliantly flawed, and shows you that in real life there is no such thing as a prince charming. If you can sit and work through the sometimes tedious 19th century style of Hardy, you will come away from this book moved.

If your a weak person, emotionally, try read a softer Hardy book like THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, other than that, grab some tissues, and be prepared to control your emotions, it's one heck of a crazy rollercoaster ride."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the Dubervilles is a truely tender and fascinating book that deeply feels the human heart. This is not a book for the average Daniel Steel- Stephen King reader. Tess is highly reccommended only for those who can respect and understand great literature that has lived through decades of readers and prints.

Beautiful for how he uses words to for sentences to form paragraphs to form a book. Yet horrible on how he can do such a thing to his characters.

However, times have changed and its relevance is not as immediate as that of Hardy's last novel, Jude the Obscure. Still, the message of this book is far from foreign.

It is a pastoral - the set-piece descriptions of nature (the play of light at differing times of the day, the verdant plenitude during Tess and Angel's courtship, the astonishing effect of bonfires at dusk etc.) are among the most overpoweringly vivid in literature, genuine word-painting - and an anti-pastoral, with even the natural world infected with poisonous, unnatural social conventions, with the growth of Talbothays petrified into the sterile limbo of Flintcomb-Ash.As in Shakespeare, there is a conflict in 'Tess' between the surface, linear plot, which tells a transient, austere tale of some people whose existence is short and ultimately barren, and the movement of the imagery, eternal, self-generating. The abundance of the latter makes the relentless grimness of the former just about tolerable (although the Flintcomb-Ash section is painfully unreadable) - as in Shakespeare, the burden of sexuality and emotion denied by society is placed on the natural world, on the language and the imagery, so the emotional deprivation in the plot starkly contrasts with its potent, lubricious surroundings.The plot is not 'realistic', but ritualised and patterned, set in heavily symbolic, paganistic sites, human nature stylised in pageants and tableaux. The climactic part, where Hardy twice startlingly changes narrative point-of-view, ushers in a new age of anti-Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I was forced to read Tess for summer reading. I have possibly never been so glad to finish a book, not out of joy at a good reading experience but because the novel was such torture to wade through, in all its melodrama, sensationalistic elements, unlikable characters, and gaping holes in the plot, especially towards the end. Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it. I was left with a very poor impression of Thomas Hardy's talents as a writer. (Incidentally, it should tell you something that more than one reader/reviewer compared it to the movie Titanic.)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A true joy to read, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is filled with situations that paint pictures of real life. Hardy knew that Tess' reality was filled with enough emotion and drama that there was no reason to add to it the things fairy tales are made of.When reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles you are brought into the story by Hardy's suberb way of sketching the scene. Though Hardy's descriptive writing can sometimes be hard to digest, his choice of words allow you to enter the landscape and smell the glen yourself.Overall, an excellent book for the more ambitious reader, and for the one who isn't afraid of the less popular unhappy outcomes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is one of the best books I have read in the past five years. It combines love and tragedy wonderfully. The characters leave memories enbeaded inside your mine. Especailly, Tess and Angel. Their love for each other is magical. It truly is a wonderful love story. By saying this you have to have a thought-provoking mind to understand the different subject matter. That is why most people read the book because you have to think and it is a sad story. I personally had to read it for class, and what honestly surprised me is the cleverness Hardy portrays to make his heroine more real rather than just another character. The way that it starts off how Tess and Angel don't seem like they are going to get together and how they eventually do. When they finally get together Tess has a confession to make to Angel. In the book we find out that Tess may have been raped or seduced by Alec. We are not sure but Angel leaves Tess because either way she isn't pure anymore. This is so hypocritical of Angel because Tess forgave him for having an affair with an older woman in London but he doesn't forgive Tess. So basically he's a jerk to be blunt with it. Eventually Angel forgives his wife, Tess and they leave Brazil. Tess goes back to Alec and murders him, so she can be with Angel without any worries. Due to this they hid away but get caught and the tragic ending comes. Tess is exacuted for what she has done.I like how the plot is not really &quot;realistic&quot; but follows a designed pattern, using heavy symbolic means. Hardy writes the book to leave an effect of you. You feel Tess's agony and confusion. You want to help her and wish you could show her the right path to take. I found myself talking to her when I read the book so she can do the right thing. That shows how Hardy gets you really involved. Difficult or not, if you like to read, I strongly recommend reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles. It is deservinly allowed to be called a classic. Hats off to Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a master craftsman. With the help of words that fit the sentences like a key into a lock, Hardy ensnares his readers like a spider traps a fly. Such is the power of Hardy's prose.\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\", was published in 1891. It was one of the last -- and arguably the best -- novels from Hardy's pen. It's the story of Tess, a country girl in a fictitious English county,Wessex, and her tragic struggle against destiny. As somebody has already mentioned, Hardy has chosen the backdrops of the story with the same care with which he describes people: valleys and moors are also portrayed as if they too are characters of the novel. The Vale of Blackmoor, Tess's birthplace, is described as \\"an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter\\", and \\"in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry\\". The Flintocomb-Ash, the place where Tess was subjected to some very rough manual work, is painted as \\"a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin\\". And the place where Tess fell in love, the Vale of Froom, is \\"that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts.\\"There are several tearjerkers in the novel but I found one moment particularly touching where Tess decides to baptize her illegitimate baby herself. And when the baby -- named Sorrow -- dies, Hardy becomes a little bitter: \\"Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of little brilliancy - luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginning\\".To put forth the case of an unwed mother so passionately in &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; was something of a stir in the English society of late nineteenth century, which was so obsessed with feminine virginity. The novel received some severe criticism initially, which ultimately forced Hardy to stop writing novels and concentrate on poetry."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I agree with mulcahey (five stars, Sept. 23, 2003), who sounds like a college professor. I'm not a scholarly reader. I miss the hidden meanings, the underlying philosophy, and so on. I read purely for enjoyment (and sometimes education--read Lolita if you want to discover new words).In addition to what mulcahey said, the book is simply highly enjoyable to read. It's very touching. It's the kind of reading experience that will leave you thinking about it for days or weeks. The writing style is elegant and poetic. Anyone who has tried to write will appreciate the grace and beauty.It's not a light read, like something you take on a plane to ward off boredom. It's the kind of read that takes a little effort. The reward is definitely there, however."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) created one of the great heroines in all of world literature when his pen drew Tess in 1891. Tess Durbeyville is a poor girl in rural Wessex. Her father is a drunk with a weak heart. Her mother is childish and her parental skills are sadly lacking. Tess is the leader of the family. Her father learns their family descends from the aristocratic but decadent D'urberville clan who came to Britain with William the Conqueror. Tess visits a nouveau riche branch of the family. She is quickly seduced, drugged and becomes pregant by the evil Alec D'urberville.Tess returns to her family in disgrace. She baptizes the illegitimate child Sorrow who dies soon after birth. Tess travels to a a dairy owned by the Cricks. Here she meets Angel Clare the nonbelieving son of a ruralclergyman. Complications and irony ensue as in all Hardy's well plotted novels. Angel is a weak man who is a fallen angel on what Hardy calls this blighted star (earth). I did not care for him or his pious family!The culmination of the novel comes when Tess murders Alec; flees with Angel; is captured at Stonehenge and is hanged for murder. These are the plot developments but Tess is so much more.The book is a poetic prose masterpiece. Hardy the countryman provides rich evocations of the English countryside yielding its pristine beauty to the coming industrial age. Reapers and trains are intrusions into old Wessex's slow progress of the bucolic season. Throughout the novel I appreciated Hardy's hatred of killing animals and birds such as the poignant incident of the dying pheasants in a field following a wantonhunting expedition by humans. Tess too is hunted, hounded and caged like a bird entraped by her dire circumstances.Hardy fell in love with the fictional Tess. Who is she? She is woman!An earth mother; sacrificial victim; a panther; a temptress; an innocent country girl; a pagan goddess sprung from the soil of England; a mysteriious presence who is often pictured in the fog and mists. Tess dreams as does a fairy tale princess. Tess is a woman of strong passions inherited from the D'urberville family who kills and loves, laughs and sings, cries and rejoices in the complicated and tragic life she is given.The prudery of Victorian England disdained Tess causing Hardy much pain. He often had to change the text of the novel to assuage the prim souls of his editors. And yet Tess lives in the minds of the reader as the acme of his creation of memorable female characters. One can never really understand the multifaceted Tess; we can simply spend time with this fascinating witch and madonna. Tess will live forever in the minds of all of us who consider Hardy a genius."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess's father, Mr. Durbeyfield, is told by a minister that his family is the direct lineage of an old, noble family that was once thought to be completely gone. There's nothing left of the family's land and fortune, except the family name (d'Urberville).However, Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife see this as a chance to move up on the social ladder. They devise a plan to send their daughter to become acquainted with a rich woman who's last name is d'Urberville. From then on, Tess is left to try to maintain her dignity and honor and to pick up the pieces of her broken life that resulted from her parents' need to be important.This is my first time reading anything by Thomas Hardy. I was warned that he was cynical man, and I'll agree that Hardy's prose is cynical, yet heartrending. I couldn't help feeling bad for Tess through all her troubles. This is not a happy novel. For a moment, you think that things will get better for Tess, but the fates seem to be against her.The landscape of the novel changes with the mood of what's happening. The land itself almost seems to be a living person that he described.He uses vivid, beautifully described imagery to describe people and places in his novels. There are themes of theology (Hardy had internal conflicts with believing in God), virtue, the boundaries of love. He employs everything from Greek mythology to modern (or what was modern in his day) poetry.There are no illusions of a happily-ever-after in this story. This was simply a beautiful novel, a novel that portrays its female heroine as the strong woman she was. She could put more modern women heroines to shame."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Since Hardy can be rather boring in his poetry, I expected that I wouldn't even be able to finish this book. On the contrary, as soon as I had started to read it, I couln't put it down! This is a work of great depth and Hardy has an amazing way of expressing himself, one that really captures the imagination (like Dickens)! I heartily recommend this book for anyone, Victorian-lover or not. The articles are also highly illuminative; this book is definitely worth reading more than once!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I had Peglet's experience when reading this book (and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; as well). I recommend, as she does, that the reader not try to empathize with the characters; it'll make you too angry. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Angel a few times, for reasons that are obvious to anyone who has read the book.I must point out that one reviewer has stated incorrectly that Tess was &quot;raped.&quot; If she had been, the book would not have had the force it does. It would have just been another &quot;victim of society&quot; or &quot;victim of men&quot; book. Take a close look at Tess' confession to Angel on their wedding night.Think of this book not as an indictment of marriage and Victorian mores (although it certainly was meant to be, as &quot;Jude&quot; further develops), but rather look at it as the relationships of three people who are never quite able to understand themselves and their natures well enough to avoid disaster. An excellent book. But once again, don't try to empathize with the characters."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"When is pain the necessary entry price for involving oneself in great fiction, and when is it simply something you might call \\"author abuse\\"? I believe the tipping place can be found somewhere in the pages of Thomas Hardy's most famous novel.In it, we meet young Tess Durbeyfield, a simple English farm girl who struggles to make it through everyday life. Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \\"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\\" he writes. \\"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\\"If only!Here's the rub. \\"Tess\\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\\"Tess\\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Ubervilles is sooo tragic! I can't even... So good, so romantic... so sad... so wonderful. Shakespeare's tragedies never EVER touched me like this! Promise me you'll read it! Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance? Bad form, Angel! Bad form!)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I read Tess of the D'Ubervilles two years ago. I have read several of Hardy's novels and this is his best work. I recommend that everyone should read this novel.I am somewhat confused on some of the low ratings of this book and do not agree with the opinion of Tess. Tess is a strong woman who has weathered through some tough adversaries and situations. As with many books written in this time period, many women are weak, can not handle themselves and require a husband - not so with this novel.At the time this book was originally published there was much controversy and reviewers were very negative against Hardy (he stopped writing novels after bad reviews of Jude The Obscure). This is unfortunate since this novel teaches us many things about life and respecting people even after 105 years.Update:I have read most of Hardy's novels and still believe that Tess of the D'Ubervilles is his best work. I have since bought the Hardy complete poem edition by Palgrave and am looking forward to reading his poems (I like some poetry but not a total fan; I am sure I will his poems)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I found myself disecting each paragraph and reading sentences over and over again, with no reason to may I also add.

Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"What is the point of reading classic literature if all you are going to do is analyse it? What a waste. Hardy, Austen et al would be turning in their graves if they knew that their work would be treated in this way by self-proclaimed experts. Classic novels are to be enjoyed; they are written for the satisfaction of all readers, not just to massage the egos of academics.Yes, I've studied classic literature, and it isn't the genre I am typically interested in. However, \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" is the novel that has inspired me to give this genre another try. I found it to be incredibly moving; dismissing the idea that it was poorly written. I've found English literature too stifled by its own airs and graces, but this is not the case with Thomas Hardy. He paints a picture of great hope in a way that allows us to empathise (unlike some of his contemporaries) with the characters of a different era.I recommend anyone who wants to start reading classic English literature to begin with \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\". You will find it an easily accessible read. It is beautiful, hopeful and tragic."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A love story that has all of the makings of a made for TV movie.

A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff. The result? Tess of the d'Urbervilles roasting on an open fire."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"HARDY HAS A MAGICAL WAY OF CREATING A CHARACTER THAT EVENTUALLY BECOMES REAL TO US.

Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles. If you liked the authenticity and poignancy of Tess but felt there must be another side of the story, please read Paul Faber."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later.

As her character developed she showed me what a fine line the Victorian woman lived --whether to profess her thoughts, will, love or to abide by society's wishes and be self-sacrificing and totally obedient to the man she loves. Without spoiling the ending, her last act was the crescendo of all of the small ways in which she held herself back. There were times that I pleaded with her to &quot;go to him&quot; or &quot;tell him&quot; but it would have been out of character for a woman of her day. Hardy kept us informed of the landscape, weather and all living things in Tess's environment, which I found breathtaking on many occasions. He painted the picture of his perfect woman. So perfect that he didn't want anyone to have her because he loved her himself. I enjoyed Tess very much."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me.

For no reason other than her own naivet&eacute; is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare.

Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental!

It's a novel about the destruction of innocence with two of the most complex male characters in fiction; Alec, who seems like the archetypal pantomime villain but never abandons Tess, and Angel, the bad harp player who appears to be a perfect lover but who turns out to be a hypocrite of the highest order. The famous Stonehenge scene at the end is almost poetry, which is the way Hardy was heading in his career.

From the very beginning, Tess comes alive. Her parents are witless drunks with two many children, and Tess must care for them. When news comes to her idiot of a father that once the Durbeyfields were the D'Ubervilles, a family with a famous past, money and land, her life takes some terrible turns.One of the best things about this book is that it is not happy-go-lucky. When terrible things happen to her, Tess has no where to go. If you want to see what life for women was like, you can easily find out through Tess.The end is very unexpected, and absolutely perfect, and very satisfying as well. I didn't need to know what happened next, I wasn't dying to read a sequel, I was content.For you people who love happy books, that have happy endings, middles, everything- read something by Jane Austen. If you are into reality, check this book out."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is possibly the saddest novel I have ever read. I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it. Few novels have evoked so much emotion in me. Tess makes me feel sad, frustrated, and angry.Tess of the Durbervilles is the story of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of poor, alcoholic parents who learn that they are of a noble bloodline and send Tess off to work for her noble \\"cousin\\" Alec Durberville. While there, Alec rapes Tess and she has his illegitimate baby. This event ruins Tess's life. She is no longer pure, and virginal, and therefore brings shame upon her true love Angel Clare when her past is revealed.It is hard to believe, in this day and age, that Tess is shamed and ostracized because she was the victim of a horrible crime. Hardy's novel is a powerful statement on the questionable morality of Victorian society. Tess, who is a heroic, brave, caring, selfless woman, is not worthy of Angel because she is somehow impure due to the rape. Angel, who has lived with a woman out of wedlock and is clearly not a virgin himself, feels justified in punishing Tess when he learns of her past.The writing is beautiful, but the story tragic. It will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I love all of Hardy's books but this is my favorite thus far. The ending is definately not what I expected and I could not stop thinking about it for days afterward. It is a break from his earlier works in that things do not really turn out for the better in the end. In typical Hardy style, people and events in the main characters past come back to bite her in the behind at the worst moments. This story is like a powder keg which is gradually packed over time until the fuze is lit and everything explodes into a million pieces."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I think Thomas Hardy is an interesting mixture of romantic poet and social realist novelist although his dramas take place in primarily rural settings. The poetic strain in Hardy's temperament makes him romanticize some of the same things the romantic poets did. For instance few settings in his work are more powerfully evocative than a ruin. And his sense that we are at the mercy of both nature and our own emotions makes reading a Hardy novel a bit like reading romantic poetry. So if you like romantic poetry especially the bleaker of those poems you will like Hardy's novels. Tess was made into a great film by Roman Polanski in 1979(and another more recent film version appeared on A&amp;E) and it is hard for a Victorian novel to compete with that kind of entertainment but what the novel has that the movie versions do not is Hardy's descriptions of landscape. You may remember a scene from the (Polanski)movie when Tess is walking through a field and as beautiful as that scene was visually it is even more beautiful to read Hardy describe it poetically linking Tess to nature in a very sensuous prose passage. Hardy is not known for his optimism ( most romantics aren't after all so very optimistic) and both his prose and poetry seem to seek out the starkest surrondings and settings to offset and emphasize the fleeting nature of those rare moments of beauty. If you like spending time in the country this novel is a kind of hike back in time and into the countryside where men and women live out their days affected by forces they cannot altogether explain and that conspire in ways that do not lead down the rosiest of paths. Most of the men in this novel are weak, but Tess's strength which is perhaps linked to her heritage makes this an unusual and powerful story. She is perhaps the best bit of poetry Hardy ever came up with. She is certainly the strongest thing ever to appear in a Hardy landscape."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Much else has been said.

Such a tale!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy really outdid himself with the creation of this novel. Tess is the quintessential protagonist to pity, sympathize with, and root for. Wronged by at least three men--her father, her cousin, and her husband--she remains pure in every sense by the corporeal. There is an overriding sense of despair that pervades the novel. Yet, what's a Hardy novel without that feeling?With this book, Hardy solidified his place as my favorite author. The author's ability to perfectly describe the English countryside, the charm, yet provinciality of the country folk, and the repressiveness of Victorian morals, makes this book one of his best. His subtlety often makes the reader question what it is that he just read, and leaves many things open to interpretation. Thus, as with many good texts, rereading it might lead to different understandings of different scenes that took place.All in all, there are few books that I have read that have made me want to give up sleep just to read them.

The story begins when her impoverished family is informed that they are descended from a local wealthy clan. Her family sets about trying to better their situation by having Tess approach their distant relatives; unfortunately, this decision results in Tess meeting the devious Alec d'Uberville, who agrees to help Tess, with the intent of seducing her. Despite being the victim, Tess is the one who will pay over and over again.Hardy has created a genuine masterpiece. The characters are complex - even the seemingly simple Tess. The incredibly sad story is used to explore human nature and the ways in which people treat each other. I found myself highlighting passage after passage of the book and noting the fundamental human truths Hardy describes. I was particularly struck by a passage in which, after her seduction, Tess ponders, \\"The past was past; whatever it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them.\\" She further muses, \\"To all mankind besides, [she] was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought.\\" How true, but unfortunately, Tess' past would never stop haunting her.When Tess meets the aptly names Angel Clare, she thinks that she has finally put the past behind her. Angel accepts her unquestioningly. Once again, though, fate intervenes and Tess is made to suffer for her past misdeeds, which are not really even misdeeds. At times, her victimhood is a bit much, and Tess appears weak, but her treatment is reflective of the sexual mores of the time, and Tess's willingness to endure mistreatment to protect her family and others is noble. The plot marches toward tragedy, with Tess managing to miss every opportunity for happiness. A truly devastating book.Note: This review is for the Kindle Duke Classics version. The text has fairly few noticeable errors aside from a few scattered misspellings. Occasionally, a paragraph has not been indented properly. However, these problems are minor and do not impinge much on the reader. The only major issue is that the Table of Contents is not linked, which is a hassle with such a long book.

Because of the bleeping Introduction, which gives everything away! Please!

As the production follows faithfully all the key plot of the story, it really helped me with the book. In lieu of this, read the Wikipedia entry which outlines the plot in depth.The book is wonderful for analysis and discussion. There are many questions that can be created. The book has a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing.For instance, after Angel Clare and Tess marry, Angel finally learns from Tess why she has hesitated for so long to marry him. He mentions once that the only way he can feel released from his difficulty with her past is if Alex D'Urberville was no longer alive. One wonders if this is a seed planted in Tess' subconscious. Technically, Tess had no real functional reason to murder Alex. He was no woman beater, Angel had finally reached the point he needed to be in in order to accept Tess again, etc.The very first scene of the book is the cornerstone that starts the sealing of Tess' destiny and fate and nothing she does or doesn't do from then on can stay her from this. Her father's learning of the real family name of D'Urberville and not Derbyfield leads her to meeting up with Alex, her rape/seduction, subsequent pregnancy, inability of initially being able to marry the love of her life (Angel Clare), Angel's initial inability to live with his new wife, Tess' murder of Alex and her ultimate fate by a hanging execution.To me, the whole of the book is greater than it's individual parts. That is it's ultimate greatness. One can criticize the hugely long section of Angel and Tess' courtship at Talbothays Dairy where Angel/Tess seem to go on endlessly coming together and falling apart as Tess struggles with whether Angel can accept her if she tells him all the details of her past. (And then the subsequent hugely long time it took Angel to come to see a way to have a full married life and future with Tess.) But I took this time to appreciate Hardy's writing style, the way he uses Nature as a character in and of itself, to learn the real and authentic \\"what it was like to live\\" in that time in England, etc.I don't feel inclined to pass a negative judgment on Tess. In many ways she was the most moral, strong, and contemplative of everyone. Alex attempted to turn good by becoming a traveling evangelist but couldn't keep up the pretense. Angel, who rejected the more obviously suited to his moral viewpoints (Mercy Chant) to choose his more emotionally compatible love, Tess, had to undergo a huge personal struggle to rise above his concerns over what society would think of them. Angel's concerns were such that he states that even if they traveled as far off as America or Australia, that they couldn't be really certain Tess' past wouldn't come to affect them and even said it could continue to affect even the lives of their children. I really felt that Angel had the weakest courage of all the various main characters.Tess, on the other hand, continuously makes tough choices in life. At times, she uses pride to keep her head up and at other times, leaves pride aside to choose paths she feels benefits her family, her ability to be a good friend, to support herself honestly and the like. For her, love should conquer all and she struggles valiantly to understand Angel's point of view.I definitely will be reading more of Hardy's novels."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The shipper sent an email immediately that they were on vacation so would be cancelling the order.

Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"How amazing. Thomas Hardy actually makes you fall in love with his leading lady, Tess, yourself. Other reviewers have complained she allowed herself to be walked on; that is not true.

It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside. Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection. Each lingers in your heart. The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste. Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically. Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of. From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom. I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise. It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader. Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book. Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings. This book WILL affect you! It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"My review is based on the Oxford Classics Edition.Thomas Hardy seems to have been interested mostly in sad, unhappy characters who lead troubled, disappointing lives, struggle against fate, and lose. There is beauty in artistically represented sadness, though, and notably so if we are only spectators. I am not giving away the ending by writing that &quot;Tess&quot; is a sad novel. I think most people who choose to read this book do so because they know it is a sad story, or they have read Hardy before. In my case, I had to read it for school, and what truly surprised me is the ambiguity that Hardy so masterfully portrays in order to make his heroine more of a real person instead of a mere character. By the book's end we really do not know whether Tess was raped or seduced by Alec; whether he took advantage of a sleeping girl and forced himself upon her, or she allowed it in a moment of weakness, tired after a strenous day and grateful to him for &quot;saving&quot; her from the other workers. However it happened, Tess's life is radically changed after the fact and this event will have grave consequences for her and Alec.The ambiguity is troubling with the entrance of Angel, the hypocrite who falls in love with Tess because she looks angelic, virginal, and beautiful as a child, but rejects her when she tells him that she is not a virgin (therefore not a child) anymore. Her other qualities are there, but Angel equates purity with virginity --something many people still do when it refers to women-- so he can construct a perfect excuse for his terrible behaviour towards the woman he has said he loved. In spite of the forebodings that Hardy drops before Chapter 35, this particular chapter, at the beginning of Phase the Fifth, is very powerful and almost surprising in its intensity. The level of troubling ambiguity goes up several notches at the end of the novel, when it appears that Angel may indeed get his &quot;little girl&quot; as a replacement for the one he just lost.&quot;Tess&quot; is a sad and beautiful story. There is much more to write about this novel, but I have decided to concentrate on what Hardy seems to have intended when he wrote so beautifully about so sad a theme, but in such an ambiguous way. He calls Tess &quot;A Pure Woman,&quot; and she is that. But as only a truly great writer would, he does not present her as an outright victim: there are plenty of opportunities for Tess to escape Alec before they have sex, and plenty of opportunities for her to deal in a different way with the cruel hand that fate has dealt her. She does not escape Alec, and she chooses Angel (rotten luck with men). There are tragic flaws in Tess, and that is what makes her human while making &quot;Tess&quot; into a true tragedy. Hardy knows this. His prose is elegant and, at times, it reads more like poetry, going from good to beautiful.This edition of the novel is helpful, but it could be better. I prefer foot-notes rather than end-notes. If they have to be end-notes, they should have numbers. The Introduction by Simon Gatrell is original, although I do not agree with its main premises: that there are two Thomas Hardys at work in &quot;Tess,&quot; and that &quot;A Pure Woman&quot; refers not to purity, but to &quot;essential, wholly&quot; woman. This is valid as an opinion but unsupported by evidence. I recommend &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles.&quot; If you have never read Hardy, read this. If you have read him, you know what to expect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"But if you get the Wordsworth Classics edition, don't read the introduction until you finish! I'm going to make this standard practice for all classics from now on. I was hoping for some background on Hardy but before I even realized what had happened I'd read a summary of the entire story in one paragraph, plot twists and all. And it really did ruin the climactic last couple chapters for me. I hate it when editors / publishers assume that if a novel is famous and critically acclaimed then the reader must already be familiar with the story. Completely false: In this day and age reading for pleasure isn't as widespread as it used to be and the old classics are fading into the distance. The story in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is certainly not common knowledge anymore, so when you discover a gem like this I beg you not to ruin it for yourself by reading the canned introduction.Still a fabulous read, certainly. The story centers on the simple, sincere, hard-working farmgirl Tess Durbeyfield who is fated to stumble into a few serious and unfortunate challenges over the couple years that the novel spans. Hardy spins a truly magnificently written and plotted tale in narrating poor Tess's adventures & mishaps.I read another Hardy classic, Far From the Madding Crowd, several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. For the life of me I can't remember any of the story in that novel except that the central character was rather strange, but a few pages of \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" instantly resurrected my memories of Hardy's unmatched power of narration. He truly brings every scene and character to full animation and vitality, does the poignant scenes full justice, and even handles humorous situations with aplomb.Easily five stars, one of the best classics I've ever read.

The ending is very sad.Through it all Tess maintains her dignity and is a very likeable character. This novel shows the extreme cruelty of legalistic morality that is not tempered by compassion and respect for others, particularly women during this time period.The book is very well written if you like poetic descriptions and vivid imagery.

Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as \\"damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around\\"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"if i'm being truly honest most 'classics' leave me cold. Pride and prejudice ? Bored me rigid. The amabassadors ? A guaranteed way to induce sleep. Remembrance of things past ?

Tess was a page turner , populist in the best way and strangely, considering cinema hadn't been invented yet , rather cinematic in it's description and creation of scenes . Even the passages that described the countryside add to the overall feel and mood of the book, rather than just describe for describing sake . As for the reviewers who accuses Hardy of being verbose, I can only say that for the time he's positvely Hemingwayesque.Yes, the book is a little melodramtic and if it wasn't for all the tragedy and downbeat ending you could see it being made into a mini series on tv but frankly.... what's wrong with that ? It's precisely this approachability that lets Hardy get you thnking about issues like women's rights , men and women's relation to each other and predeterminism.Finally to those that say Angel and Alec's behaviour is inconsistent .I can not agree. Alec is exactly the kind of person who rushes from one passionate extreme to another and Angel is exactly the kind of idealist who has trouble excepting the realities of life and the failings of the average person.Finally a word on Tess herself .She is one of the sexiest characters i've ever seen written in victorian fiction .It interests me that a man should write such a character and then have her killed as if such beauty (both internally and externally) can't be allowed to exist on the earth becuase of men like him, me and maybe you...."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Bleak and depressing, as far as the plot is concerned it's sort of like Hardy was experimenting with how many terrible things he could make happen to a trusting, wonderful person, until she's finally crushed under the weight of the world and her society. Really makes you feel awful to read it, honestly, but that's ok because the writing is beautiful and the structure is flawless. There are moments of pure poetry on a Shakespearean level, that make you want to weep for all humanity. The characters, especially Tess, are very believable, and the psychology effecting their decisions is what drives the story, for me. I'm impressed, I'm going to read more Hardy. I've looked around and it seems like most of his books are similar - a great set-up to a disaster, all the while people's hearts being ripped out of their chests and their hopes and dreams crushed one after another by a cruel world and cruel circumstances. He obviously had a pretty tragic and pessimistic view of our human situation, but a view that must have filled him with sympathy. He really goes into his characters' heads and makes you feel their pain through it all, going through the stages of their grief, with really amazing descriptions that feel dead on. Or at least that's what he did in this book.Also, it's pretty amazing that he blatantly pointed out the sexual double standards of his time and their utter hipocrysy. It's so crazy that people in Hardy's day were outraged after the publication of this book by the subtitle, \\"A Pure Woman,\\" because Tess was raped.

I was actually weeping audibly at times. These characters are so real you feel as if you know them. I found myself yelling at them as if somehow I could intervene in their lives. Thomas Hardy is a poetic genious with the ability to create people and places vividly awake in your mind. Is there anyone out there who can write like this anymore?

In short, it is a passionate statement about man's cruelty to a woman.This book understands the differences between man and woman, and for the most part, it is not complimentary to men. Exceptions exist. \\"The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.\\"And during the hard times inflicted upon her, Tess refuses to reproach those men who made her life a miserable existence. It starts with her father, whose newfound nobility engage him in a mead house where he misses a deadline, requiring her to carry on the family business, which results in a horrible accident and family economic loss. From there, she must endure hard work, be sexually mistreated by an employer, move away from her castigated self from a problem to which she had no cause, live a life as a simple milk maid, and then marry.When she marries, it seems that all is well. But, her husband, when discovering during their honeymoon that her flower was violated (even though without permission) by one before him, immediately exiles himself to Brazil and leaves her in poverty and public humiliation. Her life is not good - and she knows it: to the point where she contemplates suicide.But, one day, when walking in the woods she sees maimed birds (hunting's collateral damage) which slowly walk about to a cruel and painful demise. When seeing their tortured final moments on earth, she says, \\"Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o' such misery as yours!\\" \\"And not a twinge of bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and not bleeding, and I have two hands to feed and clothe me.\\" She is miserable, but she understands the relativity of such emotion.Men in this book really have to take the blame. Like the hunters who irresponsibly leave half-shot birds to limp to their graves, her husband must atone for his terribly misguided and failed judgment of her and her unwelcomed sexual experience. She was by modern standards too young to consent, and certainly did not consent. And, after years of review of the issue, her husband concludes what modern men would have been capable of doing in moments - ask for her forgiveness and pity her. \\"Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate.\\"But, this is not a love story with undertones of happy endings. Shakespearean in many ways, devoted to tragic ending, this book raises the title character to sainthood. And, like most tragedies, only the cold can complete the final pages without welled eyes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", first published in 1891, is set in Dorset (or \\"South Wessex\\" as Hardy called it) during the latter part of the nineteenth century. It tells the story of Teresa (\\"Tess\\") Durbeyfield, a beautiful and innocent country girl who is seduced by a wealthy gentleman, gives birth to his illegitimate child, and is eventually, after numerous vicissitudes of fortune, hanged for his murder.This was a controversial subject in late Victorian England, although perhaps not as controversial as we might think. Today we like to flatter ourselves that all great nineteenth century writers were effectively twenty-first century spirits avant la lettre, voices crying out in the wilderness against the hypocritical moral code of their contemporaries, and therefore doomed to be misunderstood by a scornful bourgeoisie. The truth is always more complex than that. In the case of \\"Tess\\", the subject of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood was not unprecedented in English literature; Dickens, for example, had dealt with it in \\"Bleak House\\", as had Elizabeth Gaskell in \\"Ruth\\". The reception afforded to the novel was by no means uniformly hostile; indeed, Hardy himself admitted in the preface to a later editions that \\"by far the majority\\" of reviewers had \\"generously welcomed the tale\\".Hardy was a countryman, and all of his novels are set in the rural area of South-West England which he named Wessex. He had not only a deep feeling for the English countryside but also the ability to convey this feeling in vivid descriptive prose. This is not, however, mere description for description's sake; the landscape becomes a vital part of the structure of his novels- at times it can almost be regarded as a character in them- and Hardy uses description of the natural scene in order to amplify his descriptions of his characters' feelings.There are two passages in \\"Tess\\" which particularly exemplify this. The first comes when the heroine, following the death of her illegitimate son, is working as a dairymaid on a farm in the Frome valley in southern Dorset; it is here that she meets Angel Clare, the man who is to become the great love of her life. The second comes when Tess has been abandoned by Angel, after he discovered the truth about her past, and is forced to find work on a farm on the Dorset Downs, slightly further north. The scenes set in the valley take place in summer, and Hardy's writing is dominated by images of heat, of ease, of fertility and of luxuriant growth, symbolising the burgeoning growth of Tess's hopes for her future happiness. The scenes set on the bare, stony Downs take place in winter, and the imagery is of cold, of hardship and of bleakness, symbolising the dashing of those hopes.In this novel Hardy's powers of description are matched by his powers of characterisation. There have been few, if any, male English novelists who have had such a gift for creating memorable female characters- Dickens' heroines are pale and insipid by comparison- and Tess is perhaps his greatest. The author used to speak of her as though she were a real person, and wrote \\"I have not been able to put on paper all that she is, or was, to me\\". If it were possible to fall in love with a fictional character, I would have fallen in love with Tess and so, I suspect, would most of Hardy's readers.Another feature of the book is that it reads as both of its time and timeless. It is not set in some unchanging Arcadian landscape but in the real English countryside of the late nineteenth century, a period of rapid social change. Agriculture was becoming increasingly mechanised; one key scene takes place while Tess is operating a steam-powered threshing machine. The position of the traditional landed gentry was being challenged by the rise of a new moneyed class, a phenomenon illustrated by the history of Tess's own family. The start of her tragedy is the discovery, by a local antiquary, that she is a descendant of the aristocratic and once-powerful d'Urberville family, of whose surname her own is a corruption. Her seducer goes by the name Alec d'Urberville, and Tess mistakenly believes him to be a distant cousin, but in reality he is neither a relation nor an aristocrat, but a parvenu. His father, a wealthy financier from Northern England, changed the family name (originally Stoke) when he purchased a Dorset country estate.The countryside has also been changed by new learning and ways of thinking which have challenged the power of old ideas. Although Tess is from a poor family, she is significantly better educated than her parents' generation. Hardy describes the gulf between Tess and her simple, superstitious mother Joan as being as great as that between the Victorian and Jacobean eras. Angel, the freethinking son of a pious clergyman, represents the growing force of religious scepticism, although his views on sexual morality turn out to be just as puritanical as those of his father's generation. Indeed, Angel's Puritanism may be connected with his personal philosophy; he seems to have kept the Christian injunction to hate the sin while rejecting that to love the sinner.The book's timeless quality derives partly from Hardy's prose style, formal even by the standards of Victorian novelists (although Hardy can be demotic when writing dialogue for his rustic characters). This style is characterised by an elevated vocabulary and by allusions to the Bible, to Greek and Roman mythology and to Shakespeare and other English poets. These allusions help to create the idea that Tess is not just a Victorian country girl but also a tragic heroine comparable to the heroes of Shakespeare or Aeschylus. Tess's downfall can partly be attributed to the social structures of her day, which made it all too easy for a rich man like Alec to take advantage of a poor girl, but also to a tragic flaw. She may be pure and innocent, but she is also a poor judge of character, too besotted with Angel to realise how priggish and self-centred he is, making excuses for him even after his callous rejection of her.Having recently reviewed Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\", widely considered the Great Italian Novel, I started wondering what might be considered the Great British Novel, and thought I would celebrate my 100th review for Amazon by putting forward my own candidate for that honour. The book is a complex one, both in terms of its plot and of its themes, and there has not been space to do full justice to these aspects in this brief review. What I have tried to do is to set out some of the reasons why Hardy is my favourite novelist and why I regard this as the greatest of his novels. I cannot think of another novel with so loveable a central character, nor one whose plight has affected me so deeply. This is a work of immense emotional power."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy, who wrote Tess of the D'Urbervilles, also wrote one of my favorite poems, The Blinded Bird, and another wonderful one called The Darkling Thrush. He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt.

This story printed on the pages of \\"Tess\\" are more than a novel, they are a portal into the world of a blameless woman. You'll feel the pain of these characters, escpeically our heroine Tess."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"One favorable evening, Tess in her white garb attends May-Day dance in sleepy town of Marllott. A passerby not used to sophistication will incline to notice her. It is not the extravagance, nay the ostentatiousness of the girl's beauty, but the softness in spirit and demeanor conspicuous on her big, beautiful eyes that sets her apart. The same passerby endowed with experience will not pinpoint Tess among the young, comely girls as someone prone to vicissitude of tragedies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Tess Durbeyfield later known in the novel as Tess d'Urberville is the hapless victim if not the heroine of this tragic tale. Born from poor parents, she is whisk away to work for the rich d'Urberville family. There she meets Alec, the handsome scion of d'Urbervilles clan. His incessant seduction of the young maiden results in violation of her rights. Forlorn, she returns home to the embarrassment of her parents and her neighbors. Stripped of clear prospect in life, she travels miles and miles away to be a milkmaid. While in the vast dairy field of Thalbothay, Tess falls madly in love with Angel Clare, the fledgling agriculturist of noble descent, convinced to make the newcomer his wife. Thus the journey that leads Tess from one farm to another is side by side with her lamentations over the two Englishmen and becomes her heart's landscape that stretches beyond endurance.Hardy, an architect by tuition, molds his male characters in an anvil of insensitivity. Their frozen hearts incapable of thawing by burning tears of a woman's pleading. As to his female character like Tess, Hardy constructs her similar to obelisk with solid foundation of faith that gradually narrows at the peak.Unsurprisingly, Victorian society scorned Hardy when this novel came out in 1891. The way he chose to describe Tess and her violation were less subtle in comparison to Eliot's writings. At present society however, Thomas Hardy is as impeccable as the clock ticking on the wall. He is in command of his story as if time is in command of denizens elsewhere. Under no circumstance he pauses to please his readers. He continues and takes them where nothing exists but the certainty of time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is among the best novels I have read when judged on its purely literary merits. Hardy's command of imagery in his creation of the nuanced satire of society and the values it imposes upon Victorian women is outstanding. And, Hardy uses nature to structure the novel and reflect the plot. He is also able to introduce a fatalist approach to the characters' actions that flows seamlessly with his characterization of them. However, Tess is more than an invaluable piece of English literature.Tess of the D'Urbervilles is also a strong insight into the forces of nature that shape our lives. It is a tale about the unlucky girl Tess, who has to endure suffering on two fronts: from the man who takes advantage of her, and the man who rejects her. She is symbolic of the person within us all, who is oppressed by the outside world, and depressed from within. She is humanity, and her story will speak to anyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I read this in about 8 hours.

Hardy does indeed capture the English landscape fairly well into his somewhat lengthy, verbose paragraphs. But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to.

It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.The ending was excellent, and rather sad.If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This book is tragic and wonderfully written. Hardy uses words to create a scene for you that creates the visual for you completely. I think that the sadest thing for me was to realize people did live like this, life really was that hard. As a 21st century woman I was outraged at the way that Tess was treated by men and by society. Who is the true bad guy, Alec or Angel? When we read it with our societies mores we perceive it one way, but if we were ken to the morals of that society how would we see it? Are they really dastards, or are they all just victims. I am not a scholar, I liked the story for being a good story.After reading the book I rented the A&amp;E movie. As I watched it, I realized how well the book translated into video, because I had already seen the exact same scenery in my mind. The only thing that surprised me was the bleakness of the trunip farm and Tesses horrible conditions. I couldn't imagine anything that awful.There are a lot of words, similar to DH Lawrence, but I wouldn't get rid of a one of them. If you come to this book as a great story and not as a classic novel, you will hold Tess to your heart and never forget her tragedies."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tess. Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35 &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot; The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The great thing about Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the poetry and the depth of the main character.Tess is an extremely complex character and yet a very simple person. It is hard to explain her:Hardy seems totally in emphatuated with his character. She is a thing of beauty like a beautiful flower growing on the road side. The flower knows nothing of why it is or how it grows, and so Tess is naive of her existance and surroundings only driven by the knee-jerk of her emotion, egged on and commented on the romantic and love struck Hardy.Hardy makes a character , falls in love with her and then day-dreams about her. Guarding her innocence amd jealously defending it by - 1)making her so complex that no other character in the book can love ,know and understand her truely.2)She ends up tragic so no one else can have her. Thus destroying her and tearing himself away from his ideal.It is true he builds her up only to tear her down. Such a tragic figure makes the reader feel a lament amd deep sorrow for Tess having tried to fathom her whilst becoming enchanted by her.I found all of this made the book frustrating and it flawed the main character. It is a very difficult, long and hard book to read- which would have made the book very hard to write by anyone other than a very idealistic romantic poet. 4 stars because I am a romantic fool for Tess as well."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the &quot;heroine&quot; she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I decided to read this book after reading the Fifty Shades series....our main character in those books,Anastasia, refers to Tess several times and identifies with her.

In an attempt to create a social connection and to gain financial assistance for her family, she entreats the d'Urbervilles to acknowledge an ancient familial connection. Unfortunately, Alec d'Urberville is taken with Tess and rapes her. Her life is haunted by his sexual assault from that point forward. Eventually, Tess begins to recuperate and finds employment elsewhere as a dairymaid. Her days as a dairymaid are happy and peaceful until she falls in love with Angel Clare. She agonizes over telling him of her tainted past, and when she confesses the truth on her wedding night, Angel is repulsed over her past and her deception of waiting to tell him. Tess is parted from her true love and never fully recovers, even when he returns to her.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is more than a sad story. It pays homage to the type of unhealthy family atmospheres that many children are raised in. The death of the horse is a direct result of her father's drunkenness and irresponsibility, though Tess never realizes this. When her parents hear of her misfortune, her mother reprimands her for not seeking marriage to the very man who raped her. The story also explores the mental effects that sexual assault can have on a person. Tess experiences extreme guilt, depression and feelings of unworthiness - common feelings for victims of sexual assault. In the end, as she is continually subjected to Alec d'Urberville, she experiences insanity which results in extreme actions.This particular edition included an introduction and notes about the text which I found helpful. However, I thought the girl on the cover did not resemble the maiden of the book. The girl on the front is plain and unremarkable, whereas, Tess, according to the text, is remarkable.I can see why this book is considered a literary classic, but I can't say I enjoyed it. That being said, I think everyone should read this book once. Tess is a memorable character that one can not help being fascinated with."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!

To the modern reader, this tale of love and morality may seem like kid stuff at first glance (they talk about more serious situations in my niece's junior high sex education class).Hardy's genius is in his incisive character portrayals and the depictions of the social and moral structure of 19th century England. Tess and her feelings and decisions stay with you long after the last page is finished. I kept wishing we had read this in college so that I could have argued with someone about the moral themes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles plays out in Shakespearean tragedy-like fashion, but maybe there is more to the word tragic in the case of Tess, being that her problems are not self-inflicted, but more in line with blind fatalism. In fact, Hardy underscores the theme of injustice playing out in the common folk's lives, with Tess being the microcosm of ill-fated individuals. The book isn't an uplifting read, but who's to say that a tragic--or even downright depressing-- novel can't have power, essentialness, importance, and beauty. Some condemn this novel as being \\"boring and depressing\\", but I would argue that there is a beauty in Hardy's prose, as he such a power in its way of making Tess' story coming to life with poetic descriptions, and this adds such an element of pathos to passages depicting her fate. Despite her suffering and pitfalls, Tess is a tragic character you feel for by novel's end, and there's a sense that Hardy is sympathizing with his tragic heroine all along.When Tess' father learns of supposed relations with a family of nobility, this sets in motion a series of events which leads to Tess leaving her family to go work at the D'Urbervilles estate in hopes of getting in good with the family. Tess' foolish father sets the tone for the themes of poor calculations and mistiming repeated in the novel. As it turns out, Tess' family is not related to the D'Urbervilles (a fact which no one from the family realizes). Tess, while here, falls under the clutches of manipulative and superficial Alec D'Urberville. Returning home pregnant and somewhat disgraced, Tess experiences more setbacks when her baby, who she names Sorrow, falls sick and dies; she cannot even get a proper Christian burial for her baby. For the duration of the novel, Tess' existence is synonymous with an emotional rollercoaster. Just as she is mourning her loss, she then goes to another place to work, where she encounters Angel Claire, a man she saw previously at a dance. Slowly, the two begin to get to know each other and fall in love, although Tess, based on earlier experiences, is mostly resistant to the idea of marriage. Tess wants Angel to know about her earlier experiences, but has a difficulty bringing herself to tell him; finally, she attempts to leave a letter, but once again fate intervenes and Angel never sees the letter. After Angel wins her over, they decide to exchange their previous indiscretions after their marriage. However, as fate seems to plague Tess, Tess is more forgiving of Angel's previous affair with an older woman than his forgiving of her relations with Alec. He can't forgive her. There is a sadness experienced as Angel leaves Tess; perhaps we feel even more pity because we know that Angel, for all his goodness, is acting a bit too impulsive and rash, hypocritical at an important moment in Tess' life. While it is a sad scene, Hardy is able to evoke great power in this moment. Tess once again finds Alec and Angel later in the novel, and each character acts in line with their character, but, as others have alluded to, the stars just seemed to be against Tess, and she makes a foolish, hasty decision.Despite this range of pathos experienced, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a powerful, poetic read, one that moves you. Hardy takes on a ride of emotions through Tess' life, and, she becomes a sort of martyr for the injustices in the world, a point that Hardy insinuates throughout. Hardy can capture the essence of detail one moment, and then invoke humanity the next. Sure, it's not a picnic reading Tess, and it is a bit emotionally draining by end, but this is a deep, emotional novel that works on many levels, one that has stood the test of time for a reason. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one novel I'm glad is required reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I know this is great literature, and I'm glad I finally read Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but I could not get past the fact that our plucky heroine Tess is a bit of a twit. While the injustices done to her may have reduced a lesser person to perpetual self-pity, Tess actually comes out the hero and pulls herself together, making a real life for her away from her family and her tormentor, Alec D'Urberville. It's only when she meets, falls in love, and marries Angel Clare that she begins acting the twit, the fool, and the loser. For some bizarre reason, she decides to be excruciatingly honest with her newly-wed husband (on their wedding night, no less), about her past trouble, involving apparently a rape, and her child born out of wedlock. I suppose it's hard for modern audiences to understand Angel's reaction (leaving her) when he realizes that she is not a virgin. Ah yes, the hypocrisy of Victorian culture. I understand that there's a huge sub-text going on in this novel about the social hypocrisy of the Victorian age, but it doesn't make sense that our formerly plucky Tess would now allow herself to fall to pieces.Great story, in all. The writing itself, however, is not great. Hardy's prose is really rambling, roundabout, and he just does not get to the point. Sure to wear out even the most patient modern reader. So, great literature, although Tess is a twit and the writing itself is rambling."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"The most depressing book in the English language. And yet, I think I was the only person in my high school English class that actually liked it. Does this mean I'm depressed? We'll leave that question for my analyst and just say I think I have a thing for melodramatic novels.Tess starts out a poor peasant girl with a drunk father and a stupid mother. After their only horse dies, they send her to their rich \\"relations\\" the D'Urbervilles, to beg for work. Her supposed cousin, Alec, rapes her and she has his child. The child dies in infancy and Tess leaves home to seek a new life and better work at a sunny dairy farm. At the dairy farm, she falls in love with a clergyman's son, Angel Clare and they get married. On their wedding night, he tells her he is not as virtuous as his name, that he went on a bender in London and slept with a prostitute. She says \\"That's great, because I'm not a virgin either - now forgive me.\\" And he's like, \\"Um, no. My hypocritical moral beliefs will not allow me to be with a woman who is 'impure'. Here's some money. I'm going to Brazil to be a farmer.\\"So he leaves her and she wanders the land again searching for work and a new life. She's doing back-breaking labor for little money on this awful farm when who should show up but...Alec D'Urberville, her rapist cousin. He's found Jesus -- until he sees Tess's face again, and then he goes back to smoking cigars and being a general d-bag. He tries to get her to marry him, so he can possess her legally. She says no multiple times, until her father dies, leaving her family with no home and no money. So her mother sells her into marriage with Alec (This is the point in the novel when you, the reader, start thinking that suicide would be a good option for Tess).Who should show up next, but Angel Clare! He's back from Brazil, having realized what a hypocrite he is. He finds Tess and begs her to be with him -- she tells him it's too late. After Angel leaves, Tess kills Alec with a bread knife. Then Tess runs after Angel, tells him what she's done and asks him to forgive her -- again. He's like \\"Whatever, we gotta get outta here. You're on the lam now.\\" So they run away and get as far as Stonehenge before the fuzz catch up with them, arrest Tess, then execute her for her crimes. The End.A fun, feel-good novel for the whole family."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Hardy writes beautifully, tells stories, evokes feelings and describes landscapes, times and cultures that touch the reader's core.Read this novel for the story and description, savor it later for the depth of existential questions and half-answers. Hardy is an early modernist, raising the big questions, describing the loss of classical innocence and hinting at potential paths to solutions. But, he does not provide definitive answers. His work suggests that the time of certain answers is permanently gone, to be replaced by a difficult journey, at best.Man has a burning need for significance and meaning, but can find neither fully. Character is the most important thing, shining through all situations ... but it is partially shaped by fate, chance, history, family, society and the environment ... and while potentially noble, ultimately inadequate to fully address the challenges of life.The reader leaves the book exhausted from the journeys, the hopes and the many pursuits. The flow of life and history continues in spite of the heroine's choices. In the end we are left with a bittersweet memory of this life which Hardy personally inserts as narrator, \\"will never be forgotten by those who knew her\\".Perhaps this is the best current answer to the ultimate questions."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles may be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel and would certainly be almost anyone else's. A dark, sweepingly tragic vision, it is a masterpiece in nearly every area: characterization, plot, meaningful themes, prose, and more.Hardy is well-known for being depressing, and this may be his most depressing novel. The structure of his dark novels is greatly influenced by Greek tragedy, and this is probably his most purely tragic. Many have thought of him as taking a near-malevolent attitude toward characters like Tess, who indeed seems born only to suffer. The concatenation of dire circumstances engulfing her is truly stunning, and perhaps even more notable is the ceaseless way in which they flow together to wreak the greatest possible devastation. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and melodramatic coincidence, and this has some of his most highly wrought examples. Tragedy of this extent requires a very deft hand to pull off well; it is all too easy to become hyperbolically implausible or even melodramatically corny. However, Tess is so well planned and finely executed that the events unfold not only with verisimilitude but almost with inevitability.This last is another distinct Hardy characteristic. He had long been an agnostic by, abandoning belief in a benevolent overseeing power - nay, in any force that took account of humanity at all. Added to this was a profound awareness of human insignificance and a consequent absence of conventional meaning. However, he wrote nearly throughout his artistic career about a concept that he eventually came to find very plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force controlling the fate of humanity and perhaps all else. Hardy is also generally considered a naturalist - a writer depicting environment as a crucial, almost insurmountable force in shaping personality and destiny. Like all of his greatest fiction, Tess dramatizes this vividly, portraying characters unable to escape wretched circumstances and even more wretched fates. Such ideas held great sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers but was almost entirely replaced by existentialism. Few will now agree with the shadowy forces underpinning the book's tragedy, but the dramatization is so well-done and stunning that it will at the very least provoke thought about important philosophical and theological issues - and of course bring admiration for Hardy's great artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is incredibly moving. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more pathos-drenched story, and Hardy runs us through a dark emotional gamut. Much of this has to do with the character of Tess, generally considered Hardy's best and seemingly his favorite. The subtitle calls her \\"A Pure Woman,\\" and so she is in a sense; an innocent, nave, and ignorant country girl of the kind no longer possible in the developed world, she is far closer - in spirit and otherwise - to people from civilization's first few thousand years than anyone from the last century or so. Hardy plays up her symbolic worth, making her a sort of Eve and giving her many pagan goddess elements. He is well-known for his heroines and generally for depictions of women far removed from Victorian stereotypes. Though not current feminist ideals, they stood out as strong individuals with real feelings and thoughts; Hardy's gender and sexuality views were well ahead of his time, greatly influencing his portrayals. Tess is his most famous, fully realized, and complex example. The most obvious sense in which she is pure is sexually and otherwise morally, but she is not the virginal domestic queen of most Victorian fiction. The pivotal scene in which she loses virginity is deliberately ambiguous, leaving it unclear if she is raped or seduced. Either way it is a sort of reverse Genesis story, as the pure woman is made impure - by Victorian standards - by a worldly, sensualistic man.Hardy uses this dramatic scene and its aftermath to boldly confront gender and sexuality issues that had always been central to his artistic concerns. He pushed the proverbial envelope in these areas from the start, often facing censorship and always struggling to get his point across in print. A few years before Tess he wrote a famous letter saying his goal was to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have a fiction at all, and Tess was his bravest and most direct attempt. She is in many ways a simple village girl but is not unaware of her beauty, and Hardy was one of the very first modern writers to even acknowledge that women could experience sexuality. We must remember this was several years before Freud revolutionized this area and also keep in mind that this was a time when statues were covered and it was not socially permissible to even mentions legs or ankles. Women were idealized as non-sexual beings meant only for domesticity and with no thoughts beyond it. It is now near-impossible to appreciate just how daring the character was or adequately convey her impact. Hardy's depiction and the issues he uses her to discuss made him world famous - the talk of high society and casual conversation as well as the literary world. For example, in his autobiography, he recalls how a society hostess told him she seated guests according to whether or not they sympathized with Tess and then had them debate. The novel received many glowing reviews but also about as many condemning it as perversely immoral. Hard as it is to believe since it was positively pass&eacute; even a few decades later, many thought it nothing less than pornographic - and a shockingly bad influence to boot. Perhaps the greatest sign of how much things have changed is that Roman Polanski's faithful 1979 film version was rated PG in the UK.This was clear reactionary hyperbole from a society so repressive that it had become pathologically hypocritical. Tess was a long overdue wake-up call. Victorians were essentially scandalized by the idea - from a man! - that it might not be a woman's fault if she is raped or seduced. This would be laughable if it were not so sad, but their offense hardly ended here. The novel vividly portrays the plight of many women at the time, especially lower class ones. Far too many women unfortunately identified strongly with Tess' problems: unsought attention from higher-class men that may have been flattering but was above all confusing; pregnancy resulting from rape or seduction without a father to raise or even acknowledge the child; suffering at the hands of grossly unfair sexual double standards from prospective and actual husbands; and, perhaps worst of all, consequent ostracism not only from society but often even from family and friends. Hardy was astounded by how many women, including quite a few high society ones, wrote him saying they were in Tess' position or a very similar one and how much the book meant to them. All this shows how strikingly well the novel dramatized contemporary issues; it is in many ways a novelistic equivalent of Henrik Ibsen's contemporaneous \\"problem plays\\" dealing with current social problems.This was a large part of the reason for Tess' impact and success, but the book would not still be so widely read and appreciated if it were the only feature. As Hardy envisioned, time has proven him right and the reactionaries wrong; the violent outbursts are now seen as perversely fascinating and mildly amusing historical curiosities, but the book's themes shine at least as brightly as ever. Feminists have unsurprisingly long had great interest in Hardy and this novel particularly, which has many themes of note to them and numerous others. Sexuality and morality aside, Tess strikes a somewhat subtle but ringing chord for women's rights via its bleak depiction of their woefully low Victorian status. Hardy movingly and accurately shows how barren life was for women, especially intelligent ones; there was not only a dearth of intellectual stimulation but hardly any stimulation at all. Sexual politics are still hotly debated and may never be resolved, but hard as it may now be to believe, rural women at the time of the novel's setting were actually kept in such ignorance that it was possible for them to not be aware of seduction even as a concept. The novel shows the tragic consequences that could so easily result from this and associated complications. Perhaps more importantly, and even more movingly, the novel also shows the grinding poverty that many rural English women faced. Worse still, it starkly portrays the consequent necessity of earning money without training, help, or encouragement. Hardy sometimes goes into considerable detail to describe the farm labor that girls like Tess had to turn to, putting particular emphasis on then-new machinery. Some may find this somewhat boring, but the point is well taken, especially as the infernal imagery used to describe the machines is particularly emphatic and highly symbolic.This leads in to some of Tess' other themes, giving the novel relevance to many with no particular interest in women's issues. Rural poverty in general - a perennial Hardy theme - is on grim display, letting readers see just how much life has improved for farmers and other laborers in the last century plus. Hardy's work is also notable for showing what one critic calls \\"the ache of modernity,\\" and Tess possibly depicts it most painstakingly and memorably. It is important to remember that Hardy grew up in a world without automobiles, electricity, railroads, and many other modern conveniences that were beginning to appear when the novel was written. Tess shows how such innovations were slowly filtering into rural England, profoundly changing a society that had altered little since the Early Middle Ages. It is thus of significant historical and sociological interest.Relatedly, and as always with Hardy, place is of great importance. Perhaps no one equals him in depicting settings with such close detail and vividness that they become an integral part of the story; setting is never mere backdrop in Hardy. Tess is one of his Wessex novels depicting the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. We get a good idea of what Hardy country looked like and how its people lived. The landscape is not as important as in some Hardy novels, but we still get an unforgettable depiction of a bygone era.But the novel is great over and above all this; one can indeed love and appreciate it without knowing any of these factors. The engrossing and profoundly moving story is a large part of this, but Tess herself is at least as important. One of literature's most sympathetic characters, readers have found her irresistible from the start. It is often said that Hardy's depiction is so idealized that he almost seems to be in love with her - and there are indeed some interesting biographical stories behind the claim -, but beauty is only one of the factors making her memorable. Hardy describes her so minutely and reveals her inner thoughts with such breathtaking force that she seems truly alive in a way very few characters do. Labeling her \\"Pure\\" caused more controversy than any other element, and perhaps all will still not agree, but it would be very hard to find another character so much more sinned against than sinning. Some of her thoughts and actions may seem extreme - or, in our greatly changed society, perhaps absurdly nave -, but only the few who have suffered comparable sorrows can say what they would do in her situation. It would take a very hard heart indeed not to feel for Tess, and the strength of her characterization, along with gut-wrenching depiction of her downward spiral, continues to fascinate and move readers - and indeed viewers, as the novel has been filmed no less than seven times and also been adapted into numerous plays, operas, etc. - more than a century after she first became a sensation.Nor is she the only worthwhile character; Tess has perhaps Hardy's largest, most varied, and most interesting cast. Though set almost entirely in Wessex, we get a good cross section of humanity: Angel Clare, who is intelligent and sensitive but selfish; his father, who is a Christian in the truest sense and a rare example of Hardy depicting a minister positively; Alec D'Urberville, the kind of hedonistically and hypocritically evil man who habitually preyed on girls like Tess; Tess' father, an alcoholic and possibly insane deadbeat of the kind who may first seem harmless and even comical but who inadvertently lead many rural families to ruin; and Tess' mother, who though well-meaning, has a combination of harsh practicality and ignorance leading to near-Machiavellian scheming that often has unforeseen negative consequences. Characterization is not Hardy's acknowledged strength, but this proves that he was on par with the greatest writers here as well as elsewhere.Another of the book's biggest and most easily recognizable assets is incredible prose. Hardy was a poet at heart, and it shows. An autodidact, he has a distinct style with a strong self-taught air that can be hard for current readers to immediately grasp; his eccentric vocabulary, full of archaisms and \\"dictionary words,\\" and his heavy use of dialect can easily make his work seem stilted and older than it is. However, this is the apex of his prose as prose; its beauty and power are simply undeniable. Though a very dark novel, the writing often reaches heights of sublime beauty, and philosophical asides about humanity's insignificance, the absence of providence, fate's apparent malice, and social stigmas' drastic effects are immaculately phrased and stunningly forceful. The narration during Tess' lonely ride, the short segment with her son, and the final chapter is almost unmatched in literature, and the writing throughout is incredibly strong - so much so, indeed, that the book would be worth reading for it alone.In reality, of course, there are many other reasons. Elevated prose and other complexities may mean it is not the best Hardy introduction, and new readers would probably be better off with more accessible masterpieces like The Return of the Native or The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some who have read Tess first have also said they found it so depressing that they vowed never to read Hardy again, but its undeniable greatness forced nearly all to break the vow. Thus, whether you read Tess first or not, Hardy is a must read for any serious lover of literature, and Tess is at or near his considerable summit."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"There are many good things I could say about this novel: it is excellently written, the characters are vivid, the message is clear and important, the setting is richly textured and gives a detailed glimpse into the past, and it is never boring.Yet, one thing I cannot say is that it was a fun read. Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \\"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities.

Worth reading"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I am irritated and unnerved to see such poor reviews for Hardy's novel \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\". Hardy's style is not to everyone's taste; some argue that it is laboured and far too flowery, and this may be true in some cases, but the moral message and the profound nature of this novel far outweigh the archaic style of writing that Hardy chooses to adopt.The novel, as the title suggests, focuses on one woman in Victorian England. Her foolish and drunken father finds that he is the descendant of the ancient and landed family of the d'Urbervilles, and Tess is sent by her parents to meet one of her descendants in order to get some help from the family's financial difficulties. Alec d'Urbervilles then seduces Tess, and she is left, with illegitimate child, to deal with the consequences.After her child dies, she finds work on a farm and falls in love with Angel Clare. She feels that she cannot marry him because of her past, and, after his insistence, gives into her heart and marries him, although consumed by guilt. Eventually she confesses her past, and Angel leaves her, travelling to Brazil without her.This is not, as one reviewer described it, \\"like a bad TV movie\\". Hardy's novel is a comment on Victorian society. Tess is the ultimate victim, as many have pointed out, but she is not the victim because she chooses to be, but because society puts her in this position. Those who criticise her for being weak and being unlike any other \\"feisty\\" women in other nineteenth century novels forget that, unlike characters such as Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennet, Tess was poor; and that, unlike Jane Eyre, Tess was raped. Tess is the perfect example of a blameless woman who cannot escape from the confines of society. Arguably the point of the novel is that Tess cannot change how people perceive her, and, because she has no means to support herself, she has to hide the truth and battle on with the terrible injustice that has been done to her. Victorian society would simply have ostracised a woman who had had an illegitimate child and not married the father, no matter the circumstances, so I find it deplorable that people feel that Tess was spineless when she was placed in such an impossible position.Also, any new reader, and, indeed, any old reader who hasn't accepted this point yet, should perhaps try to understand that Tess is suffering, throughout the novel, from terrible grief, guilt and depression, which is surely enough to earn anyone's sympathy, not their scorn. Hardy did not invent a \\"cocker spaniel\\" of a woman; she is a literary construct and is used in a wider sense to illustrate those taken advantage of in Victorian society; and the only reason she comes back \\"for more\\" punishment is because she cannot escape it, no matter how she tries.Additionally, it has been claimed that Hardy's characters are one-dimensional and contradictory. I take issue with this. Alec may be one-dimensional in some senses, but he is an unremittingly unpleasant person; it destroys the comment being making if Alec was an abused child, or in any way a redeemable person. And yes, Alec is turned into a preacher, but anyone who believes that he sincerely let go of his previous persona must not have understood his character properly. It is a perfect way of introducing him again into the story, and a perfect way to illustrate his own falseness, by comparing him with Angel's father, who is the Good Samaritan. It is the contrast between what Tess could have chosen and what she did - in fact, arguably, not meeting Angel's father is the only mistake that SHE makes (opposed to outside forces placing decisions upon her).Angel on the other hand is in no way one-dimensional. Although his opinion of Tess does change rapidly, it is not unbelievable on careful reading. He likes to think of himself as a maverick and someone outside of society's rules, but he is an excellent portrayal of how we all are constructs of our society. Angel, although he loves Tess, keeps referring to the fact that she is \\"pure\\", which she is not (through no fault of her own). This is a clear indication, early on in the novel, that Angel has painted himself a false image of his bride-to-be, and, for all his good qualities, he is as flawed as the next person. I fail to see how this is a shallow portrayal of a character.Tess is also not a nonsensical, weak being, but a beautiful, sad creation of Hardy's used to show injustices, and highlight practises that should be stopped. Besides that, in her own right, she is a clever, melancholy character who really should inspire the reader's pity.I have no objections with people who dislike this novel because they dislike the style or because they dislike some character development for sensible reason; but when people decide to abuse a novel because they don't seem to have bothered to read into it properly, I find it irritating to say the least. This novel requires people to put themselves in the place of another and feel sympathy with another person.One reviewer commented that the novel was ill-received when it came out, and should have stayed that way. The novel was considered offensive because of the implied sexual context and because of its criticisms of Victorian morals, but this does not make it a bad novel; this means that it encourages people to think, to question and to re-evaluate. Any novel that is so brave as to find an injustice in society and write a whole novel criticising it deserves our praise; and Hardy's writing, far from doing the idea down, only helps to elevate the moral: that society can be wrong."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Having just finished this book a mere few hours ago the pain of it is fresh in my mind, but I'm sure it will distract me for weeks, such is the intensity of this tragedy. The only other novel of Hardy's I have ever read - Jude the Obscure - was a good book, stable and interesting, though not compelling until it's heart-wrenching twist three quarters of the way through the book. It was, in essence, more a social commentary, so it was with some surprise that I absorbed the constant emotion and passion that was this book. The basic storyline is as follows: Tess Durbeyfield, a young woman of a poor country family, is sent to visit her rich cousin, Alec d'Urbeville, after learning of her (perhaps mythical) relation to the ancient family which bears his name. In the obscure randomness that fate casts over life, innocent Tess is then pursued by perhaps the only man she could never tolerate (Alec), who is as his most evil in the early parts of the book. At Alec's house Tess works as a keeper to the poultry and is assaulted by Alec's constant sexual attentions until finally (and this is suggested rather than explained), exhausted and numb, she submits to intercourse with him. She later gives birth to a baby, whom she names Sorrow, who soon dies; and then meets a man she had glimpsed once years before at a dance: Angel Clare. Working together at a milking farm, they become drawn to each other despite Tess's unwillingness to incite the attentions of any man. Their love for each other grows but Tess knows that she dare not enter into marriage considering her past and a society that is both ludcrously religious and prejudiced. The strength of her love finally wears her down and they wed. However, on that very night she confesses her past, and is cruelly thrown aside by Clare, who now begins to view her as an impure woman separate to the Tess he had always loved (despite his past containing a similar history). After suffering years of solitutde and hardship, Tess finally gives up on Clare and falls in the way of Alec d'Urbeville again, relying upon him for the care of herself and her family. Sick and wasted, Clare eventually realizes the mistake he has made in casting Tess aside and finds her at d'Urbeville's mansion: too late. This brings the story to its close where greater tragedy ensues.The book was brilliant in its emotive persuasion and its depiction of Tess, who is impossible to not feel for, and, indeed, love. The misfortunes of her life are never self-inflicted, and we are left to wonder at the end at the awful nature of a world that would bring such sorrow upon one person. Tess is wonderful, stoic, and pure in her unyielding love for Clare; d'Urbeville is horrible in his initial portrayal as the villain who will singlehandedly destroy Tess's life, though is perhaps a little less repulsive at the end as one understand's the depths of his feeling for her; and Clare is the one who holds in his hands the ability to restore all past wrongness and find joy himself, but tragically fails to do so because of pride and convention.Overall, there were only two problems I had with the storyline: the first being Tess's succumbing to Alec's sexual persuasion in the beginning - if we are to believe that she is repulsed so many times by Alec's advances so completely and bodily, how are we to believe that she so easily concedes in one (unmentioned) incident? Her strength is greater than that. And the second is one which has been mentioned by another reviewer here: the ending, where a minor, unimportant character is introduced as a means through which to resolve everything, where in fact she is incapable of doing so, since we know nothing about this character, and can therefore put no faith in her.Despite these minor quibbles the whole of the book, with its engaging plot and brilliant prose, is worth more than the sum of its parts, with the pain of lost love being the principle effect one experiences long after the reading is over. Tess is beautiful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction.

Her parents (and especially her father) are greatly heartened by the news that they are, however distantly, nobility. Tess is therefore sent to her richer relations, the d'Urbervilles of Trantridge, to claim kinship and benefit from their superior finances.Upon taking her position as a bird-tender, Alec D'Urberville is captivated by Tess's natural country beauty and seduces her. Tess is an innocent, and she returns home to bear her child. After bringing shame upon her family, Tess must attempt to build a respectable life out of a situation that denies her every particle of respectability she once had.Hardy writes in a rather long-winded, flowery style. His vocabulary is rich, but it can become tediously melodramatic at times. The plot of this novel is full of coincidences that seem rather implausible, but it is a wonderful portrayal of the prejudices of society. Tess is an absolutely heartbreaking character, enduring trial after trial silently, feeling it is her due.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a solid read, but be prepared to be thoroughly depressed and disillusioned with society at its finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another.

As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels.

Through this book, Hardy addresses issues that society in his day didn't want to face: the fate of the farm worker in the increasingly industrialized society, predjudices held against minority groups, and the inequality of women. All of this is not to say that this is a dry or boring work -- &quot;Tess&quot; is gripping, riveting, and almost overpowering in its emotional appeal. One cannot read this book without becoming involved in Tess's situation. I have never been so angry with a character in a book as I was with Angel Clare at a certain point in the novel.

This is one of the standout pieces of literature of its time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" describes the experiences of a woman who, through no fault of her own, falls outside of the moral code of the Victorian era in which she lives and suffers long-reaching consequences as a social outcast. Hardy's novel is carefully well-drawn, but the novel's content demands far more than Hardy could acceptably give it in the nineteenth century. For example, the rape scene is only is carefully stepped around, inferrable only from the fact that Tess subsequently has a child; Hardy also has to carefully frame some of the scenes, such as that of Alec d'Urberville's murder, in order to avoid too closely examining the psyche of the criminal. Hardy's writing is at its best in the scenes surrounding Angel and Tess's estrangement - a safe enough environment - when he can freely move within the minds of his characters. In short, \\"Tess\\" is the stuff of a twentieth-century novel written in the nineteenth, which leaves some of the emotion that modern readers are accustomed to lacking."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Even reviewing Tess makes me choke back tears. Hardy develops one of the most truely beautiful female characters in all of English literature; then, like an evil wizzard, slowly tears her to shreds and finally grounds her into dust.A modern young woman growing up now might find it hard to identify with Tess. She is a poor farm worker and a product of the cultural changes at the beginning of the industrial revolution in England. But there is enough of a study of basic human nature here to make her story valuable to just about any reader.Hardy's prose is gifted, deep descriptive narative and character development. You may end up loving Tess; it's hard not to hate Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"There are many 1-star reviews for this particular novel and I have to admit that I am rather confused. Many people lament the fact that Tess is somewhat of a weak woman, not a strong woman, defying Victorian convention and fighting for the rights of women. I'm not entirely sure why Tess's tragic and weak personality has people so up in arms enough to say that the book is terrible and unrealistic.Personally, I found this to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I didn't find the text to be as easy to read as some of the other reviewers, and I was an English Lit major in college! It is difficult to get through in parts, you will yawn every so often, but fight through it-- use your brain and you won't regret it!The story is tragic and offers very little in the way of an explanation for Tess's extreme punishment. So if you are looking for a book about a woman who fights convention and social injustice, go read something else. If you want a story that illustrates the cruelty of fate, comments on the injustices of the world, or a shows how, if one doesn't fight, one can be trapped by the past... read this book.I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This was the first Thomas Hardy novel I read, and it is still one of my favorites. The hypocritical late 19th century society views, and the strains they put on the human spirit. Hardy had a keen eye for what went on around him, and he was aware of how the old ways were being replaced - Edwardian enlightment was on it's way but Tess is the symbol of land of Wessex itself, violated, forsaken, and like the wounded birds she finds, longing to be put out of her suffering, despite how she endures until her situation becomes even more unbearable. Christian versus pagan, rural versus urban, her true love's struggle from his family's religious views and the restrictions of society's rules, end up costing Hardy's herione more than himself. Young Tess Durbeyfield, daughter of a poor farmer, finds herself at the mercy of a ne'er do well scoudrel, Alec d'Urberville, thought to be a wealthy relative. The girls' parents, in their naivete and ignorance, put their eldest child on a disasterous path in an attempt to improve their situation and trade on the ancient and noble family name. Tess's situation makes her an outcast, after giving birth to the cad's baby son who dies not long after birth, but she never asks for pity, and finds work at a dairy farm, only to fall in love with a provinicial minister's son, Angel Clare, who cannot forgive her past. Tragedy ensues at nearly every turn.***some spoilers herein***I think both men were unforgivable, both were terrible to Tess in different ways. Granted, Angel was nowhere near the controlling cad that Alec was, and yes Tess loved Angel. Alec thought his wealth could buy Tess's affection and possession was love. For Angel, since Tess didn't fit his idealized version of her, and that she wasn't a virgin (never mind the fact that she was raped), he couldn't bear that and took to the hills like a coward. His hypocrisy is maddening, especially since he considered himself to be such a free thinker and more open-minded than his pious family. He did see the error of his ways, returned her and they had a few days together before she was executed, but too little, too late. Tess is the most extreme victim in the novel, with Alec next, being the cause of her hardship and downfall, and for being the villain. And yes, I did say that Alec is a victim, a murder victim, but not an innocent victim. He had no qualms about manipulating situations, taking Tess against her will and using her father's death, her family's destituion, her husband's desertion and her hardships to possess her. In a time when women had virtually no rights and the fact that he had taken her virginity and fathered a child with her gave him a totally wrong sense of ownership and his determination to get her any way that he could is what lead to his fate. Both characters are doomed, while Angel must live with the fact that his actions toward the woman that he loved led to this tragedy. Not that Alec had no part in it, if he hadn't violated Tess and impregnanted her, no doubt there would have been a different outcome to her life and to his. But of course, there would have been no story, and no commentary on the standards of the time in the novel if those events had not taken place.There can be no happy ending, as this is a Hardy tale. But it makes its mark, and was immensely popular at the time of its publishing, despite the brutal critical response it received. The aching misunderstanding of longing love, the loss of innocence and a herione victimized by the standards of her era.A timeless masterpiece of literature. Tess lives beyond the pages of the book, as though Hardy knew a girl who embodied his most famous character. Worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Published in 1891, this book was Thomas Hardy's best seller, and has become a literary classic. This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them. Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune. Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly. I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel. One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman. The character development here is fantastic. I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way). Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature. I didn't find it especially slow, however. If you like books like Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch, and Wuthering Heights, you'll love Tess of the d'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I love the story of Tess. Considering many of the classics I have ever read, I think Tess is one of the easier ones to understand. The work itself is a masterful story. However, I take issue with Penguin's version. The Notes are just awful- referencing back and forth from your place in the book to the back is a nightmare and many times isn't worth breaking your flow. Some of the Notes are helpful and even necessary to understand the sentence, but others are pointless and annoying. I recommend a different version, either without notes entirely or with more reasonable ones."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I think part of the reason I kept so interested is because I had heard some horror stories about not being able to get through the book. So, in turn, I dilligently read and looked for the hard parts. I really didn't find anything. It kept my attention. I loved seeing the journey that Tess was on. I watched her character change drastically from beginning to end. It was fun to see that change. I will read more Thomas Hardy because of this experience."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"In today's permissive day and age, it may seem far-fetched that 'Tess' was received as a bit risque by the British readership of the time. To readers a century later, the tragic story of Tess is very moving, and the nobel heroine evokes extreme sympathy from us.The novel also artfuly portrays the dynamics of life in 19th century England. We are presented with a crude, colloquial variety of the English language then spoken, in stark contrast to the stuffy, self-satisfied brand of sophisticated English that modern authors and film-makers would have us believe is all- pevasive amongst the English, in contrast to the bland, pedestrian English spoken by their brethren overseas.Hardy artfully portrays the dynamics of rural life on an English dairy farm; life that, despite the industrial revolution, is here probably not so different as it was centuries earlier.His characters are beautifully portrayed, with signicant depth. &quot;Tess&quot;, like the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, depicts the thoughts, hopes and dreams of those consigned to a rual existence; those who are peripherally aware that the industrial revolution and the opportunities presented thereby, are radically altering life only a hundred kilometers away.Both 'Tess' and the 'Mayor' are brilliant tragedies. The astute reader knows that tragic events will ultimately prevail, but the dynamics, twists and turns of the plot in 'Tess', make it more of a compelling page turner: an excellent piece of 19-th century British lit. (If I had been forced to read it in high school, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it immeasurably less, so I commisserate with those students who were undderwhelmed by the book- read it again ten years later!).A brilliant story of an admirable, virtuous girl, who can only withstand the castigation visited upon her for the sins of others, for so long. A classic, tragic, heroine."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"There are people who will start reading this book then about 100 pages into it realize that it's going nowhere fast.

She goes to live with some guy named Alec and falls in love with him or something. I never read it but have studied Thomas Hardy's works and that is all I know about this classic. I also know it has a very sad and tragic ending because I ruined it for myself by reading spoilers on wikipedia so don't ruin it by doing that, read it and reach the tear jerking ending, if you can survive a TOME! HA HA HA HA! (Of course you can \\"survive\\" this one. I was just cracking a joke about the length of this book. Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest writers who ever lived and this book proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt)The story attacks the role of woman in Victorian society and because of that, it wasn't really well received in 1891 but at least it did better than Hardy's final novel Jude the Obscure, published in 1895 (some sources say '96 I'm not sure) Jude the Obscure was hated so badly that it was mockingly renamed \\"Jude the Obscene\\" and Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and focused on poetry.This is essential Victorian age literature and is Hardy's most famous novel. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I was a little bit disappointed by Tess, but it is a good outlook of late Victorian Era on the progress of woman.

However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter.

And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I had to write a review just to bring up a rating that was unfairly knocked down by a handful of obtuse reviewers. I wasn't an English lit major like some of these reviewers, but I have read upwards of 10,000 books in my life -with a concentration on literature- and have to say that the descriptive writing in \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" is the most beautiful and poetic I have yet encountered. It is not the most exciting, nor the most stunningly transformative(that honour goes to \\"Altas Shrugged\\") book, but the construction and execution is exquisite.The book is in fact slowly paced - so much so in the first couple of chapters that I was rebuffed the first time I started reading it. However, a little patience will grant you entry into the gorgeous spell Hardy invokes. Yes, it is a \\"victorian\\" novel, but the sublimity of the writing and of the plot's tragedy emancipates it from the staidness of the genre.The upshot is that you shouldn't turn to this book if you want a fast paced thriller or \\"clever\\" writing.

My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book.The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way.The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions.Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable.The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll.Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like \\"depressing\\" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome.I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times.Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times).But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Any woman who has been pursued by the likes of an Alex D'Urberville will appreciate with a shudder his sinister characterization.

It's just too incomprehensible for someone living in the 21st century to relate to--and you wonder about Angel's incompatible behavior--for someone of his supposed character. As much as I love the pastoral beauty of Hardy's described vales and heaths, I loathe the society under which the characters lives are always ruined. The whole books starts to seem silly and tedious when viewed from such a perspective."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty. The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance. The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family. Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles. But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage. Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville. Naturally she is blamed for her \\"defilement\\" and resulting pregnancy. Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul. Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will. He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work. The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Deep. Tragic. Memorable.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a wonderful read and highly recommended. I had high expectations of this book and they were all surpassed after reading it. It is very moving and the story stays with you long after you've read it. It is also full of memorable scenes such as the one wherein Angel sleep walks with Tess in his arms.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles must be one of the most moving and beautifully written novels ever created. Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \\"Old Lady's Day.\\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless. It's definitely worth the time and effort to read this masterpiece of a novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Angel's perceptual turnabout comes a day late and a dollar short. In Hardy's Victorian world, the victim was the co-perpetrator. He had to justify to his audience that despite her technical loss of virginity, Tess was pure in essence. She was a victim of bad luck, particularly that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved when Irving Howe remarked that \\"Tess is...goodness made interesting.\\" Unfortunately, Tess never got to appreciate or even recognize her goodness. She was so full of (unmerited) shame and a sense of inferiority. Angel's liberalism and code of ethics gave way to censure, and he reinforced Tess's self-doubts. He could overlook her being a milkmaid from the fallen D'Urbeville lineage, but not a victim of rape. That even a man like Angel would be influenced by the Victorian attitude (and not recognize the timeless double standard) is Hardy's sharp social critique."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \\"natural fearlessness\\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \\"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \\"a girl of tact.\\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \\"plains\\" he meant \\"rain forest\\") and describes a cow's \\"large-veined udders.\\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \\"kindness\\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville. Although he is supposed to be the \\"villain\\", I find him rather funny and much less annoying than Tess and Angel. Too bad that Thomas Hardy did not choose Alec as the main character. The novel would have been more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"When i started reading the novel,i did't feel like droping it.I felt so touched that the herione of the novel could still carry on with life,and reconcile with Angel who is hypocritic about the religion he criticizes and yet practices when discovering the past of Tess who forgave him of his sin which could not be weighed with hers,but failed to do likewise."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'urbervilles (Summer Classics)","review":"tom hrdy was a \\"wimp\\".

No more than anyone else, perhaps, but a decent few that i could get my hands on.I've never read Hardy, and though his style was different, it was not hard to follow. The flaws in his characters are realistic enough, but it is those flaws that made me dislike the book. Tess is a simpering simpleton who should be smarter than she is. Angel is a Devil, who is the most hypocritical, bigoted, delusional idiot that walked in the book. The evil man, Alec D'Urberville, was terrible, but his evils could be comparable to Angel's. And in the middle is the lost child Tess, who can't be counted on to have a milliliter of sense or perception concering people throughout the entire book. She worships Angel, and blames herself for her rape, because Angel blames her despite his insisting that he doesn't.The plot could have been better, the characters could have been likable, and for God's sake it could have been less repetitive.

I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

Shocking in it's day, Hardy's efforts were felt. Tess is a provocative look at the plight of the 19th century woman, unnaturally naive to a world run by world-wise men.

The language was full of beautiful imagery and the characters were unforgettable. Hardy's use of birds and colors as symbolism provide a vivid picture of the novel. Tess's story is compelling, tragic, and beautiful. Despite the difficult language, once one begins to catch the flow of the novel, it is almost impossible to put the book down.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is the tragedy about a young maiden who is seduced/raped by an incorrigible Alec Stoke-d'Urberville. Her life from there only becomes worse. She falls in love with Angel Clare, who does not know her secret, so their relationship is doomed from the start. Circumstances and human nature drives the innocent Tess to unspeakable bounds, finally leading up to a murder and an execution. Like a bird, Tess has unknowingly flown too high and tragically falls from grace. She is the 19th century version of Eve. Hardy's subtle yet profound allusions to the Bible, more specifically Genesis, cannot be mistaken.This novel is one that should, or must, be read by all.

Fredrikson literally chews through the gospel almost verse by verse, using Greek and historical information to show the intentions of the original author. In many cases he references scripture in other sections of the book of John or elsewhere in the Bible and ties it all together showing a loving and merciful God. This book (along with the series) is intended for someone who has previous read the new testament and is eager to know more about Jesus Christ and how his disciples thought about him.

A professor at Biola University, and then at American Baptist Seminary of the West, he was a prolific writer. His book on hermeneutics remains a useful textbook on the subject.In the present volume he explores the purported incompatability between scientific reason and biblical accuracy, and shows that the illusion is because of improper interpretation of scientific evidence and/or the Biblical texts. Although some of the scientific data he cites are somewhat dated (e.g. supposed age of the earth), his reasoning still stands. The strength of the book is in its ability to sweep away the controversy and clear the way for intellectual honesty on both sides.As the list of books referencing this work demonstrates, \\"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\\" is a seminal work. Reaction to this book was evidently the impetus for the writings of Henry Morris, who shortly thereafter published his first major works on so-called \\"scientific creationism\\". Thus, it may have been the opening volley in the current \\"war\\", but as Ramm points out, the debate goes back to Augustine's time. While Morris' work is meant to exclude and divide, Ramm's book paves the way for those trained in the sciences to approach the Bible without having to \\"check their brain at the door\\". It also allows the Christian to approach science without a sense of guilt or heretical treason, free to explore its wonders, and yet, understand its limits. But most importantly, it opens a dialogue between serious believers and serious scientists that can lead to salvation on one hand, and greater appreciation for the works of the creator on the other.It is obvious that Bernard Ramm had a great love of the Bible and science. His most cogent point is that we, as Christians, must be cautious when we speak of scientific subjects, and we must be sure that we really understand the scientific method and the field of which we speak. Otherwise we will be dismissed as ignorant, and even more tragically, we may exclude honest seekers from coming to the Bible for reconciliation with the Creator. Also, as scientists, we must not impose a scientific framework on the Biblical texts. It will almost always result in misinterpretation and obscure the intended message.That however does not imply that the Bible cannot stand up under scientific scrutiny. While it was not the intent of the Biblical authors to write a scientific treatise, Ramm points out many instances where statements in the Bible have proven far ahead of their time for scientific and historical accuracy. And when viewed from a phenomenological perspective, even the creation account violates no basic tenants of science, a remarkable accomplishment for such an ancient text.This book remains a classic on the subject. I recommend it to all who honestly seek to reconcile science and scripture, not merely compromise one or the other or both."},{"Title":"The Christian view of science and Scripture","review":"This book is an all time classic on the relationship of scientific knowledge to Christianity. Bernard Ramm bemoans the fact that there are so many books of this type and his is just another. But his stood the test of time, while the others have largely been forgotten.This book is timeless. Although some of the information on specific sciences such as geology, astronomy and biology is dated, much of the discussion could have been written yesterday.Ramm illustrates many ways of reconciling science and the study of scripture. He sometimes gives his own position on a particular issue. We may not agree with him on any particular issue. But Ramm stresses the important thing is that Christian scholars should take seriously the findings of science. Although we Christians accept the Bible as authoritative, there are sources of knowledge outside the Bible and it is not acceptable for the Christian to dismiss these if they seem to conflict with our understanding of scripture. Our understanding of scripture is every bit as contingent on fallible human reason as scientific knowledge.Ramm is a villan to the young-earth movement because of his \\"accomodationism\\" and critisism of \\"flood geology\\" and young-earthism. He is cited heavily in Witcomb and Morris' book The Genesis Flood, and in fact may have partly inspired that book.Some of the information on specific sciences is quite dated. But that illustrates the ever-changing nature of science (and theology) and the unchanging nature of scriptire. Just as our understanding of nature is always changing, so is our understanding of scripture and how it relates to science.Ramm does indicate that he does not personally accept evolutionary theory and is not a theistic evolutionist. He characterized himself as a \\"progeressive creationist\\". I have to admit I don't know if his opinions changed over the years as science progressed. Although my personal opinions may not be in total agreement with Ramm's, he displays an appropriate respect and honest consideration of scientific knowledge."},{"Title":"The Christian view of science and Scripture","review":"Bernard L. Ramm (1916-1992) was a Baptist theologian who was professor of Systematic Theology at California Baptist Seminary. He has written important and influential books such asVarieties Of Christian Apologetics,Protestant Christian Evidences, andProtestant Biblical Interpretation: A Textbook of Hermeneutics.He wrote in the Preface to this 1954 book, \\"In research for this book I discovered that there are two traditions in Bible and science both stemming from the developments of the nineteenth century. There is the ignoble tradition which has ... used arguments and procedures not in the better traditions of established scholarship. There has been and is a noble tradition in Bible and science, and this is the tradition of the great and learned evangelical Christians who have been patient, genuine, and kind and who have taken great care to learn the facts of science and Scripture... Unfortunately the noble tradition ... has not been the major tradition in evengelicalism in the twentieth century... It is our wish to call evengelicalism back to the noble tradition...\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"...the Holy Spirit conveyed infallibly true theological doctrines in the cultural mold and terms of the days of the Bible writers, and did not give to the writers the secrets of modern science. It is a misunderstanding of the nature of inspiration to seek such secrets in various verses of the Bible.\\" (Pg. 136)\\"The amount of material carried by a water stream varies with the sixth power of the velocity of the stream. There is little deposit far out on the continental shelf where a few feet may represent thousands of years of deposits. Flood geology has no means of accounting for this.\\" (Pg. 184)\\"A local flood would come and go and leave no trace after a few thousand years, but could a universal flood be a traceless flood? (George McCready) Price's view we cannot but emphatically reject.\\" (Pg. 243)\\"The mixing of the waters and the pressure of the waters would have been devastating. Many of the salt water fish and marine life would die in fresh water, and many of the fresh water fish and marine life would die in salt water. An entire marine creation would have been necessary if the waters of the earth were mixed, yet no such hint is given in the account.\\" (Pg. 244)\\"Getting rid of such a vast amount of water would have been as miraculous as providing it. If the entire world were under six miles of water, there would have been no place for the water to drain off. Yet the record states that the water drained off with the help of the wind (Genesis 8:1). A local flood would readily account for this, but there is not answer if the entire world were under water.\\" (Pg. 245)\\"There is the problem of the special diets required for the animals, and the problem of special conditions for the animals. Some animals need a moist environment, and others a very dry one; some need it very cold and others very warm. Again, there is no question what Omnipotence can do, but the simplicity of the flood record prohibits the endless supplying of miracles to make a universal flood feasible.\\" (Pg. 247)"},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"Good historical novel but almost felt like I had read it before, maybe I had, not sure.

The story is set in Strassburg 1348 (the time when the Black Death has just arrived in Europe). The protagonists are Solomon, a trainee physician, who is the son of a prosperous Jewish merchant; and Rica (Frederica), the daughter of a \\"new\\" nobleman. Both face familial constraints, but they are also divided by their religions, their class, and the expectations each family has of them. Rica is expected by her father to marry a rather religious German nobleman who cannot tell her apart from her mentally and emotionally disturbed twin sister Etta. Solomon is expected to become a physician, and then to marry a suitable Jewish girl. Add to all this, the fact that Rica and Solomon meet each other secretly at the cottage of her father's mistress (the local wisewoman). Add to this, the fact that mobs are beginning to massacre Jews all over Europe, believing them responsible for the Black Death. Don't worry, our hero and heroine survive - although their sanity is often tested, along with their commitment to each other.This is one romance I am keeping. It is well worth several re-reads, for the complex social interactions as well as the sheer beauty of the relationship.

This is a beautiful story told by a stunningly fine author."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"STORY BRIEF:Identical twins Rica and Etta are 16. Ten years ago Etta was brutally raped. Since then she has rarely spoken and appears to have mental problems. Rudolf wants to marry Rica and the father gives his permission. Rica does not like Rudolf and does not know she's been promised to him. Rudolf does not want Etta because he considers her damaged goods. Etta desires Rudolf and starts coming out of her shell. She and Rica pretend to be each other. Etta spends a lot of time with Rudolf and flirts with him. He thinks she is Rica. Rica meets Solomon a Jewish medical student. It's love at first sight but forbidden since she is Catholic. They both would be killed if anyone learned of their love. The plague is occurring in nearby communities. People erroneously blame and murder the Jews. Solomon's family is at risk.REVIEWER'S OPINION:What is most interesting is probably the setting. It's rare to read something set in Germany and set during the plague. Love is forbidden due to religious reasons.Rica is unusual in being able to read. The priest taught her. Other women cannot read, and that is one reason Solomon likes her. They discuss poetry and stories. She is good, loyal, brave, takes risks, and of course she is beautiful. Solomon is so handsome and virile looking that women of all ages stare at him as he walks by on the street. One woman compares his sex appeal to that of a stallion. Not much else is done with their characters. It's mostly lust at first sight. They must sneak around and fear being caught. There is not much relationship development and nothing special about the dialogue.CAUTION SPOILER:Two things bothered me. 1. A woman is killed and the author does not tell how or by whom. I am guessing who did it, but I wish the author had been more clear. 2. I didn't mind family and religious reasons keeping the couple apart. But additional separations happened when Solomon lied to Rica, saying he didn't love her. And later she lied to him causing more separation. That wasn't great storytelling, yet so many authors do this kind of thing. The result is a lot of separation and more worry, hurt, and grief due to separation.DATA:Story length: 343 pages. Swearing language: none. Sexual language: none to mild. Number of sex scenes: 5. Total number of sex scene pages: 12. Setting: 1348 - 1349 mostly Germany with a little Cairo, Egypt. Copyright: 1993.

PLEASE DO NOT PASS UP THE CHANCE TO READ THIS UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL AND EMOTIONAL LOVE STORY!"},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"Just not my cup of tea. This book was brilliant but so, so dark. It takes place during the plague in the year 1348. Jews are being wrongfully blamed for the sickness and are being killed in huge numbers. Within the first chapter we learn of the heroine's mother's death through brutal rape. Her 6 year old twin sister, Etta, was also present and raped as well leaving her unable to have children or even to have intercourse. As a result she was left severly traumatized and mute, with the exception of conversing with her sister, Rica of religion.When Etta learns of her sister, Rica's, betrothal to Rudolf, the man Etta secretly loves, she very quickly comes out of her self imposed coma to try to win him. Etta and Rica do a roll reversal to fool Rudolf so he might fall in love with Etta instead. Rica had no qualms about this because she was personally repulsed by the overly pious man. We soon learn that Rudolf is not such a fantastic man. I won't go into detail but there was a definite evil within him.At the same time Rica meets a young Jewish man and they very quickly fall in love. The conflicts that arise are heart wrenching and difficult to read. Because of their religions and different stations in life their families as well as society are deeply apposed to the match. As a result the pair are forced to meet secretly whenever possible.I had a feeling of dread through this entire novel. There were a few twists and turns and it constantly had me guessing whether there would be a happily ever after. If the writing hadn't been so wonderful I would not have cared as much but this is not the kind of book that I like to escape with. If you are looking for a book that is tragically realistic than this book may be for you.

It was like I could feel their chemistry through the words, really well done. I don't want to recap what's already written on the back cover/description but I will say that I enjoyed the premise of all the trials and tribulations that you face when you love someone and fate is determined to get in the way.

I generally agree with the reviews. The author's writing style is palatable and she has good flow. However if like me you read medievals for deeper plots than 'will they or won't they be together?' this book may not be for you. I mean towards the end I was basically 'jumping ahead'( that means the plot has lost my interest)for the inevitable 'the author will never let any thing bad happen to her characters' ending. There was nothing more left to unravel, just that. I wish she had spent a few more pages delving into the persecution of the jews and also more into the troubled sister's life. I thought these plot points could have made for a richer story rather than just a mere love story.

The story centers around Rica and Solomon, and their forbidden romance. Set in the 1300's, the book deals with the plague and its subsequent impact on the Jewish population who were among those falsely blamed for the Black Death. Rica and Solomon can't help falling in love, but circumstances keep them apart.There are several sub-plots woven throughout as well. I found the book to be a very enjoyable read, extremely romantic, and at times even sensual.

The characters are all believable, overall good read"},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"After reading A Bed of Spices by Barbara Samuel, I am left with the impression that MOST romance plots are just plain silly. Hardships are not REALLY hardships, common plot obstacles such as \\"the misunderstanding\\" are not REALLY that hard to overcome, and many plot lines are shallow. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS BEFORE, so I guess I will \\"blame\\" the richness, historical accuracy, and perfection of this novel on my change in perspective. None other compares to this book.This book is not a \\"light hearted romp\\"! These characters are facing REAL crisis....The Plague is ravaging through villages in Europe and is leaving thousands dead in it's wake, Jews are being blamed for the plague, tortured and killed, and marriage between a Gentiles and a Jew is punishable by death. Soloman is a Jewish physician in training and Fredricka (Rica) is a German nobleman's daughter. They meet in a \\"spice garden\\" owned by a local midwife/medicine woman. He is studying herbal remedies from Helga and Helga is a sort of \\"mother figure\\" to Rica. Love at first sight seems too elementary to describe what happens when these two meet. It is more like it is a \\"collision of souls\\"...not to get to dramatic!!! The CONNECTION that Soloman and RIca share is what sets this couple apart from other couples. There is no reason these two should fall in love....they are of different class, race, and religion, and yet their love just \\"is\\".The odds these two face seem insurmountable, even right up until the end. I couldn't put this book down until I knew what would come of these two \\"star crossed\\" lovers. There are secondary characters...Etta, Rica's twin and an evil pursuer of the sisters, but nothing can compete with what goes on between Soloman and Rica. Their relationship is absolute beauty.I'm usually kinda cheap:)......I paid $15.00 for this book and don't regret a penny of it! Find this book."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"I was very impressed by all the positive reviews of this book, and had absolutely adored Samuels' book \\"A Winter Ballad,\\" so I was eager to try \\"A Bed of Spices.\\" Sorry to say I got halfway through, and found myself falling asleep every time I picked it up. It just did not hold my interest. I did not finish it. So my comments are based only on the first half.For one thing, I could not connect with the hero and heroine. The heroine was perfect- stunningly beautiful, with men dropping at her feet. The hero was also perfect - stunningly beautiful, with women dropping at his feet. They each took one look at each other - one look! - and could not stay away from each other. I understand this was supposed to represent true passion - but I thought maybe something that showed development of some real feelings for each other would have been more believable - and more interesting reading. Samuels does an absolutely wonderful job developing the relationship between the hero and heroine in her other books- not sure why I didn't feel it in this one. And I think flawed characters are far more interesting, and far more believable. These two seemed flawless.The set up for their story was very interesting. You don't read too many historical romances with Judaism as the backdrop for the dilemma between the hero and heroine, and I was really looking forward to reading/learning about this unfortunate and devastating part of history and how it affected these two people. But the first half of the book (the only part I read) tread on this only remotely. In fact, I thought it was implied, and that I was expected to have figured it out telepathically. The author kept referring to their love as \\"forbidden,\\" but never explains why. What a rich opportunity this would have been to have expressed the turmoil religious differences have made on personal relationships.For me, not finishing a book is akin to going to a nice restaurant and being so disappointed in the appetizer and/or the service that I leave and don't try the entr&eacute;e. I always feel that perhaps if I stuck it out, I would be rewarded in the end. So I am disappointed that I couldn't finish this, as I really love Barbara Samuels' writing style and the stories she weaves. I find her books totally enthralling, but unfortunately this one didn't do it. Perhaps if I could have been enticed to stay for the entr&eacute;e....."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"Romances set in the Middle Ages aren't my preferred RHF reading era...the severe restrictions on behavior, the excessive concern for piety and sin, women usually being illiterate usually add up to \\"no, thank you,\\" save a few notable exceptions.Bed of Spices is one of those beautiful, poignant, lush, divine exceptions. The heroine is plausible for her era, with a believable reason for being literate, independent and strong, while still dutiful, thoughtful and young. The shifting POV between her, the hero and a select few secondary characters is smooth, never muddled. The details of daily life are vibrant enough for the reader to be present in the moment with characters.And the passion. This book smolders, smokes and finally bursts into flames, without being erotica. Illustrating they are deeply in love, not young lust. The hero and heroine both suffer through trials, fight their forbidden love, remain true to their faith while growing closer with each page.I wish Barbara Samuel would return to writing historicals. This is a stunning, delicious piece of work. When someone asks me for a shining example of the genre, a book that will create a life long addiction to reading romance novels, this is one of the books I'll shoving in their hands while jumping up & down."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"I have recently been reading various novels by Barbara Samuel.

You are amazing!"},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"I have now read several of Barbara Samuel's historical romances and I am astonished by the consistent quality of writing. She does not confine herself to any one period and here she uses 14th century Strasbourg as a backdrop.There is the threat of plague and religious persecution. As disease ravages through Europe, superstitions are rife and Jews become the easy target of those looking for scapegoats.People are confined within the limitations of their social status and women have no real independence in their own affairs.Frederica/Rica lives with her father and twin sister (Etta) and runs the castle's domestic affairs. Her mother was brutally murdered and Etta grievously wounded years before the story starts. Rica is bright, learned and curious.Solomon is a Jew and the son of a wealthy merchant. He is training to become a doctor and visits the local midwife to learn from her knowledge of healing.It is at the midwife's cottage that Rica and Solomon meet and are dazzled by each other. He is the only person to treat her opinions with respect, to regard her as his intellectual equal. They are both very aware of the confines placed on them by society and their families and they are determined to abide by the rules. However, they seem fated to meet and their love draws them inexorably together regardless of the consequences.In addition to the social and religious implications, Rica is betrothed to Rudolf, who in turn is loved by Etta. Rudolf and Etta seem imbalanced at times, making their actions unpredictable and dangerous.There are many hurdles to overcome and the drama and tension continue throughout the story. Despite the setting in the dark ages, there is a great deal of hope and honour and love."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"I can't believe I haven't submitted a review of this novel long before this time, as I've owned and loved this book for years.A BED OF SPICES has all the elements I love in a romance novel: a forbidden love story, this time between the Christian heroine, Rica and the Jewish hero, Solomon (very rare to find a Jewish hero); well-drawn supporting characters; a medieval setting (Germany, 1348-1349 in the time of the Black Plague) and a fabulous blend of historical fact with romantic fiction. Although the story moves slowly, it's really worth your while. You will remember Rica and Solomon's story. If you love historical romance novels, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I often turn back to this novel to refresh myself as to what a historical romance OUGHT to be - creative, imaginative and tender."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"As a keen reader of historical fiction, I was delighted when Barbara Samuel's book took me to into a different time period and country from so many I have read. Based on real events in Strasbourg in the fourteenth century, Ms Samuel's book manages to intertwine a passionate love story with an exploration of intolerance and fear. There are certainly familiar elements in this Romeo and Juliet themed novel, but the characters are original and appealing. The setting is convincing and Ms Samuel's handles the factors that keep the young lovers apart with skill and credibility. When I finish a book and do nothing but sit and think about it for a while, I know I've got a keeper. This is the first of Ms Samuel's books I have read. It certainly won't be the last."},{"Title":"A Bed of Spices: Bed of Spices, A (Harper Monogram)","review":"I found this book so interesting that I recommended it to some of my book club friends.

It definitely suprised me. I liked the recurrence of Lou Ford and Amy from \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" and how their characters were given a nobler twist in this novel. I also enjoyed the protoganist Bugs, who seems along with Doc McCoy to be one of only a few Thompson anti-heroes who is free from any considerable physical or psychological pathology. The two femme fatales, as well as most of the minor characters are very well thought out and entertaining. Any mysteries or loose ends surrounding them, or the plot in total, just add to the fascination of Wild Town. The story and the characters really hooked me and drew me in. I've read all of Thompson's Noir/Crime novels and after Pop.1280, The Grifters, Farewell my Lovely, The Kill-Off, and the Killer Inside Me, Wildtown is tied with The Nothing Man for #6. In my opinion, Wild Town, is more intriguing and fun than The Getaway, A Swell Looking Babe, Savage Nights, The Criminal, His Kind of Woman etc. But, I'm just a girl ;)"},{"Title":"Wild town","review":"The unlikely protagonist of Wild Town answers to the name Bugs McKenna. An ex-cop and an ex-con, Bugs cannot stay out of trouble because of his hair trigger temper and his inability to cut the other guy any slack. Another major character is Lou Ford, the sinister lawman introduced by Thompson in his 1952 classic work, The Killer Inside Me. As pointed out by Robert Polito in the definitive Thompson biography entitled Savage Art, Wild Town is neither a sequel nor a prequel to The Killer Inside Me. It's best to think of the two books as presenting the Lou Ford character in alternate universes.Bugs drifts into West Texas' Ragtown and soon meets up with deputy sheriff Ford, who strongly suggests he accept the job of house detective at the Hanlon Hotel. The owner of the hotel is Mike Hanlon, a wealthy oilman who became paraplegic in an industrial accident.Wild Town is a relatively short book, yet there are a number of intriguing subplots. And Thompson wastes no time in introducing them.-All is not well between Mike Hanlon and his wife, giving Bugsand the reader reason to believe murder is in the air.-Bugs find himself attracted to school marm Amy Standish who justhappens to be Lou Ford's fiancee.-The Hanlon's auditor is an embezzler and its general manager isa world class alcoholic.-Bugs becomes a recipient of an anonymous blackmail threat.All of this and more plays out under the watchful eye of the omniscient Lou Ford.Perhaps the strongest aspect of Wild Town is the very engaging dialogue. Especially the fake hayseed utterances of Ford as he dominates and intimidates one and all. Another strong feature of Wild Town is its depiction of hotel life. You'd be hard pressed to find an author more capable than Jim Thompson when it comes to describing the inner workings of hotels.What keeps this from being a really great novel, at least for me, is the tendency for many of the characters to do things which are....well, out of character. Of course, that particular criticism is a bit unfair. I suspect it was Thompson's intention to have these characters act in unforseeable ways so as to purposely keep the reader completely off balance.I would rank Wild Town high among Thompson's second tier novels. As you read this entertaining book, remember to expect the unexpected."},{"Title":"Wild town","review":"I was torn in rating this book. I am not especially familiar with the genre, so I am not sure how it compares with other novels of its type. However, it was quite entertaining and an extremely quick read, and overall I liked it - I simply couldn't see rating it any higher, in terms of the writing itself.So, the negatives first. It seems as if it were written in a hurry. Some parts are polished enough, others seem quite raw. There are some inconsistencies (though only one that really bothered me), and a &quot;dirty trick&quot; or two used to keep you from catching on to the plot twists too quickly.I can't really give a plot synopsis without throwing in spoilers, as the story takes twists and turns at every chapter. The main characters, of course, are not what they seem at first (and you expect this from the beginning). But they are also aware that their circumstances are not what they seem, and in their respective ways are trapped by their own cunning and distrust.This book really shines in its character development, most of all. The reader sees each character from many different angles, gets to recognize their hidden strengths and flaws, and while they are very different the reader can sympathize with (if not like) almost all of them. This provides no rest, however; the plot twists relentlessly, and each character is all too human and seems fully capable of betrayal for their own reasons.Tolstoy it's not. But this novel is suspenseful, never boring, and will hold your attention for the day or two it takes to finish it."},{"Title":"Wild town","review":"Jim Thompson continues to hurt the boundaries of noir fiction. IN this book a man is hired to protect an oil baron in his hotel from somebody. That somebody changes throughout the book leavign you guessing until the final chapter. Of course like any good mystery writer Jim Thompson gives away the person in the first few pages of meeting that person but convinces you that he was only giving you a red herring. The book is normal for Jim THompson since the main character isn't completely psychotic, nor narrating and when the final chapter comes the whole narrative is neatly wrapped up without ambiguity, still it is an enjoyable read and worth recommending"},{"Title":"Wild town","review":"This was my intorduction to Jim Thompson. The cover said it was like Dasheil Hammet and Raymond Chadler. It was like neither. Sure it was noirish in the sense the hero (antihero i guess) was a murderer with a police record a mile long, but the sinister story was pretty bland. He didn't seem to care about the mystery very much either, which made me likewise almost not care. The ending was okay, there was a slight tiwst that caught me off guard, which i liked. But having to slosh through 250 pages of stagnant story almost made it not worth it. The character of the police chief was very well done. If he's in other books by thompson, I'll read them.I think the biggest problem was that it felt like Thompson was just trying to fill up pages sometimes, like he said to himself, &quot;Well, i need to fill up five pages in this chapter somehow,&quot; so he just made the hero walk around the hotel for five pages, not doing a whole bunch.I guess overall, characters were pretty good, plot was slow and boring."},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight[hardcover]","review":"I am a big fan of Michele Albert's books and I have always admired her character development. Though I liked both Fiona and Grif, they are not as fully realized (IMO) as I've come to expect from this author. I think perhaps this book suffers because it is a \\"transition\\" book. It closes out the (very) loosely connected trilogy of three friends introduced in GETTING HER MAN, continuing with ONE WAY OUT and now concluding with HIPS. It also serves to kick off a new series about a shadowy organization called Avalon which specializes in recovering stolen works of art, antiquities and busting forgers.Five years prior, Griffith Laughton ran an op that went bad and several of his team were killed. Grif feels guilt over their deaths as well as a burning desire to finally put art and antiquities trafficker Rainert von Lahr (also seen in prior book OWO) behind bars where he belongs. He finally has another chance to catch his nemesis with a \\"lost\\" Christopher Marlowe manuscript. The bait must, unfortunately, also include an innocent civilian, Fiona Kennedy-MacMahon. She's an expert on Marlowe and Grif approaches her (in the guise of an attorney) with a proposition to appraise the manuscript for his client to determine if it is real or a forgery. Grif liberally pours on the charm to convince her, but then it's not so hard to flirt with this warm and very pretty redhead.Prior to Grif entering her bookstore, Fiona had been in the process of planning a vacation in the Bahamas to kick-start her life. Her husband has just been declared legally dead (he disappeared years ago) and after five years in limbo, Fiona wants to finally live again. And now here's this gorgeous charmer offering her the opportunity to authenticate a possible Marlowe manuscript! He's the second gorgeous man to enter her shop (and flirt with her!) today what with that blond German gentleman who came in earlier. And now the charming Griffith Laughton has invited her to dinner. Perhaps her luck is changing?Well perhaps not, for after spending a long, blissful night with Grif, Fiona learns the truth of what is going on. When they must go on the run from von Lahr and others, their forced time together allows them to get to know one another. Fiona discovers that Grif already knows pretty much everything about her while Grif reveals his growing disenchantment with the job and his desire for someplace to call home. Fiona's anger toward Grif for using her diminishes as she comes to understand and like Grif. Their mutual attraction was clear from the start, and now the question is, if they can stay alive long enough to get von Lahr, will she ever see him again?While I enjoyed the story, I must agree with another reviewer that there were several things that were sort of left hanging and agree that perhaps there were things the reader is not meant to know? For all it's mention, in the end the manuscript did not seem to be very important. The person or persons that head up Avalon seemed to be important though I've no idea why. The revelation of what really happened to Fiona's husband was kind of anti-climatic. And the period of time that Fiona and Grif spend together is extremely short (like two or three days) so their attachment seemed a tad unrealistic. And I did wonder if Grif would be happy in the long run with the choice he made at the end.Not her best, but still enjoyable. I look forward to her next book and to learning more about Avalon."},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight[hardcover]","review":"Her husband disappeared and is now declared dead, so book store owner Fiona Kennedy finally feels closure and is ready to fly off to the Bahamas for sun, fun, and a no-strings fling. When not one but two sexy men darken her door in a single day, she's not sure what to think of her luck. But one of them is Rainert Von Lahr, a slippery thief and murderer who has eluded capture. The other is Griffin Laughton, a mercenary of sorts that will do anything to catch his man, even if it means seducing the widow and using her for bait when he discovers her husband might not be dead after all. Under the guise of authenticating a long lost manuscript by Christopher Marlowe, Griff worms his way into Fiona's store, then her bed, and soon her heart. But when she discovers his duplicity, will she be able to forgive him?Albert's follow up to the great \\"One Way Out\\" maintains the suspense, action, and sizzling action of its predecessor. Griff and Fiona have excellent chemistry that sizzles off the pages - and the inclusion of other key characters from her previous novels aid in moving the story along instead of marring an otherwise good story. Albert's forte is her witty use of dialogue to bring life to her characters. She's a new and not to be missed author for me!"},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight[hardcover]","review":"This book is wonderful,I just began reading this author and even though I apparently missed the first book I understood the plot with no problem. I love the fact that Fiona the female lead is strong and independent. She supports and incourages the heroe to stop blaming himself for past mistakes. But she also, goes toe to toe with him when she finds out he lied to her. This is a fabulous book by a wonderful author. I am a fan for life!!!

Fiona, feeling used and betrayed, is taken somewhere safe to hide out for a while. She attempts to act civil towards Griffin but he has become a stranger to her now.Fiona's safety is Griffin's top priority. While he attempts to keep her at arms length, Fiona discovers that there is much more to Griffin than what he portrays. Griffin finds himself wanting to do more than just to keep her safe and Fiona wonders about what could be, providing they can get out of this alive.Hide In Plain Sight is terrific. The mystery kept me guessing, the action is thrilling and the romance is hot! Griffin's good looks, charming personality and the aura of danger that surrounds him, make him so desirable. Fiona is a beautiful and strong woman. She held her own no matter what was thrown at her. I really enjoyed how their relationship grew and changed.

Mostly Grif, he is very burned out, he seems to care for nothing but revenge on von Lahr. When fubar happens he and Fiona are thrown togather and through her he comes to some very deep soul searching.The plot was a little involved and was not totally solved to my satisfaction. Not to mention the addition of some characters who were not introduced fully. It seems there are things we are not ment to know. I feel there will surely be other books.

Now her time is up in marital purgatory and she can officially have the court rule that her spouse is dead. She plans to celebrate her widow status with fun and sun in the Bahamas.However, before she can leave town, Griff Laughton asks her to authenticate and appraise an old manuscript. Griff hides his real agenda from her, which is to capture his enemies von Lahr while also protecting the bookworm from enemies she does not know she has that her late spouse has brought her. He also conceals his work of fifteen years destroying art, artifacts, and antiquities smuggling rings. He is a bit disturbed to find he is attracted to the charming beautiful Fiona, but detachment is his middle name until someone tries to kill the woman he willingly would die for to keep her safe.HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT is a fabulous fast-paced tale starring a courageous female and the male champion risking all especially his heart to keep her safe. The story line is filled with action from the moment Griff hires Fiona and never slows down as her past comes back to haunt her in spite of her innocence from Richard's dealings. The changing relationship between the hardened agent and the bookseller is deftly handled in a believable manner that in turn augments the prime plot of a woman in peril over something she knows nothing about. Readers will appreciate Michelle Albert's superb romantic suspense thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight[hardcover]","review":"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but how did this book even get published?

This book shows that activists of color are extremely dedicated to fighting pollutants in their community. This book stresses that a disproportionate number of communities of color have been targeted for toxic wastes sites, etc.; so it is not environmental classism, but specifically environmental racism. This book does a good job in showing how Blacks, Native Americans, and Latinos are equally engaged in fighting this tragedy. This book may be too simplistic for longtime activists. For non-scientists like myself, many of the chemical compounds mentioned and stuff like that went right over my head (figuratively, of course). Still, this helped me learn more on the topic and is a good starter book. I think this book can help bring progressives across color lines together."},{"Title":"Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices From the Grassroots","review":"Robert Bullard, whose work on environmental justice has really made \\"local\\" struggles for a cleaner environment much more visible in academic literature, along with Benjamin Chavis, Jr., a Church activist working to organize and support local struggles against environmental racism, have put together a very readable collection. Chavis and Bullard, open up a forum for other grassroots activists to participate in ongoing academic discussions of the environment and the detrimental effects of waste industries and environmental pollutants on minority and poor populations. CONFRONTING ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM is a nice collection of essays that incorporates the important voices of the individuals who are in the frontlines of change. The one thing I would have liked to see more of is accounts from a broader geographic region. However, if the edition is explicitly about the US (although it never says it is), it is indeed an insightful edition for all who are interested in environmental justice and grassroots social movements."},{"Title":"Crises in U.S. Foreign Policy: An International History Reader","review":"This book covers major events in US foreign policy, such as the World Wars, Vietnam and Korea, Cold War, and Iran.

Most people who make money on the internet have multiple streams. That is, they do several things that generate income and pay more attention to the ones that pay them more money. ==He's also right in listing the various ways that you can make money on the net. These simply put come down to: selling a product, selling a service, selling advertising on your site.But it's not quite as easy as he makes it appear.First the internet is a communications medium, that's all. It is largely the replacement for direct mail - but if you've noticed, you are probably still getting a lot of advertising mail. That alone says that the internet hasn't replaced everything.Second, means that you've got to find a product where there is enough interest to attract a lot of attention, but not so much that there is a lot of competition. You could sell a newsletter or some other kind of electronic publication. But where do you get the material.Third the real key is getting a lot of people to come to your web site. And that means a minimum of say 10,000, and 100,000 is better. What do you think you can do that will attract that much attention.Fourth, he is right in that e-mail is essentially free. But advertising e-mail is usually called SPAM. And people don't like SPAM. There are laws about sending it, and while he is careful to say that you should make up a list of subscribers (called Opt-In), what can you do that is unique enough to get 10,000 subscribers.Fifth, you are realy going into the mail order business. It's a business like any other. You have laws that apply, the IRS wants to be your partner, and so on.Conclusion, yes, it can be done, the general rules he lists are pretty good, but it's still starting a business and a heck of a lot of work.

For example, he talks about how he made an online offer that became an instant success in 24 hours. He leaves out the time he spent developing a website and the lists of interested prospects to which the offer was distributed. If we add in the time spent building up to making the offer, it isn't exactly a instant success story anymore.It takes time and effort to develop a business.

There's mindless fluff that's just a commercial for the author. It looks rushed and sloppy.Then there are books like this that are a little better. There's a broad overview of different strategies presented; maybe it'll open some peoples eyes up, but there's very little depth. Internet success comes down to alot of things. There's marketing, branding/communication, strategy, finding and developing a niche. The reader is alot better off going out and finding books on each of these topics, developing some depth and expertise, and then fitting them together to create something successful (i.e. books by Al Ries, Jay Abraham, M Gladwell, etc). The last kind of business book are the meaty ones like these.The internet changes so much, it's just not possible to write a book that's the end all be all.

Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer. If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day. Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time. The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly. They always show up as just a bunch of html code. Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly? Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him. But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before. He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods. Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.

Its analyses are descriptive as well as logical. And, its focus is strongly optimistic.Surely, the world is still undergoing a digital revolution; and the Internet has remained an undeniable source of endless opportunities. The author of this book was meticulous in picking and establishing his points. These (points) revolved around sole proprietorships, and dealt critically with core business development, electronic storefront, operational strategies, competitive marketing, and so on. Each of these was discussed relative to both business-to-business and business-to-consumer settings.But, one major drawback was that the author (of this book) was so confident in his ideas that he 'forgot' to pay adequate attention to the issues, which led to the dot.com bursts of the yesteryears. Such issues like: market saturation, stagnation of the tech sector, etc., are still very much around. Though analyzing them would paint a rather pessimistic picture, it would still be very useful to do so. The precarious nature of online business warrants every precaution that any would-be starter could get. Likewise, it would be nice to see more narratives on the legal issues partaining to Internet business.In conclusion, I must mention that despite its relatively small size, this book contains the basic information for anyone considering an online venture. It would also prove a useful handbook for those already in the game. But, I still would have liked to see better analyses of both the risks and the legal issues surrounding Internet business."},{"Title":"Multiple Streams of Internet Income: How Ordinary People Make Extraordinary Money Online, 2nd Edition","review":"Be very careful how you follow up with some of the information presented in this book. Don't assume that just because a marketing guru is mentioned in this book, that it is completely safe to do business with him or her. Use Google and read in-depth comments about each one before you decide to proceed to their web site.For example, when I Googled the marketing gurus quoted in this book, for six of them (as well as the author) when I entered their first and last names, the third word that Google autotyped following the name was \\"scam.\\" Reading comments for one individual in particular revealed many complaints that he was verbally abusive to prospects when they declined to buy. Not good.In addition, other reviewers who signed up for the author's newsletter have found themselves inundated with spam. I did not personally sign up for the author's newsletter, but signed up for one distributed by another of the gurus cited in the book. I am now receiving over 140 spam e-mails a day and may be forced to abandon an e-mail address that I've used for 15 years.I'm also receiving exactly the same kind of spam e-mails that other reviewers have reported receiving after signing up for the author's mailings. Rest assured that these people are swapping their mailing lists. On page 161 of the book, Bob Gatchel (who wrote that section) says, \\"I discovered yet another way to make money with my database--I found other people on the Internet with whom to joint-venture and swap leads. If I had 1,000 leads who showed interest in my products in the past and my new partner had a comparable product, we agreed to an even exchange of leads and marketed our respective affiliate programs to those new people.

Yes, it is, but Internet on its own is just a vehicle to conduct business that wasn't there before. Years ago, there probably was a book titled How to Make Money Using the Telephone.

You almost experience the agony and discomfort of such a long and miserable journey. Thank God for the conveniences of modern travel."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Anything For Billy is a fictional account of the final months in the life of Billy The Kid, i.e. it is not true historical fiction, but then it never claims to be. The story is told by a well to do Philadelphian, Benjamin Sippy, in very short chapters, a la James Patterson. \\"Sippy\\", after becoming obsessed with \\"Wild West\\" dime-novels, becomes the very successful author of such books and one day - bored with his life and wife - heads out West, meets up with \\"The Kid\\", and begins traveling with him. So begins our story and, at least initially, has the potential to be a good one. Unfortunately the book falls flat with a thud about 100 or so pages in.The set-up to this story is an engaging one - Sippy the Greenhorn \\"joining\\" up with one of the West's most infamous outlaws with our narrator \\"learning the ropes\\" of being a true cowboy. And through Sippy the reader meets up with a fascinating cast of characters, all intertwined through ancestry, revenge and romance. There are also some laugh out loud moments, including Sippy's 10-day stagecoach journey and his comedic attempts at robbing trains.But then once this stage is set the story-line falters, at least for this reader, badly. Sippy's \\"city-mouse\\" wide-eyed perspective of the Wild West becomes repetitive. Billy's brash behavior, at first unpredictable, quickly becomes just the opposite. The impending confrontations, once they finally do occur, are anti-climactic. It almost seemed as if the author was deliberately taking the \\"wild\\" out of the Wild West. The violence and gun-play is here, but none of the adrenaline.Anything For Billy has an interesting premise with interesting characters that loses its way in the telling."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"WOW!!!

The story takes you to yet another undiscovered time and place that I would only want to visit with Larry McMurtry. This time he focuses on a well known name, but not a well known person. We all know Billy the Kid, but none of us know Billy, and Mr. McMurtry artfully weaves a tale that is more than believable and entertaining.If you have or have not read one of his book it should not matter, but you need to make sure you start or continue with this one. It's entertaining, engaging, thought provoking, and just good. Read this book and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With grace, style, humor, description, and perceptive insight, McMurtry's book Anything for Billy is poignant story that on the surface is about Billy Bone, a disguised version of Billy the Kid, but underneath is about a writer, his experiences, his successes, and his tragedies. Plenty of action abounds in this tale, with the expected violence, sadness, and personality found in most westerns and particularly the books of Larry McMurtry.What makes this book a little different are the hidden tensions that accompany the events presented. Is the narrator really crazy or simply trying to experience the world that has made him successful? Is Billy an amoral psychopath or a young man who can't find any meaning in life and takes a journey down the pathway of self-destruction? Are the many people who show up as confused as the main characters and searching for their place in the world, making decisions that serve nobody but themselves?All these things and more are in this marvelous book that ultimately seems to be about the problems of a writer, who is the narrator of the story, attempting to demythologize the west, but instead adds to it. As he experiences the reality, his books take on less appeal. The tragedy is in his generally average output of dime novels that lose their value, at least to a publisher, when told with literary honesty and accuracte depiction. In some ways, the flashbacks, the asides moments, and the questioning of human responses, point to a type of disenchantment with popular expectations and with the delusions found in many people.This is definitely one of McMurtry's strongest works of fiction, and worth reading as a bittersweet story of human failings. Entertaining, page-turning, and fascinating for its writing style and psychological overtones, it is highly recommended. As mentioned in other reviews, comparison to Lonesome Dove is unfair and in a subtle way, perhaps what this book is about!"},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is my second McMurtry book (first was Picture Show). In this book, McMurtry details the life of the outlaw in the southwest, Billy Bone, from the eyes of a bored upper class journalist from the east coast. Though parts of it could be construed as the life of Billy the Kid (especially the other outlaws), this is a different Billy altogether. The parts of the book I really enjoyed had to do with when the outlaws were traveling in Texas, New Mexico (Las Cruces), and south o' the border into Mexico.All in all, I think you'll enjoy this book, but it really is a quick read (and not a difficult read either)."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Read from the perspective of Mr. Sippy, (and he doesn't come from Mississippi). A dime novelist that leaves his family after his wife tosses his collection of Dime novels. His career as a train robber ends short, after he fails to rob a train, which Billy Bone never fails to note. Mr. Sippy soon forms friendship with Billy Bone and Joe Lovelady (my favorite character). Joe Lovelady kind hearts attracts you more to this particular character, but don't get too attached or you will find yourself disappointed, and anyone who has read this book knows why. The characters in the book is what assists your interest in this reading. Each character has their own unique personality. You find yourself becoming more like Mr. Sippy then any other character; he takes you through the angst, struggle, and hardships of the outlaw's life. His in-depth detail strings many emotions and feelings throughout the reading. You find yourself hating, loving and downright becoming Billy Bone. The chapter that truly captures Billy Bone's personality is \\"let me fall\\" after reading the book I found myself fingering the pages of this chapter again. The bad part is, this book contradicts historical accuracy making it slightly hokey. I was disappointed to see the tactics and base of the book get turned into a cheap love story. Katie Garza would have been better left out in this book. And Billy Bones death should have ended on a more nobler note, and I think he should of stuck to history when Pat Garret was the actual man who killed the infamous Billy the Kid. Then again the Book wasn't for historical references anyway. If you are a fan of William Booney or should I say Billy the Kidd, read this book. I also advise to watch the Billy the Kid movies."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"For old-weastern books, Billy the Kid is a true clasic.

I examines all the the themes of every other book he has written (including the Lonesome Dove epic) with a rare economy of words. It is not a historical recounting of the Billy the Kid story. It is much more important. This slim and spare novel (compared to McMurty's usual volumes) successfully recounts and examines the myths about the American west that still shape our national character.

It basically gives insight into the fact that legends can mostly be made from fictitious or exaggerated stories from people in history.

I particularly enjoyed the multi-leveled aspect of the work: on the one hand it's a story and in some sense the characters are &quot;real&quot; - real that is only in our imaginations where they take up residence - and in others it's a loving homage to the dime-novel genre with the characters archetypal and larger than life. I think the author very cleverly solves the &quot;point-of-view&quot; problem novelists face by mixing the narrator's first person account in with his character's interactions. There's classic line about love which illustrates how the book is both about the west and about writing about it: &quot;he thought love was something that happened in all capital letters ...but I had Dora to teach me it was all mostly fine print.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not a bad read anyway, but could only be treated as a snack if compared to his LONESOME DOVE,and not quite profound either.

Rough and unpolished, darn it, it just doesn't make much sense. While there are some very quirky and interesting characters and incidents (the US Cavalry's experiments with the dromedary camel was a hoot), its just not McMurtry's best. The Arabian/African swordsman really reminded me of that line in The Third Man where the British Major is reading Holly Martens' dime novel and says \`Interesting...I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas.'

If you are a fan of any of the McMurtry Lonesome Dove series, pick up this book. Although it involves none of the same characters it spins a tale in a similar gritty, adventurous vein. Anything for Billy rivals Lonesome Dove for heart pounding excitement and gut wrenching sorrow.Meet Billy the Kid,(Or McMurtry's version, anyway) an inexperienced young drifter with a lucky streak a mile wide, an all consuming desire to make a name for himself, and a tragic taste for violence.Watch the sparks fly when Billy meets Katerina, the beautiful leader of her own band of Mexican outlaws. See Billy tangle with the largest land owner in the west, deadly hired gun men, and vengeful indians, all while he tries to survive his most destructive foe: himself.Although the book involves a number of colorful characters, Billy is what makes this book so interesting. He is more than just a one dimensional shoot 'em up gunfighter. He's an ambitious kid with his own fears and loves and some very dark problems. He's someone you can root for even if you're not sure why.Unlike many of McMurtry's other books this one is narrated in first person perspective. The narrator, Sippy, one of Billy's companions, is an east coast, old society gentleman with a penchant for western dime novels.

This is a great book, that no one should pass up.-A McMurtry Fan"},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am not a big Larry McMurtry fan, but this book really pulled me. It uses very stylistic prose, reminiscent of the 19th century dime novels that made cowboys into myth. It is, in fact, fun to read. The persona is very present and we enjoy his use of language that is at once both cliche yet sounds original. In this world of the book, there are three types of people in the untamed West: gunfighters, cowboys and buffalo hunters. I suppose there are bar tenders to serve these three as well.Far from being a dime novel, however, is the darker side of the work, beginning at about the last third or so. Billy's penchance for unthinking violence catches up with him and with the alert reader as well. This is a novel about life in America today. Or about life anywhere where individuals become icons instead of people. It is easy, McMurtry seems to assert, to kill an generalization. It is more difficult to kill a person. The whole novel sets up contrasts between generalizations of people (as if they were computer icons in a war game) and individuals. So while folks are getting killed and hurt throughout the book, it is only the Romanticized wild West until a main character that we all have learned to love gets killed. Suddenly the book is about something far beyond a recreation of a cowboy dime novel. And it hurts.So while it is a delightful and fun romp through a Romanticized West, the undertones of the book hit hard. Read it and laugh, then weep."},{"Title":"Anything for Billy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although not in the same category as the Lonesome Dove series, the book is still an interesting and entertaining read.

Mr. Benjamin Sippy from Philadelphia is a big fan of Western dime novels. When his supply slows down, he first starts cranking them out himself - then, when it stops completely, he jumps on the first train west and falls in with a young kid named Billy Bone. Along for the ride, he witnesses and documents Billy's short but wild career in fame, love and death. Many colourful characters complete the setting - Joe Lovelady, the cowboy; Katie Garza, the Mexican bandit; gunslingers, buffalo hunters and more. There may be little in the way of character development, but they all come to brilliant (if usually short) life. And there was certainly a development in the way I saw Billy.

I thought it [stunk]."},{"Title":"The Router Joinery Handbook","review":"Nuances of router operation, router bits, and router use are described which provide important insight that any woodworker needs when using the router. It is the best of several books on routing that I have found. Several jigs for joinery are described that really work well. These jigs and an offset router base have increased my router use and work quality. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you are experienced with the router."},{"Title":"The Router Joinery Handbook","review":"This is one of those rare woodworking books that combines plenty of great technical information and an inspirational, even challenging, message. Regular readers of magazines like Fine Woodworking and Woodwork know Warner as a highly knowledgeable if occasionally doctrinaire (witness the scorn he heaps upon table-mounted plunge routers!) router maven. Oftentimes such a personality wears thin over the course of a long book; not so with Warner. Having bought the book to learn about a specific jig I had heard about, I found myself reading page after page with attention and growing excitement. My routing (a daily activity in my woodworking business) is going to change for the better thanks to Warner. I'll be building several if not all of the jigs in the book within the next few weeks. I am convinced that, 10 years into my life as a router user, Warner's approach is going to make my work faster, more accurate, and even more enjoyable.Warner's approach is open-eyed and creative. Several of the jigs bring the router to the work in directions (and tool-path-shapes if I may be forgiven a gaucherie) that appear bizarre to someone used to the standard manufactured jigs. Bits in unusual shapes and sizes abound in this book, too. Warner's prose is also occasional eye-openingly unfamiliar, but almost always in a satisfying way. This man has obviously thought long and hard not just about routing, but about how to describe it precisely and without a lot of the hackneyed jargon that often conceals a writer's limited mastery of the subject. I kept coming upon concepts like \\"handedness\\" and being reminded of Russian Formalism's \\"defamiliarization\\" or \\"enstrangement.\\"I must share a few cavils about the book. Two of them are about perspective. Every page of the book is full of close-up photos and clear diagrams. However, there is a frustrating lack of wider-angle views. \\"Okay,\\" I found myself thinking time and again, \\"Here is a great shot of how this template, this router bit, and the workpiece come together. But how does the whole assembly get held to the bench? Where does the man stand as he moves through the work? And how tall is his workbench?\\" Leaving aside even such practical matters, it would be nice to see what Warner's shop looks like. A similar claustrophobic feeling permeates the text. Warner seems in such a rush to get us into cutting the joints that we lack a sense of the whole scenario-we don't know what router (or routers), or bits, or jigs we'll be using until they appear without introduction in the process narration. As a matter of fact construction of the key jigs is discussed after their use is described-as if by afterthought....For a simple, even low-tech approach to router jointmaking, I recommend Gary Rogowski's Router Joinery. For those ready to make the step to a more sophisticated and involved, but safer and more accurate approach to the router, this book is a great introduction, and I say again, I am sure that my approach to routing will change for the better thanks to this book."},{"Title":"The Router Joinery Handbook","review":"The author of this book has been doing router joinery for decades, and he has strong opinions on the appropriate techniques (mounting, jigs, bits, etc.) to be used for making various cuts. I love the basic premise that the book is based on his experience, but I wish he talked more about the WRONG ways to do things so as to put his recommendations in context. (E.g., \\"It might seem that you could cut this tenon more easily on a router table, but I recommend the use of the free router because...\\") As it is, you're pretty much left taking it all on faith, and some of the approaches seem needlessly complex. I doubt doubt the advice; I just wish I understood it in more depth.My other gripe with this book is that I've generally had some difficulty understanding how the various jigs and setups work. I'm not speaking existentially - I'm talking about basic details such as \\"Which of these boards is the workpiece?\\" and \\"What's the table and what's the jig?\\" The photographs, diagrams, and descriptions just aren't sufficiently broken down to make these details clear.To some extent this is probably a question of general woodworking knowledge, and a result of my relatively shallow background. (For example, Warner seems to assume that it's obvious what he means by \\"the fence\\" of a jig, even when there are multiple parts of the jig in direct contact with a workpiece. To me it just means \\"a barrier the workpiece slides against\\", so that doesn't narrow it down much.)All in all, a meaty and useful book, but be prepared to put some work into decoding it."},{"Title":"The Router Joinery Handbook","review":"I have found this book to be inforative and helpful. The author is detail oriented and explains his techniques well."},{"Title":"The Router Joinery Handbook","review":"The book is very difficult to follow and the plans for the jigs are quite poor. The prose is often distracting and it feels like this is either the author's first book or he was in an hurry to finish it. The pictures are all black and white and too close to the subject. You really get the sense that the author is more concerned about showing off his jig making skills rather than helping you make your own. I also dislike his blatant plugs for both Porter Cable routers and his offset subbases that he wants to sell you...."},{"Title":"Behind the Veil (The Royal Pavilions #3)","review":"It was kinda hard finding this book because it is out of print but I purchased it and read it; it was definitely well worth the price and the wait. I loved the first two books in the series and I couldn't wait to find out what happens to Helena and Tancred next. Helena Lysander was on her way to her castle of Hohms where Tancred had believed she would be safe with his adoptive father and her mother. But Helena's bodyguard, Bardas, brought news to Tancred that her entourage was overtaken by her enemy Constantine and she never reached the castle. Tancred plans a daring rescue and succeeds...until Philip Lysander has him captured and sold as a slave. Tancred fights despair and anger as he finds out that Helena, his beloved, was sent to his Moslem cousin Prince Kalid to become his wife. With some help he manages to escape his slave owner and confronts Philip. Tancred then sets out for Antioch and the Castle of Hohms where Helena is held prisoner along with her mother by the evil Bishop Constantine. He finds Helena again only to be overtaken by soldiers of Prince Kalid and was almost killed. Helena desperately saves his life but still is faced with her dilemma of marrying the prince. After nursing Tancred back from the brink of death, they plan together their escape from the city as the crusaders under Prince Bohemond close in. There is also the assassin Mosul who framed Tancred for murder and who is the bodyguard of Prince Kalid. Tancred must confront both men over Helena and prove his innocence.

But Hamilton's text turns out to be, at best, a kind of apologia and, at worst, a &quot;how-to.&quot; Consequently, his assessment--and understanding, I'm affraid--of historicism is delivered from the position of a believer and advocate. This contributes to the reproduction of a lot of conventional mantras about historicism, such as, for example, that it somehow represented--and still does--an &quot;anti-modernist&quot; position. We are still modernist, in a sense, and this is why, as this book demonstrates, it is difficult to think outside the framework of historicism. A provocative book, but not deserving of its authoritative title."},{"Title":"Bears: An Altitude SuperGuide (Altitude Superguides)","review":"Bears: Monarch's of the Northern Wilderness, by Wayne Lynch, is the best all-around natural history on bears; Van Tighem's book isn't quite as rich in natural history, but includes more practical information on safety in bear country, and environmental issues affecting bears. With spring black bear hunting a contentious issue in various parts of North America, so called &quot;experts&quot; writing for hook and bullet magazines have reassured readers that you don't have to worry about accidentally mistaking females for males, because cubs rarely leave their mother's side. Wrong. Van Tighem notes that a study near Canada's Riding Mountain National Park found that &quot;when female black bears investigate bait stations, they usually leave their cubs behind.&quot;This book is filled with well-documented facts about bears. It's well-written, too. It doesn't read like a boring scientific paper. Van Tighem touches on a lot of politically sensitive issues affecting bears but doesn't have a shrill voice at all; instead, he let's the facts speak for themselves. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"Chip Bell has the magic touch when advising managers. In his 2nd edition, he has provided helpful self-assessments that point the manager/mentor toward development needs for the purpose of being the best that you can be as mentor. He paints a verbal landscape that includes insightful adages from Socrates to the Little Prince. The short chapters and direct, pithy style make for quick reading episodes over time--minimum effort with maximum gain. And, last but certainly not least, his quotable language will give you turns of phrase to use in your own communications and presentations. Yet another star in Chip's gallery!"},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"Chip R. Bell thinks that the future relationship between the managing and the managed will resemble a partnership, and at the core of this partnership will be mentoring. In Managers as Mentors he describes the ideal relationship between mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Unfortunately, Bell's description of the \\"magical dance\\" of mentoring is perhaps the book's weakest offering, composed mainly of amorphous passages related to things like \\"synchronization and synergy.\\" When Bell narrows his focus to practical advice, however, the book begins to shine. His insights into how to give advice and ask questions, although aimed at the mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute; interaction, will be useful to readers in many other situations. For that reason, we at [...] recommend this book to executives and managers who want to be mentors, any student or professional that might someday be in the market for a mentor, or anyone who wants to pick up some common-sense communication pointers."},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"In today's employment market it is very difficult to find and retain hard-working motivated employees. Many companies are restructuring, down-sizing, and outsourcing many segments of their administrative activities, and employees have become less productive, less interested in performing quality work, and less satisfied with their jobs.Today's better salary market does not encompass all employment levels, especially those employees just entering the job market with minimal skills. Salary budgets do not always stretch to provide better wages. Teambuilding works well in bridging part of the gap between wages and self-confidence and pride in job performance.&quot;Managers as Mentors&quot; provides in-depth insight for approaching management from a teambuilding perspective. Managers can recruit, train, motivate, and inspire their employees to perform at peak levels in numerous settings by following the recommendations for mentoring employees. The techniques detailed in this book are practical, straight-forward, and easy to understand and implement. Examples illustrating the steps are clearly described.Many organizations now offer internal staff mentoring programs, and my employer is one of those groups. Managers and volunteer mentors are involved, and &quot;Managers as Mentors&quot; has become required reading before a volunteer mentor can be paired with a protege."},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"I had read a few books on mentoring as I was recently promoted after having hired 8 new people in a short period of time. My challenge is that all 12 people I would supervise are located in all parts of the country! And, I didn't want to &quot;supervise&quot; these very competent people. The other books were academic, stale. Enter Managers as Mentors! That book really spoke to me. I'm buying one for my boss, highlighting all the sections as I did after I read my copy for the 2nd time, so he will know the scope and strength of the mentoring program I intend to use. I purchased the book for my two senior regionals and we will meet to study the book. The best part of mentoring?? You CAN influence all directions - subordinates, peers, superiors. Watch out! Here we come!"},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"and so I have. My second read of &quot;Managers as Mentors&quot; leaves me even more satisfied and full of ideas and strategies than my reading of two years ago. Chip Bell is a phenomenal speaker and author. Just the time he spends and the guidance he gives in the prologue to this book will inspire managers who want to give back primarily by coaching and teaching. Read the first time to give me insight in a new job assignment; working again with new managers and many youthful workers instead of the skilled team that I had had in the northeast, I wanted to inspire myself to be more than just a &quot;good boss&quot;. I hope I have succeeded in making their work experience with me memorable, and, if I have, I owe a lot of my ability and willingness to guide and teach to the lessons I solidified by reading this book the first time.This time, my division is planning to embark on a formal mentoring program. The first five chapters and the SAGE principle will be my inspiration for the design of the introductory course, and we will utilize Bell's book in many ways as we move on through the test program for new managers and the final version for non-salaried employees to add to their personal growth, and perhaps become managers in turn.It may be some time before institutions of higher learning catch on to the fact that teaching lifestyles skills such as mentoring is crucial, not only to the success of their graduates in the workforce, but also in helping them obtain some harmony, balance, and personal satisfaction in addition to honing their technical skills. When they do, the competencies needed to succeed in a learning organization, and one that succeeds through building relationships to build productivity may find a home in undergraduate degrees of all kinds. Until then it is critical that those of us in the workforce develop the emotional wisdom it takes to be a successful leader, and also to keep learning ourselves, from the new and unfamiliar experiences we gain from the people we supervise.What a wonderful book to utilize in your own learning, or in your teaching (couple it with scenes from the movie &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and you will have a powerful tool)...Bell's book not only sets the stage and expectations for a mentoring relationship, but gives practical advice, such as how to mentor around equipment, and a quiz to assess your mentoring skills.One of today's most valuable business books...6 stars would not be enough!"},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"Mentoring is such a &quot;hot&quot; topic these days, I was concerned that this was going to be another one of those fluffy books that don't give you specific actions.

However, we feel young professionals are not well equipped with actual job skills.

Bell shares practical experiences and guidance in short easy to read chapters, while getting away from the typical referance book material.Self-assesments, tools, and communication tatics are just a few of the practical ways that are offered in this book. Often times I found that Mr. Bell cites other authors and practices. I believe that these methods are a wonderful way to bring multiple factors to a single situation and base those experiences on resolving the matter at hand.I recommend this guide to anyone that wishes to begin a healthy relationship of mentoring.

I particularly like the new chapters that address mentoring from the perspective of the protege' because they help ensure that the relationship formed is a true partnership. While the final chapter - Arduous Alliances - begins to address the difficult task of maintaining a mentoring relationship in today's fast-paced business environment, I left hungry for more help in this area.

It's poignant inasmuch as it's chock full of examples of real people doing genuine, inspiring work in helping others improve.

The gems of this book help with both. I only wish I'd known before Christmas that it was now available in paperback, because it would've been my book-gift for the season!Besides offering solid tools, checklists, and self-assessments, Dr. Bell's writing style is a breath of fresh air for those of us looking for something more engaging than the stuffy academic business books, and more meaty than the standard fable business books."},{"Title":"Managers as Mentors 2 Ed: Building Partnerships for Learning","review":"Chip Bell talks to us at a very practical level.

In fact, if you liked the first edition, you are an especially good candidate for this new one because of the content (whole chapters) he's added. And the self-assessment tool.The way this book is written encourages you to act on what you've learned. Chip all but holds your hand as he describes what works and gives examples.

I purchased this book (used) because I wanted to find out more about Erin, not for self-help philosophies. And I'm glad to say, the book shares a lot of her life story. Erin came from good parents and family, and wandered in her teenage years, succumbing to the \\"call of the party life\\".While her story is honest and remarkable, I noticed a bit of arrogance too. Erin compares her story to a fairy princess story, dropping names like Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy, and Marilyn Monroe. Her point was that no matter who you are, you'll have struggles too (like the mentioned famous ladies) but I thought it was a little conceited of her to classify herself in the same category as them. There's also the egotistical part where she says (about Julia Roberts speech when receiving her Academy Award) \\"Just because in her (Julia's) confusion and excitement, she omitted my name means nothing to me\\". Well, I guess it does if Erin brought it up in the book. I mean, why should Julia thank Erin for a performance award? Julia did the performance, not Erin.Erin admits her early struggles in life, and the struggles she's had since the movie, with both her oldest children, Matthew and Katie, having to enter rehab for drug and alcohol abuse at the tender ages of fourteen and thirteen. She speaks of her \\"formers\\" and exes coming after her for money after the making of the movie, and the lawsuits and extortion they attempted to use against her.Erin repeatedly mentions that she has, and still does, battle with dyslexia and panic attacks - showing that money itself can't cure everything. She skims only briefly over her pageant days. (She was Miss Pacific Coast in 1981, not Miss Wichita like the movie said). She's been through a lot and overcome a great deal of adversity, but her advice (the \\"self-help\\" part of the book) is bland, generic, \\"Dr. Phil\\" type of advice that only takes a person so far. (Don't lie, Believe in Yourself, blah-blah-blah...) Her best advice is underneath what she's actually saying - to take responsibility for your actions and use your mistakes to make yourself a better person.It's unfortunate that after spending more than one chapter on extolling the virtues of her recent husband Eric Ellis and how perfect their relationship is, that after the book was published she divorced him too.If you want to find out more about the intriguing character, Erin Brockovich, then this book will satisfy your desires. Take note that while she does talk about Hinkley and the lawsuit she became famous for, she never goes into any real detail about it. Don't look to this book for self-help, find a more professional volume. It's a fast, rather enjoyable read, with eight pages of color photographs. Buy used or borrow from the library. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win","review":"Kind of like the car rental commercial.... not exactly whatI was hoping for.

Finding the book better than Erin and Julie's movie, even for Erin is very UN-likely! \\"Life's a Struggle but You Can Win\\" does describe the clear theories for Erin's success. That the interviewed Erin, is the same Erin in her book is SO evidence that we can make a difference with what seems like extreme persistence until that first correction of wrong -- each new challenge less &quot;mission impossible&quot;.

Having not seen the movie, I can't say I knew much about her story when I picked up the book. After reading the book, I still don't know a lot about it.The account she gives in here of her life and the how eponymous movie was made is kind of interesting.

It was nice to read the real-life stories behind the Hollywood hype ... but the biggest surprise was that the truth was often more interesting and dramatic than the dramatization.

I also recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold. I have found much inspiration from both of these books."},{"Title":"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win","review":"Erin Brockovich and I had several things in common. We were both blonde law professionals making our way in Southern California. For those reasons I have watched Erin's story unfurl with interest.I first thought her &quot;a brilliant woman trapped in a trailer trash body&quot;. Erin, a caterpillar, of sorts, has morphed into a butterfly. I have not changed my opinion in that regard, and as time marches on I hold Erin with increasing regard.Now comes her book, \\"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle but You Can Win\\". What better person to write such a book, but the queen of struggle, Erin Brockovich. Did you see the movie staring Julie Roberts?When it comes to overcoming adversity, Erin is the expert. She lived every day of her life fighting the current. And now she has written a self-help, self-fulfilling, and all empowering book. I came away from her book thinking that I could have done more with my life. After reading this book I now feel inspired to do more with my life.One review said that the book was a \\"pretty quick read\\". A straightforward assessment, but, according to her book, those three words sum up what Erin Brockovich is really all about. A simple, unpretentious woman, whose kind and moderate nature is both quick to forgive and forget. I enjoyed this book. I think you will too.Erin has received a number of awards for her work. To mention a few: \\"Consumer Advocate of the Year\\" - Consumer Attorneys of California,\\"Profile in Courage\\" Award from Santa Clara County Trial Lawyers Association, &quot;Justice Armand Arabian Law and Media Award - San Fernando Valley Bar,\\"Champion of Justice\\" Award from the Civil Justice Foundation of ATLA, President's Award - Oregon Trial Lawyers Association, and many many more."},{"Title":"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win","review":"What's most impressive about Erin (and it shows in the book, the movie, in real life) is that she hasn't forgotten who she was or where she came from. Sure, she's outwardly flashy, but she's also a true role model in an age where most celebs are an example of how NOT to be. Take It From Me explains why Erin is Erin; where she learned to be such a caring global thinker. This book masterfully explores how Erin worked hard for what's she become and was granted very little. And it does so in a spirtually-uplifting fashion."},{"Title":"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win","review":"I'll give this 3.5 stars. It's a deeper look at the woman behind the movie, Erin Brockovich. With wit and grace Erin tells the story of her broken marriages, the drug addiction of two of her children, and how she got through proving a difficult case against PG&E.; Erin's honesty is refreshing, and I enjoyed her stories of talking to herself until she could figure out what to do. She says that sometimes you have to make your own decisions rather than relying on the advice of friends and I think that this is a valuable gift. There are times when you cannot reach your friends or you know that your situation is beyond their experience so the only person that can really help you work through it is YOU.Erin's straight-shooter personality comes out in this book on every page. While she did have help writing the book, you can't help but notice Erin's voice.I was very surprised as I read the book to find out about the hardships Erin had to endure both before and after the PG&E-Hinkley; case. She tells of how almost all of her money went into a misrepresented house and taking care of her kids' addictions. She also tells the truth about \\"Jorge\\" from the movie and her dealings with Ed Masry.She mentions the movie a few too many times throughout the book, so it gets a little irritating after the 10th time. However, I do appreciate her attempts at contrasting the movie with what really happened. It's just that several of her mentions of the movie are in little side comments that aren't really talking about the movie, but about the fact that her life SEEMS great because Julia Roberts played her, but that her life isn't great. This is fine, and needed to some extent, however, it happens many times throughout the book. Still, this is not enough to detract from the humorous, down-to-earth tale of the life of Erin Brockovich."},{"Title":"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win","review":"Cheers to Erin Brockovich!

The book is about how SHE could win, and maybe if there's time she'll give you a little advice, but she comes first.I couldn't tell if she was trying to get pity for having to rebuild her house that she paid so much for.

Other than the ridiculous cover on this paperback, as astutuely mentioned by another reviewer-a U-Boat which has nothing to do with this tales of an E-Boat and espionage, this one's a rather nice page turner and not bad for a quick thriller to fill in on the plane trip or at the beach."},{"Title":"Cold Harbour (Dougal Munro & Jack Carter)","review":"I very much enjoyed the characters.

The nanny's huband has a business of washing windows and he became sick so Jethro comes in to help him. When Allie sees what's he doing, she assumes that Jethro is poor.

There is a meddlesome ghost pushing the couple together, of course, but mainly the story is about the heroine trying to fit in with her fellow townspeople who treat her unfairly. Both the hero and the heroine are decent people, honestly portrayed, who are easy to like. I was very satisfied when they eventually opened up to each other and put an end to their repetitive cycle of non-communication. Pick up this one if you're in the mood for a slower paced, character driven novel."},{"Title":"A Willing Spirit (Haunting Hearts Series)","review":"Cynthia Sterling's second novel is a gem. A story of love between two individuals from different cultures in a small town in Texas in 1855. Tessa, a widow, hires half-breed, Micah, to help her take care of her farm, and finds herself immediately attracted to him. But the ghost of her dead husband, Will, who has hung around to watch over her, decides that a love affair between the engaging couple is the last thing he wants, and he sets about to disrupt their romance. Ms. Sterling's novel is, by turns, innocently touching, sweetly sensual and at times, hilarious, especially when Will whispers a suggestion into the ear of the local vicar to court Tessa, and is mistaken for the voice of someone higher up. Ms. Sterling spins an irresistible tale with A WILLING SPIRIT, and I can't wait for her next Haunting Hearts book."},{"Title":"A Willing Spirit (Haunting Hearts Series)","review":"Cynthia Sterling has a delightful talent for making her characters come to life -- and not just Tessa and Michah, and even the ghost, Will, but the entire town of Pony Springs, Texas.

Read it today, and cherish it forever."},{"Title":"A Willing Spirit (Haunting Hearts Series)","review":"After reading (and loving) Cynthia Sterling's debut book, PATCHWORK HEARTS, I couldn't wait for A WILLING SPIRIT to hit the shelves. Brava!--Sterling delivered again! It's rare to read a story so well-crafted that you find yourself laughing out loud one minute and dabbing away tears the next. The main characters, Micah and Tessa, ripped me along on a satisfying roller coaster of emotions, while the rich cast of fabulous secondary characters kept me firmly grounded in the story setting. In fact, I'd have to say A WILLING SPIRIT's stellar secondary characters alone are worth the price of the book. (I still think of Will the ghost and the Indian chief and grin.) All that and a satisfying love story, to boot. Combine it all with Sterling's exquisite historical detail, and A WILLING SPIRIT is the total package. Americana fans will adore it--paranormal fans will find it fresh and enticing. What more could a discerning romance reader want? But hey, please DON'T take my word for it. Order the book and find out for yourself. I absolutely guarantee, once you enter A WILLING SPIRIT's fictional world, you'll be haunting the bookstores for the next Cynthia Sterling release. Just like I am. (Impatiently!) :-)"},{"Title":"A Willing Spirit (Haunting Hearts Series)","review":"I had a good time reading this story.

Though totally shunned by the townsfolk, Tessa is not alone as the spirit of her deceased spouse Will remains her steady companion while providing her advice. A traveler arrives on foot offering to sell the saddle he carries to Tessa. Instead, she offers to sell breed Micah Fox a horse. However, neither have the money to complete a cash transaction. Instead, she hires Micah to work on the farm while her arm heals.Will tells Tessa that Micah is not the right person for her. He plans to find her a spouse to take care of her. She warns him not to frighten Micah into leaving because he is the first person to agree to help her. Will manifests himself as a hermit warning Micah to stay away from Tessa. Following that, Will journeys to town to find a husband for Tessa. He chooses Reverend Deering, obviously a respectable person. Even with otherworldly interference, Tessa is a stubborn person who will choose whom she wants when she wants.By jove, Cynthia Sterling provides fans of supernatural romance with a clever ghost story. The story line is fast-paced as Tessa and Micah begin to fall in love but he needs to figuratively and literally overcome the ghost of Will who holds onto Tessa's heart. The prejudices against the lead protagonists add depth that brings the period to life. Fans of otherworldly romances will take immense pleasure from Ms. Sterling's latest story, A WILLING SPIRIT because it is simply an entertaining novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Helping Victims of Sexual Abuse","review":"I appreciated this book for the incite it can give to a skilled helper. It helped me see into the world of someone who has suffered from sexual abuse even though I myslef have never been. The authors did an outstanding job at peering into the images and messages that are acquired as a result of having suffered such an emotionally, and spiritually damaging act as sexual abuse. As a Christain counselor I aprreciate how the authors highlighted the truth of God's Word in setting the tone for true healing. I have used this with one client an have had great success in making them feel understood, and in helping them see hope."},{"Title":"Helping Victims of Sexual Abuse","review":"This is an excellent textbook for those going into the counseling ministry. I not only enjoyed the book but gleaned alot of helpful information."},{"Title":"Helping Victims of Sexual Abuse","review":"I've had to read more than my fair share of these books in my field of study, and many books have inflated \\"fear mongering\\" statistics and a lot of misinformation on the nature of sexual abuse based upon cultural and media bias. This book is opposite. This book very accurately describes abusers as a homogeneous group rather than the trench coat wearing dirty old man image we conjure up when we think of sex offenders. In order to prevent sexual abuse, we must recognize the reality of sexual abuse, not the myths society believes about it. The facts is, most sexual abuse occurs in the home by trusted friends or family members. Not all are pedophiles. There are a variety of reasons why people commit sex crimes. Thankfully this book recognizes this fact, unlike many other books I've read on the subject.Another good point made by this book is understanding what it REALLY means to \\"forgive\\" the offender. It is NOT excusing, not punishing him/ her, or forgetting the pain caused. Forgiveness is about not allowing the past to dictate your life any longer.Most importantly, recover is a PROCESS, not one single event that instantly transforms you. I think many times we base our faith on those \\"miracle\\" stories we see on TV, when the reality is most of us continue to struggle even after we are saved.This book offers a nine-step recovery process for abuse victims, and the steps address many of the feeling abuse victims endure as a result of the abuse they suffered.The only things I feel should be addressed in the future if they revise this book again is the impact of sex offender laws in regard to barriers to treatment. The harsh nature of many sex offender laws offer incentives for family members to keep mum about the abuse or risk losing a loved one for life."},{"Title":"Helping Victims of Sexual Abuse","review":"I have read many books on the subject.

The authors didn't just go to school and learn a bunch of book stuff and then write another book, although obviously, their research is exhaustive, and appreciated. Beyond the knowledge is their heart to help. The statistics on how pervasive sexual abuse of children is is more than staggering. Jeanette Vought went on to establish Christian Recovery Center, founded on Jeremiah 29:11 FOR I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU DECLARES THE LORD; PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND NOT TO HARM YOU, PLANS TO GIVE YOU HOPE AND A FUTURE. i cannot recommend this enough or too much.

I wanted something with a thoroughly biblical perspective. Many books on this subject are either very humanistic and Freudian in their approach. Others that are more biblical in their perspective often give overly simple explanations of the problem, giving pat answers that do not go deep enough to solve the real-world consequences of abuse. The authors of this book provide a balanced perspective that remains true to Christian worldview while honestly addressing the difficulties of this subject and how contributions of psychological research fit into a Christian worldview.This book helped me to understand that sexual abuse (or physical abuse) at an early age can affect the actual brain development of a child and adolesent causing problems that may require the survivor to re-learn simple things we take for granted like trust. Fear serves as a defensive mechanism during the abuse and releases hormones like ephinephrine that heighten the persons senses to danger, but later works against the survivor by preventing them from getting close to other people and trusting them in natural ways. I especially found the insights on \\"hyper vigilance\\" helpful.I would recommend reading \\"Learning to Trust Again\\" by Christa Sands along with this book to get an inside view of sexual abuse from a survivor perspective."},{"Title":"The History of the Republican Party","review":"This is a great book!

Brenton's experience was that most companies invariably needed to mix Novell Netware networks with, for example, Windows NT, perhaps also supporting some Macintoshs that speak AppleTalk, and, with the increasing importance of the Internet, every administrator also needed to understand TCP/IP. Brenton's book is about how to be calm and organized and master all of it. He starts from the beginning with elementary network concepts and facts: what's actually on the transmission line, the kinds of line and airwave media, and basic network topologies. He describes each of the different kinds of networking hardware, from punch-down panels and PC Cards through hubs and switches (including those that handle VLANs). A chapter that begins with the Open Systems Interconnection OSI) reference model discusses specific network protocols including IP, the various TCP/IP application protocols, Novell's Domain Name Service (DNS), IPX, NetBIOS, and AppleTalk, and relates them all to OSI. After discussing these protocols together in a single chapter, the author provides a chapter on each major network operating system - Novell's IntranetWare, the Windows NT server, and UNIX systems - and adds a chapter about Lotus Notes, a network application likely to be superimposed on any of them. Having discussed servers, Brenton then describes how to configure the client programs at workstations and how to consolidate protocols. The final chapters describe the troubleshooting tools available to an administrator in general and within each operating system and provide approaches to diagnosing real-world problems. Unlike a number of networking books we've seen, this book is a pleasure to read. Brenton's conversational style set into a well-organized framework lets you read, meander, or do a quick look-up. The book design and the book's many illustrations ! aim at clarity. At whatis.com, we haven't had this book long, but we find ourselves making frequent use of it. This book is not just for network administrators. We recommend it without qualification to anyone who wants to know more about how networks work."},{"Title":"Multiprotocol Network Design and Troubleshooting","review":"Hats off to Chris Brenton!

In reality, the book is heavily weighted towards Novell. The vast majority of examples, descriptions and figures are specifically from Novell. Not that that's bad, but be prepared for lightly covered NT and Red Hat Linux. I'm still confused about why Lotus Notes was included in a book of NOSs. Still, the book was well laid out, easy to follow, and fairly exhaustive in covering networking, from a topical viewpoint. Anyone who wants to understand any part of networking, from beginning to end, Chris Brenton touches on it.Although the author seems very knowledgeable, the grammatical errors are like boulders on the interstate; all that clutter makes navigation terribly slow. I'm astonished the publisher let this title go to print with its name on it. That leads me to believe Sybex is more interested in shaking down its readers, than in providing decent reading material.

Readers unfamiliar with song writers such as Aunt Molly Jackson, Jim Garland, and Ella May will be delighted by Lynch's descriptions of them and their songs. Scholars will find new insights into the songs, and a lengthy bibliography. One of Lynch's principal points is that &quot;unlike their husbands, brothers, and fathers, women lyricists drew an overt connection between the deprivation they saw their families experiencing and the fight for higher wages, improved working conditions, and collective bargaining rights.&quot; Lynch's prose sparkles, and this sets his book apart from so many others published by academic presses."},{"Title":"Paint Shop Pro 5 for Windows (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"If you're an experienced Paint Shop Pro user, this might be a good reference book.

Ben Sawyer and Joann Meyer have written Paint Shop Pro 5 for Windows to offer a concise overview of the operation of the entire program.The book offers readers detailed instruction on a number of topics such as setting the program's preferences, creating images, acquiring new images (scanning, digital cameras, clipart collections, and Web services), using the many editing tools included with the program, creating Web images, controlling colors for faster Web delivery, and creating animated Web graphics with Animation Shop that ships with Paint Shop Pro.Of special interest to others, who like myself enjoy experimenting with creative image editing, the book devotes a considerable amount of time discussing the use of the image filters supplied with the program. Readers are taken on an in-depth step-by-step walk through their use. A color illustrated section provides some amazing special effects anyone can create on their own with very little effort involved!This Paint Shop Pro reference guide is clearly and concisely organized, making it easy to follow.

I understand that they faced obvious defeat and were able to arrange for a settlement in which they retained \\"autonomy\\" over the lower half of the coutry. How \\"independent\\" the Vichy France government was and how much they ended up collaberating with the Nazis is a story that much of the rest of the world knows little of. I understood that the feelings in France were quite divided during the occupation/collaberation. \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\" helps make this even more apparent.Jules Roy is the author of this study of the trial of the improbable leader of the Vichy government, Marshal Phillipe Petain. Roy has the credentials to write this story because he was in the French Army; the one that stayed with France. He frequently expressed his sense of doubt as to his misplaced loyalties at the time. In his apparent shame for the outcome of his allegiance, there remains a loyalty for the ultimate authority that Petain represented to him and to millions of other Frenchmen. How then to judge a man who may have betrayed or may have saved France.Roy leads us through each day of the trial interjecting his own thoughts and observations. At time these asides are extremely helpful while, at other times, they are bewildering. Roy has two basic faults as the author of \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\". The first is a tendency to assume that the reader knows all of the events that took place during the Vichy government. For example, there are several references fo the affair in Syria. As far as I could tell, French aviators had to fight British troops during a military encounter. I never heard of it before and could have used at least a footnote of explanation. The second shortcoming is Roy's obsession with Byron. He quotes excessively from \\"Marino Faliero\\" yet none of his citations conveyed any profundity or relevant addition to the subject at hand. He tends to get poetic at times to the distraction of the reader.I picked up \\"The Trial of Marshal Petain\\" to find out more about the nature of Vichy France. I succeeded in that search but I'm still looking for more."},{"Title":"Trial of Marshal Petain","review":"The book has its moments, which is not hard considering the personalities, conflicts, and notoriety involved. However, nearly half the book is consumed by the author - who was loyal to Vichy until the landings in North Africa - attempting to convince the reader that _he's_ not a traitor. While this provides some insights into the divided loyalty dilemma the French faced, it's tangential to the topic of the book: the trial.The author also spends zero time on introductory material, assuming the reader is familiar with French legal process and every personality, speech, major event, and political conflict discussed on its pages.Nonetheless, as I said, it has its moments. Dividing the book by day was brilliant for organization. We glimpse Reynaud's bitterness at being the Cassandra no one listened to (\\"Who are the three men responsible for France's misfortune? Daladier for making Petain Ambassador in Madrid, me for making him a minister, and Laval for making him head of state.\\"), Laval's dismissiveness at even being considered a traitor, the feigned-or-not senility of Petain, and the I-was-just-following-orders and I-don't-remember answers from the cowardly Vichy ex-officials.Once the excuses and the lies about saving France are set aside, the truth is that Petain expected the Nazis to win the war and was determined to be on that winning side. (The author, almost trying to convince himself more than us, argues that Petain played both sides and saved France.) The France that Petain sought to \\"save\\" is an unrecognizable one: one where Frenchmen lived not as free men but in German chains. The author comes close to drawing the reader's attention to this fundamental truth."},{"Title":"The Rhyming Season","review":"This is a great read.

Argue all you want about his descriptions (are they masterful, or are they tedious?); his characterization is what makes the book breathe. Will Halloway, Jim Nightshade, Mr. Dark, the dust witch -- I finish the book for the hundredth time, and I am STILL surprised that they are not there, reading over my shoulder.

He uses truly timeless themes (fear of evil, growing pains, freudian struggle between father and son, greed) and joins them with excellently layered and creative metaphorical prose. I literally get chills down my spine reading this work, both in terms of the alternating tension and relief in this dramatic tale of horror, and also because of Bradbury's wonderfully refreshing and unique ability to please and surprise with his descriptions of events.

It is being able 2 see through the children's eyes that makes it all enjoyable.

Dandelion Wine had better stories and better descriptions. That being said, this was a very entertaining book and the story line will certainly make you turn the page without effort."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"What stood out the most about Bradbury's most famous work \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was the supercharged, heady wording. Full of allegories and not-quite-normal descriptions, the book was an interesting read even without the dystopian setting and robot spider dogs. In this book, the colorful language and oddball wording once again takes the front stage. Although it occasionally comes across as overbearing, Bradbury usually uses just enough off-ness to set the reader on a razor edge.The setting is a surreptitiously evil carnival, where the dead live again through the power of an electric chair and the mirror maze drowns souls with the weight of the future. The carnival is populated by all manners of freaks and horrors, yet when two kids discover its dark underbelly, of course, no one believes them. Carnivals are supposed to be strange and the freaks are supposed to be freaky, after all. It is under this guise of twisted normalcy that the Carnival feeds on the boys' hometown.You know that feeling you used to get when you read a fantasy book and the hero is confronted with Sauron or some other unimaginably powerful evil? That dread and utter hopelessness you feel when you honestly wonder if the hero will be able to stand up to it and win? Most of us have grown out of that feeling, too cynical to believe that anyone would write a fantasy story were the hero loses. Well, this book brought that feeling back, and that speaks volumes about its craftsmanship.When it comes to the psychological horror genre, you can't find anyone much better at it than Bradbury. While less popular, this book is as good of a horror novel as Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian one. Put on your white hat and read it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Originally released in the early 1960s, Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" reads as fresh as any dark fantasy novel or horror piece written today, and it's as well written as the best of the genre, Stephen King and Dean Koontz and the like.The story in this novel starts off quite simply. There's a small town. In the middle of the night a train rolls into town and a carnival unloads itself off the train. Two young boys become interested and begin sneaking around the carnival at night, as young boys are likely to do. But then weird things begin happening in town.I won't say any more about the plot, because it would give too much away.But the writing here is great, flows easily and is full of awe-inspiring moments and some laughter. The darkness of this tale is not visually grotesque, so this is a perfect story for both adults and young adults. Even children nearing the teen years could enjoy this book.As far as a theme or subtext, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" focuses a lot on age, on the young seeking their dreams, and the old wishing for dreams that had never come to fruition. The relationships between fathers and sons is also a main feature of this story.Read it, you'll love it. It's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is hands down in my opinion Bradburys best novel and my favorite story his.

The book came quickly and was as advertised. This book is a quick read and is enjoyable. I recomend it to any one who likes fanasty/science fiction. Also gives an idea of what a small town in the midwest was like in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a dark tale about weakness in the face of temptation. A tale that is a moving commentary on youth and relationships, as well as being unsettling when it depicts how regrets affect our attitudes and actions in maturity.The book centers on two boys moving into adolescence, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, best friends born two minutes apart. When Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show rolls into town with its carnival attractions, the boys natural curiosity for adventure lead them to discover the sinister intentions of the show. The boys, as different as light and dark but complimentary to each other, must work to save the community (and themselves). To stop Mr. Dark they must fight their own desires and growing impulses.Ray Bradbury's writing style is lyrical and poetic which takes a few pages to get accustomed to, but ultimately enhances a book that if written in a more direct style would feel slightly empty. The tone is dark and brooding in a beautiful way that carries the novel to heights above where it should be for the story alone. Although the story has wonderful coming of age yearnings, mystical and dark action and a lovely father and son awakening, the theme of loving yourself and accepting your fears is slightly bland. It is Bradbury's lyrical writing that creates an emotion on the page that leaves the reader mesmerized.There is much to enjoy with this book. Although the book is developed around the two boys and their relationship, I found myself routing for Will's father to shed his fears of being irrelevant and not miss the opportunity to show his son that it is his maturity that will be needed to beat back Cooger and Dark. I also loved some of the really spooky possibilities of how Cooger and Dark's carrousel could create situations where innocence of youth may not be so innocent.A good book with some very beautiful writing and scenes, but overall it seems slightly incomplete with many themes just touched upon leaving the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked this way comes starts out as a book about two boys named Will and Jim. Jim always gets into trouble for not thinking but acting while Will usaully thinks and avoids things. This book is a mystery that will have you on your seat reluctant to put it down. The beginning scenerio is that there is a man who sells lightning rods walking down the street and there is about to be a storm. The man offers Jim one. This is the first time you see Jim's ignorance and Will's insight. Jim thinks it would be cool to have your house hit by lightning while Will is convinced that it would not be worth taking the risk. Soon the boys are in the midst of a carnival that claims the merry go round is broken when infact it runs backwards. They see a man on the merry go round get younger as it goes around. This sets the novel up for a great mystery and plot. The first thing that will catch your eye will be that you are constantly trying to figure this novel out, if you skip one scene or one page you may be confused for the rest of the book. Overall I beleive this book would be good to recomend to anyone looking for a very good mystery novel with good themes and a good plot."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"_I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success._Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds...._This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar._This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This book is a fiction masterpiece. It is enormously frightening in a very subtle way. I found it easy to identify with the two main characters, whose lives are forever changed in an instant by the sudden appearance of evil. It reminds us just how very fragile our surroundings really are and how evil can have many, not so obvious faces. At the same time, we see how good can triumph over darkness. Suspenseful to the end, I could barely put the book down."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I tried to read this book several times when I was about thirteen (the age of the two boys in the story). Although I was a Bradbury fan, and found the tone and premise intriguing, I could never get past the opening chapters, usually setting it aside about the time the carnival pulls into town.35 years later, I finally read it.I didn't lose anything by waiting, because I'm sure my younger self would have been disappointed. This story has a lot to offer in terms of its philosophical mood, and has a haunting quality to it, but it's told in a surrealistic style that is not always clear, and Bradbury's prose is clotted with numerous tangled metaphors and sentences that make no literal sense. It's still not what I'd call a difficult read; I whipped through it in a few days. Bradbury maintains an element of suspense(more by suggestion than by clearly describing anything) and the conclusion, although slightly heavy-handed, is satisfying.&quot;Something Wicked this way Comes&quot; reminds me of two books: &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L'Engle, a children's novel which made a tremendous impression on me when I was nine years old; and Stephen King's &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which has a similar theme. There are probably dozens of stories using this theme; since this one was published 40 years ago it's not fair to call it derivative, but I'm not sure if it's genuinely original. None of that really matters, though, since it's Bradbury's feel for the time and place, and his accurate depiction of the adolescent point of view that make this story effective, in spite of its frequent wordiness, obscurity, and overwriting. Sometimes the best writers can get away with bad writing --- or what would be bad writing in the hands of a less capable author --- and that seems to me to be the case here.As others have observed, it's not a horror novel; more of a dark fantasy with a positive underlying theme. I find it encouraging that so many young people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Most of what needs to be said has been said above, but I'd like to add a word about Bradbury's lexical enthusiasm. Too many folks here knocking him for 'swallowing the thesaurus' or summat. What a dumbed-down, pathetic bunch of quasi-illiterate prats! Some folks could (can) write like that without dictionary, thesaurus, assistance or therapy. They did/do it for fun, for the sheer joy of language, for the ping-pong of Joyce, Woolf and Faullker versus Hemingway, Mailer and Co, avalanches of colour versus perfectly composed black and white. Bradbury never needed the paranoid little forewords that whinged about fantasy and sci-fi being peripheral to literature. He could write, late 50's/early 60's-style, and do it well. To judge him by the cretinous reductionism of the post-post modern is anachronistic, patronising and unfair. Sod off and complain about Moby Dick if you want to pick holes in language."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Well, Ray Bradbury pulled off something I never thought I'd see: heartwarming horror. Something Wicked This Way Comes is a truly frightening horror story about two boys living in a midwestern town visited by a mysterious carnival and its group of evil proprietors and \\"freaks.\\" The boys see too much and become the target of the malevolent forces of the carnival. Bradbury writes these characters to be truly frightening.The horror story itself would have been very solid, but Bradbury marries it seamlessly to the story of one of the two boys coming to see his father in a different light, even as the father finds something within himself that has sat dormant for far too long.A truly deep story that will scare you, inspire you and keep you turning the pages. This one should be read more often, it's a real gem."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Sometimes there seem to be two Ray Bradbury's. On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.But in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.Oh, and whatever you do, don't watch the movie version."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury has always been a better short story writer than a novelist but occassionally he comes along with something that makes you wonder why he doesn't write more novels. However most of his best novels read like longer short stories and this one is no exception. Not that I'm complaining, mind you, because this one is so good you don't notice how short it is and really don't even care. His classic seems engrained on our collective conscious and most people probably think the phrase &quot;Something wicked this way comes&quot; comes from the title of this book and not from the Shakespeare play (Macbeth?). The one thing I notice that's different about his writing is that it's far more lyrical than normal, he seems to have a better command of the English language and every sentence and paragraphp seems dense with imagery and metaphors. The story itself ain't too bad either, the tale of a carnival that has come to take the souls of the unsuspecting town, and only two boys and a father who doubts himself can stop them. Mr Dark is one of the best villians ever to grace a novel and he exudes menace and pure evil all at the same time. The entire novel feels like a child's dream turned into nightmare and Bradbury's trademark nostalgia is still there, though less prominent than usual. Everything is beautifully constructed and you'll want to savor the writing over and over. Everyone who thought he had left horror should read this, even though it's not in the same vein as say The October Country it's close enough and just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked this Way Comes is a story of mystery. If you like spooky and curious novels, you are going to like this one. Something Wicked this Way Comes has events you probably want to know who the bad person is and what is going to happen. I did not really understand the story in the beginning; because my opinion is that, the author goes from talking about a character and does not click with the rest of the story. The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read. The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like. You can picture the theme of the story easily. Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has. The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one. They hide, because the carnival freaks are trying to hunt them down! If you choose to read this novel, read each chapter carefully, because if you do not you will get lost and would not know what is happening."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the masters of modern literature. However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to. It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons. Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out. The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW! And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R. McCammon which in many ways is a reflection on this story...the two would definately make excellent book ends."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book!

My only source of confusion is whether I've always felt this way or only since reading \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes.\\"Ray Bradbury is amazing.

It is a perfect book for anybody looking for a literary chill to go with the melancholy of an autumn night.

Something sinister is afoot and therein lies the tale.This is vintage Bradbury. At its face, a simple horror story with evil men and their evil intentions set within the neon glare of the inherently creepy carnival.But in classic Bradbury style, it is also a look at the murky, unmanageable chasm between youth and adulthood, and the many pitfals of traversing it. An absolutely must read. The kind of book that will provoke long rested memories of childhood while providing the kind of chills that spring from long autumn shadows. You will hear the sound of far off carousel music long after laying the book to rest."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury's dark novel of a mysterious carnival that strolls one night into a quiet Midwestern town has attained a deserved classic status in the forty-some years since its unheralded release. Here Bradbury's oft-demonstrated gift for recalling the mindset of childhood and returning it however briefly to a reader, is in full bloom. Two thirteen-year-old boys, James Nightshade and William Halloway, each a sort of contrast of the other, exist as the heroes in this fable of good versus evil. In this book the weight of the desires of the human heart and the capacity of those desires to ensnare the soul (here, literally) merit the fullest exploration. Nowhere else in literature is a Mephistophelian bargain made so simplistically appealing, and it is a delight to see how Bradbury delivers his temptations like ripe red apples inwardly rotten to the core. And while thinking about the nature of evil, it seems certain constants have been there to bind the forces of ill in the genre of light versus darkness. One of these is that evil has universally stood revealed in the end. Can evil not hide itself? It seems it always gives its nature away. In this book at least Bradbury has the unmasking come in the form of the intuitive perspicacity of two small boys. I liked this enjoyable tale and I liked its characters, from the wickedly charismatic ringmaster Mr. Dark, to its peculiarly vulnerable wicked witch, to the custodian of the town library, Mr. Halloway, whose seemingly dull life is truly one of secret worlds opening to him each night amid the stacks of books. And what WOULD we each give, either now or one day, to be young all over again? Stop to think about that. And if not a return to youth, do we each have some secret desire for which we would do anything, or pay any price? Under the guise of a soft read, Something Wicked This Way Comes delves deep into humanity's consciousness, and explores what lies within."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury's novel opens up with a wonderful prologue describing good months and bad months. After reading this, I couldn't wait to delve into the novel to discover what other morsels of genius he had to offer.The story of good versus evil, youth versus death, and love versus hate is timeless. It will never get old. It will be recycled in various formats until the day people stop telling stories. Bradbury uses his story as a vehicle to expound upon these themes.When a wicked carnival comes to town it tempts its inhabitants with youth and life. It's hard to say no to your greatest wishes as Will, Jim, and Charles Halloway discover. Some townsfolk cannot turn their back on their dreams. Others discover that true happiness means accepting Life's twists and turns, no matter how cruel they may be.This novel is full of exquisite figurative language. Bradbury shows his prowess as a storyteller in this tale of good and evil."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury's classic tale is about two thirteen-year-old boys who dally with a strange and evil circus and end up fighting a battle to save their town from the dark forces of evil. There are many vividly frightening characters and scenes along the way. When things are looking really grim for the boys and the society, one of their fathers steps in, believes their outlandish tales, and joins forces with them. The father figure spouts eloquent philosophy on a wide range of subjects, and in the end, he's the true battle hero, which is a little disappointing, because I wanted the young heroes to shine more. Overall, this is a great read around the month of October, and I know it will be enjoyed by generations to come."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Mr. Neal Luis PeraltaEnglish 1 9/2/03Dear Peers,SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMESPeer reviewIf you are looking for a book that has eloquent vocabulary, you should read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES by Ray Bradbury who wrote the book in a very eloquent vocabulary. If you do not like books that have, too many mysteries you should not read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES because the book has many mysteries that need to be solve. I recommend the book to readers who like to solve mysteries and to those who want to have a good time while reading a book. The book is 293 pages long it is very long but is worth it because you get the chance to read a very cool reading book. The book has many life lessons that can teach you how to deal with daily life problems. I learned many life lessons from the book one thing that I learned was not to be nave when people are warning you about something that could hurt you and you do not even listen to them because you do not trust them. The two main character of the book are James and Will who are two cool teenagers who are trying to solve a mystery in there home town city of Green town, Illinois.

How these two innocents, both age 13, save the souls of the town as well as their own, makes for reading on timeless themes. What would you do if your secret wishes could be granted by the mysterious ringmaster Mr. Dark? Bradbury excels in revealing the dark side that exists in us all, teaching us ultimately to celebrate the shadows rather than fear them. In many ways, this is a companion piece to his joyful, nostalgia-drenched Dandelion Wine, in which Bradbury presented us with one perfect summer as seen through the eyes of a 12-year-old. In Something Wicked This Way Comes, he deftly explores the fearsome delights of one perfectly terrifying, unforgettable autumn. O"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"For someone in search of a dark read, this is it. The poetic prose of Ray Bradbury swept me off of my feet and into the small town in Illinois country where the midnight carnival arrived with it's empty promises and tantalizing shows. Bradbury shows us how people can be good or evil, and that the choice remains in every person; he also provides beautiful examples of how joy and imagination triumph over fear and doubt. He uses the carnival as a symbolic representatation of what happens to people who allow themselves to drift in the past and not make progress towards future happiness. Bradbury alludes to several of his earlier writings, tying together many of his other works into this chilling novel. Even if you have never read Bradbury's work before, this book holds great insite into the world and the individual within it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"There are so many levels to this novel, so many important subplots that to dismiss this book as an &quot;evil carnie&quot; story would be totally irrelevant and unfair. The evil- and this book defines evil, it hits the nail on the head- takes so many forms and affects so many people; but here are the most important:... 1) Jim and Will's friendship. They're best friends, but they're obviously spereated by their characters. Will has been brought up by both his parents; he's thoughtful, a little neurotic; shy, conservative and introverted. Jim is the opposite. He was brought up only by his mother, his father left when he was little; he's outgoing, impulsive, daring, eager to grow up, leave the past behind. Bradbury expresses their differences several ways: Wills' blond, Jim's dark-haired; Will was born one minute before Halloween, Jim's one minute after. And even though he's older, Will always feels he's behind Jim. Like Jim's always in a rush to grow up, leave Will behind... there's symbolism in a scene where Will's running after Jim, and Jim's constantly slowing down for Will. This is important when the carnival comes to town, because Jim, perhaps anxious for a father figure, is easily swayed in going with the carnival. In Star Wars, Jim would turn to the dark side, and Will the light... 2) Will's fathers age. Mr. Halloway feels like he's grown up too fast; and now, in his fifties, he believes that he's never done anything with his life. He feels particularly ashamed that he's never been there for Will: never young enough to play ball with him, run with him, climb with him. And now he's afraid that Will doesn't love him anymore, and is gradually turning into his father. Mr. Halloway bears a mental load on his back of age and regret. Bradbury does a wonderful job here, as in all his stories, of really communicating a man's personal fears and longings. You really side with Mr. Halloway, because his insecurities and insights are the same as ours. You feel his angst, and when the carnival comes beckoning, offering him the chance to be young again, you can truly understand his dilemma... This is really a novel about the evil which resides in us all, merely manifested into something tangible. It's about humanity: their desires, fears, longings, insecurities, regrets, and how we can't let go of them. This is a horror book, not it the sense of ghouls and goblins (though there's plenty of that); it's a horror book about the stuff inside of us, and what we don't express to the ones we love. This is my favorite book, and might just be yours once you read it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Okay, sorry for the pun, but it's true. Hear we have probably one of the most effecting horror novels ever written. What makes Bradbury so powerful a writer. It's not just the simple, yet lyrical, prose, but how every word seems to pulse with the theme of his stories. Bradbury is a master fanticist, who, like Gene Wolfe or Harlan Ellison, has written an large amount of stories in various genres (SF, Horror, even mainstream) yet alway maintaining the same style and texture. Any one who loves good writting should at least read this, The Martian Chronicles, and Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This magnificent story of a dark carnival that visits a small town is a masterpiece. Ray Bradbury weaves an incredible blend of grace in prose with this tale of a would-be boyhood dream turned nightmare. The head of the circus 'Mr. Dark' will really give you chills as he is a pure through and through villian seeking the souls of everyone in town. 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is one of Bradbury's paramount works of pure genius. Anyone will truly be a Bradbury fan after reading this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"If there was a rating for zero stars, this book deserves it. I've never read anything so awful. If I didn't have to read it for school, I wouldn't have gotten past the 1st chapter.

Bradbury starts well but turns increasingly pretentious and obscure. From the third chapter on, there is at least two metaphors per paragraph, and quite a few of them are undecipherable."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This novel is a coming-of-age tale of two thirteen-year-old boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade. A carnival arrives at their small town during October, the wrong time of the year for a carnival. Soon, it is apparent that this is no ordinary carnival. There is a maze of mirrors that drowns people with their fears about themselves, a tempting carousel that can both increase and decrease age, and a multitude of freaks that have fallen victim to these fears and temptations. The leader of the carnival is Mr. Dark, the Illustrated Man. Charles Halloway, Will Halloway's father, becomes the hero of the tale because he finds away to defeat the freaks: smiling and laughter. The freaks feed off of negative energy, so a laugh can render them useless and even dead.The novel started out rather slowly. The beginning discourse was intriguing, but it just didn't hold my interest through a large section. The freaks and the supernatural events were hard to believe at first. They seemed to be too easily accepted in the fabric of the story when they were first introduced. The author spends a lot of time letting Charles Halloway talk. There were times when I just wanted him to shut up and do whatever it was he needed to do.Despite the fact that Charles Halloway talked too much, he made a lot of interesting observations. There are beautiful passages in the book. I copied some out to remember them. I liked it that the main temptation, the carousel, played on the fear of death, the most common fear in anyone.I have mixed feelings on whether I like this book or not. I give it a 2 1/2 out of 5."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I read Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. I give this book a 3 star rating. The author takes a long time to get to the point, so it's a little boring. If you don't understand metaphors then you probably wouldn't want to read this book.Something Wicked This Way Comes is mainly about two thirteen-year-old boys, who are best friends, experiencing the wrath of evil. It all starts with a flyer that says \\"Crooger and Dark's Pandemonium Side Show\\". Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, the best friends, find this flyer. At three o'clock in the morning, they see the carnival roll in. Once they visit the carnival they quickly find out that there is something not right. The main attraction is the \\"Freak\\" show and the Mirror Maze will suck you in and you will never come out. Will and Jim visited the carnival one night and the \\"Freaks\\" caught them. The boys' got away but the \\"Freaks\\" hunted them down. Once the boys' and Charles Halloway were caught all it took was a little love for the \\"Freaks\\" and the carnival to go away.Will Halloway is one of the main characters in the book. He thinks about danger much more than Jim. Will was afraid to go to the Mirror Maze because he saw evil in it. Although, as the story unfolds, he becomes more confident. He shows this by cutting the witches balloon. Jim Nightshade is a main character also. He is the exact opposite of Will. Jim is a daredevil and carefree. He wanted to experience the wrath of the carnival and fight the evil. Jim shows that he is afraid of nothing by wondering the streets at night and going to the carnival a couple times alone before Will went with him.If you think or know that you enjoyed Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury then you would enjoy A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle, All Summer in a Day by Ray Bradbury, and The Veldt by Ray Bradbury.

I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:\\"Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.\\"Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I thought this would have made a great short story. If all the action had been packed in to 1/4 the number of pages, it would have made for a very exciting read. But I got bogged down with all the philosophy and the description. Something exciting would happen, then there would be five pages of philosophy, and then something else exciting would happen. Sometimes the philosophical rambles would occur in the middle of conversations between characters.I would have enjoyed this book more if I had been in the right mood for it. I picked it up because I enjoyed the movie, and my experience with Ray Bradbury (mainly short stories) is that his work is exciting and entertaining. I was just looking for a fluff story, I wasn't prepared to work for it.The plot line was great. It revolves around two boys and a carnival that comes to town. This was a different sort of carnival, though, because it was run by evil people who fed off people's fears and unattained desires. The two boys manage to fight the carnival and loosen its grip on their town.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or good triumphing over evil. But take care to realize that it's not a quick and exciting read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury is an exceptional writer....and this story is like a well-written Goosebumps book. It is NOT scary for an adult brought up on Stephen King horror. However, I was fooled by reviews claiming this book &quot;has been known to give some people nightmares&quot;.... well, those &quot;some people&quot; are twelve year olds. I recommend this book for pre-teens. For adults, I recommend Stephen King's Needful Things, which is vaguely similar."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Were the option available, I would have given the book 2.5 stars, but since it wasn't, I opted for 2 stars; I will not give this book half a star more than it deserves, and I don't feel too unfair giving it half a star less. Basically, this book strengthens my belief that just because a novel was published over a decade ago and it contains original concepts, it does not automatically receive the title of \\"classic.\\" Unfortunately, that is how I came to read this book; it was recommended to me as a classic.First of all, I cannot vouch that the idea of a \\"dark carnival\\" is entirely original, but for the sake of the review, I'll assume that Bradbury was the one to conjure it up. That aside, there are only a few aspects of this book in its favor, and a great many aspects that hurt its value.After reading the first ten or so pages of the book, I thought it would indeed be an interesting read; the contrasing personalities of best friends Will and Jim, the reclusive Mr. Halloway, and the lightning-rod salesman's encounter with the first two gave a solid opening to the book.But the next 225 pages of the book were nearly torturous. First of all, it's hard to follow protagonists with cardboard cut-out personalities, who encounter more lifeless shells. The only exception to the uninteresting characters was Mr. Halloway; even the \\"evil\\" characters are boring once you get past their basic premise (the fact they thrive off of the suffering of others, a concept that is never really explained). Second, Ray Bradbury's writing style was unique in the beginning of the book, but quickly became obnoxious. I'm talking about the sentence fragments, run-ons where every other word is \\"and,\\" and the ridiculous metaphors and similes sprinkled over everything. At some points, the philosophical description fit in, but most of the time, it just hindered the reader from going through the book smoothly. Even when I went back and reread some of these descriptions, it seemed as though Mr. Bradbury only used them to distinguish himself. He succeeded, and for that I congratulate him; this was the first book I've gone through where I had to reread sentences to the point where it became nauseating.Finally, there is the senselessness of some of the book's plot. A good example is Will's encounter with the Dust Witch, where he somehow knows how she is able to locate him. Nope, no explanation as to why he knows, no precedent he's basing the guess off of, he just knows. And how about Mr. Halloway discovering the carnival's secrets from research at the library? I guess a lot of books were written on the evil ulterior motives of circuses. Please.But to be fair, the book's last 50 or so pages were decent. But I just couldn't say this was a good book because of a DECENT ending; the fact of the matter is, the majority of the book was sub-par, and a merely satisfying ending didn't compensate for that."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"A good old creepy carny type story.The wicked in the title refers to the travelling sideshow/fun fair/show or whatever you want to call it attraction that rolls into a nowheresville USA town.

I think most peers like to read fiction books and this is a fiction book, so most people would like them. This book is one of a kind, I say that because most of the times you do not read this types of novels. This book takes place in a small town with a big storm on the way and no one in town cares except two kids. This book is also about two friends, Jim and Will that have been friends since babies and do most things at the same time. These two boys find out a mystery that most people in town do not know about because it does not happen that often. This novel is interesting because thing happen that are not expected. For example, an old man in a black suit told Jim and Will that Jims house was going to be hit by a lightning, so he gave them a lightning rod to help them. Then the old man in the black suit disappeared and Will went running to the house to help but Jim stayed behind like if he did not care that his mother was not in the house. Another example is when they went to the carnival when they are parents told them not to go because something weird is going on that only. Wills dad knows but will not tell his kids. In the carnival, they found out that the marry-go-round did work but went backwards. Then they saw the people who worked in the carnival were changing figure, which was weird.Well if you choose to know more about the novel, you should read it and if you do, I hope you like it as much as I did.Sincerely,Esmeralda Castillo"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books.

And his style is clearly on display here: a flair and passion for nostalgia he effortlessly imbues throughout this allegory: a morality tale which on the surface seems simple enough but has several complex themes running through it (if one cares to take notice and truly analyze it). The premise is familiar: a dark and sinister carnival, centuries old, led by a Mephistopheles-like character, Mr. Dark/The Illustrated Man, arrives one chilling October morning to tempt the fair people of Green Town, by granting them their deepest and most secret desires. However, as such similar allegories and parables play out, we discover the Luciferian-like temptations are nothing more than a Pandora's Box waiting to happen, and the most unimaginable horrors to be unleashed on the unsuspecting victims. But there are those among us with purity of heart who have the vision to see through such treachery and pose the biggest threat to evil. And therein, Bradbury harkens us back to such a time of innocence, a time of ageless wonder, an almost dream-like time, a time when our very thoughts and passions were at its infancy, and the dark and fearsome world, which lurked in the shadows and deep recesses of our unsophisticated and underdeveloped minds, were still years away at a safe and measurable distance, a time when we were all children... lamentably, a time when everything was a beautiful lie. As in most magical and sensory-leaden fairy tales, the ending is predictable and almost anti-climatic: Yes, good does defeat evil, as it always seems to in idyllic literature, but Bradbury's delivery is rather hokey as Bradbury is prone to get caught up in over-sentimentality, happily exploring the make-up of his past. In hindsight, I had hoped Bradbury would explore the depths of the dark underbelly of evil which lie within all of our souls and our pathetic attempts of the denial of its existence, instead of just skimming its surface."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is a great read.

However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to. It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons. Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out. The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW! And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R.

Under the guise of a children's tale is a story of a circus of bad intentions, a seller of lightning rods, an evil merry-go-round, and the terror of being a teenager.

They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter.

The author makes the reader understand that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so tempting. The people of the town aren't really bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, and head down the path of evil. What Mr. Dark is offering is a temptation in every sense of the word. Will has to struggle against him in a truly heroic way."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The most important thing to know about this cd set is that it is NOT an unabridged sound recording of the book. It is a performance like a play. Amazon's description is not clear."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway are two best friends teetering on the edge of adolescence. They run wild like the archetypal boy has always run, free of worry and filled with a sense of anticipation and adventure. On a night indistinguishable from other nights both walk the streets of Green Town, Illinois, the kind of place where boys are allowed to roam with the world as their chaperone, the earth their toy box. There they meet the lightning-rod salesmen who deliciously warns the two of a coming storm with the prospect of lightening. What better enticement for the two than the excitement, the danger, the possibility that one of their houses--and only one--will be struck, changed by his predictions?Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is an evocative tale of friendship, innocence, and the horrors of death. As the two boys journey their way through a wicked carnival, they discover the temptations of life, the secret desires of people around the world that we do not leave behind with childhood, and the ever continuing battle of good against evil. There's no one who writes quite like Bradbury. It's a rare gift to possess the voice of childhood with all of its fears, joys, and sorrows, but it's an even greater gift to evoke a nostalgia for a childhood I never had. But Bradbury pulls from the reader's emotions something universal in all of us: desires of curiosity and friendship, fears of loss.The boys grapple with their friendship and the ultimate (and literal in this sense) threat of doom: growing apart. But in searching individually, the two find the strength neither has without the other. Bonds are solidified friend to friend and father to son in this touching and horrific tale of life and the things that make our existence worth every minute: family, friendship, and laughter."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is a book where Dean Koontz 'Funhouse' creation lack - visionary imagination. Bradbury has this unique ability to capture the mind of readers and pull them in a world of dreams that become horribly wrong in a world of doubt. Have you ever seen what an apple can do to you? Have you ever cross a railroad crossing, yet you stop and wonder? I re-read this book again because it is just soo good, yet so evil. A thick plot layered in so many ways that only the wicked be damned. Nightshade and Halloway wants to find out...will you join them?A highly recommended masterpiece of a read.....just forget the movie."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Best friends Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade were born 2 minutes apart, Will one minute before midnight on Oct 30 and Jim one minute after midnight on Oct 31, and their different personalities reflect that well. And each is tested in different ways when Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to Green Town, IL shortly before their 14th birthday. Characters from the carnival compliment the overall creepy atmostphere, from the Dust Witch to the Illustrated Man, Mr. Dark himself.Bradbury's unique writing style perfectly sets the tone for this spooky tale of boyhood and wishes. While reading it, I was reminded of other characters from newer books, especially Mr. Leland Gaunt, the proprietor of Needful Things, from Stephen King's book. And while some passages near the end of the book are a bit long-winded, it didn't detract much from a great spooky story, and one with a lot of insight into what it's like to be 13."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"\\"Something wicked, this way comes\\". You have to respect an author that is willing to take the title of his book from the master Shakespeare. Furthermore, Bradbury manages to incorporate myriad ideas for young and old into one true feast for the senses. No matter how many times I read this, I am always struck by the poetic manner in which the story is told.This is the story of Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, and how they outwit the evil carnival and its twisted custodians. Seems like a great idea for a kid's book, yeah? And it is. However, add in thorough discussions on the nature of growing old and the character of good versus evil and what it means to be one or the other, and you have a dissertation worthy of any graduate student. All this is told in Bradbury's characteristic bouncy, playful syntax and is always a consummate pleasure to read.This is required reading for the imaginative child or the adult looking to reconnect with their youth and the wonder therein."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury uses fantasy to drive home moral truths, and no where else is that more apparent than in this classic short novel.The Cooger and Dark Pandemonium show invades a small town in fall, but only two young boys, Jim and Will, understand its true intent, to prey on local citizens by giving them their hearts' desires and then stealing their souls. But the boys, especially Jim, are as susceptible to the sinister charms of the carnival as anyone else.This is a word-drunk book, crammed with imagery, as dizzyng and delightful as a Ferris Wheel. But it's a cautionary tale too. Bradbury seems to be telling readers that man must accept the nature of things, for if he fools with nature he risks losing his own soul forever.I have taught this book to college students on two different occasions. They love it for its fantasy and horror and sense of wonder.

It was through this book that I came to appreciate his unique, often imitated but never reproduced, style, and made me move to the October Country, where I lived for some time. Bradbury is the master and creator of the Dark Carnival, and the concept was never better than in this book. But, like so many of Bradbury's works, this book has a deeper meaning. It is about a boy's yearning to grow up and an old man's yearning to be young again.

Something Wicked is without question the finest piece of contemporary american literature to ever be written.Starting as a child's tale or fable, the book expands into a mult-layered, multi-complex novel involving death, life and all parts in between. The dynamic tension of freindship, lost loves and pubertyare all dealt with in this amazing piece of work. The premise, a &quot;dark&quot; carnival ariving in a small mid-western town in October is common Bradbury territiry. And there is no doubt of the autobigraphicalnature of this work. As the story weaves itself through the town's population, the two boys at the center of the story, are the only ones that sense the approaching darkness that the carnival brings.In classic Bradbury prose, the reader is trasported with eloquent descriptions into the story itself. One of the two climaxes of the story, a confrontation between one of the boy's fathers (an aging manwith buckets of regrets and no real hope for the future) and Mr. Dark, the owner of the Carnival is rollercoaster ride of words. In a time where action has displaced writing in novels, this scene is adelight to anyone who enjoys good literature.The film adaptation was atrocious, and looked (as Dinsey films do) only at a single element in a multi-faceted story. This film should not be used to judge this book. So don't be put off because of the film.If you read ANY book this year, make it this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Any fan of Halloween will fall in love with RayBradbury's dark novel about two boys and an evilcarnival that comes to town...

But it is brilliantly written, with some of the most deliciously macabre imagery ever put in a novel about children.The only thing that detracts from its brilliance is the weakness of the good ultimately used to prevail against the powerful minions of evil. Bradbury's worldview doesn't allow for anything more powerfully good than humor in the face of horror. Unfortunate. It would have been nice to see the boys use virtue or faith or hope to triumph.But, by all means, read this book! You will be thrilled, horrified and firm in your resolution to never be in a library after closing time!!!!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something wicked this way comes the movie is a mind puzzeling and an abnormal movie, because of the characters and the events that catch your eyes and mind.This story of two boys who encounter the sinister wonders of Cooger and Mr.Dark's pandemonium shadow show.

Also I think that it was kind of odd how Mr. Dark used the diguise of being the lightning rod salesman, and how Jim and Will found out all the secrets of the mirors and the mazes and the fariswheel. All that Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger were trying to do were to take the peoples souls and trade them for what they (the people) wished for the most as in their sins. To all that haven't read this book should really read it because it will make you interested in it more and more...page after page. This book is one of the best ever written and it will make you more interested in it because of all what happens it makes you wander whats going to happen to Jim and Will next, so it keeps you gessing, and it makes you wander if Will and Jim will make it out alive or dead!! Who know till you read it, so go out and read it for my sake and for yours."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I will get directly to the point, which is something the author found difficult to do in this book.This is one of the most disjointed, incomprehensible novels I have ever tried to read. I think this book is the most clear case of an author's vanity that I have ever seen. Do you ever get the feeling (when you're reading a novel) that the author is so very proud of the colorful language he has just scattered across the page that he can scarcely help himself from trying to top his last success at articulation? That is the way this book reads, like a perfect example of an author's vanity getting away from him.I grew up with this movie (and loved it!). This is one instance where I can honestly say that the movie was way better than the book. The book took too long to get anywhere, tried to introduce motives for characters' actions that never seemed to make any sense (to any normal person anyway), and was generally boring.So, whatever you do, stay clear of this book. Jump, skip, skidattle-crack your way on down the road to another book (yes this is my attempt to imitate Bradbury's annoying descriptive style in this book). You will not find anything that you liked about Farenheit 451 (another book by this author) in here."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Haven't read it yet, but I am looking forward to it.

I would have liked to know more about the Illustrated Man, aka Mr. Dark, who was the most fascinating character in the novel. Also, I don't know if I liked Mr. Bradbury's style of writing for this novel - there were sections where I couldn't follow the imagery and wasn't connecting to what he was talking about. Otherwise, a very enjoyable, fast paced, thriller/horror story from Mr. Bradbury."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Long recognized as the master of the short story and science fiction, Ray Bradbury is most at home in the October country, the land where beauty and terror walk side by side. He ushers us into this land in his novel,\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", and almost poetic rendering of two boys coming of age and a man dealing with his own mortality.It is October, the season between warm summer and the chill of winter, and a carnival is coming to town, blown in by the same winds that make two young boys wake in the morning hours and gaze out their windows, full of unspoken longings. A handbill flies across the street promising a thousand and one wonders on its way to the quiet country town and a library's janitor feels the stirring of the boy he was fifty four years ago as the sound of a calliope comes closer.Too late in the year for a carnival,\\"Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show\\" arrives with something for everyone, the sweetness of cotton candy and the fascination of the freak shows, mirror mazes and merry go rounds and, master of it all is the Illustrated Man, who just might have your picture tattooed in the pal of his hand.Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are fascinated by the secrets the carnival hides and are drawn steadily deeper into it's dark secrets and fantastic promises, but the line between the wonderful and the terrible is a thin one and it is up to Will's father to make sense of the wonders the carnival has really brought and to try to save the two boys from its' lies.Although I am not a fan of the horror genre and did not believe I would like this book, I soon became fascinated with this novel and it's beautiful imagery. I often found myself re-reading Ray Bradbury's expertly crafted phrases which propel the reader from this world to Bradbury's own like the magic he loves to write about. He touches on our past experiences of sound and taste, memory and desires, hopes and fears and wraps them into a fantastic story that appeals to all ages. This is more than a \\"horror\\" novel.,it is a life-affirming story of foolishness and bravery, wisdom and the miracles of love between a father and son, and between two friends. Though \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" has been made into a movie, there is no substiture of Ray Bradbury's genius for description and his mastery of the English language. He reminds us of the children we were and reassures us of the future when he writes. This book will leave you smiling and looking at the world with eyes more attuned to the wonders around us.Oddly enough, this book has been dedicated to actor/dancer Gene Kelly whose artistry, says Bradbury, \\"changed my life\\". This book and its sweet message will also touch lives and leave them changed. I highly recommend the experience."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The best book ever. Granted, that's only an opinion, yet I would not just say that about any book. What I enjoy so much about this book is great portrayal of the common battle of good vs. evil. That's an old story, but this book is that storyline in its purest form. Additionally, the imagery is amazing. True, it can seem purple at times, but I still enjoyed it immensely. It really keeps everything interesting.

Maybe I just don't like carnies..."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Do not waste your time listening to this radio production/audio version of this book. Although this \\"radio production\\" was apparently done with Bradbury's own blessings and collaboration, it is terrible. The \\"acting\\" is sub-par and often sounds too much like somebody strictly reading their script, without any emotion or connection to the other parties in the scene. I have not read the book, and this was my first exposure to Bradbury. I knew nothing about the plot, and figured since Bradbury has been hailed as a \\"must-read\\", this would be good, but I was sadly disappointed. Perhaps it is because this is a radio production, however there seems to be far too much missing from the plot and at times it is difficult to fill in the many blanks that are left for the listener to try imagine what is happening. Too many times there is just creepy calipoe music, where, I suppose, they figured the listener would know something awful was happening, but it is never described. The plot jumps around too much without explanation- changing scenes, locations, characters, etc without much sense. The characters are shallow and there is no connection from the listener to them at all. Overall just a terrible production! As I was listening I couldnt wait for it to be over, and I kept hoping that something marvelous would come along to justify the reason that Bradbury is considered a classic- but that just never happened. No suspense, no emotion, no acting, no plot development, no resolution (what happened to the teacher? the mother? the carnival?) I can't put in to words how disappointed I was with this production. Again, do not waste your time with it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I can't tell you how much this book has influenced my imagination.

It is more along the lines of Somewhere A Band Is Playing... not exactly mediocre, but not exactly executed properly.

Item delivery date was on time if not earlier.

Unfortunately, I had already seen the film so I had a plot in mind as well as a mood. Bradbury as always strings metaphores together like we do popcorn on the Christmas tree. It's his main setup for atmosphere and that is the books great strength. Unfortunately for me, the characters of Will, Jim and Will's Dad are flat, underdeveloped and dull. Without a back story, I really don't have a sense of caring for the characters and as hard as I tried that didn't change. This was typical of Dickens at times. He created characters and then threw them into the story for development. I never found this technique particularly inviting for me.The story is simple enough -- a carnival comes to town creating strange and bizarre situations that invite temptation. Jim wants to be older -- but we aren't given a good enough reason why. Will's Dad wants to be younger and the idea feels more universal than centered on the character in question and it falls short. The carnival can do this of course but at a price. That alone feels as rundown an idea as I've ever read. Everyone has that statement. The ending feels more of a fable than anything else and perhaps that's what Ray wanted out of the story. Perhaps he would have put 'once upon a time' and 'happily ever after' were it a different time.The message -- don't fall into temptation and don't let misery eat away your soul. I don't know, the book has great mood and atmosphere but had the same feel for me as 'Tale of Two Cities' -- I couldn't want to finish it and move on to something else."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Another Bradbury masterpiece, this multifaceted jewel shines - even from within it's dark story. The tale of horror is a subtle one, the gothic imagry will remain with the reader, this book slowly work its magic, it has as many layer as it does pages - the loss of innocence, the evil of technology, mysticism, and many others. Truly a thought provoking novel, and a grand old tale of horror in a small American town"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"No, that's not the title of a new self-help book, it's the title of my review of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", a story that captures the awesome freedoms and fears of youth, as well as the potent yearnings of age.I read this as a student and enjoyed it, and recently read it again after entering my mid 30s. I am now at a point between the two extremes that Bradbury dissects in this timeless (pun) merry-go-round (pun) of an a-fair (pun). OK, three puns in a row deserves a bad rating for this review, but what else can I do? The book is a classic, and will live as long as men and women look forward or backwards through their lives and reflect on what could be.I could chirp about how Bradbury has such eloquence and how he can construct a phrase with more spirit and humanity than should be possible, but if you want all that just read the jacket cover - greater readers and writers than I have said it all before.All I can do is verify that the story still holds true, and still stirs both boyish and manly emotions, even as I begin to see the shape of middle age forming in the mist of my future."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes(1962).Ray Bradbury, author of such renound classics as The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451, took a stab at the horror genre in 1962. Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!Plot-During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...Writing-Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way Comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down.Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me.Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as many authors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

A book like this, I will give 3 stars because its somewhere in the middle, which is where I kept finding myself as I read. Lets start with the good, because then, if you choose, you can stop reading after that. The plot is great, the theme is really fun, the pacing is nice, and the ending is exciting. Of the main characters I loved the Dad (who I consider the main protagonist and The Tattooed Man, who is the antagonist). In fact, if you want to read a truely great piece of writing, read chapters 39-41. The dad gives a great monologue about good vs. evil and has a really good match up against the forces of evil in this book. I reread these chapters over and over and couldn't get enough of it.Now, the bad, unfortunately, the great characters stop at the two main ones, and all the supporting characters are all just fluffy paper cut outs with little or no impact on the story, and the WORST characters are the two boys Jim and Will, and unfortunately, you will be stuck with them throughout the story. They have terrible dialogue, stupid sayings, and they don't act, talk, or do anything kid-like in the book. In fact, I would say, that these two characters are among the worst written characters ever in a book I have read. The other big con in this book is Bradbury's style of description. Bradbury is just one of those writers that you either love or hate, because his style is so peculiar, you either embrace it, or you just can't stomach it. I am in the latter circle, and have a hard time making it through his books.All in all, I think whether you like this novel or not, you will find yourself doing a fair amount of skimming, and for a book that is barely 300 pages long, that's not a good sign."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes is chilling, intense tale of two teenaged friends, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, and a mysterious carnival. They are the only two people in the town, initially, that can see that something is not right with Mr. Dark and the sideshow freaks.Bradbury gives such life to his main characters, Jim and Will and Will's Dad. It is with horror and total understanding that the reader watches as Jim is nearly seduced by the carnival's promises. As an older reader, it was easy to feel the sadness and sense of loss being experienced by Mr. Halloway. Will, so likable, so naive, is the least believable only because he is so true in his goodness; and yet, I truly couldn't find fault with Will's character as such because his emotions were portrayed so well. Emotions were captured with wonderful clarity in this book, and are it's strongest feature.The language used by Bradbury in this book borders on poetry. I was continually struck by the beauty of a phrase, by an unusually accurate description or by a passage that simply begged to be read aloud. I was amazed at how beautifully he used the words, and how the words themselves added to the surreal feel of the story.As a story, this was a tense, spine chilling fairy tale, or urban fantasy (if I can use that term to describe a country story). I found I needed breaks after a few chapters, so suspenseful was the experience for me. It's not necessarily horrifying or frightening, but the level of anxiety that the characters were undergoing expressed itself to me as reader. The evil was sometimes over the top evil, again in a fairy tale way, and the actions and reactions didn't necessarily make sense, but one doesn't look for normal everyday reactions in such a surreal dark fantasy. The message of good triumphing over evil, while not particularly heavy handed, is rather painfully obvious, which was off-putting at times.I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending, with the particular way that good triumphed evil. It just didn't fit the build up and felt a bit forced, as if Mr. Bradbury didn't have the ended planned out and had to come up with one in a hurry. While still surreal, and still requiring serious decisions by the characters, it fell too neatly into place and at the same time left several unresolved issues.Despite any complaints I have, it is certainly a good read, and I can see it's influence on many other authors I read, but it's not as strong of a book as is, say Fahrenheit 451"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I had only read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and I wasn't sold on the genius of Ray Bradbury. It is hailed as a literary classic and there is merit to this, but quite a few literary classics don't really hold up as a pleasurable read...but then folks have different tastes and perspectives. Then I came across Something Wicked This Way Comes, and honestly it was half title and have Bradbury that made me pick it up. I love the title of the book, and the back of the mass market paperback has to be one of the single best book descriptions to hook a reader. The book jacket read like a carnival barker trying to convince you of the wonders you will find inside the tent, or within these pages. A carnival is exactly what has come to Green Town, Illinois. Two eleven year old boys, Will and Jim, were born minutes apart. Will was born a minute before midnight on October 30, Jim a minute after, October 31. Light and Dark. They are best friends and in the middle of the night, two weeks before Halloween, they hear a train whistle blow and music in the air. They sneak out of their homes and discover a carnival being set up, except there is something dark and dangerous about this carnival coming in at three in the morning. By daylight things look better, friendlier, but there is a darkness and a creepiness hiding behind every tree and every carnival ride. Something is wrong. How wrong? I couldn't say without spoiling the surprise, but while there is the sense of the innocent to this book there is something truly wicked on the horizon.Had I read Something Wicked This Way Comes when I was around the age of the boys, or even a few years older, I would have absolutely loved this book. It has that creepy vibe that works better when you are young and reading a scary story alone in a mostly dark room. I have no doubt about this. When I have children and if they want to read a creepy book when they are a little older, I'll recommend this one. It is not at all filled with gore or excessive violence, but the imagery and what is occuring is the stuff of bad dreams. Ray Bradbury is very effective in telling this story, building tension, and capturing the tone and perhaps essence of young boys. This novel seems geared more to a younger (early teens, maybe pre-teen), but it is written with skill and craft, it isn't a low budget campy movie, it's a quality prestige piece that is accessible to a range of audiences.Still, I had difficulty being truly engaged all the way through. It's a great campfire story, but reading it in the daylight and fifteen years later than I should have, Something Wicked This Way Comes just didn't completely click with me. I can admire Bradbury's craft and imagination here, but I didn't love it like I would have fifteen years ago. It's a very well written book for a younger reader, though readers of all ages can certainly still enjoy. I certainly did.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I admit i thought this book seemed strange and somewhat corny from first reading the synopsis. But after begining to read i was imediately swept into Bradbury's vision. I could clearly see every detail and believe in the fantastic events. This book also provides a wonderful discourse on good and evil and the nature of each. As all good literature should it does not provide answers but asks deep questions."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This book was suggested for me to read by a friend of mine. She knew the wicked books that I have read very recently. At first, I did not want to read it, but after I read the cover of the book I was hooked. The opening pages were very interesting, I was going into the book not knowing what to expect and I was very shocked. The scene I most thoroughly enjoyed was the carousel. Most people would think that it is a very wicked part but I really enjoyed it. Most of the book was very disturbing and that they did not know what they had gotten themselves into. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"A mildly paced, philosophical novel by author Ray Bradbury (author of \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"). Bringing out his very wordy and verbose style of writing, Bradbury tells a tale of dream-like, or even better, nightmare-like proportions. Jim and Will, a week under fourteen, are searching for some excitement in their quaint town in Illinois, but what they get is the place they call home suddenly turned upside down. Late one night, the boys discover a night-train coming down the shore. It's carrying what will shortly become a carnival of mystery. The boys can hardly believe their eyes. The carnival filled with sideshows and ghastly dark tents, harbors a cast of evil-natured freaks that have a certain humane charm, winning the hearts of the town folk. Inside the carnival, they find an insane, powerful, mirror maze that casts a spell on the boys' teacher, who later falls victim to the magically twisted carousel with powers to add or extract years from it's riders. The boys find this out, and are soon on the freaks hit list. Nothing is what it seems, friends are being disguised by new ages, and nobody knows who these freaks are or where they came from. But one thing is clear. Jim and Will are next, if they don't find out how to stop them."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I had to write to say do NOT listen to the many reviews of this book describing it as empty, dated, lacking creativity, etc. If you're familiar with Bradbury at all, this book will live up to your expectations of his typical high quality of writing. If you are not familiar with Bradbury, I'd personally say start with something closer to F451, Martian Chronicles, or some short stories to get a feel for Bradbury, but regardless of when you read this book, you'll be impressed. Bradbury creates suspense throughout the book, in fact, the only reason I read this book so quickly was because I simply could not put it down! There's no way to describe the magic bradbury creates, please, do yourself a favor and read this and every other Bradbury story you can get your hands on!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This book was an interoggative inquisition of the brain. Everytime you thought something, Bradbury made it into the last think your mind would allow you to think. My brain twisted and turned. Honestly I had to read a lot of it over to fully understand the signifigance of what he was saying."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Or should we scratch out that &quot;horror&quot;? &quot;Something wicked&quot; is, by all means, Bradbury's best. It has an authentic way of describing the feelings of children, and the horror lies in that surreal point of view. A glamorous and terrorizing carnival arrives in town and steals the lives of people, with its secrets visible only to the unfettered eye of children. In my opinion, S.King was inspired much by this book when writing his masterpiece &quot;It&quot;. Recommended for everybody, double recommended for people who are looking for serious horror, albeit in a fairy-tale clothing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury is more than just a sci-fiction writer. In Something Wicked this Way Comes, Bradbury uses vivid metaphors, and details to illustrate the story of two young boys coming to age. The underlying theme of this book is the battle between the good and evil on earth, and also the battle inside of all of us. This is a must read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I read the book for a school project. One night while reading it I read over 100 pages in one sitting just because of the suspense at the end of each chapter. Great read, buy it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Ray Bradbury is an intriguing and insightful author. In this novel, which revolves around the life of two young boys that are attached at the hip, the fantastical plotline is only a small portion of what the book has to offer. The novel opens and the reader is introduced to the two young boys, each with very different backgrounds. One resents his lack of a father, and the other resents the advanced age of his father. One wants to forever cling to his boyhood, and the other can't wait to turn around and spit on his youth. When a dark and strange carnival comes to town, it seems that it holds solutions for everyone within its billowing tents. The one boy can grow older, and the other boy can make his father younger. Through the progression of the novel, many characters are lost to the somber carnival, and many of its previous members are introduced. If the reader can only cling on through the intense twists and turns this novel takes, he will be rewarded greatly at the end. Insight into human nature, and the true colors of good, found in the age-bent body of the father, and evil, found in many of the carnival members (essentially the owner, Mr. Black), will all be received by the faithful reader. The two boys triumph over the evil strangers, and they escape with scars gained only from their loss of innocence. In essence, it's the not quite average story of two boys reaching the brink of manhood."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This was a great book, no questions asked! I dislike some of Bradbury's book, like &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, but this was a great book. I liked the way it kept you reading, making it hard to put the book down. At the end of every chapter, there was that constant overhanging feeling of suspense,forcing you to dive even further into this ocean of a book. The characterization was great, and the way Bradbury would switch from one scene to another to keep you updated was wonderful. The characters from the book acted like your worst nightmares would actually act, making the book seem all the more real. Even the beginning was exciting, unlike most books. This horror book skips the hassle of blood and guts, and just gets right down to the real thing: an evil group of people only you realize aren't what they appear to be. Not just another horror story with cardboard people and a stupid monster, this book really lets you get INTO the people in the book. It can get confusing at some points, but that's part of the fun. I recommend this book to sci-fi and fantasy lovers. &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; just goes to show, looks can be deceiving."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a novel about mankind's struggle with temptation. The three main character's Will, Jim and Charles (Will's father) live a relatively simple life before an evil carnival comes to their town. Once it rises up in the middle of the night, people in the town start to disappear and everything goes horribly wrong. The carnival offers what every person could ever dream of but the price is too horrible to bear. The boys have to struggle with their friendship while combating the evil that has manifested in their town. Charles also has to confront the greatest challenge he has ever faced and live up to being Will's father. Bradbury goes outside the narrow-minded sphere of reality, challenging our beliefs, and forcing us to confront our deepest desires and fears. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I have to admit that I just don't get it. I'm baffled as to why Ray Bradbury is considered such a genius. This book, considered one of his best, really doesn't stand out to me as anything all that special. The plot is cute, at best. It's not terribly creative; in fact, it's quite formulaic and often predictable. The characters are interesting, but not in any profound sort of way. And the writing is choppy and unrefined. I might give this book to an 11-year-old looking for a quick, easy read. But I have to believe that the past forty years have produced better material in the way of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I have read several Ray Bradbury works, I have yet to find one I like but other people rave over them and movies have been made of some of them. \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is, to me, one of his worst. The story is simple, a carnival comes to town, two boys, fast friends, visit it and discover the carousel has the ability to either age people or subtract years. The carnival owners find out the boys have this knowledge and plan to get rid of the boys. One of the boy's father comes to their aid and in doing so grows in stature in their eyes and the boys and the man rediscover themselves.In my hardcover copy it takes Bradbury 289 pages to tell this simple tale and he seems to have searched the dictionary for words that he doesn't know how to use, he groups them in awkward fashion, makes nouns into verbs, adjectives become neologisms, juxtaposes words together but making no sense thus used, repeats phrases for some reason which I am unable to detect and I think tries to make himself look greater than he is by this use of words, instead he disrupts thought, not helping the story and, frankly, making a fool of himself by his word usage. Vladimir Nabokov was a Russian who also looked to use uncommon English words in his writing, he seldom missed but his stretches could be excused since English was a second language to him. What was Bradbury's excuse?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I'm an avid reader, and I am usually able to comprehend what I'm reading.

It seems to the majority of us that one would have to be on acid to understand what's going on, this may be because it's the end of the school year and we're seniors, but I think it's mainly due to the over-descriptive nature of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This book used a mammoth amount of undecipherable metaphors and similies, confusing and unnecssecary description.

But perhaps he WANTED us to read it slowly, the crafty fellow! The plot was interesting, and the ending clipped along at a brisk enough pace to salvage things for me."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"For me to enjoy a book I have to be able to relate, on some level, to the characters and it was difficult for me to do that. It's not gender; I've read many books with male protagonists and still found them very enjoyable, but I just couldn't empathize with either of the boys' plights or thoughts or emotions. Both boys were just so unoriginal and trite.More unforgivable than the fact that the two young boys were rather boring and cookie-cutter, is the fact that this book did not cause me to jump, feel shivers up my spine or feel my heart beat speed up in dread at all. I felt cheated of a scare. I was promised that this was a classic horror story and that I would never forget it, but unfortunately, the reason I will never forget it is because it was such a boring read.I don't understand it - carnivals can be one of the creepiest settings for a story, yet Bradbury allows this choice backdrop to go to waste! He focuses on the carousel, which is great because that can be a pretty scary ride, what with all the bizarre colors and expressions on the animals' faces, but the reason the carousel was scary in this book just did not do it for me. When I read it, my initial reaction was \\"That's it? THAT'S the 'big' baddie?\\" I don't need my horrors to actually be physically manifested in some demonic thing or thrown into my face with no subtlety, but I do need it to actually BE scary and that was just not the case here.There were numerous times when I had to go back and re-read passages that were convoluted just for the sake of being convoluted, that I nearly tossed the book aside in impatience. Some authors write \\"complicated\\" novels well - consider Faulkner's Light In August for example - but Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes does not fall under that category.Doggedly I persisted and I finished this stupid thing and I wasted my time.Despite how much people seem to laud it (and that's fine - everyone's entitled to his/her opinion) I did not enjoy this book at all, would NOT recommend it if you are looking for a good read and would advise that you turn to Bradbury's short-story collections instead. I think that Bradbury is MUCH better at writing short stories than he is at writing novels like this one."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I know that Something Wicked This Way Comes is a classic that many readers love, but I found the novel rather disappointing and can in all honesty only reward it with three stars. For me, the writing was just too disjointed at times, full of little pot holes I kept catching my foot in. The real world of this dark fantasy, the town before the dark carnival rolled in under the cover of night, never seemed real to me, and the friendship of the two boys, Will and Jim, never made perfect sense. We are told they are so much alike, born two minutes apart, but they seem mirror opposites to me. One aspect of Jim in particular is mentioned rather prominently yet never explored or even mentioned again, a fact I found disheartening. Then there is Will's father, an older man stumbling quietly through just a few pages of the first half of the novel before becoming magically transformed into an eloquent speaker and incredibly able enemy of dark forces. Certainly, there are aspects of the story I accepted and enjoyed, such as the issue of time and the ways in which boys want to be older and aging men and women long for a return to youth; it was exactly these most innermost desires that fed the strange carnival operators Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger. The idea of the carnival freaks being the remnants of the carnival's former victims is also good. The machinery of the story, though, just never worked for me. The mirror magic of the maze was not developed enough to be convincing, and the inner mysteries of the darkly magical carousel never seemed anything more than foolish to me. Since the evils of the carnival were never convincing to me, the manner in which its harmful effects are fought seemed almost ridiculous. My entire reading of this novel was something of a struggle, one which offered me only a few moments of satisfaction. Knowing that this is Ray Bradbury, I tried very hard to like Something Wicked This Way Comes, but for whatever reason Bradbury's magic just never had any discernible effect on me."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"A carnival comes to a small town.

Bradbury seems to like showing off how smart he is and renders most of the descriptions of places and things in flowery, overdone language. More often then not I had to reread a sentence multiple times before I understood it! This is a perfect description of the word \\"pretentious\\". The sad thing is this has all the elements of a good horror story. The description of Mr. Dark's carnival works (when you can understand it) and the Dust Witch \\"marking\\" the two kids houses is downright horrific.

Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, but I don't have much fondness for his nostalgia literature--like Something Wicked This Way Comes, or Dandelion Wine. My memories aren't made up of those landscapes or experiences, and so there's no personal fondness. I also begrudge that branch of his work its stylistic redundancy. Bradbury's science fiction has incredible atmosphere, but it's driven by a demanding premise and/or constrained to short form, and so there's less opportunity for the prose to run away with itself--instead, his emotional focus and quietude are atmospheric blessings. Something Wicked has fantastic elements, but they're powered by nostalgia--and so while it offers up some beautiful turns of phrase, those are lost within a mountain road of prose. I've read the book before, some years back, and find I remember some parts well: there's aspects of the book that I love, and Bradbury creates a veritable carnival of horrors which delight me; I see how they could make for a successful book. Bradbury portrays an intensely idealized but vibrant representation of youth and youth's confrontation with age (and with life)--and his themes, despite their lack of personal appeal, are carried through with conviction. But no matter my best intentions and my love of the author, Something Wicked isn't the book for me. I appreciate and can recommend it for what it tries to be, but I don't enjoy it."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes, not bad for a horror novel. im usually not into horror, but all in all it wasnt bad. the storyline was pretty original, and the writing itself was not bradbury's best, but still decent.

It's a sign of a talented writer if he or she is able to make the reader feel nostalgic for a childhood that one didn't have. SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES pushes all the right buttons in reminding us of the wonder that was present in everyone.A lot has been said about the prose of this book, and it's certainly of a higher quality than one would be expecting from a \\"horror\\" story. It's quite poetic and most of the time it is excellent at painting the scene. However, there are a number of places where it feels forced and pretentious, as if Bradbury is writing that way just to show off his thesaurus-reading skills. But for every turn of phrase that falls flat, there exist several chilling moments that will be forever etched in the mind of the reader. It's a step above the sort of material that one usually finds in genre works.The point of view from the two children is executed amazingly well. As in his other novels and short stories, Bradbury demonstrates his superb ability to realistically portray the beliefs and emotions of children. They aren't overly mature, but neither are they childish. He's hit the nail so perfectly that it really feels as though one is reading a true-life account of some curious boys, rather than a fictional account. On the other hand, breaking up the action between two children means that we never really get extremely close to either one. There's some nice interaction between one of the boys and his father that deals with the grown-up's attempt to develop a backbone and to stand up to the evil carnival people. This relationship creates some great dialog between the child and parent, as the older man tries to explain thoughts and concepts that are just slightly outside what the child can realistically understand.The story itself is quite chilling and is told well. Many of the actions that occur don't really make much logical sense, but they are nonsensical in the same way that fairy tales don't make sense; everything works inside the current context and that's just fine for their purposes. Evil men do evil deeds simply because they're evil. Good men attempt to prevent the spread of evil, because that's what good men do. Their motivation really isn't important. What makes it work is the journey that the characters go through.SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is certainly a recommended work. Although often classified as a horror book, it really isn't all that frightening. But it succeeds at being a fantastic adventure tale that will remain with the reader long after the final page is turned."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Bradbury at his greatest is truly a great read. Any avid reader can remember the first time they read Farenheight 451. The thoughts and issues contained in that novel were truly amazing, causing one to pay attention to the glory our society can create and destroy. Something Wicked This Way Comes is as wonderful.The novel is ultimatly about a battle between good and evil, or truth verses deception. The main character is confronted with secrets he doesn't want to know and given the chance to live out long hidden dreams. The book plays out well, leaving the reader wondering until the last pages.Most important is Bradbury's ability to describe the elements in the novel. One could taste breath, feel the wind, and smell the carnival. Something Wicked This Way Comes is a wonderful book and should be enjoyed by readers of science fiction and other genres alike."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"\\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\" This quote from Shakespeare adequately describes this now-classic work of horror by Ray Bradbury. Bradbury manages to use evocative language and charming characters to draw the readers into what is almost a parallel world.Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade are boys born two seconds apart -- one on Halloween, the other on the day before. Will is the ultimate innocent, while Jim is darker and more knowledgeable about the world. These two have been inseparable friends all their lives, despite their different personalities and tiny events that divide them on subtle levels. Then, one day, a strange carnival comes to their town, with a freak show and a carousel.But a more sinister undercurrent runs in this carnival: The freak show, with its tattooed \\"illustrated man,\\" blind gypsy witch, and murderous dwarf, is more menacing than the townspeople expect. And when Will and Jim see the carousel change a man's age, they become the targets of Mr. Dark and his evil cohorts -- for fates worse than death.Bradbury's writing is a mixed bag. While it's extremely evocative and often surreal, it becomes a little clumsy at times. He refers to the carousel horses having \\"panic-colored teeth,\\" but never explains what this description means. His metaphors occasionally become very strained, and at times the lapses into philosophical musings become distractions to the overall plotline.However, he expertly draws out a feeling of horror with only a few words, never overdoing the descriptions of something that terrifies Jim and Will. Rather than using \\"ghoulies and ghosties,\\" Bradbury plays on fears in every human being, such as fears of aging, loneliness, physical decrepitude, loss of loved ones, and most horrifyingly when people are aged or de-aged and thus unrecognizable to their friends and loved ones. The buildup of suspense as the boys hide from Dark and his lackeys is utterly terrifying. And in a masterful use of nostalgia, Bradbury brings readers to the midwestern America of his youth, an innocent place of screen doors, fall leaves and barber shops.Jim and Will are good foils for one another. Too often in books with two lead characters of the same age and background, there is no personality difference, but these boys are radically different. Will is an utter innocent, with no comprehension of the seductiveness of evil and a great deal of fear for his family and his best friend. Jim, on the other hand, is more susceptible to Mr. Dark's offers. He wants to age to the level of a young adult with the carousel, while knowing in his heart that nothing good can come of it; his temptation is frightening in its intensity. The temptation is reversed for the quiet Charles Holloway, who is haunted by his own age and the relative youth of his son. His gradual changes of thought on this matter are never clumsy or sappy, but rather with the brilliance of Charles' new perceptions.\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is one of the rare stories that blends unusual prose, good characterizations, and skilful atmosphere into a true spinechiller. A great horror classic. Do not read after dark."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The book is great, and the Kindle price is very low ($1.99 as I write this). However, the Kindle file is riddled with errors: typos, bad returns, sentences run together, no table of contents. There's nothing like reading a great book and having the experience marred by a terrible translation to a new medium. I would have happily paid more for a decent, readable version of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I have read Something Wicked This Way Comes at least 5 times and every time I am amazed at the writing skill of Ray Bradbury in this novel. Each paragraph reads like poetry. I not only see, but I smell and feel the story.The book evokes the desires of all of us to be younger, older, prettier, or more famous. But there is always a cost for these atributes and there is even a cost to recover them from your past. We all know a Jim Nightshade (the darker side of each of us) and a Will Halloway (the brighter side of us). In this coming of age novel, the two best friends are only one day apart in age, but quite different in what they will do to attain their aspirations. They are anxious to be \\"older\\" and when a carnival comes into town during an electrical storm, they find the means to their desires. The question is whether the cost is worth it.This book is not for those that get high off of action, but for those that love to indulge in feeling goosebumps, smelling decay and hearing creaks. Just one example of Bradbury's prose from the book: \\"What's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. Caesar's lean and hungry friends. They eat in the dark, who only stand and breathe.\\"Interestingly, the movie with Jason Robards as Will's remorsefull librarian father (quoted above), still maintains the same prose and feel. I recommend both. Read the book, but remember, there is a cost for going backwards."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"No one has ever written better about the enchantment of childhood than did Ray Bradbury in Dandelion Wine. Its a book that's all about the bright possibilities of youth, when the whole world seems magical. With Something Wicked This Way Comes, he looks at the flip side, how as we get older we discover that evil exists in the world too, and not just that it exists but that it is alluring, to us and all those around us.It's 1929, in Green Town, Illinois, and Jim Nightshade and William Halloway are thirteen, right on the traditional cusp of manhood. They are still boys when the dark carnival, Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, comes to town, but by the time it leaves they'll have grown up, for Mr. Dark, ringleader of the carnival, offers people their deepest darkest desires in exchange for their souls. Many of the townfolk, including Will's own father will be seduced by the offer of a return to youth, while Jim will find the offer of growing up fast irresistible. But Will can see what's going on and first saves his father and then the two of them fight to save Jim and the town. This book is thrilling, scary, and, most important, wise in the ways of man. Bradbury well understands that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so attractive. The people of Green Town aren't necessarily bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, they head down the path of evil. What Mr. Dark is offering is unnatural in the strictest sense of the word, it violates the laws of nature, and Will's struggle against him is truly heroic, maybe even Biblical. You'll not often hear him listed among the great American authors, but with this book, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 to his credit, Ray Bradbury may deserve at least a mention.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Two boys, a small town and an evil carnival. Sounds campy, but it's actually a good story, problem is, this is not a good book. Bradbury can invoke your childhood wonder of life and the brashness of youth and in that way it's a very good book. You can feel the fear of the boys of Mr. Dark, but you also feel thier wonder of him and his show, makes you really feel for the characters. The problem with this book is the semi-philosophical ranting, it was just irating to read, and he keeps doing it all though the novel. I can take it if it happens once or twice, but the thing is just littered with it. It breaks the momentum of the book, something happens, something else is about to, but first you have to push though three pages of these conjectures. That's the other problem with this book, the building of suspense is just that he talks about something else for awhile. Something is about to happen, and then he'll flash to a childhood memory, or moralize about society, or whatever...arghhhhh. I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"When I heard that my book club had chosen this book for our October reading with the idea of reading a creepy, Halloween-esc story, I was thrilled. I later found out that Something Wicked This Way Comes is often considered a genre book for horror. Even better. On top of all that, Ray Bradbury is a well-known author whose works are held in high regard. I was eager to dive into the book and went in with high expectations.I was severely disappointed.The overall idea of the book is really quite intriguing. A creepy carnival that feeds off of its customer's inner fears and insecurities mysteriously rolls into town before Halloween. Two boys know something's not right and set out to foil the evil that has invaded their small town. There's a lot of potential for an amazing story.However, the writing really ruined it.The style and overall writing struck me as overly poetic, clunky, and self-indulgent. Creating a captivating, bone-chilling setting is an essential for making a good horror. However, metaphors heaped on top of analogies do not a good setting description make. There was often so much description going on that I lost track of what exactly was going on plot-wise. It always seemed like there was more happening that there actually was. There were also a lot of sentences that contained prose like \\"He saw. He didn't see. He thought. He didn't think. He heard. He didn't hear.\\" At first, such prose was interesting and new. But it got really old, really fast. I respect Ray Bradbury as an author and I respect that all authors have their own, individual writing styles. However, the writing style really killed this book.The first fifty pages or so were actually quite well done. The scene settings were captivating and the way Bradbury set the characters of the two boys up was masterful. Then, the whole thing went downhill for the next 150 pages or so. The boys became really bland and hard to relate to and the writing got so clunky and confusing that it was difficult to figure out what was going on plot-wise. The last 50 pages picked back up and ended the book solidly enough with a satisfying conclusion. It was just a matter of slogging through the middle to get there.It really is a pity that the writing style ruined the book as much as it did because the idea behind it is truly intriguing and interesting. I haven't read a lot of Ray Bradbury's works, but I hope this is one of his worst and that his other works are far better."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I have to start by saying that I am an avid reader, but it usually takes me about a week to read a novel. On rare occasions, though, a book hooks me so thoroughly that I drop everything and read it constantly. This is what happened with Something Wicked... I am not one for heavy, thick, flowering language in my fiction, but I tolerate it fully with Bradbury. He never just says plain in simple terms what something is or what something is doing. He uses metaphors constantly and they work so well. Yeah, I know that's what good writing should be, but I've read lots of books that use lots of metaphors and it just doesn't work for me. I choke on it and can't see it and can't keep up with it. Bradbury does it masterfully in my opinion. As for the story, it is creepy and it is scary and it is wonderful! No, it won't freak you out or give you nightmares, but it will give you a chill if you let it. Let yourself visualize the characters and hear the calliope and you will be immersed and I bet you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Out of all of Ray Bradbury's prodigious gifts, perhaps none is greater than his ability to capture the true essence of childhood in a timeless manner. While his most prolific period is now four decades past, Bradbury's descriptions of the hopes and fears of childhood still strike a powerful chord; in particular, he is able to capture the fears of childhood from an adult's perspective, without in any way minimizing them.In \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" the reader is treated the pinnacle of Bradbury's writings on childhood. In it, he explores the most fundamental desire, and conversely, the most fundamental fear of childhood: growing older. Who among us wouldn't have leapt at the opportunity to be \\"grown up\\" at the snap of our fingers, but what about the consequences? Here, Bradbury uses the metaphor of a carnival that preys upon the fears of growing older, quite literally, in order to sustain itself.The two main characters, Will in Jim, are fourteen, and in that awkward time that is not quite adulthood but not quite childhood either. They are torn between the desire to plunge into adult life, even as they cling to the safety of childhood. In this regard they are no different from any other child, the difference is that the carnival, and it's mysterious merry-go-round make it possible for them to do something about this situation. Juxtaposing their dilemma is Will's father, who married and had Will relatively late and life, and feels his age all the more as a result of his young son.\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a clever, spooky story, perfect for Halloween time. Bradbury is a master of descriptive writing, and no one sets a mood better than he does. More than that, tough, this is a novel about coming of age, about the value of youth, but also about appreciating where you are and what you have achieved. It is heartfelt and sincere in an age where far too many novels use cynicism as a mask for a lack of ideas. For that reason alone, this is a novel that is well worth reading.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes was my first contact with Bradbury, and it was a mindblast! The powerful story of archetypes and conviction that has inspired not a few of Steven King's books, and the beautiful and colorful prose of the novel enchanted me in a way that very few authors have ever managed.The story is set in a small Midwestern town. One October, a mysterious traveling carnival arrives, filled with strange attractions and stranger performers. And as the carnival's dark promises of secret desires turn to madness and despair, the lives of two 13-year old boys change forever.The beauty of Something Wicked This Way Comes is contained in its contrasts. Will Halloway is born a minute before midnight on October 30. Blond and blue-eyed, he is careful and timid. Jim Nightshade on the other hand - born a minute after midnight on October 31 - is his exact opposite. With his chestnut hair and dark eyes, brooding and always \\"looking at his shadow\\", he is ever getting into trouble. Perhaps it is this duality that accounts for the boys' friendship. It is also another beautiful contrast that Jim's brashness is what makes him the weak one in the story, while Will's timidity hides greater strength.The monstrous performers of Mr. Dark's carnival are among the most vivid images of nightmarish dementia I've seen in any type of fantasy, not in small part due to Bradbury's amazing descriptions. The scene of the Wax Witch's flight in a balloon held by her breaths, as she touches people's dreams in search for the boys, brands itself deep into the imagination, and won't let go long after you've put the book down. And it is but one example of the powerful imagery that occurs many times throughout the book.In the end, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a story of growing up and coming of age, of overcoming the greatest obstacles - your own desires and self-doubts - and of finding strength in what makes us human, against a power that would steal your dreams and turn them to nightmares. The book has mythic resonance, despite its \\"YA\\" setup and small-town setting, and in its wake one feels maybe a little stronger, as if the reader, and not the characters, has overcome the obstacles of Mr. Dark's traveling carnival. It is a beautifully written and imagined novel, and an attestation to the genius of Ray Bradbury's writing. I can not recommend it enough!10/10[...]"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is a tale of two boys: Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, one cautious, one adventurous and both who like to play and get in trouble as all young boys do. It also tells of the relationship between Will and his father who is an old man and has always felt that he hasn't been there for his boy because of his age.A carnival comes into town, and when Bradbury terms it carnival that means it's bad, because circuses are fun whereas carnivals hold the freaks and are dark. And that is exactly what it is; the carnival arrives at the evil time of 3:00 am in the morning unannounced and mysteriously sets up camp in one night. The carnival, as expected, draws in all the residents of Green Town, Illinois with its promises of fun and a good time for all. What the local residents do not notice that is for a select few the carnival, run by Mr. Dark, offers even more than fun, it offers dreams fulfilled.Jim and Will come across this revelation as they are sneaking around like young boys do, and they happen to be the only ones in town that know this carnival is evil, and they are praying on the towns people. Obviously, as boys, no one will believe them, except Will's father who for once in his life is able to help the boy and confront the carnival and Mr. Dark.This is obviously a classic in literature, and a classic for the horror field, the way Bradbury creates such a believable fantastic setting is unbelievable. Bradbury can describe young boys better than anyone else on the planet, when reading it you feel like the boys, you can visualize everything they do because you can relate. And add the wonder that Bradbury has for Circuses he creates a unique story that is a joy to read. I love this story!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Even being familiar with Ray Bradbury, I must confess this might be the most bizarre book that I have ever read. As a tale of youth that spins frightfully out of control, Bradbury gives readers a deep look into the soul of man. But even as Bradbury's metaphoric device comes full circle, one may feel that their equilibrium is corrupted.Jim and Will are the typical childhood pairing. Jim is rougher and perhaps more streetwise, while Will is somewhat naive. In the story, Will's father gives a sense of balance as the carnival reeks havoc on the town. Though the intentions of the carnival appear innocent at first, the boys are quick to note something peculiar. At the center of the mayhem is the carousel. As Will's father keenly observes, the carnival's power preys on the greed of people as note on page 152 of the 1970 printing. And once one gets what they want, they will find something else to want. Thus, a slave to the sideshow is created.This may be the type of book that requires thought and reflection for the reader to fully appreciate. While some of the sequences may be too fantastic for some readers, the overall picture is quite intriguing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I was really excited to receive this cd of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes.

Way too bad, since I love this story."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is Bradbury's finest novel, in my opinion. All of Bradbury's fiction is lyrical in nature, but in this work his prose flows quickly and magically from the first page to the last.The book is closer to horror than sci-fi, but I regard it as simply a great novel and believe that its universal theme of good vs. evil qualify it as literary fiction of the highest order. It is a book I read every few years to remind me of what language is capable of doing and to listen to the voices of Bradbury's unique small town characters as they attempt to deal with the mystifying forces of Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Show, a traveling carnival.The one-star reviews appear to be from the usual students who were forced to read the book. Don't be deterred. If you like a scary tale that also examines love and the human heart, you can't go wrong with SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I read this book for the first time about 16 years ago, when I was 10 or 11 years old. I was so impressed by the book, which had gripped me with its enchanting prose, that I immediately re-read it. Over the next couple years, I read several other works by Ray Bradbury and I periodically tried to imitate his style for school projects. I loved the book.I just re-read it for the third time, and I was still bewitched. Ray Bradbury's writing is impressive! He is poetic, and his writing perfectly fits the spooky subject of the book. In the book, there are dark characters whose bodies are covered with tattooed illustrations or who have been squashed down to resemble dwarves, and Ray Bradbury's writing, which is full of images, metaphors, and poetry, captured these characters and provided a great accompaniment for the book's story.Rereading it, now, after many years, I understood the book in a different way. The book's repeated discussion of immortality stuck with me, and has a different significance for me now. Also, between the first reading and this third, I had learned a bit more about Ray Bradbury's life. Did you know that Bradbury claims that, at a young age, he met a circus performer called Mr. Electrico? According to Bradbury, this performer, who had electric current pumped through him in front of a crowd of people, pointed his sword at Bradbury and declared: \\"You will live forever!\\" Knowing this story had a significant, and I think positive, impact on my reading!Finally, I'm glad that so many reviewers have liked this book. That's great. At times, I wondered whether other people would like Bradbury's wild writing, which jumps around, and calls forth images, and which captures the dark magic of the performing freaks. On a few rare instances, the prose felt forced, or seemed vaguely pretentious, or felt too overdrawn . . . But, when the writing seemed like this, the sour impression would only last for a moment before the story once again swallowed me whole.I was very glad that so many readers have found Bradbury's prose appealing."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Thirty-five years after its initial release, this magical and mesmerizing story still carries a punch.

And the father of one of the boys, a meek and beaten down man, has a great decision to make. Others in the town face a temptation that could and does change each person's life.A small town story with universal truths about life and what you make of it.

I can see where some reviewers have found Bradbury's style here a bit difficult to get into, but if you go with him, he will take you on an unforgettable journey. Highly recommended to all Brabury fans.

Will and Jim, two thirteen year old boys living in a small town in Illinois, were best friends since they were born and nothing separated them, nothing yet. An evil carnival comes to town, which is strange because carnivals stop coming after Labor Day, but also because it is named Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show. Will's father Charles Holloway thinks that this carnival is bad news. When the carnival comes Will realizes that the carnival is strange, but Jim is mesmerized by it. This carnival is strange, but more like evil. Strange things happen at the carnival, people go missing, the mirror maze shows everything but yourself, and the carousel makes you younger or older. Will and Jim set out to defeat the carnivals freaks and owners Cooger and Dark with help from Will's father. The boys soon realize how to destroy the carnival with their own most important emotions happiness and love. Something Wicked This Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury was an exciting story about the evil of a carnival, I recommend it to anyone who wants to read an exciting story about overcoming evil.*One reason I liked this book is because the character development. Will who seems so nice and shy, when pressured to do the right thing can become mean and tough. For example when Jim attempts to get on the carousel Will punches him so he cannot become older and leave him. Another character I like is Jim because he changes from wanting to get on the carousel, then when he realizes that the carnival is pure evil he decides that he doesn't want to.*Another reason I liked this book is because of the interesting plot. Ray Bradbury has a great imagination in creating the characters and their roles in the story. Some of Bradbury's characters were unnecessary though, like the Lightning rod salesman who appears in the beginning of the book and then the rest of the book as a dwarf, but Ray Bradbury never reveals what happens to the man. Bradbury is very creative in his way of writing, he writes in metaphors and similes for most of the book, which can become confusing at some times but make it sound cool.*Another reason I like this book is because Ray Bradbury keeps you on your toes by creating a sense of suspense. Bradbury hooks you in the prologue by shaping his words to make the book seem interesting, like I the quote \\"But this year Halloween arrived early.\\" Bradbury always ended the chapters with a metaphor that left you wanting more.*Something Wicked This Way Comes was a thrilling book with many twist and turns. A few reasons I liked this book was because the character development, its interesting plot, and its ongoing suspense factor. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a book about overcoming evil.

At the time, I didn't understand the metaphors and symbolism that Bradbury's books are known for. I enjoyed it at the time, but it still wasn't one of my favorites. But now as I reread the book, I realize how great of a book this is. As I mentioned, like other of his books like Fahrenheit 451, this book uses a lot of metaphors.Anyways, I've been re-reading many of his books recently, and this is one of my favorites. I couldn't put it down and I read it less than a day. It's not really extremely scary, but the atmosphere and dialogue is masterful and tends to make the book have a mysterious and somewhat creepy feeling. It doesn't resort to violence and death to create this atmosphere as too many of today's \\"horror\\" novels do.It is essentially the tale of two boys, Jim and Will, who discover that the carnival that has come to town is evil. It is run by Mr. Dark, and a bunch of freaks that are pretty much actually souls that he captured. The two boys and Will's father much get rid of the carnival before it \\"destroys\\" more people.Overall, this book is excellent. While it isn't extremely scary, it is still a great piece of literature with a creepy atmosphere. It is as much a book about growing up as it is about terror and horror. I would recommend it to almost anyone who will understand the Bradbury metaphors.

I would qualify this just a bit, it is a &quot;boys&quot; childhood fantasy, and may be universal for boys. This distance from my personal experience(I'm a woman) didn't harm the book in the least.

The book is not exactly fast-paced, but it is a smooth and pretty quick read, and quite suspenseful (a trio Bradbury usually manages to evoke.) Bradbury has a very unique style. He has been called a &quot;prose poet&quot; and that is a highly accurate description. Though he is writing literary fiction here, it is almost as if you're reading poetry at times. He uses metaphor often and it is quite effective. The only problem with this is that the dialoge at times, though beautiful, can see a bit unrealistic. Alas. The book is a great read. The fascinating portrayal of evil and self-responsibility is all the more effective due to the two protoganists being teenagers.

In this book, evil comes in many different ways shapes and forms. If you are not satisfied with your life, evil will temp you with your most deepest desires, but if you are not strong willed, you will be taken over by evil and lose something very important to you. I would encourage anyone to read this book if you are looking for a good book to read. Evil comes in town in the form of a carnival and everyone associated to the carnival is evil. All the &quot;freaks&quot; in the carnival are people that weren't satisfied with their lives and gave in to the evil temptation. The prince of evil, whose name is Mr. Dark, controls all the freaks and everyone else in the carnival. The main characters in the book are Jim Nightshade, Will Halloway, and Charles Halloway. These characters are the main people that evil is after throughout the book. Charles Halloway is Will's father and Jim Nightshade is Will's best friend. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate this book as an eight. I would strongly encourage anyone who likes to read to pick up this book sometime."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"First of all, Something Wicked is not for those seeking a cheap thrill, a sudden &quot;Boo!&quot; that sends you three feet in the air one minute and makes you wonder why it ever scared you the next. No, this deeply poetic tale is not for literary &quot;junkies.&quot; If you actually take the time to digest this marvel, you'll end up distinctly disquieted; truly, you'll see things in a depth you never did before, from the longings and regrets we all face, to the simple joys anyone can find right at the end of their nose. Oh, who am I kidding? There's no way to sum up this book. I have read it at least five times, and I still find myself unlocking undiscovered secrets I passed over the time before. As I age, my views about life are constantly changing. But always, this book hits me at the core. This tale will follow you for the rest of your life; I would advise all sincere Bradbury fans to keep a copy in the glove compartment. The man has been blessed with a gift of language that will not be surpassed in the forseeable future."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Something Wicked This Way Comes(1962).Ray Bradbury, author of such renound classics as The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451, took a stab at the horror genre in 1962. Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and lods have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!Plot-During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...Writing-Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down. Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me.Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as many authors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A GREAT HORROR AND CLASSIC NOVEL NOT TO BE MISSED BY ANYONE! BRADBURY MAKES THE CARNIVAL SEEM MORE EVIL THAN IT DOES IN REAL LIFE!(...)"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"For English I wrote a response to this book, in poem form, and I'm going to share it with other Amazon-Niks:'The crescent moon I have marked on the bullet is not a crescent moon.

It was much more analytical and philosophical than I expected, thinking it would be more of a traditional horror plot without a lot more. While some of the long speeches from Will's father got a little tedious, the main point -- that evil feeds on sadness and despair and can be vanquished by happiness, laughter and love -- was excellently woven into the plot. Will and his father are great characters, juxtaposed against Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger and even Jim, who has both light and dark in him."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"\\"Don't look back on happiness, or dream of it in the future.

This is the first time I have read this book, I will blame it on laziness rather than lack of courage...It's the classic tale of good versus evil. A dark carnival comes to town led by Mr. Dark, The Illustrated Man. This is no ordinary carnival. Mr. Dark is out to recruit people to a life of misery in his sideshow traveling tour. Two boys discover his secret and will be forced to decide if they are \\"autumn people\\" or \\"summer people\\".

Will and Jim went to watch it set up. The train was old and black, and the tents went up in complete silence like magic. It scared Will and Jim so they ran home. The next day they went to go check it out but it seemed like a normal carnival. So they decided to ride all the rides. As night fell they came across and \\"out of order\\" carousel where they met Mr. Cooger and Mr. Dark. Mr. Dark seemed interested in Jim But he and Will left. They hid in the bushes and saw Mr. Cooger get on the carousel backwards and get younger. Later that night Jim went to go see if he could get on the carousel to get older. Will tried to stop him and they ended up putting Mr. Cooger on forward to many times and he died. Later, the dust witch from the carnival, under Mr. Dark's control, put a mark on Jim's house so they could find him later. Will and Jim washed it off and Will tried to kill the dust witch but it didn't work. The next day the carnival had a parade through town to secretly look for Jim and Will who were hiding under the street. Will's dad, Mr. Halloway, saw them and agreed to meet them later in the library to figure out how to beat the carnival. They figured out that the carnival came every thirty to forty years so no one would remember it. Then Mr. Dark came looking for Jim and Will. He crushed Mr. Halloway's hand and then had the dust witch put a spell on Will and Jim. Then they went back to the carnival. Mr. Halloway showed up to volunteer for the bullet trick. Using the crowd, he was able to break the spell on Will and kill the dust witch. After the crowd and all of the carnival freaks left, Will and his dad went to go find Jim. Jim was still under the spell and was being pulled toward the carousel. He got on it and it started going forward. Will ran over and, with some difficulty, pulled Jim of the carousel and they fell to the ground. But6 when Will got up Jim didn't move. Will started to cry because he thought Jim was dead. Then a little boy came to talk to Mr. Halloway, but he turned out to be Mr. Dark. Mr. Halloway killed him and then went over to Will and Jim. By just singing, dancing, and laughing, they were able to break the spell on Jim and he was okay again. They all agreed that they would be able to handle whatever evil that was up ahead. Although parts of this book are boring, overall it was very interesting.Parts of this book were very boring and confusing. For example, whenever they talk about life. They talk about it to much and it can get boring to read. You could skip over those parts and the story wouldn't change at all. Also, when Will is talking to his dad about being a good person. They were talking about if being a good person meant that you were happy. I didn't find that part interesting. They could have just skipped to the part where Will warns his dad to stay away from the carnival. This book uses a lot of metaphors and strange descriptions that make it hard to understand. For example, when Will and Jim were watching the carnival set up. You kind of have to reread parts of it to figure out what they were seeing and what you were being told.Parts of this book were funny and interesting. For example, it was funny how Will and his dad saved Jim. They were jumping around being goofy and even though Jim was pretty much dead, it made him okay again. And when he woke up, he didn't even question what they were doing, he just joined in. It was interesting when Mr. Dark was looking for Jim and Will in the library. He made it sound like he could hear their hearts beating. You want to keep reading to find out if it will lead him to them. Also, it was interesting when Will was trying to kill the dust witch. At the last possible second his weapon broke. He had to throw the arrow himself. Maybe she would have died if it didn't brake.Some parts of this book creepy, but still kind of cool. For example, when Will and Jim see the carnival set up. It was completely silent and they said it was like a spider with all the ropes everywhere. And the big tent seemed to pop up out of no where. It scared them so much that they ran home. Another creepy part was when Mr. Dark crushed Mr. Halloway's hand. You have to have a lod to strength to crush someone's bones. It made Mr. Halloway collapse in pain. Another creepy thing was the tattoos that Mr. Dark had of Jim and Will. If he pinched the tattoos then they actually felt pain. His hands were bleeding s Jim and Will's foreheads started to bleed. That is just weird.I would recommend this book to people who under stand metaphors and don't mind some boring parts. I would recommend it to people ages twelve and up. Little kids might find it a little boring and confusing.C.

It took me back to my boyhood, and the mystery of every autumn night. The prose is filled with description and metaphor, transporting the reader directly into the shadowy side of Jim and Will's sleepy little village.

I think it would have clicked more with me at a younger age, but it was still fun to read. This is a classic example of Bradbury's &quot;indirect storytelling&quot;... he presents the framework or essential elements of a situation, and then it's left for your imagination to fill in the blanks and interpret it.

While I do find this novel to be very appropriate for a younger audience. I also think that whether or not you read it at a younger age, it is a novel that will be more appreciated by those of a more ripened age. To me, a younger audience will be more drawn to the plight of the main characters whereas someone such as myself will identify and better understand the position and emotional makeup of Will's father, Mr. Halloway.The story itself is a wonderful coming of age type of adventure with plenty of tension and horrific moments that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. While the book is not so long as to be intimidating to more inexperienced readers, I found that it was anything but a quick read. That is not to say that I struggled to get through it, as a matter of fact, that couldn't be further from the truth. I found this novel to be one that I had to savor in smaller bites, taking a moment from time to time to sit back a reflect on the language and description provided by the author rather than rushing on to the next moment with our young heroes.All in all and enjoyable tale for both young and old that I will be sure to pick up again."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"With so many reviews there's not a lot to add, so I'll say this.

I picked it up immediately after Fahrenheit 451, which was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked. Bradbury is probably more responsible than any other single author for my love of reading, and for that he has my eternal gratitude.Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are wonderful characters, in many ways alike (hence their nearly unbreakable bond of friendship), but in some ways very different (hence that bond's almost being broken)---and I could relate very much to them both when I was about their age (and to some extent still). Mr. Halloway is wonderful as well, and I've always had a special affection for him and his beloved library stacks.Rereading it now as an adult, it doesn't stand up quite as well as some of his other books, but it still shines with that irrepressible Bradbury spirit. It's quite entertaining and a lot of fun even for grown-ups, at least those of us who haven't become too jaded. There's just something almost inherently thrilling to the child in all of us about the idea of a dark, October carnival.And the book is a bit dark, at least on its surface, even compared with Bradbury's other Green Town stories (notably Dandelion Wine) which were themselves actually kind of dark. Like them, it deals with death, but more specifically and directly in a more focused novel. But in the end, it is a story of light and life, as Bradbury puts death in its proper place, concluding: \\"Is Death important? No. Everything that happens before Death is what counts.\\"Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This is the story of Will and Jim, best friends for as long as they can remember.

Purchased \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" Ray Bradbury after his recent passing last month. -Wasn't available in Kindle and so I purchased a hardcopy- haven't done that in over a year. Got it yesterday afternoon and finished half before I realized it.Such rich characters such as Tom Fury, lightening-rod salesman who tells the main characters that there is a storm coming the night a dark carnival comes to town. Will Halloway and his best friend Jim Nightshade, both 13 years old and born next door neighbors. They have the distinction of being born one minute apart at the stroke of midnight. Bradbury has them see the exact same events, but their point of view is so widely different. Blond Will is the optimist and Jim Nightshade ever the pessimist. Will's dad, Charles Halloway is the older-frail librarian who stands against Mr. Dark, the illustrated man and owner of the carnival- think surrogate father- who wants to lure Jim away as his new partner. I have to think that Stephen King has this book on his own shelf- themes are similar in so many of his own titles.Yup, I'm a fan and have been since I was Will Halloway's age- I cannot recommend this as a Young Adult title however. I am not sure if the themes adults willing to sacrifice their souls for youth or teenagers willing to sacrifice their youth for adulthood isn't too subtle."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"The title of this book is what initially drew me in. I always wondered where this phrase came from; little did I know it was actually a Shakespeare quote. Either way, I had never read a Ray Bradbury book before and I wanted an easy read that would be suspenseful and satisfying.The book follows the adventure of two young innocent boys and their run-in with an evil carnival that comes to town. I found the friendship between the two boys to be very similar to my childhood friendships, which helped me make a quick fun connection. The circus magic in this book seemed to me to have a little influence in the magical Harry Potter series, although not so deliberate in its fantasy.One of the most unique aspects of this book that I noticed was the usage of a mixture of concrete/abstract imagery to set the scene and describe the characters. When describing the dark figure coming into the room, Bradbury writes, \\"The shadow seemed deliberate in its slowness so as to shingle his flesh and cheesegrate his steadily willed calm.\\" With noun-verbs in descriptions such as \\"cheesegrate\\" and \\"shingle\\" it seems as though we can trace the tendency we have in American English of \\"noun-ing\\" our verbs back to Bradbury. At first, the very detailed and obscure descriptions were a little annoying and hard to read through. However, as I got used to the style of the author, I began to enjoy reading the different adjectives and verbs he would use to paint the picture in my mind.Overall, although a little hard to find initial interest, I found this book to be an interesting and beneficial read. The characters that are brought life in vivid abstract-concrete detail provides for a creative story with enough suspense and emotion to keep you interested until this end of this short read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"When a shadowy carnival comes to town, promotional flyers touting a dusty witch, a skeleton, magic mirrors and the most beautiful woman attract the attention of 2 boys, the best of friends, having been born each side of midnight. But this is not a regular carnival, full of wonder and excitement. People start disappearing from town, a strange boy appears, and the carousel plays the Funeral March music backwards.The level of suspense and creepiness escalates with the turning of each page. But it's no simple horror story. Bradbury weaves a colorful and at times, poetic fantasy, bringing our best childhood nightmare creatures to life between the pages, and leaves us scrambling to grasp at a slim hope that an unlikely character might actually have the answer to stop them from devouring our two boys.What's especially impressive is Bradbury's ability to draw out the natural curiosity of boys who are full of life, one always just running towards what the future might bring, and the other leaping along more cautiously, one arm outstretched to protect his friend if danger should present itself.The suspense is held like a taut string all the way till the last chapter of the book."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"On the surface this would seem to be a fantasy story about a dark carnival and the even darker man that runs it.However, all the fantastical elements of this story are really just a springboard for discussing teenage Will Hollawy's relationship with his over the hill father, Charles, and something most decidedly not wicked at all but wonderful: the redemptive power of love.It all starts in anytown USA circa 1930s when an otherwise common October is altered by the arrival of a carnival. Young Will Holloway actually witnesses the arrival of that carnival with his friend Jim Nightshade when they're out adventuring one night.Even from the start the boys suspect that there is something very different about this carnival. In stages their suspicions are confirmed when they play witness to a series of extraordinary things from a calliope that can alter one's age to the strange powers of the carnival's inhabitants up to and including the mysterious Mr. Dark, the carnival's operator.Perhaps more dark than even Mr. Dark are the quiet fears and unfulfilled desires of some of the town residents who Dark would prey on. This includes the supposedly elderly Charles Halloway. In that quaint way that authors sometimes betray the age in which they write (this book was published in 1962), Charles Halloway, though only 54 is still pre occupied with thoughts that his age makes him somehow impotent as a father. (As an aside the screenplay for the 1983 movie on which this book was based most powerfully underscored Halloway's concern about his age by creating an incident where another younger man, had to be called in order to save Halloway's son from a drowning.)For his part young Will Halloway and his friend along with him soon find that they're in deep way over their heads and they need assistance. It's in this way Bradbury cleverly uses his fantastical set up for an all too real story that allows both young Will Halloway to save his Dad and the older Charles Halloway to save his son, both using love's redemptive power.Will that redemptive power prevail over Dark's evil? And if so how? Those questions of course are best answered by reading this story which is, in my opinion, not just one of Bradbury's best but also one of the best stories of American fantasy and science fiction."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This small town October adventure is better than bobbing for apples and coming up with the grand prize kiss from your middle school crush. I love the poetry in Bradbury's prose. I love the way he writes images that turn the pages into a looking glass you can step through to join hands with his characters. And most of all, I love the way he wrestles with major themes beneath the immediate action. At its heart this read to me like a book about death. About the power we give to evil because of our fear of it. About always looking ahead, be we young or old, and wanting something other than the gift we have right now: the present. Great read."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"When Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to town, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are drawn into a battle for their souls. Ray Bradbury's writing style sprinkled with half mad similes and metaphors turns a carnival into a place that breathes out wickedness and despair. There are a couple rambling philosophical sections that detract from the pace of the book, but this is one creepy page-turner!"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"It's incredible... a must read. I'm serious. It's a great book. You really won't regret buying it, trust me. Honestly, why aren't 6/5's possible?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Great book, but the movie (also written by Ray Bradbury) was much better. It's probably the best Halloween (the holiday) movie I've seen.The book can stand on its own, though, and is a great read"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This story is one that I have thought of often in the 15-plus years since I first read it. It is a tale of moral dilemma and tests of loyalty. There is enough of the macabre to keep the reader tightly gripped, yet enough moral fiber to keep the reader thinking for years to come... and isn't that the true test of great literature?"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"Pandemonium Shadow Show, where evil is entertaining and funhouse mirrors reflect the beast within....an adventurous and imaginative novel right from the first line, a foreshadowing of the trouble that begins for two boys when a very unusual train pulls into town one day: &quot;The seller of lightningrods arrived just ahead of the storm.&quot;"},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I read this in a weekend in October a couple of years ago. A tight, wellwritten tale."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I am a true Bradbury fan, having read most of his work, this has to be one of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I am a true Bradbury fan, having read most of his work, this has to be one of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"This book is wounderful. It really got me thinking, and it made me want to get out and find some type of adventure. The best thing I can probably say about this story is: After I finished it, I couldn't sleep. For I was busy running the story through my head, over and over. I know that I will probably read this book every October for years to come. Every one should read it. Child, young adult, adult... Everyone."},{"Title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ever since I saw the disney movie adapted from the book when I was a kid I always was fascinated with the story. Recently I thought about the movie again so I went out and picked up the book. I can't say how much I enjoyed it, bradbury definitely has a unique way of describing events as they unfold. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes dark fiction and over the top adventure."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],x={key:0},R={key:1};function M(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(t(!0),o(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),b(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",x,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(H,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-e11823f9"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/6.md","filePath":"people/6.md"}'),L={name:"people/6.md"},O=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{q as __pageData,O as default};
