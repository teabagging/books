Here we have an introduction to the way Greeks and Romans faced on humanity most ancient and perilous \\"game\\"...maybe battlefield is a more appropriate definition. We're talking about Love, sexual desire and the quest to obtain them (both or just one).This is an extraordinary anthology of Greek and Roman erotic verse. But much more than that, it is a fabulous introduction on ancient customs regarding sexual life and the classical views on how they regarded sex and roles.Form the Greek symposium where erastes tried to conquer their eromenos, to the much sought hetaeras where a man should look for pleasure (and not their wives). The comparative freedom women had in the Hellenistic world (compared to classical Greece), quite obvious in contemporary verses. To the living goddesses like Ovid's Corinna or Catullus's Lesbia, loved and hated at the same time.This book provides a solid footstep for further study, with excellent footnotes, suggested reading and representative examples of Greek and Roman erotic verse. Obviously you should study a little classical history and mythology before embarking on this journey; most verses have several references to myths, legend and history.From Greece you have short biographies and excerpts from (among others): Archilochus, Alkman, Mimnermos, Sappho, Ibycus, Anacreon, Theognis, Hipponax, Pindar, Bacchylides, Hermesianax, Asclepiades, Callimachus, Theocritus, Herodas, Machon, the Grenfell papirus, , Meleager.And from Rome you will find Bios and excerpts of: Catullus, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Sulpicia, Propertius, Ovid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Chariots Still Crash","review":"More dubunking of Erich Von Daniken's hypothesis in his Chariots of the Gods.

He is being sentenced in chains before King Stephen when the the king, a one-time ally of Faucon, decides to give him a chance to prove his innocence in this latest skullduggery. He has one month to acquit himself of Guillaume du Pree's murder, or he will be put to death for the crime.Lady Lyonesse of Taniere was betrothed to Guillaume du Pree, and, unlike a lot of romance heroines, she actually had feelings for her dead fiance who was also a childhood friend. She wants revenge on the man guilty of his death, so when she hears the dreaded Faucon is in the area, she and her guards kidnap him and take him prisoner at Taniere. At first she expects she'll simply kill him--an eye for an eye--but after meeting the so-called devil, and seeing a glimpse of his honor, she wonders if maybe there is some truth to his assertions of innocence.The two are attracted from the first, and this attraction soon turns to deeper feelings. Their passion blooms as they seek to rout out Guillaume's true killer and secret enemies arise that could prove deadly.

Rhys of Faucon is one of Anne Stuart's bad boys. He has a dreadful reputation that stems from all believing he killed his wife and child. Of course, the reader soon senses poor Rhys bears a bad rap for this evil deed. Now he stands sentenced to death for the murder of a peer of the realm. Dragged before King Stephan, another man once his allay intercedes and secures Rhys the chance to prove he is falsely accused once again. He must find out who did murder Guillaume du Pree or face his own death for the crime.Lady Lyonesse of Taniere was betrothed to the murdered Guillaume. Where Lynn shows her deft crafting of character, instead of going to the \\"old detested fianc&eacute;\\" stereotype, Lyonesse actually cared for the dead man. He was her childhood friend and she truly wants revenge for her friend's death. Naturally, she sees Rhys as responsible, so when she learns the man has been set free to find Guillaume's killer she things the knight is on a fool's errand. She sets out to kidnap him and keep him prisoner. She had planned, at the back of her mind, just killing him, but once she meets him, senses there is more to the man that the black tales that follow him, that maybe he is telling the truth about being innocent. If he didn't kill Guillaume, then who did? Attraction sizzles between the two from the starts and that reaction soon deepens into full-blown passion as they join forces to run to ground the true killer.Lynn spins a delightful tale, with a strong medieval flavour for the period. It's charming, witty, full of suspense and adventure, with two very vivid characters that stole my heart. Followed by Falcon's Desire and Falcon's Honor. Look for one more in the series to come.A Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Winner for 2003.The whole series is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Falcon's Desire (Harlequin Historical, No. 645)","review":"This book is wonderfully written.

Rhys Faucon is a strong admirable hero with solid, unwavering strength in character and his beliefs. What possessed him to like the heroine, Lyonesse, was beyond me. First, she wrongly captures him for a scum of a fiance and then cannot decide whether or not to trust him despite his oath to protect her in front of her people, his overall protection of her as an escort to her father's home despite his obvious attraction to her, and also her father's (whom she respects and loves) urging to trust him. Although the author states that the Rhys admires Lyonesse for her strength and uniqueness from other women of the time, I wish that the Lyonesse had actually possessed more admirable qualities. More show and less tell would've been nice. Had Lyonesse been less wishywashy and a better match for Rhys, I would've liked this book a great deal more.Recommended books:Heart of Gold,White Lion's Lady,Stealing Heaven"},{"Title":"Falcon's Desire (Harlequin Historical, No. 645)","review":"A friend gave me a copy of this when she was cleaning out her non-keepers.

It constitutes one of the few books written by Brunson on ancient history.Funnily enough I have not read this book. However, I have read much of the material inside 'Black Jade', by way of reference to other works by Brunson (probably unpublished??, as well as published material viz. in 'African Presence in Early Asia' by Ivan Van Sertima & Runoko Rashidi(eds).Much of what is written in 'Black Jade' is covered in a series of (unpublished??)booklets (written by Brunson) whose main (generic) title is called 'The Image of the Black...'. The key ones relevant to this review is: 'The Image of the Black in Eastern Art Part 1: Black Roots in Most Ancient China 1766 B.C -950 B.C' and'Image of the Black in Eastern Art Part 111: Kingdoms in South East Asia'.In Black Jade Brunson attempts to document the Black/African presence in China and S.E Asia in a very detailed way, going back thousand of years.You can also get an overview of Brunson's thoughts on the subject by seeing the chapters: 'African Presence in early China' and 'Unexpected Back Faces in Early Asia: A Photo Essay' which can be found in Van Sertima & Rashidi's, 'African Presence in Early Asia'(published).The chapters in 'Black Jade' runs as follows:Pt 1: AFRICAN PRESENCE IN ANCIENT CHINACh1; Prehistory; Ch 2 The Shang dynasty; ch 3 Blacks & Southern KingdomsPart 2: BLACK KINGDOMS OF SOUTH EAST ASIA- Chronology of China, People and MigrationsPart 3 - THE AMEN PRINCIPLEAlthough loosely familiar with the concept of Amon/Amen (ie God) I have no material by Brunson on this topic. So I am not sure what he has to say on this subject in 'Black Jade'Part 4 - AFRICAN PRESENCE IN THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN & AEGAN ISLESThis chapter is replicated in 'African Presence in Early Europe' by Ivan Van Sertima (ed).To conclude 'Black Jade' is a very difficult book to get hold off and costly too.Personally I think if one already obtains the Van Sertima books (published). Then the information provided by those books will cover the same material within 'Black Jade' except for part 3 - Amen Principle. Therefore it is not necessaryto buy 'Black Jade'Failing this one can always hope that Brunson will someday bring out a new editionfor this book. It has been rumoured within one of Brunson other published book, but that was a very long time ago."},{"Title":"Volvo S70, C70 and V70 Service and Repair Manual (Haynes Service and Repair Manuals)","review":"I've owned a '98' V70 for over six years now and I do all the work myself.

His book opened my eyes to new possibilities and ideas while poking fun at itself. \\"Agony of the Feet\\" portrays a cliched paradox without succumbing to the hackney genre. It is an anitnomy in almost all respects.I could go on and on about the fine piece of literature, but I'll sum with a few thoughts.Life is always better when you can share intimate moments with Some Dude and his itchy privates.The ability to shock someone with electric currents thrown from your fingers, to melt cyborg's feet to a bridge, or to pummel someone within an inch of their life after asking for mustard, does not make a superhero.It is not always crucial to go home again.And the most important lesson gleaned from \\"Agony of the Feet\\" is to make steady progress, and let it last a long time."},{"Title":"Agony of the Feet","review":"If it weren't for this book I'd be dead.

No really, it is a charming tale about youth, innocence, and living as much as we can in the short time we have. Thank you Mr. Hansen, for showing the world how to stand back up after having suffered the 'Agony of the Feet.&quot;Your friend,Rufus Leeking"},{"Title":"Agony of the Feet","review":"I didn't know what to expect as I approached this book. The author's earlier, mostly unpublished works are primarily comedy, so that is what I half-thought I was getting. I was only partially correct.Hansen has crafted a work here which cross genres and influences with ease. To nail down &quot;Agony Of The Feet&quot; as one genre or another is hopeless -- the book is equal parts human drama, absurdist comedy, biting satire, and action-adventure. And amazingly enough, it all works surprisingly well.&quot;Agony Of The Feet&quot; is a study of contrasts. Moments of dramatic tension are routinely intercut with irreverant and often bizarre humor. Case in point: the characters with the silliest names are also the most deadly. The work is frentic and brutal at times -- the violence on display in this book is, while not exactly stomach churning, unforgiving in its immediacy.But, what &quot;Agony Of The Feet&quot; is most of all is addicting. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. The reader is drawn into this strange and outlandish world that Hansen has created, and wants to see what he has in store next. The author is, like his creations, seemingly not a product of the real world, but rather of one of his own fanciful creation -- and that's not a bad thing.Strongly recommended -- buy this book! You will not be disappointed at all!"},{"Title":"Agony of the Feet","review":"Every so often a novel comes along that redefines the way we think about the world we live in while not taking it too seriously. Mr. Hansen has created &quot;a world within a world&quot; which many have us have already experienced and in a setting that most can relate to. In this case, the author uses university/college age students to portray an area of life in which so much maturing and growing is done and opinions are formed about the world around us. In this case, the day to day lives of the characters, the struggle they face, and the setting form that &quot;world within a world&quot;, a microcosm if you will, and uses interesting and colorful personnas to develop the story. In short, Mr. Hansen has written a great and entertaining book which dares to take issues we all face and put a fantastic spin on them, while making you think. I currently use this book in two pluralism classes I teach and my students reaction to it has been fantastic. Pick up this book any way you can. I promise that you won't be sorry you did and you'll walk away from it with a smile on your face and a little more educated to boot."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I loved this book, I loved the sweet, clever and endearing dialog between this couple.

For young adult and adult women!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Only problem is that this book is not available in hard back- only in a library version. But, the book is great."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book after hearing it was an unofficial sequel of sorts to A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but I didn't love this book nearly as much as Tree. Ms. Smith did a terrific job of recreating the world of the late 1920s college experience in Michigan, and just the world of the 1920s in general, so the setting definitely came alive with many little details, like the price of things, how people dressed, the way Annie and Carl decorated their living quarters, and what hospital birth was like for women. She also vividly brought to life what it was like to be a woman in this era. I'm so glad I was born in 1979 to Annie's 1909, when women have so many more rights, options, and choices, and the sexual double standard isn't nearly as extreme and cruel as it was in Annie's era.It frustrated and saddened me to see Annie putting herself last so often, accepting the double standard, and not really questioning things, like referring to sex between a *married couple* as \\"the act of sin\\" and just accepting her doctor's claim that her breastmilk didn't have enough nutrition. It was painfully obvious that Annie didn't have much self-confidence or know how to advocate for herself against authority figures or just men in general, and that she was used to passively going along with what she was told or expected to do. She put up with Carl's disturbing horndog episode on their wedding day, having a doctor chosen for her by the Dean, the rather suspect, non-evidence-based things she was subjected to during her pregnancy and labor, and the patronizing attitude taken to her by some other men. Even in the 1920s, it wasn't unheard of for a woman to be a bit more assertive and empowered (for her era) than that!However, a well-built setting can't save a book that's otherwise very ordinary. As much as I love quieter, character-based stories with a more episodic feel, this story just felt too ordinary. A lot of the dialogue was rather simplistic and banal, and a lot of the story was told through this dialogue, as compared to the beautiful, lyrical descriptive prose of Tree. Annie and Carl never really came alive to me as fully-developed, flesh and blood characters. I actually liked some of the secondary characters better, like the old grocer Henry and the Dean. It's not a good sign when secondary characters seem more believable and better-drawn than the leading couple!Annie and Carl seemed like the young couple just about everyone has known, the annoying couple who thinks their love is so special, magical, and exceptional, and that they'll beat the odds against poverty and divorce just because they're young and in love, so different from all those other young couples who rush into marriage. They were like two kids playing house, completely nave about real, adult life. I wasn't surprised to learn that this book was based on Ms. Smith's first marriage, which indeed ended in divorce. Carl was leaking red flags from the jump. Even by the standards of his era, he seemed controlling and sexist. I don't understand why Annie would want to be with someone who acted like such an animal on the front porch on their wedding day, and who, some years earlier, made it look to his mother like he and Annie had been making out on his bed. It clearly seemed like they only got married for one reason, to sleep together with social approval. I never got a sense of any realistic love or chemistry between them.There wasn't any real plot, except to tell the story of a young couple's first year of marriage and the challenges it brought. Nothing really dramatic or noteworthy ever happens. Most of the book consists of a recounting of fights, cluttery chat, meals, and Annie's trips around town and campus. Tree wasn't really plot-centric either, but at least the characters came alive, and there were plenty of memorable, interesting, dramatic scenes, beyond people sitting around smoking, making dinner, buying alarm clocks, and hanging up curtains. Annie and Carl have so many convenient deus ex machina rescues--jobs, money, a place to stay, free classes to audit. They never really descend into the depths of poverty and have to really struggle. All their fights seemed to be resolved by Annie sitting on Carl's lap.Since this book really is like an unofficial sequel to Tree, right down to strong similarities between Annie and Francie (having her caul stolen by the midwife, a stepfather much older than her mother, growing up poor in Brooklyn tenements, leaving school to work at 14, wanting to be a writer, etc.), it kind of disturbed me to see some of that history being rewritten. Suddenly the stepfather is a pedophile, her childhood was really unhappy and crummy, the mother is a witch without much love for her daughter, she's left home not to attend college but to marry some boyfriend to escape the creepy stepdad.The book wasn't horrible, but ultimately it was just too ordinary to feel compelling. The characters and story weren't memorable or unique enough, and there weren't enough dramatic tension, any real antagonists, or a truly black moment. It would've been more interesting to follow them through the Depression, which was looming just a few months away when the book ended."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"In 1927, eighteen-year-old Annie leaves her Brooklyn home to join her new husband in the Midwest, where Carl is a law student.The two quickly learn that love won't pay their bills. Angry about the elopement, Carl's mother cuts off his allowance, and as a busy student Carl is only able to put in a few hours each week delivering papers and working in the cafeteria.Still, Carl and Annie are determined to make it work. Cramped in one room with Carl as he's trying to study at night, Annie soon learns to follow her own interests. Never having gone beyond eighth grade, Annie's natural curiosity and love of learning causes her to try her hand at writing plays, and eventually, she's even auditing classes.For every hurdle that's thrown their way, Annie and Carl also meet someone willing to help them, or a lucky coincidence that helps them make it another day. And if only they can get through a year's worth of days, Carl will be a lawyer and things will be great.As always, Smith's novels feature real-life characters, full of goodness and flaws in equal measure. Readers can't help rooting for Annie and Carl, and also wishing there was a way to find out how their story continues!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I first read this book in high school and never forgot it. Last year, I found this book on the book table at Costco and grabbed it up. I re-read it as an adult and found it to be just an enjoyable as it was when I read it as a 17-year-old. It's Annie's simplicity and innocence that is so endearing. She \\"collects\\" people - they become her friends instantly. She even takes in a homeless dog from the college and makes it her own. At the end of the book, I found I wanted to read more about Annie and Carl and their little boy.

Smith wrote \\"Joy\\" as a semi-autobiographical account of her own first marriage. The couple, Annie and Carl, are madly in love, and Smith creates a cute, heartwarming love story without the over-hashed sugary sweet romantic tales (coughNicholasSparkscough). Their own personal struggles, such as Carl's jealousy and Annie's own haunting memories of a pedophiliac stepfather brings more realism to this novel than just the average drugstore romance; Smith also immaculately depicted the external struggles of an early marriage, such as Carl balancing a family and college, financial struggles, and an early pregnancy, and that, too, also makes this novel easily relatable.Highly recommended! It's a heartwarming tale about the emotional bond between two people and how the impossible can be accomplished with the power of love (cue in Huey Lewis)."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"My Grandmother left Joy in the Morning after visiting years ago.

I have never enjoyed a book that much before. I felt like I was right there. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I wasn't a very big fan of Carl though, I felt as though he had a tendency to take his anger out on Annie. I wish the book would've been about 200 pages longer so I could have known what happened when they moved and if Annie ever got to fulfill her dream of going back to college. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. I think anyone could get into Annie and Carl's life. The thing I liked the very best was the fact of how real it was and that it could happed to anyone. Many people experience the troubles they had everyday. This book was so good I can see myself reading it again."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"After reading and having enjoyed &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; I was excited to find this book on the shelf under Betty Smith's name. Although not as powerful or as touching as her other novel, &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; was still a good book and I thought its basic concept was interesting. This book really makes you appreciate and be grateful for what you have, whereas these characters struggled, but they had each other and they appreciate the little that they had. I admired the characters and could appreciate their joy. And I firmly believe, as this author is trying to get through, that joy does come in the morning and that everything does get better."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I bought this book a few years after reading \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" and a few months before I got married. I didn't read it until my husband was sent overseas 8 months into our marriage (which up to that point was a little rocky) and I found in the characters of Carl and Annie, shadows of my husband and I. All newlywed couples have adjustment troubles, my mother in law thought I was pregnant too, and there were tears and heartache. But at the end of it all, there is love and joy. It took a simple little story to make me see it.Five years later, this book has become a staple of my husbands and mine on our camping trips. I start at the begining and read the whole thing through. Carl and Annie feel like family now, and my husband and I love each other more and more each day."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Several years ago, I picked up this book for next-to-nothing at a used book sale. I began reading it and couldn't put it down. The story of the young law student and his other-side-of the-tracks wife is endearing and most memorable. This book has drama, comedy...anything any reader would want. I was so sorry when I finished it that I turned it over and started it all over again. This book is also a good summer or winter vacation read for teenage girls. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"The reader will immediately be captivated by the characters, Annie and Carl and their devotion to each other. This book is by no means new; it was written many years ago and has become a true classic. The story reads like an older version of Love Story - not the same scenario, but the same passion. You will feel part of the obstacles and challenges Annie and Carl face as a couple and share their dreams, aspirations and sorrows. Annie is, indeed, a young woman ahead of her time. She stands her ground and is not afraid to make her own decisions or stand up for what she believes in - quite an accomplishment considering the year this book was written. The book is written in a poignant, easy-flowing manner by an exceedingly talented author. &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; is one of those unique literary masterpieces you will want to read over and over again. This book and one other by Betty Smith, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; are two of my favourite classics among my collection. I would not part with either one. Both are deeply moving, touching and sensitive stories and ones you will remember and cherish throughout the years."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Joy in the Morning is another great book by Betty Smith. It is probably my second favorite book, behind A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by the same author. I am only 13, but this book is very easy to understand at my age level, despite being an adult book. I finished the book fairly quickly. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to relax with a good book! Read it, you'll like it too!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I found this book in a used bookstore for a 50 cents. It is now my favorite book. Maybe because I am young and just got married and my husband works while I go to school. Our hardships aren't as extreme, but we have some. The attitude of Annie made me love her and I really felt a feeling of loss when the story ended. I am a compulsive reader and when I get flustered I pick up a book and read. This loving story always makes me feel better!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book is about Carl Brown and Annie McGrairy and their compassionate love. This book is about young love and newly-weds. It is great all the way through. Betty Smith maintains her style of writing through this book as well. One would easily fall in love with the characters. This book really makes one believe that love can accomplish anything and everything. This book deals with dreams, aspirations, ambition, romance, poverty, desire, love and much more. I would recommend this book to anyone, it's hard to pick it up without putting it down, and it's a easy read. It's a rich experience all throughout. The book about newly-weds and especially about Annie who moves from Brooklyn to the Midwest to join her husband while he studies law at Midwestern University. Annie loves to read and write (like Francie Nolan from ATGIB) and how she makes friends and learns to love her new hometown.It is a more gentler novel than A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and the character of Annie is much like Francie Nolan and even more like Betty Smith. The character of Carl is alot like Ben Blake from ATGIB, but like the ideal prince as well as husband. This book doesn't have as many down parts as ATGIB and it keeps a smile on one's face throughout.This book was great! I loved it...as much as ATGIB. From cover to cover---IT WAS TRULY WONDERFUL. The characters in this book are one's that anyone can easily fall in love with. I THINK ANYONE WOULD ENJOY THIS NOVEL. I've read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and I know that many people think this book isn't as great, but it is, in it's own way."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Normally I don't like reading, but i read this book in two days!

I thought that Betty Smith did a good portrayal of life as newlyweds in the 1920s. I actually wouldn't know because I wasn't born then, but in general, it was very realistic. I felt terrible for Annie and Carl (the main characters) when they had to eat potatoes forever, it seemed. They were good kind people and they were suffering from extreme poverty. Throughout all the hardships they went throught, they stayed together, managed to put food on the table, and kept a good relationship with eachother.

Being newly married, I could identify with some of the struggles that Annie and Carl faced.I know that most of Betty Smith's books are autobiographical, but there was something about Annie in this book that was especially touching. Maybe it was her struggle to fit in, or to grow into the adult woman she was pushed into being with her marriage to Carl. Either way, this is by far my favorite book (not just by Betty Smith) and I would highly reccomend it. It's a book that I would have no problems reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a really good book.

I had been looking forward to reading it for years, but just didn't get around to it. I was pretty disapointed when I finally did. It is about a teenage girl named Annie who weds at a young age in part to escape her sexually abusive step father. She longs for an education like her husband Carl has. Even though she cannot afford college, she does learn a lot by sitting outside the college classrooms and listening to the professor's lectures. I found the parts about their scruffy stray dog \\"Jello\\" pretty amusing, but not much else. I guess I expected it to be as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn which only took me about 4 days to read. Joy in the Morning took me about 6 weeks to finish. It was so slow. However, I can see it being inspiring for teens I guess who long for a better home life and education."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"couldn't put it down, was dissappointed when I got to the last page because I wanted there to be more"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"A Tree grows in Brooklyn (Betty Smith's most well known book) is one of my favourite novels of all time. As a result, I bought Joy in the Morning with a keen sense of anticipation. The book is a simple, sweet story of the first year of married life of a poor young man and woman in the Twenties. It is a poignant and enjoyable read. But it lacks the depth and conviction of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Somehow, Annie never captures your heart the way Francie did. She never seems quite real - too naive, too nice. A lot of the incidents in the book don't seem to ring true either - Annie's inclusion in the university class, for example. Perhaps I approached the book with unreasonable expectations - it is certainly not a bad book, just a featherweight, not very memorable one. Worth reading, but nothing great."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I enjoyed this book, it is kind of sappy and dribbly but you can't help but like the characters in this book. I guess I like reading this book over and over because it gives me a feeling that love can make a marriage work. You just know it will work out. I agree with some of the reviews that they probably wouldn't of made it without a lot of hand outs, but they strive to make it on their own. You know Carl will be successful and Annie will be happy. So to wrap it up it is a good read.

Found an old copy of this book while looking for something to take my mind off of personal problems. Was swept away to a simpler time and place... Midwestern college town in the late 1920's.

Why did I read Smith's novel for that class? What many of you may not know is that Smith bases Joy in the Morning on her experience as a young girl at the University of Michigan who falls in love with and marries a fellow UM law student. A poignant novel, extremely touching, and a realistic portrayal of Smith's personal experience.

I have given loads of people this book to read and many have enjoyed it but appeals more to people who don't want loads of action."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Like her modern classic, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Betty Smith's Joy in the Morning envelopes the contemporary reader in every part of her heroine's world and creates a safe haven from virtual-pets and liposuction.Smith's characters are real. They are so warm and real you can hear their voices when they speak. You ache for them to achieve their dreams. You feel both their joy and pain and welcome both as a reminder of your kinship with humankind (and I'm only being slightly dramatic). Their story gives you warm fuzzies in places you didn't know you could get warm fuzzies-- amazingly without being trite.In Annie, Smith creates a simple character whose simple story is somehow made rivetting by the presentation of both her quiet dignity and unquenchable spirit. Unlike more recent authors who also present rather straightforward plots, such as Anne Tyler, Smith does not rely on eccentric oddballs or bizarre circumstances to keep the reader engrossed and keep the story moving. There is not a more perfect and real love story than this narrative of Annie and Carl's first years of marriage.A great gift for a literary-minded bride-to-be or any romantic realist..."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Its true that this story wasnt nearly as touching as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but i still thought it was really enjoyable and entertaining. it left me with a &quot;feel-good&quot;, feeling, kind of like the feeling I get when i see a cute little romantic movie or something like that.

She really describes life in a realistic way. It's like I was there."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book roughly picks up where \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" leaves off. The characters have different names, and a few details are changed. The story and characters remain recognizable nonetheless.So, if you have read \\"A Tree..\\" this is a satisfying novel because you feel like you have read about the next chapter in the lives of familiar people. The best part of this book is something that it has in common with \\"A Tree..\\" They are both heavily autobiographical; therefore, they really give you the flavor of Betty Smith's life in the U.S. around the turn of the century. In the end, however, this book is much less interesting than its antecedant."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book was great but... well, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was so much better! If I was focusing on comparing the two, this would definately get 4 stars, but I'm going to try not to, and compare it to other books, and then it gets a 5. It was about Annie McGairy Brown, who marries Carl Brown, who is still in college, and they are both very young. They must survive the first year of the marriage, and they are very likable characters. Betty Smith is a great writer, she just makes the book flow right on without using strange plot turns.

It's one of those books that you can't put down, but dread finishing. I have read it three times now, which is saying a lot -- I don't usually reread books unless they make a BIG impression on me, and even then I rarely read the same book more than twice. And I am positive that I have not read Joy in the Morning for the last time.This book cannot be considered a particularly cheerful book, but it is uplifting, inspiring, and, above all, optimistic. It instills hope in its reader, it is a voice that says, &quot;no matter how bad things are, they can get better with with confidence, determination, and everlasting faith.&quot; This is the main message of Betty Smith's masterpiece -- &quot;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&quot;"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I really enjoyed this book alot, but I guess that after just finishing A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, I had set very high standards for this book. I was not totaloly sucked into this book, butI got to the point when I felt like I was Annie's friend. I never really liked Carl. This book was very believable. The fact that they married very young and that Annie did not even go to highschool shocked me, but at that time those actions were very common. If you are looking for a pretty good book to read than put this in your shopping cart.

It is a chronicle of their first year of marriagein 1927, when Carl is finishing his last year of university. It is an honest and sometimes funny story of their trials and disappointments, their optimism and hopes. Annie is one of those characters that you just have to love-she's eternally open and optimistic and has a natural gift for writing. Carl isn't quite so much of a main character-you see that he loves Annie and is the &quot;steadier&quot; side of the marriage, yet you do not get to know him like you get to know Annie. You can still see traces of Betty Smith's &quot;trademark&quot; keenness and insight, yet this interesting novel can't hold a candle to &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"After reading a Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I just had to read this because I loved the other so much. And this book, written much in the same style, I enjoyed as well. Although I think that it is not quite as moving as a Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and it is a little harder for myself to relate to, I still loved it and it was worth the time and money. Annie and Carl are characters that you instantly like and embrace, you want to protect them and help them, you root for them the whole book through. It is a very well written book, and I think everyone should read it"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Betty Smith will always be remembered for A Tree Grows In Brooklyn but Joy in thew Morning and all her other books all have a certain mystic that also makes them special.

It is incredibly romantic and upbeat!!Just like Francie in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, you'll fall in love with Annie. Annie moves west to Chicago from Brooklyn to marry Carl, her sweetheart. And the story is about her first year with Carl, getting pregnant and making new friends in a strange town and making do with little money. And throughout this whole book, Annie faces every challenge with an upbeat and cheerful spirit. And she will steal your heart too!!I am almost afraid to watch the movie because the book itself is absolutely wonderful!! It's incredibly romantic and wonderful. Please don't hesitate to buy it ~~ it's a good buy and one that will warm your heart forever!!..."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"In light of our terrible divorce rate in America, this book lets you know why those older couples you see who celebrate their 50th and 75th anniversary make it that long. I was married not too long ago and this book actually pointed out things I could have done with my new husband to improve the quality of my marriage.You will love both the characters: a determined law student (with a little temper) and an Irish-American girl with dreams and hopes (and a secret past involving a stepfather). In most modern books, the guy would have ended up being a wife beater and the girl would have had issues regarding being molested. This book could have been like Terri McMillan's &quot;Disappearing Acts&quot; with dsyfunctional characters trying to make it. Instead, we truly believe the characters love and respect one another and the author is not afraid, even in her time, to allude to subjects that have become standard fare in recent years.The girl, is thankfully not a wait-on-your-man-don't-express-a-single-thought-of-your-own type of gal. And the guy is not of the all-men-are-dogs type. She has opinions and he has drive. She seems to have dreams of her own and her husband slowly comes to accept it. He makes his sacrifices for the family to stay together. They argue and make up. I recommend giving this book to an engaged couple so they can learn how to start their marriage right with committment and respect.I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is the same author of the book &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, a book I've never read but a movie I've seen. It turns out that &quot;A Tree...&quot; is one of my mother's favorite books, although she remembers it being behind the library desk and not on the open stacks due to a rape scene. In typical Betty Smith fashion, obviously, she doesn't see the world in rose colored glasses.I will be honest. Not only did I read this book within a couple days but it also helped put my marriage back on track. As many non-fiction books I read about marriage, none helped so much as this one. The basic message I got out of the book is to establish little rituals that show your love to your spouse. It goes a long way toward setting a foundation for feeling good will toward your spouse."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This is one of my favorite &quot;youth&quot; novels. Annie McGairy has a lot in common with Francie Nolan of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and even more with Betty Smith, the author. This is more autobiographical novelization, this time, chronicling Annie's move west and her marriage to Carl at a young age.While Carl studies law at a big Midwestern university, Annie must cope with the changes marriage brings, plus the stress of little money and a burning desire to get an education. Annie's solution is to camp outside a classroom at the university and listen in. The events that follow are, indeed, joyous.Some readers find that &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; is less enjoyable than &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Some of this may be due to the fact that &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; is a novel about a transitional time in the author's life. Novels and autobiographies that deal with times of change and transition are often less &quot;jelled&quot; than ones about childhood. I sometimes compare &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; with &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by McCourt. &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; shares some qualities with McCourt's sequel &quot;T'is&quot; for the same reasons--it's that time of growth and transition. If you keep that in mind, it explains the difference in quality from the previous work.I had the amusing experience of reading &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; for the first time while I was attending a big midwestern university myself. When Smith began describing the campus and the classroom in the novel, I could clearly visualize all the locations she wrote about. I began to have my suspicions and ran to the library to look up Smith's biography. Yes, she was writing about University of Michigan, where I was going to school at the time."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"&quot;Weeping my endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning&quot;-So begin the pages of Betty Smith's novel, Joy in the Morning. Within these pages we meet Annie and Carl, a young couple struggling against the tide, to make the first year of their marriage work. Carl is a twenty year old law student, who gets cut-off financially from his family when they learn he has married Annie, an 18 year old girl from an uneducated, and poor family. The story chronologically walks us through the first year of marriage for Annie and Carl in an extremely simple, yet touching way. The writing style is simple, but effective. Annie is an optimist and though she feels that she doesn't fit in amongst the college students and the scholarly life, has an innocent zest to learn and adores books and writing. Carl, more of a realist, is a hard-working student who struggles to find time to be a good student and husband as well as provide financially. Blended in, are a rich cast of characters from the local grocer, Henry to the caring landlandy, Mrs. Hansmon, each adding a touch of humanity and warmth to the story.This book should not be compared to A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but based on its own merit. It is a feel good, comfort book, best described as wholesome, yet insightful. Yes it is simplistic at times, but it works. What the reader is left with is that love can endure, through sacrifice and trial. We can't do it all alone, it is only through the help of friends and community as well as faith. It reminds us, that if we are patient, we can all look toward tomorrow and find joy in the morning."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Having read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; back in high school I was very excited to find that Ms. Smith had another book. From the opening paragraph to the very last page I fell instantly in love with both characters. Annie's innocence and Carl's steadfast belief in there love. My heart stopped when her professor asked her into his class and it soared with the praise of her first play. When she found out that she was pregnant I cried knowing that her and Carl must make a decsion for the future of there love and there marriage. I will recommend this book to everyone I knowand to everyone I don't. It will be placed on my shelf alongside my other all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"In the Elizabethan era Christopher Marlowe wrote the famous line \\"Comparisons are Odious.\\" However, when an author such as Betty Smith is so famous for one work, comparisons are very difficult to avoid. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was such a powerful novel that anyone who has ever read it is going to find it difficult to read Joy in the Morning without at least being vaguely reminded of the first book and possibly just a little disappointed in this one.Joy in the Morning is the story of Annie, who leaves Brooklyn just after her 18th birthday to marry Carl, a young law student at a Midwestern university. The first year of their marriage is the stuff of subtle drama as Annie and Carl work out their cultural and educational differences.The work is strongly autobiographical. Like Annie, Betty Smith left school at the age of 14 to work in factories and retail. Like Annie, Betty Smith (then Wehmer) left Brooklyn for the Midwest at age 18. At Ann Arbor, Michigan, she married George Smith, a young law student. In the book Annie is a writer trying to find her voice, and finds it in playwriting. Betty Smith was also a playwright-she attended Yale Drama School and had over 70 plays under belt before she wrote her first novel.With that much stage experience, it is no wonder that Betty Smith is a virtuoso of both pace and dialogue. The underlying structure of Joy in the Morning is every bit as well-crafted as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. But it is every bit as different from the earlier work as a college town in the Midwest is from New York City. It is lighter, more sentimental, and less condensed. The grit of the Brooklyn streets is softened here. Though there are allusions to her stepfather's behavior in her bedroom being part of the reason Annie fled Brooklyn, Smith doesn't show the reader anything truly ugly as she did with Nolan's drinking and death in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Joy in the Morning is simply a kinder, gentler read, a sweet story about the first year of marriage in a new town."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book is an account of the first year of marriage for Carl and Annie and the trials they (like so many others) endure, including an unexpected pregnancy, financial troubles, and adjusting to living with one another. Smoothly written with detailed characterization. I was, however, disappointed that this book lacks the beautiful prosaic quality, imagery, and nostalgic feeling that is so wonderful in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Much of the book is dialogue, which does not 'flow' as well as the author's narrative writing style. Worth the read, but not Betty's most enchanting book."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Having read a Tree Grows In Brooklyn I had set high standards for Joy In The Morning and I was not disappointed. I don't know if it is because I can relate to the situation or because Betty Smith herself can write a book in such a way that you feel that you are part of the story. I didn't want the book to end. The power of love can do anything that this young couple set their minds to. I was speechless when Annie and Carl exchanged Christmas gifts and I felt Annie's fear when she thought she might be pregnant. This book is so emotional and insprational. While it may not be A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I feel it is a wonderful novel of true love. They were able to accomplish the impossilbe. Annie is a wonderful character. She has such a zest for life. Like Francie, she is an unforgetable character in an unforgetable book."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"By the time I'd read the first paragraph, I knew I was going to love these characters. As she did in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Smith creates realistically flawed yet beautiful human beings. It is hard not to think of this as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Part II. Annie is so similar to Francie and also to Katie. I have always suspected that Smith's works are strongly autobiographical, and this work feeds that suspcicion. Beyond being a touching story, this novel would provide a few chuckles to anyone who tries to write. Smith remembers her days as a green writer, and vividly paints the mistakes we all make."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This is the only book I've ever read at least four times. It is a book that is almost impossible to put down. You live the story with the young couple, savoring their joy, anguishing in their suffering, or laughing at their innocence. Over my 23 years of teaching high school English, I convinced many young girls that reading can be enjoyable by loaning them my paperback copy of this book. Needless to say, it is now held together with a rubber band. Time to buy one of the lovely new editions. So glad it is back in print. Although I enjoyed A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it does not hold a candle to Joy in the Morning."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very depressing book. It is about a family who lives in the slums of Brooklyn. They try to make the best of it, but it usally turns out for the worst. This novel takes place from 1902 to 1919. The father is a drunk, the mother works hard, the brother is an average boy,and the sister has high hopes of becoming a famous writer. Her dream is squashed when her father dies and she writes about such, thus, her teacher calling her compositions 'sordid'. In my opinion, the book is sad because most people die, Aunt Sissy has 11 children and one survives, Uncle Flitman leaves Aunt Evy, Flossy's brother dies, and Johnny dies. But most of all from these things comes happiness. Aunt Sissy is happy, Aunt Evy is happy, Flossy is free form caring for her brother, and Katie can marry again. Katie does marry, she marries seargent McShane, who is now mayor of Brooklyn. In her doing this made me feel as though Johnny was the cause of all their troubles."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Everyone should read this book!

It is funny, sad, serious, and moving."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This is a well-written little novel. But, it was written in the late 1920's and it lacks much of the dynamic we have come to expect in today's fiction. It is the simple but sweet story of a young couple's first year of marriage. Well told and with touching moments, but no real highs or lows."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"\\"Joy In The Morning\\" is one of my favorate books, written by one of my favorate authors, Betty Smith. In the novel, two young lovers, Annie McGairy, a bimbo with a flare for writing, and Carl \\"Carlton\\" Braun,a law student, are wed by the state, and it was funny, because the person who wed them thought that Annie didin't look \\"A day over fourteen\\". In actuality, Annie was eighteen. It's a romantic novel about young love, young parenthood, and young manerisms. There's a part that still bothers me, though. The part when Annie is pregnant with their baby, she's upset about the old carriage, and Carl threatens Annie that he'll \\"Bop her one\\". Well, I'd never let my man talk to me like that! One example of 20's male chauvinism. Shame, Betty Smith, shame.Oh yeah, and this is NOT a novel with sexual content. It does give some indication, like sexual abuse, but no, pretty clean in general. I would know; I read this in the eighth grade.If you're in the mood for clean romantic novels,I would also reccomend \\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks, and \\"Bling: A hip-hop Story\\" by Erica Kennedy."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Like most folks who've read 'Joy in the Morning' I did so after reading Betty Smith's wonderful 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'. But unfortunately 'Joy..' doesn't measure up to '..Brooklyn'. Not even close. While the coming of age aspect of this story involving a Brooklyn girl marrying a law student at the turn of the Depression does have endearing qualities, overall the story comes off a bit contrived and the characters seem shallow. Fortunately the story's overall sweetness outweighs the 'boy, I cannot believe the author expected readers to be THAT gullible' sensation. And therefore I think women, especially teenaged girls, will like this book very much.Bottom line: read 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' instead. That book is literature, 'Joy in the Morning' is dime store fiction in comparison."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Joy in the Morning is one of my all time favorite books and one that I will never forget. It was beautifully written and the characters were soo real I felt I knew them. Annie was soo cute. Sometimes I would just stop reading and smile because she is so cute. I reccomend this book to anyone because I loved it soooooooo much!!!! I can almost garuntee you will like it too. I can't wait to read a Tree Grows in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I just have to save someone else from wasting time on this book, if possible, esp. after seeing all the glowing reviews from other (must be diehard Betty Smith fans). \\"Tree Grows\\" is wonderful; by all means read it; it's one of the greats. Not sure if that one or this one is the fluke, but it's hard to believe they're written by the same person.The best part was the author's early attempts at play-writing, as that dialogue is only slightly more hilarious than that which comprises this entire novel. The characters are wooden and one-dimensional, the conversation stilted and artificial, and Annie (I thought) obnoxious. Whiny and petulant, she's nonetheless immediately beloved by all she meets; not only is this not credible, it's rather self-engrandizing since everyone knows this is semi-autobiographical. Everyone cutting her deals and doing her favors; wha---? The end, lame. A waste of my time...Also disturbing was the very dark picture painted by the same author of her (presumably) own background in these two novels; suddenly, in \\"Joy,\\" the stepfather is a child molester, the mother an unforgiving shrew, and her childhood horrible? Kind of sullies the \\"joy\\" of \\"Tree Grows\\"...I can't recommend this. Instead, re-read the great \\"Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" Your time will be much better spent that way."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Nice to be able to buy a hardbound book for mere pennies...most of the cost is the shipping, which still only amounts to about 25% of a new hardbound book."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I enjoyed Joy inthe Morning a lot except I thought she left the reader hanging at the end. I would probably give it about 4 stars."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book is by far the worst of the 4 novels Betty turned out.Most likely as it is set away from Brooklyn. The two main characters Annie and Carl are stiff and unreal.The saving grace in this book are supporting players who have depth and emotion.Annie is nothing more than a shrew.From not wanting to fry because of an innocent comment to her unrealistic expectations of life. Why if it weren't for everyone in the book helping her she would be no where. I mean the way she talks you just want to smack her.Carl doesn't add much life except you want to egg him on to hit her.However all the supporting players from Miss Aggie to Goldie to the Dean show depth and are FUN to read about. And the book keeps on using stupid devices like &quot;ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WAS SUMMER.&quot; Let's forget about what happened then...The book is hastely organized, badly written and is obviously trying to be two people in love who make it. Yeah they do ONLY because EVERYONE ELSE gives them things. Annie gets free classes from the dean, a free place to live, even at the end Carl is handed a job by the dean.They didn't make it on their own...But if you can get it used it is worth a read."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"When I started the book I saw it as a character rather than plot driven story. Thats okay. However, as I worked through the thin story, I found most of the characters shared common characteristics. The author told us how different they were, especially in the way they viewed and practiced their faith. But in practice, there is a sameness in many of the characters that saps some of my interest, as a reader.The author's use of the language is praisworthy. He has a feeling for the tempo of language and his dialogue, while sometime strained, mostly has a believable feel to it.I liked the story, but would have liked it better if all of the characters had their own novel outlook on the issues covered in the book, and their own voice."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I just finished, much to my dismay, Joy In the Morning. I couldn't put this book down over the weekend. Smith's character development is incredibly strong and her dialogue is excellently realistic. I have been away from reading for some time for various, no-good-reason reasons, and when I found this book I had meant to read in high school...and then college...I decided to give it a go and am ready to read again, often. It was truly a delight. The plot captured me immediately and I felt as though I quickly got to know Carl and Annie intimately. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a laid-back read that touches on many emotions and the common hardships/adjustments that come with starting a new life with someone. 5 stars, without a doubt."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I like books based on reality. Things that could actually happen to people. And for me, this book was not only was realistic but it described the couples life in detail. She didn't leave anything out. A Joy in the Morning is a book that you'll celebrate when the characters celebrate, and hope when the characters are hoping. BUT it wasn't a book that made an impact on me; all the same, IT WAS GREAT!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This book doesn't compare, in my mind, to 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' but it was still written in Betty Smtih's wonderful style. If you liked 'A Tree', you should definately read this book."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I found this in my high school library and it being on my list to read, I checked it out. I finished it one day, it was that good. I really enjoyed this novel, it was sweet and romantic and it fits the time period that I like to read most about. Carl and Annie were a sweet couple, and you could really tell that they loved each other.Annie is simple; she's smart but it's not book smart but rather life smart. The only time I got frustrated with her is when she was nearing the end of her pregnancy; I was right there in Carl's corner, I understood his frustrations.It's not the greatest novel in the world, but it's entertaining. It has a lot to be desired in the ending, it being cut as short as it was, but that was because the editor felt the book was dragging on too much. It has a lot of inconstancies, unbalanced in many ways, or at least it was to me. However, I still enjoyed it as I think anyone will when all she (possibly he) want to do is some light reading."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I read this book many many years ago. I believe it made me fall in love. I have been looking to find it e-book form so I can put this on my e-reader but I can't find it, I still have my copy and I want to pass it on but not until I get the e-book.This story is about true love of two young people, Annie and Carl and their struggles. It is set in Brooklyn, where I was born and raised so I was able to relate.Just thinking about this book brings a longing to read it again, I guess I know what I will be doing tonight.The movie they made from this book stared Richard Chamberlain and Tuesday Weld, they were just adorable, I would love to see the movie again too."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This is the story of Carl and Annie.

I was thrilled to discover this new edition and am enjoying the novel all over again. It definitely holds up!"},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"I finished this book not but two minutes ago and am in awe over the magical journey it took me on. This book is definitely a Betty Smith classic, and is simaliar to A Tree Grows In Brooklyn in many ways. The main character, Annie, has a very unique and presice personality. Very unpredictable, yet always does something you would expect the character to do. The other characters, including Carl, Henry, and the Dean came to life in my mind and seemed as real as my next door neighboor. The book was very believable and I felt compassion towards the characters and all the struggles they faced incluing money, pregnancy, in-laws, marriage, college, and many others. The plot was interesting and suspensful. I wanted to see what Annie was going to do next, if Carl was going to get a job. Smith is an expert writer, and as I said about A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, if she kept on writing about the Browns I would keep on reading. I was disappointed when it ended, but satisfied at the same time because I had enjoyed the story so much. I highly reccomend this novel! I guarantee you will fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"Okay, I picked this book up at my local library because it was relatively short, set in the 1920's, about a young couple, and I'd heard only good things about her other novels... all good so far. However, I was disappointed at the outcome. Like some other readers, I found Annie annoying, childlike (not in a good way), and hard to identify with. She was very unpolished and uneducated. I know this was because of her background and it is, of course, 1927, but I could not relate to these circumstances at all. Carl's lack of leadership, financial responsibility, and quick temper made me dislike him also. I would have liked to see the characters curb these disagreeable qualities more at the end of the story. Now for the good. The story went in the right direction. I like the concept of two young people marrying young and overcoming their obstacles; the plot outline was good. The characterization was good, too,and I was thoroughly convinced of their true love. Overall I would encourage others to read this novel. I look forward to reading her other novels soon."},{"Title":"Joy in the Morning","review":"This is a sweet novel that is somewhat reminiscent of the author's seminal work, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". The author appears to have drawn heavily from her own life when penning this novel, which is about Annie, an eighteen year old girl born on the wrong side of the tracks, who in 1927 moves from Brooklyn to the Midwest to marry her sweetheart, Carl, who is a law school student.The book describes the trials and tribulations that the young newlyweds undergo during their first year of marriage. Money woes, in-law problems, and pregnancy are some of the issues with which the newly weds must contend. Annie is also an aspiring writer who lacks confidence in her abilities due to her lack of education. The newly weds discover a great deal about themselves as a couple, and Annie gains new insight into her writing talent.While the book can be a bit treacly, as well as sentimental, in parts and lacks the grittiness of \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", fans of the author will, nonetheless, enjoy it."},{"Title":"Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1","review":"This past summer, I had the good fortune to review &quot;Aces Wild: The Race For Mach 1&quot; for the publisher. To say that this book will generate controversy would be far too mild. This remarkable book will rock much of the old Air Force establishment back on their heels. What author and former test pilot Al Blackburn has done here is to shatter the fifty one year old cover-up that placed Chuck Yeager on an exalted pedestal and denied another, even greater hero, his due acclaim as the first man to fly through the sound barrier. Up to now, George Welch (heir to the grape juice fortune) has not received any credit for his bold feat. Welch managed to get airborne in his P-40 fighter at Pearl Harbor, shooting down four Japanese attackers, and would eventually be credited with 16 victories. In early October, 1947 Welch took up the North American XP-86 Sabre up on its maiden flight, and on his own, dove the Sabre prototype through the much ballyhooed sound barrier weeks before Yeager pushed the Bell XS-1 (X-1) past Mach one. Not only did Welch beat Yeager, he did it more than once before Yeager's mythical record flight.Blackburn weaves the stories of Welch and Yeager together with the excitement of the most dramatic era of aviation since the Wrights teetered off the launch rail at Kittyhawk. The reader is introduced to a facinating cast of characters and can feel the tension of the unofficial race for speed, won by Welch and the Sabrejet only to be buried as a political expedient by the Secretary of the Air Force.Even before being released, NASA and the Air Force are buzzing about Blackburn's book. If the aviation reader were to buy only one book this year, &quot;Aces High&quot; is that book. Don't miss it. It is this years best treat in aviation writing."},{"Title":"Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1","review":"Regarding the one reviewer's (Matt's) point that Blackburn's evidence is from biased sources; yes, they are &quot;biased&quot; in the sense that they were people who worked in the North American Aviation F-86 program and are telling us (finally) what went on over there and when it happened. That does not make these individuals liars. &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, &quot;The Quest for Mach 1&quot;, and other writings were clearly biased to the Bell Aviation personnel's view of the world. These two &quot;camps&quot; which existed out at Muroc (Edwards) simultaneously were intentionally kept separate and had little or no contact. Therefore it is only reasonable and proper to get the information from each of them. The problem is that none of the earlier writings on breaking the sound &quot;barrier&quot; covered both camps. Thus, up until now, the world only has read and heard one side of the story, the &quot;official&quot; side according to Washington D.C. officialdom.My father-in-law is Larry Greene. He appears several times in Blackburn's book. Larry was North American's chief aerodynamicist, in charge of the F-86's groundbreaking design, particularly the &quot;swept wing&quot; design. He was with North American for about 20 years, rising to Vice President before leaving shortly after the Rockwell merger.I don't know much about aviation, but I do know this man. I have known him since 1981, and I believe him. Larry says the F-86 with Welch in the cockpit went Mach 1 before Yeager and the X-1. He may not have been in the cockpit, but when I recently read the paragraph to him where Welch has the conversation with him and &quot;Stormy&quot;, where Welch asks about putting the Sabre into a dive from 35,000 feet, Larry piped up &quot;I told him to do it!&quot;.Not being an aviation buff myself, in the past I would sometimes confuse Larry's work with the Bell X-1 project. After all, he had worked on early supersonic aircraft, and the X-1 was all I had learned about in school and at the movies. My wife and I actually rented &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; once when he and Terry were visiting. As we watched the movie, he grew noticeably grumpy and irritated at it. I didn't understand why. I thought he would like to see the events surrounding his career glamorized on screen.This was years ago, and when I pressed him a bit, he muttered something like &quot;we were ready to go supersonic before them, but the politicians held us back&quot;. I didn't get the &quot;we vs. them&quot; reference and I wrote it off to old age grumpiness. Later, on other occassions, he would make similar comments if the subject ever came up, sometimes venturing a little further and basically saying &quot;we beat them&quot;. I never &quot;got it&quot; until I read Blackburn's book. Unfortunately, Larry is now of an advanced age which makes detailed discussion impossible.Larry is from a generation that knew how to keep a secret. Even 20 or 30 years after the events, I feel he was honoring his word not to discuss the Sabre's early test flights. In retrospect I can see it bubbling up. I can now understand his irritation at all the glory accorded Yeager and the Bell X-1 team. Finally, now, in his waning years, when presented with the words in publication, he is willing to acknowledge the truth. He actually seems relieved to be able to acknowledge it.The publication of Blackburn's book may cause aviation historians to long debate who went Mach 1 first, and others may ask &quot;who cares&quot;. I am neither a historian nor an aviation expert, but I consider myself a pretty good judge of character. If Larry Greene tells me the Sabre went Mach 1 on those early test flights, then that's good enough for me and it's what my boys will learn.As for the general public, I believe we would do them a service if all references to the X-1 &quot;breaking the sound barrier&quot; were henceforth followed with an asterisk. That asterisk would lead them to the remarkable story of the remarkable team that developed a remarkable jet, the NAA F-86 Sabrejet. This shouldn't take away from the achievements of the Bell people, including Chuck Yeager; it should just lay out both sides of the story.Oh, by the way, I thought it was a fun book to read, aside from the supersonic issues.Pierre Redmond predmond@qcandy.com"},{"Title":"Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1","review":"What a find -- a terrific read, an interesting poke at one of our most cherished icons, and a wonderful reminiscence about the \\"golden age of test flight.\\" Mr. Blackburn presents two main ideas in this book -- first, the legendary Chuck Yeager may not have been the first person to pass through the equally legendary sound barrier, and second, the need for public support for flight research dictated the credits for this accomplishment. The author test piloted for North American Aviation, which produced the XP-86 Sabrejet (discussed later), so he has singular credentials and credibility. His research seems reasonably well done, with personal, primary, and backup sources.The first person to become supersonic may well have been North American test pilot George Welch, in the superb new XP-86 fighter prototype. Welch may have jetted past Mach 1 several times before Gen. Yeager's immortalized flight (this takes little away from Yeager, who doubtlessly never felt Welch was first. The author also pays the obligatory adulations to Yeager's skills, although I doubt Mr. Yeager has bought Mr. Blackburn many drinks to celebrate this book). The author gives three reasons to suggest Welch was first. To begin with, the XP-86 aircraft was certainly capable of Mach 1+ (in a shallow dive), and Welch's skill and aggressiveness were up to it, too. Second, although the government gave Welch's team strict orders to let Yeager's Air Force team go first, Welch often cared neither a fiddle nor a fig about such orders. Finally, witnesses heard Welch's sonic booms several times before Yeager's.So why didn't anyone investigate the legitimacy of the claims for Welch and the XP-86 when the flights were performed? The author implies things worked out as they did for three reasons. First, breaking the sound barrier became a vast potential gold mine of publicity, and the \\"powers that be\\" wanted this publicity mined for purposes they would determine. Supporters of the brand new Air Force wanted the prestige. Furthermore, tremendous effort had gone into developing specialized research planes like the X-1, and few wanted to see the experimental aircraft program be swept into insignificance by a relatively non-exotic fighter -- the sonic boom was to announce a revolution, not a progression. Even North American later joined that revolution with its own magnificent X-15. Second, about the time the sound barrier was \\"broken,\\" aviation became very expensive, and progress depended upon public acceptance of the required effort. Therefore, aviation wanted a good publicist, and Yeager proved almost ideal. His confident charm seemed likely to pluck the funding right straight out of a politician's tight but awestruck fists. By contrast, George Welch was a fine young man and a superb pilot, but his speaking and social skills seemed, uh, marginal compared to Yeager's. Recruitment and public support for aviation probably benefitted from Yeager sitting atop the supersonic food chain. Finally, neither Welch nor North American made a big deal of the purported accomplishment (especially since it was forbidden by the top brass), and Welch was tragically killed testing an aircraft not long after these flights. At any rate, he did not keep complete data records for these surreptitious flights, so his methods (having witnesses listen to his sonic booms) were anecdotal. In my opinion, Welch's accomplishment, no matter how possible, is speculative, and Yeager' X-1 still indisputably claims the first properly documented piloted supersonic flight.Not that it matters so much. The author agrees the first supersonic flight turned out to be little more than an inspirational but dangerous adventure, and even for aviation, the publicity-to-direct-benefit ratio was high. The first supersonic flight, like the first Everest climb, was immensely uplifting but hasn't put food on our tables any faster or better. Few people will experience supersonic flight or an Everest climb, but if the stories about the first ones don't cheer your spirit, you should check to see if you can become excited about anything.Mr. Blackburn does far more than advance these ideas, however. With a test pilot's brassy style, he has crafted a genuinely interesting book about one of the most colorful chapters in aviation history, when dangerous and challenging aircraft filled the skies over America's test ranges and when computers weren't around to lower the danger but soften the adventure.The book has unfortunate ommissions. Although the author was a North American test pilot for may years and was granted access to first-source files, he documents these sources poorly in the Bibliography. Regrettably, he tells little about his company, which was an exceptionally productive jewel in aviation's crown. For example, would aviation have benefitted if publicity from the first supersonic flight enabled North American to survive? I hope this superb author will write more about this magnificent corporation, which eventually fell on hard times and became mergered out of existence. Sadly, Mr. Blackburn feels the irreplaceable files he used for this book face an uncerain near-term future and may soon just get tossed into the trash by their new corporate owners.A well-written, fascinating, controversial book, a chance to see how history and progress can be shaped by publicity and the need for the right hero, and a great gift idea for an aviation nut who has everything."},{"Title":"Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1","review":"I first must say that I found out about this book from long time family friend, Neal Scott(NAA Eng., Muroc) and was presented a copy of the book by my cousin Blaine Murray (P-38 recon pilot Italy USAAF).

When I asked him what he knew about the XP-86 vs the X-1 he told me it was true from what he had heard in his many project stays at Edwards AFB. A second friend who is a retired navy pilot told me the following story: His squadron was flying FJ-1's (the navalized version of the F-86) and were given a tour of North American Aviation's production facility in 1955 to pre-view the up coming FJ-2's and 3's.

Robert Kempel makes it clear with forensic evidenceIt's unbelievable how far and wide this myth has spread, but it makes for a good talking point around symposiums, airports, and hangars. All one need do is to insert key words on the subject into Google and we can read many authoritative dissertations about how a J35 underpowered XP-86 achieved supersonic flight before the XS-1, but the writers never say which engine powered the airplane--it's always,apparently, assumed to be a J47. Ad infinitum the tale goes on or so it seems.In Robert Kempel's book, he has the historical record straight contrary to the opinions based on false information re Blackburn's book concerning the supersonic capabilities of the XP-86 from October through December 1947.Al Blackburn's fictional book that the first prototype XP-86 achieved supersonic speed as early as 1 October 1947 is a myth. Robert Kempel's book dispels this myth through the presentation of documented facts concerning the physical attributes and limitations of the airplane (generally neglected by historians and writers), logical flight-test objectivity and sound test techniques, and with supporting 1947 North American Aviation's own documented flight-test data.With an objective view of the fledgling 1947 XP-86, I think that with the historical record presented, Mr. Kempel's (NOT Al Blackburn's BOOK ABOVE) book replaces vague anecdotal extrapolation, the documentation dispels speculation, and the conspiracy theorists legend is swept away to reveal a far more accurate and informative, but less romantic, picture of what really happened at Muroc Air Force Base in 1947 between the XS-1 and XP-86 than has ever before been available."},{"Title":"Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1","review":"Blackburn certainly makes an interesting point by questioning Chuck Yeager's record of being the first to fly supersonic, but not necessarily a strong one. The evidence is compelling but the witnesses all are from subjective or biased postions.

I highly recommend this guide book and used it extensively, while travelling in England and Scotland.When I first got off the plane and ended up at the airport, I made the mistake of making a hotel reservation through the Thomas Cook booth at the train station. That was a mistake. The next day, I pulled out my LP guide, and found a hotel down the street that was half the price, and it was cleaner, and nicer to boot. From that moment onwards, I was hooked on LP guides.Since I was travelling solo, and had a rail pass, I pretty much decided where I wanted to go when I woke up each morning. I would find a hotel when it started to get dark. When that would happen, I would pull out this guide, and find a place to stay.Recommended."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Britain (Britain, 4th ed)","review":"My husband bought me this book before we went to Britain for our honeymoon.

Other activities on the 1400 acres are cattle, barley, wheat, oats, potatoes, turnips, etc. At ten he was driving an Alvis Speed Twenty in addition to tractors and an Austin Seven. At Crimond in North East Scotland on June 16, 1956 he drove his very first car race behind the wheel of a DKW \\"sonderklasse\\" finishing 8th. He won his next 4 races. (By the way, the first I car I ever drove was a 50 dollar DKW.) He then drove Sunbeam, Porsche 1600S, D-Jaguar, Triumph TR3 until 12/26/58 when he drove a Lotus Elite for Colin Chapman and hit the big time. Other highlights are 1960: At the LeMans 24 hr race, Clark drove an Aston Martin DBR1 to 3rd overall, while 6 Ferrari 250s finished 1-2, and 4-7. 1962: In March Daytona500 winner Fireball Roberts let Clark borrow his Pontiac for practice laps at Daytona. In October, Clark borrowed Taylor's 175bhp Lotus-Climax for 100 practice laps at Indy with a fastest lap of 143. Dan Gurney convinced Chapman to extend the Lotus 25 to 8 feet (Indy minimum) and convinced Ford to build an aluminum 4.2 litre Fairlane V8 351bhp. 1963: In March at the Ford proving ground 5 mile oval in Kingman, Arizona, Gurney and Clark did 165mph laps in the Lotus 25. After adding longer outside wishbones and 6 fuel tanks to meet the 50 gal. minimum both qualified in front of 200,000 spectators ten days before the race. \\"The middle of the second row of the starting grid, all around me were these giant cars. When all 33 cars were sorted out, I was well back in the field, about 11th, there was nothing but smoke, dust and the roar of engines. I found myself behind Gurney for a few laps watching to see how we were to pass these monsters and after about 30 laps I set out after the leader Parnelli Jones with his Offenhauser AJ Watson Special. I could get quite a drag on the straights but the big cars took up an awful lot of road in the turns and I had great difficulty in getting past. When Parnelli went in I found myself leading. I did make a dive for fuel and tires and back in the race I was 50 seconds behind Jones. I was knocking off a second per lap. Parnelli was with the yellow lights when the time came round for his second and third stops. I came within 4 seconds of him, there was smoke from his car and oil appeared making the track very slippery. I felt sure he wouldn't finish. I was happy to finish second.\\" Later in 1963 Clark became the youngest ever Grand Prix World Champion with the Lotus25. He also came within a few laps of winning the 1962 and 1964 World Championships. In 1965 he became the only ever to win both in the same year, winning the Indy 500 with the Lotus 38 as we sat in the Paramount theatre with closed circuit television, which we did every year on Memorial day while Chris Economaki provided the entertainment. In 1966 Clark finished 2nd to Graham Hill at Indy. He raced in an era when race cars were works of art and victory went to the most skillful, not to the one in the most technologically advanced machine, before the evolution of safety standards spearheaded in great part by Jackie Stewart. More of Clark can be seen in the dvd Grand Prix that covers the 1966 season. He is in first row car#4 British racing green Lotus 33 at the Monaco GP. Begining 12/21/66, I attended this film 5 times at the Cooper Cinerama. Starring Jim Clark with co-stars Jim Garner (Pete Aron) wearing Chris Amon's Honda Helmet, and 3 other actors: Scott Stoddard borrows Jackie Stewart's BRM helmet, Jean Sarti wears John Surtees Ferrari helmet and Nino Barlini wears Lorenzo Bandini's Ferrari helmet. In 1961 the first of 3 Super Cinerama theatres was built on Colorado blvd in Denver which was considered the finest venue to view a Cinerama film, now the site of a Barnes and Noble Bookstore. The movie Grand Prix won 3 Academy Awards for Best Effects, Best Editing and Best Sound in 1967. Since then I have been to 20 Formula One races and the 2006 Indy500. Be sure to check out the Eddie Rickenbacker memorial in the Speedway Museum and take the tour bus around the 2 mile oval. An excellent Indy500 film is Mickey Rooney's Big Wheel that covers the 1949 race."},{"Title":"The Breathwork Experience: Exploration and Healing in Nonordinary States of Consciousness","review":"Kylea Taylor's beautiful little book (135 pages of text, expanded with Appendices)is a labor of love, and a testimony to her devotion to the work of Stanislov and Christina Grof.

The short descriptions of experiences of amazing healing and remission of symptoms, and relative freedom from unwanted recurring behavior patterns are compelling. As a breath-worker myself, I longed for the text to live up to the overly-expansive title.

The thinkers of that age had a sizable impact on concepts of science, nature, politics, religion and society. How do we become immersed in the wealth of writing of that period, however, without giving up job and family in order to read the works of the Enlightenment authors?This reader is an excellent book for novices and experienced readers alike. It is an excellent 600+ page book filled with short, pithy excerpts from the key thinkers of the period. Actually the writings go back as far as 1620 with an excerpt from Francis Bacon where he puts down the Greek philosophers and introduces what is to become the scientific method. Beccaria comes up with novel thinking on crime and punishment. Does the death penalty deter crime? How about the punishment fitting the crime instead of being meted out at the whim of some aristocrat?Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau and Paine weigh in with their political philosophy. The skeptics speak up with their religious criticisms. Manners, morals, art, war, and gender and race issues are all discussed by the likes of Mary Wollstonecraft, David Hume, Reynolds, Pope, and Bentham.Bite sized as these entries are, they give the flavor of Enlightenment thought. And, importantly for the general reader, they are all mentally digestible. You don't have to read every paragraph six times in order to get a glimmer of the authors' meanings. The represented authors are not just from France either. The best thinkers from France, Italy, Germany, the United States and Great Britain are represented."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"More than forty years ago, when I was a college undergraduate, I ran across several lists books that were recommended reading for anyone who wanted to be truly educated. Those lists invariably included books such as Rousseau's \\"The Social Contract,\\" The Federalist Papers, Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" and many other writings from the Enlightenment era (as well, of course, as other time periods). I dutifully noted the titles, and, wanting to consider myself an educated person, fully intended to read all of them.Well now I'm 62, and it's time for me to admit that I'm almost certainly never going to read \\"The Social Contract.\\" This volume is for me and others like me, who are suffering from the \\"So Many Books, So Little Time\\" syndrome. The book contains a broad selection of writings from the major thinkers of the Enlightenment, which the editor defines roughly from the 1680's to the 1790's.What a marvelous time it must have been to be an intellectual! The barriers erected by the authority of the kings, priests, and classical writers were being shattered. The ability to ask new questions and propose new answers produced an almost intoxicating sense of infinite possibilities for the improvement - even the perfection - of human society.Some of the pieces in this book will seem hopelessly naive to our modern cynical minds; on the other hand, some of the points being made so excitedly and even belligerently are now taken for granted - and we are likely to read them and say, \\"What's the big deal? Everyone knows that.\\" And then there are the debates about the most fundamental questions - such as the source of knowledge - that have yet to be resolved, and probably never will be.If you read this, you will almost certainly get caught up in the excitement of the exploration of the ideas. You will almost certainly have your own thoughts stimulated, and your own opinions challenged.And you can smugly pretend that you have read Roussseau, Locke, Hume, Kant, and Voltaire - and no one (except real scholars) will be the wiser."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"The Age of Enlightenment, the Rise of Science, the art, and literature of the eighteenth century has always been an interest of mine. So you can imagine how amazed and elated I was when I came across this gold.It has all the big enlightenment writers such as Voltaire, Diderot, Leibniz, Paine, Addison, Pope, Montesqieu, Franklin and many more. It gives a great run down of the wit, the result of the evolution of thought, politics, society and reason as seen in the words of these great minds.The only thing that I didn't like about this is that there is no Hobbes, which is only a minor quibble. I just thought that since there is Descates, who is not of the eighteenth century enlightenment (17th century and dryer than dust), but a major influence (like Hobbes was included, Hobbes, who was a major link from Descartes to Locke should be included and the provacative and ENLIGHTENING words from The Leviathan should grace the pages of this indispensible book and yet another superb volume from the Viking Portable Library."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"Editor Isaac Kramnick describes the Enlightenment as \\"an age when intellectuals eagerly wrote for the wider audience of new readers, not yet having become alienated from the philistine public in a posture of romantic weariness.\\" This book offers many of the most influential Enlightenment texts. It is a pleasure to read the earnest, excited, hopeful and well-intended thoughts the Enlightenment directly from their original source. The book has substantial drawbacks, but it is well worth reading.First a look at the positive. Most of the writings selected in this book are important, and editor Isaac Kramnick's introduction is insightful, albeit with a narrow focus (more on that below). The selections are grouped non-chronologically by theme and include on average four-page citations from the more influential writings of a given author, allowing the reader to get some feeling for the author without having to read the entirety of the original sources. Kramnick starts each selection with two sentences about its origin, date and significance. The original texts are probably all available free on the internet, but then the reader would have to find the juicy bits by him or herself, so it would be much more work to get an overview.The selections of materials offer much to learn. The reader comes directly to the text where John Locke calls for the separation of Church and State or where Adam Smith invokes the invisible hand. It is fascinating to read seminal texts, such as Kant's reasoning leading to his categorical imperative. I particularly liked a selected poem from Alexander Pope (p255) that conveys both the thinking and the excitement of the times, including hero worship of Newton, and a poem from Bernard Mandeville, \\"The Fable of the Bees\\", on the economic benefits of self-interest. Also fascinating is an anonymous selection from 1792 which describes French revolutionaries propagating their doctrinal morals (e.g., \\"reason guides us and enlightens us\\"), using symbols such as fasces, and replacing the Christian icons in the sanctuary of Notre Dame Cathedral with a statue of the \\"Goddess of Reason\\". The ceremony ended when \\"All took the oath to live in freedom or to die.\\" Kramnick shows how the principles of economic laissez-faire, free trade and governmental non-intervention in the marketplace were proposed by Quesnay and Turgot, many years before Adam Smith did. The reader also sees the hard limits of how enlightening the Age of Enlightenment was, such as when Hume, Jefferson, Kant and Rousseau (among others) rationalise misogynist and/or racist attitudes.The selections and Kramnick's comments also show the direct intellectual influence of European Enlightenment thinkers on the founding of the USA. The Declaration of Independence (one of the selected texts) and the American Constitution are products of the Enlightenment. Kramnick points out that the first two paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence paraphrase Locke.And now some criticisms. The book claims to \\"bring together the era's classic works ... from a broad range of sources...\\". The introduction mentions in one sentence that the Enlightenment involved many countries. These beginnings are misleading. The narrow focus of this anthology is misrepresentative of the breadth and depth of the Enlightenment. Only a small number of relevant countries and their Enlightenment figures are included. What about the others? Of the 116 individual writings supposedly representative of the Enlightenment, more than 95% are British, French or American. If one includes the few selections from four Germanic writers (Kant, Leibnitz, Mozart, Frederick the Great), then the figure exceeds 98%. There are just two selections from Italians (Vico, Beccaria). It is as if nothing significant was written outside these countries. Some of the selections are not particularly significant and could have been replaced with more significant writings outside of this narrow focus.Kramnick confines the span of the Age of Enlightenment from the 1680s to the 1790s. He bases this starting time solely on English and French milestones, such as the English constitutional monarchy, Newton's Principia and the writings of Locke, Bayle and Fontonelle (all of whom had made substantial contributions before the 1680s). Earlier Enlightenment milestones go unmentioned in the introduction. There was no exact moment that the Enlightenment started, but Kramnick's starting point is like saying that the average person's day begins at noon. In the first half of the book are the two excerpts written before Kramnick's starting point: from Bacon's Novum Organum of 1620 and from Descartes's Discourse on Method of 1637. These were revolutionary and seminal. The Enlightenment, as a new movement of questioning everything in the new light of reason and empiricism, was already under way by 1648, the year when the Thirty Year's War ended and a time when many Europeans were sickened by violence in the name of religion. By the 1680s the networks of the Republic of Letters (1664), the coffee-houses (1650), and substantial smuggling of Enlightenment books from Holland (for example) were old hat. By the time Newton published his works, a vast path had been cleared for him by the heroes who were forced to push through the darkness at the dawn of the Enlightenment, inevitably making errors on the way. Newton was aware of and grateful for their gigantic work. Voltaire points out how Newton had the advantage of living after scholasticism had been largely banished.Kramnick writes that the end of the Enlightenment is \\"best linked\\" to the realisation of Enlightenment ideals \\"in the revolutionary fervor that swept through America, France and even England\\". All of these milestones focus on only three countries. What of the many others countries? Benjamin Franklin, who lived in the latter part of the Enlightenment, is featured as the sole character on the cover of a book pretending to cover key Enlightenment readings. What about those who enabled and triggered the Enlightenment, or those who battled first and at great risk to make its ideas accepted?Granted the importance of the Enlightenment and the fabulous richness of its writers, why such a narrow selection almost exclusively of writings from three countries? For example, the anthology includes David Hume's criticism of the belief in miracles, written in 1768 when such criticism was not at all original, but completely ignores the innumerable writers who confronted such beliefs more than a century beforehand. Was Kramnick following the herd of his time and delivering the goods to satisfy limited expectations? Were limited language skills a factor? Was the motivation to focus on three imperial countries to make an uncomplicated narrative understandable and pleasing to a simple audience?This misrepresentation is misleading for students and denies other Enlightenment figures their due. For those seeking to understand and appreciate the real depth and breadth of the Enlightenment, Jonathan Israel's three volume series gives an excellent view of the reality (especially \\"Revolutionary Enlightenment\\", which has changed the historical perception of the Enlightenment).Like other editions of the venerable Viking Portable Libary series, this book offers much reading at an affordable price. Viking Portables were often aimed at enthusiasts. (The first of the over 100 editions was published in 1943 to give American troops a literary anthology.) Although this particular book gives no indication of its target audience, it will certainly be more satisfying for casual enthusiasts than for scholars. Neither this book nor the other two Viking Portable Libary books that I read have an index or footnotes to the main texts. Granted how easy it is to generate an index, this is unhelpful. The introduction gives no word about how, when or by whom the original sources were edited or translated. The texts are mostly converted to modern English, with somewhat random exceptions where older English is used. The translations from French are often incorrect because they translate idioms word for word, thereby losing their meaning.As far as I have been able to determine, this is the only such collection of Enlightenment readings available. Again, despite drawbacks, this book is a good read."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"This well organized collection of extracts from Enlightenment Era thinkers is valuable on many levels. This edition does not restrict the reader to a narrow selection of French and English writers (important as they may be); it includes American, German and Italian authors and provides the reader with a sense of the scope of this important era.The anthology is divided into topical sections and the selections are important because the selected content provides readers with even the very flawed thinking of some of these great minds, particularly on matters of race and women's rights -- issues that later generations would have to tackle.The introduction is well written too. The Enlightenment Era's optimism was based upon assumptions that have not always proven too true and though the editor is certainly devoted to this great era in philosophy and political progress he is not an iconodule unwilling to present criticism of this era or honestly discuss the shortcomings of the Enlightenment Era.It is impossible to present a comprehensive understanding of anything when compiling an anthology, but this selection is a good starting point. Readers would do well, and I suspect it is the desire of the editor, to select writers of this era to enjoy in the unabridged editions of their individual works."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"The Enlightenment was the turning point that created the World as we know it. The transition from the superstition and intolerance of religious dominated society, to the modern educated (at least in theory) democratic, science based lives we enjoy today.This book is a good collection of examples of the kinds of thinking, and the free expression of those thoughts, that was impossible, and usually fatal in earlier times. Ideas that challenged the established order, and caught on like wildfire in the coffee houses and fraternal lodges where the future leaders of society gathered.There are more complete and more detailed books available, but for a broad introduction to many of the important sources of the Enlightenment phenomenon, this book is a great start."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"I assign it for class.

Only problem is that it's hard to follow.Good book"},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"I have had this in printed format for years, now in kindle. It is a quick review of enlightenment source material. In some cases, only selections from the original documents are shown; this is helpful since some of the philosphes were notoriously wordy, but if you want to go deeper this book may leave you asking about the rest of the document. Anytime someone down-selects from sources, they make interpretive decisions, and not everyone agrees with those decisions. But if you're like me, an armchair philosopher and historian, this book may be for you. If you only want to sit down for a half-hour and read a piece from Priestly or Hume, Jefferson or Franklin, Montesquieu or Voltaire, it's nice to have a good browser like this. If you need a quote, most of the quotes you need will be in these selections. If it's not, you know how to find the rest of the work. I appreciate the topical groupings because it has shown me authors who I did not know had written on a topic. It has essays, poems, even snippets from an opera. It's not a complete study on the period, but it gives you a great start with the primary sources, and is fun to browse through."},{"Title":"The Portable Enlightenment Reader (The Viking Portable Library)","review":"This was the most helpful anthology when I needed to write a research paper on seventeenth century religion.

Stick with the source documents for the \\"whole story\\"."},{"Title":"Inner Gardening: A Seasonal Path to Inner Peace","review":"This book strikes me (maybe that description is too harsh for such a book) as an informative, healing, and spiritually-thoughtful book. I felt like I was being wrapped in a glowy, enveloping, surrogate home every time I picked it up, which is more often now since I seek more comfort these days in our insecure world. The writer chronicles each month of the year in terms of gardening, so that you are doing something garden-related, even in the Winter months, when most of us are just pipe-dreaming of the first sprout of the year. There are so many ideas and so many questions the writer poses to you, many involving your inner self, that it will take some time to process it all. Luckily, you can work on these questions monthly, and pick and choose whichever month of the year you want to pore over (I couldn't resist). There are also sonnets and other literary entries by various writers, which will surely make you ponder or simply smile. This book made me take notice of all the life around me, down to the grass growing outside, and to live more in the season and the moment. You may be inspired or spurred to take action once reading this delightful book, and don't be fooled by its docile, calming nature. Great change can spring forth from such quiet contemplation. I have begun to live this truth. Maybe it will help you live a more healthy, vivacious and thoughtful life, or maybe it will just bring you home. Either way, it will certainly help you create change within yourself and your life. I think in just the small excerpts I would read at times, I would gleen some replenishing freedom for my oft-parched soul, and it is sometimes just what I needed. I hope you, too, find some freedom in just such a book. Ultimately, this is a useful book that was written to guide you through your spiritual growth AND your gardening (it doesn't get much better than that) in a way that a gardener can understand and relate to, to the molten, stormy core. I must say that there are many things in this book which I did not mention, as I am sure you will find them yourself, with your own unique perspective.

His interpretations and the posturing of OEE with factory output demonstrates the importance of reliability to the corporate bottom line. Many companies continuously ignore the importance of unlocking the hidden factory and don't realize the waste generated by ignoring OEE concepts. Mr. Hansen, in 274 pages, gives a complete and compact version that any corporate manager, by being proactive and a visionary, can utilize to change costs into profits. Reliability and OEE technologies appear to be fairly new to much of the industrial world. Mr. Hansen decribes in his book a cultural change, that if followed,will help produce a payback welcomed by any corporate institution. His writing is easy to understand by both new and old Reliability/OEE practitioners. He has written in an orderly fashion with each chapter building on, and complementing the previous. The book describes in a step by step fashion the concept of true OEE, which when practiced will unlock the hidden factory. As Mr. Hansen points out; &quot;If you are not supporting Reliability, then you are supporting failures&quot;."},{"Title":"Overall Equipment Effectiveness: A Powerful Production/Maintenance Tool for Increased Profits","review":"Improving the manufacturing plant can goes nowhere if you go blind.

I had ordered it for the OEE information (I write software that calculates OEE) and was looking for greater detail to help in my work. I have found an overall lack of consistency on how to calculate OEE but I like the practicality of Hansen's approach.There are diverse approaches to OEE that differ mainly in how to classify downtime and calculate ideal rates. Because of this diversity OEE has not been able to deliver on the promise of a generic measure to compare all factories. For some approaches all downtime is considered bad (unscheduled) except time for no demand. This means that changeovers, cleaning, preventive maintenance, etc all end up as negatives. Breaks may or may not be scheduled downtime depending on demand (breaks are a special case of slack time). Some use the maximum rate of a machine even if it would produce 100% bad product. Others like to \\"leave room\\" in their OEE so they can show improvement over time as they update procedures and equipment(!). All these approaches make 90%+ OEE impossible to achieve. Hansen's approach is fairly practical (at least as I read it) and 90%+ OEE is achievable by controlling unscheduled downtime, keeping production rates high, and maintaining high quality. I only wish his approach was more clearly explained with more detailed examples that would either confirm or contradict some of the other approaches.I was not initially interested in the maintenance and reliability chapters but have read them and found them useful as well."},{"Title":"Overall Equipment Effectiveness: A Powerful Production/Maintenance Tool for Increased Profits","review":"I read this book because the work has already started with the implementation of OEE.

He shows us how to capitalize on a very simple formula to save thousands by investing a little time and the knowledge in his book. It surprising how many do not know about OEE, so don't assume they do.The overall performance of a single piece of equipment, or even an entire factory, will always be governed by the cumulative impact of the three OEE factors: Availability , Performance Rate, and Quality Reject Rate.Availability X Performance X Quality= OEEWith the knowledge and utilization of the OEE calculation, it is common to realize greater than 40% increase in your bottom line. If you're making a profit now, just think of the opportunity. More importantly, OEE is the glue that sustains other initiatives by enabling all to clearly see where to focus, and the results of those focused efforts.

It can also be used for activities with creative non-traditional measurement activities. For example: Paper clips, hands, feet, craft sticks, shoes, beans, etc. This book can be a springboard to a thematic unit on measurement. It can be extended for study of birds, other nature studies, art experiences, and musical activities as well."},{"Title":"Inch by inch","review":"Once upon a time there was a cute, little, green inch worm hanging out on a piece of grass. One day, a robin came up to eat him, but the inch worm talked the robin into letting him measure the robin's tail. Being such a useful worm, the robin did not eat him, but took him to other birds so that they could have something measured by the smart inch worm. Finally, a nightingale told the worm to measure his song or he would eat the little inch worm. Using his little worm brain, the inch worm began measuring the song until he had inched away to safety.This wonderful book, written and illustrated by Leo Lionni, won the Caldecott Honor in 1961. He has taken a little worm and made the reader fall in love with it through the worm's usefulness in measuring and his cunning ability to escape the hungry nightingale. Even though there are many different scenes, with many various shades of green on them, Lionni has illustrated the little worm in such a way that the reader can always point him out. Children would enjoy finding the worm on each page, especially at the end of the book when he is hiding from the nightingale. Also, we always see the story from an outside perspective; eye level with the grass. It is as if we are another small animal looking in on the story.The background of each page is pretty much the same. All Lionni has illustrated on each page is the worm and the other details that are needed during that part of the story. For example, while the inch worm is measuring the legs of the heron, Lionni has only portrayed the heron with the worm inching down its leg. I think this technique is good for younger audiences because it helps children focus on the story and keeps their attention for more specific details. This also makes sense because there is a small portion of text to read on each page which means the audience does not have much time to look at the illustrations while the reader is reading to them. As for colors, Lionni has kept them realistic. For example, the flamingo is a bright pink whereas the nightingale's colors are calmer. Overall, the colors in the book make the readers feel at ease and calm. The dull greens of the grass and the open, white background keeps the reader moving along at a steady pace. It's almost as if we know that the inch worm is going to outsmart the different birds and there is no need to get over-excited.Lionni has intertwined the illustrations and the text in a way that they are dependent on each other. Although you could get the gist of the story by either reading the text or looking at the pictures, by having the illustrations support the text, the reader gets a more detailed, visual story. However, Lionni leaves room for the imagination to add on to the story at any time.Overall, I loved this book. Lionni has creatively illustrated this cute story, making children and adults want to read it over and over again.If you are looking for instructional ideas, I would read this story to students in primary grades before doing a lesson on measuring. Then I would have students measure different things around the classroom including themselves. I would also use this book when talking about different types of art. I would have children do a collage or make something with decoupage. They could even re-create a scene from the book!"},{"Title":"Inch by inch","review":"This is the story of one very smart little inchworm. As the story begins, he is about to be an addition to a robin's meal as the robin is hungry and the little inch was quite available. But unfortunately for the robin, this was one fast thinking little worm and he convinces the robin that he is a very useful creature. He offers to measure the robin's tail. Of course the robin is quite impressed (he found that his tail was five inches long, which pleased him greatly) so he takes the little worm to the other birds.And so the measuring begins; a flamingo's neck, a toucan's beak, legs of a heron and a pheasant's tail. This goes on until the nightingale arrives and demands that his song be measured or he will eat the little inchworm. Is disaster about to befall the little green guy? How on earth do you measure a nightingale's song? Is our little measuring worm about to become a meal and is there no escape?Well folks, you have to remember that this little worm is a bright little worm and his thinking ability under pressure certainly surpasses mine! All ends well, but you will have to read the story of how the singing bird was outwitted.Of course this Caldecott award wining author has not slacked off on this illustrations one bit. They are as colorful, as original and playful as any of his other work. The combination of Lionni's words, story telling skills, ability to simplify the complex and his beautiful art work are truly amazing. I am not sure how he was able to sustain his high quality output over the years, but he certainly pulled it off.This little work is ideal for the classroom or personal library. There are so many lessons to be learned here...thinking fast not being the least. Measuring, counting activities, nature studies, art...really, what you can accomplish as to teaching with this little work is only limited by your personal experiences and imagination.I will admit to being rather delighted with anything to do with inchworms. I spent hours as a child seeking them out at watching them inch their way through their small part of the world. I have to admit that as a old man now, I seldom pass one by without stopping to watch which has made me late for quite a number of lunches and appointments over the years...which you can tell really worries me.Recommend this one highly for the little ones. It is a pure joy to read it to them and the delight in the colors and in many cases, trying to find the little inchworm.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Inch by inch","review":"One of my favorite 5 bookes was Inch by Inch by Leo Lionni.

You just will love any book by Leo Lionni. He was one the great writers of our time."},{"Title":"Inch by inch","review":"Leo Lionni has a sensitive heart to catch tiny creature's world for the readers to see and in INCH BY INCH, the seemingly vulnerable inchworm has relied on his usefulness and intellects to beat the odds of his own survival game. Delightful and surprising as usual, the story starts when the inchworm is about to be gobbled up by the robin. As in Aesop's Fable (THE LION & THE MOUSE), the smart prey persuades powerfully to the predator why it would be a mistake to eat him, \\"I am an inchworm. I am useful. I measure things.\\" Curiosity comes to the robin's eyes, and after the inchworm measures his tail to be five inches long, the impressed robin spares his life. Put the inchworm's talent into good use, the robin takes him to measure many other things - flamingo neck, toucan's beak, the heron leg and the whole hummingbird. In the end, another crisis strikes that a nightingale also asks the inchworm to measure the immeasurable - his beautiful song. The nightingale may have a great voice but not much of a brain and the inchworm agrees to measure, inch by inch until ....the peril is behind him. An applaud for the inchworm and this remarkable book; though the hero is small (Where is the worm? The kids will look for the emerald inchworm on every page), his adventure is great."},{"Title":"Inch by inch","review":"My daughter brought this home from school.It's a cute little story about an inch worm who gets out of being eaten by offering to measure stuff for the birds.

What to do?The art work is good and my daughter did look it over.At first she was so-so to the story as she didn't understand how the inchworm measured.

I just didn't want to loose these wonderful characters that I have been introduced to in this book. Cal's family was great! I really cried when Jane had to be mean to them to make them dislike her. How hard it must have been for her when she really liked them so.But more than the tears this book gave me so much laughter. I laughed out loud in so many scenes especially the ones at heartache mountain after Jane started living with cal's mom and grandma. And fights between Cal and Jane were hilarious especially the fight over marshmallow cereals.Although the beginning of the story didn't seem real to me but still unreality was excused on the account of the hilarious situation it created when Jane tried to act like a classy hooker!The secondary romance between Cal's parents was refreshing. How two people living with each other for 37 years can hold so much resentment for each other? If it doesn't come out, it keeps growing. And when it comes out it hurts lot. That is why so many couples get divorce after 20-25 years of marriage, because they just can't keep their resentment inside any longer. But the way they made up and tried to live their life together all over again was sweet! Thumbs up to SEP for giving love and hope to so many couples who just can't take it anymore!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I am a big SEP fan and this is the book that got me started.

Ms. Phillips is the expert at humorous romance and this book had me in stiches. I've never laughed so hard reading a book before. Dr. Jane Darlington and Cal Bonner have got to be some of the wildest, most interesting characters I have ever read about. So the story line is a tinsy bit hard to believe... it doesn't matter. Ms. Phillips brings her work alive and keeps you reading late into the night. Her plot was interesting and all of the twists and turns it took held me right until the last word. Jane and Cal are so fun to read about that you simply can not put this book down. I just love Ms. Phillips' special combination of laughter and tears- it is the perfect combination and makes her books winners. Her characters are special individuals with amazing stories and lovely lives. There are some highly origional scenes in this book.

SEP never fails to deliver! &quot;Nobody's Baby But Mine,&quot; is a real tear-jerker. Dr. Jane Darlington desperately wants a child, but she's a brainy physicist who thinks she's a sexual dud. Au contraire! Jane meets Cal Bonner, or more specifically, targets Cal Bonner to be the unwitting father of her child. Who would have thought that America's top physicist and a football player would get together? At first, I found Cal to be very juvenile because of his preference for young brainless women, but the reader will discover the reason behind his silly preference and it really just makes you laugh. This, along with other incidents add humour to the story. Although Cal seems brash and inconsiderate towards Jane, I think that he loved her almost from the start. There was definitely an attraction! It was just a matter of revealing truths and growing to trust each other. I've read &quot;Noboby's Baby But Mine,&quot; about three or four times. This surely predicates a great novel!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Only SEP is this original. This is my favorite in the 'Chicago Stars' series. I just love Cal. And Jane is the perfect woman for him to argue with! The story is VERY original. The book is full of wonderful characters, laugh-out-loud dialogue, and perfect lovers. It has SEP's trademark humor AND emotion. You will love it...it is absolutely her best work yet! (FYI: You'll be introduced to Kevin Tucker, the hero of SEP's February 2001 release. The heroine is Molly Sommerville from IT HAD TO BE YOU.)"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Like another reader, I read the sequel to this book first. It didn't matter, because as with all of SEP's books I thoroughly enjoyed it. Apart from the clever plot and interesting characters, SEP included some keen insights into male/female relationships that were alternately maddening and hilarious. The characters were so interesting and endearing (especially Annie) that I hated for the book to end. It was also fun to read about the current status of characters introduced in earlier books (Bobby Tom Denton, Phoebe Calebow, et al). As another reader noted, I'd like to see a follow up book with Kevin Tucker as the main character."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I really hated the first 1/3rd of the book. The only character who wasn't immoral was Kevin Tucker. All the other secondary characters were just plain sad or dispicable. As for the main characters Jane and Cal - Yikes! Cal is a jerk. It's totally understandable that he is furious with Jane but to want to destroy the mother of his future child is not only stupid it's also not a character trait you want to see in a leading man. He also shows his stupidity by not protecting himself while having sex with a potential wacko groupie with some unknown agenda. Yet the fact that he had unprotected sex is never mentioned again. He certainly never assigns himself any blame. Then there is the \\"genius\\" Jane. If she had any smarts, she certainly didn't show it in the first third of the book. She's a researcher but when it comes to genetics or sperm banks or Cal Bonner she doesn't do any research. First of all, even I , a simple engineer knows that genetics can be a real crap shoot. The probability of having genius offspring is incredibly small no matter who the parents are. Also, men who donate to sperm banks come from many different backgrounds - not just med students. Finally, if Jane was so concerned with the sperm donor's intelligence why didn't she do any research into Cal's background (besides health history). Jane's actions simply made no sense.The other thing that I hated about the first part of the book were the two sex scenes. They were brutal and sad and really made me despise both Cal and Jane.It was not a good beginning for a book. The only thing that kept me reading was that I really liked \\"Heaven Texas\\" and \\"It Had To Be You\\". So I kept reading and along about page 175 or so an amazing thing happened. The book actually began to get really good. Jane developed a backbone and Cal lightened up. The interactions between Cal and Jane became warm and funny. The secondary characters were good (with some real depth) and some of the situations had me laughing out loud. By the end of the book I had no trouble believing that Jane and Cal would have a good marriage and be decent parents.So, how do I rate this book? Well, the first 1/3 gets zero stars and the last 2/3 gets 4.5 stars. Overall - 3 stars."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This book won a lot of prizes, including the RITA or RWA's. But for me, it was boring and irritating. I couldn't find the sexual tension or the humour I was expecting in a SEP's novel.The beginning was directly offensive. A woman used as a whore and treated like a present, a 'thing' not a person. It's highly unbelievable that any woman who wants to be pregnant hopes for her child to be a little bit stupid. On the other hand, professional sportsmen are not so easy to trick, there are hundreds of women trying to catch them and their money. Sure they don't rush and marry anybody just because of a pregnancy. From what outdated Regency cave has SEP taken that idea?And then he practically imprisons her in a terribly decorated house in the Great Smoky Mountains.Well, I liked the landscapes. And Annie, the old woman with such clear ideas about everything. And Amber Lynn, who is sick of being the perfect doormat for her asinine husband.But the rest of the characters are irritating. Cal's a yelling brute. Shall we suppose we're in love when we find somebody to yell at and he/she yells back? Jane is exactly the same idiot, tacky dressed woman with no brain as many of her other novels. Perhaps SEP doesn't know somebody with a high IQ to inspire her in creating her.I was bored in page 75 and I had to make an effort to finish it. It ends with a bizarre / very uncomfortable / unbelievable scene.So if you are a seppie, sure, you should read it. But if you are not, don't expect a great love history. That way you will not be disappointed with the book."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I liked what some reviewers didn't: her bad behavior at the beginning of the story, and his explosive temper. She could more than hold her own, which was what made their relationship work for me.

Five stars because the characters and dialogue are great, the book zips along, and it's FUNNY.

That particular scene in the book had me laughing for days and I still chuckle when I think about it. This book is definitely a must read. It has many laughs and the characters are lovable.

He seemed unforgiving toward Jane, this is true, but he was entitled to it in my opinion. He hadn't even wanted to sleep with her when he thought she was a hooker and she tricked him. He was wronged and I didn't blame him for being bitter since his choices were taken away - no one likes that. I enjoyed how both characters developed thoughout the book because of their experiences together. She mellowed out, not being so uptight and dignified all the time. He finally had someone he can be himself with. I think Jane dealt with his overbearing issues quite well. Cal's mentality may have been a bit old-fashioned (though, how many old fashioned men would have let you hang out with their competitive enemies?) he was charming nonetheless. This book is not to be missed. After this one, read Dream a Little Dream, Cal's brother Gabe's book, which is another great story. Gotta love those Bonners."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This book is by far one of SEP's best! It will definately keep you laughing the whole time. Jane and Cal are probably two of my favorite characters of SEP. If you have never been one to laugh out loud while reading a romane then I suggest you read this book, because I was on the city bus while reading the funniest part of the the book and people were looking at me like I grew a second head, I was laughing so hard. Believe me you will be fast on you way to reading all her books after this one. SEP's books are quite addictive, and you owe it to yourself to give in. Enjoy and happy reading!!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"When you read a Romance book that makes you laugh out loud you know that there is a lot more to come.

Susan Elizabeth Phillips is wonderful. I have listened to several of her other books on tape and thoroughly enjoyed them too. Luckily, there are still some left and I look forward to all of them. I hope Dream A Little Dream is coming out soon on tape. Anna Fields is a terrific reader, putting emphasis just in the right place. Her male voices are the best I've heard yet!

Can a brilliant woman who's biological clock is ticking find the right man to father her baby? He has to be as untilligent as she is brilliant. She refuses to let any child of hers become fettered with the stigma's she's had to battle all her life. The heroine finally finds the appropriate candidate--a dumb jock and gets herself pregnant. But all hell breaks loose when he discovers she's pregnant and didn't intend to tell him.

I've read it before, and I like it so much that I decided to buy a copy to give a friend. I think the story is very sweet. Susan Elizabeth Phillips can be kind of cheesy, but the humor she injects into her books keeps it from being sappy. She's one of my favorite authors and I always look forward to reading her next book. In terms of my experience with Amazon, they've always been great and this time was no exception. The two SEP books I ordered arrived very quickly (especially considering the time of year), and everything was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Great book, I absolutely love it.

This is the second time I've read this book, this time on my Kindle, on loan from our local library. I still thoroughly enjoyed every page.If you can set aside the somewhat-hard-to-believe premise of the plot, the writing in this book is excellent. The story follows classic \\"Romance\\" formula. Nothing new there. This novel itself is heartwarming to read. The dialog between our protagonists is some of the best SEP has ever written, and gave me many, many LOL moments.I will purchase it for my Kindle library for a third re-read, in the future. The proof-reading/editing is superb with extremely few errors; only one or two typos which, in my brief Kindle experience, is worth 5-stars alone. That alone makes it worth spending money on to purchase."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This was my second book by Susan elzabeth Phillips and she keeps convincing me that you can have great romance with straightforward contemporary characters.I liked the interaction between the two heroes and their dealing with their own personal problems.I really enjoyed this romance."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Dr. Jane Darlington, a physics professor that is too smart for her own good makes the least intelligent decision of her life. She chooses to play a high class hooker and football groupie to get the one thing she is looking for.... a less than intelligent man to father a child for her with no strings attached and no desire to have an actual relationship. Her needs became prevalent on her 34th birthday and that hormonal clock is ticking louder and louder. Too committed to her career, fearful that procreating with another intelligent person would create yet another intelligent person that will be treated like a freak that she was, and a recent breakup with her long term relationship pushed her over the edge, she confides in her football groupie neighbor in hatching a plan to help her get what she wants.... a baby of her own to love. Once she saw Cal Bonner on the television, she decided that he is the one to father her child and a plan was put in action.Cal Bonner, Chicago Stars legendary quarterback is nearing his retirement age, but is determined that if he only dates very young women, he can never get old enough to retire. A smart man that plays the dumb southerner celebrates his 36th birthday with a gift he has no interest in.... a one night stand with a high class hooker that is really Dr. Jane Darlington in disguise.Little did Jane know, Cal was intrigued with this mysterious woman that only wanted to \\"do the deed\\" and run and seeks her out. Finding out who she was and that she is pregnant with his child, he demands to set the record straight and not let his child be born illegitimately. Determined to do the right thing, but not wanting a real life long commitment, he gives Jane no option but to be married to him until after the baby is born and then get a divorce.His rage at being deceived and her resentment for being found out makes for some serious sparks to fly and for some funny pranks at his expense. Secrets get exposed and perceptions are shared. Upon meeting Cal's family, you get to learn about his family dynamic and how history kind-of repeats itself, but yet again, love appears in the least likely of places. I enjoyed the book. There were some funny places that had me laughing, but there were also some places that made me cry. The premise of how the story played out was a little far fetched for a fictional story, but for an escape to daily life, it is an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read by any author in any genre. You will laugh until your sides feel like they are about to split. You will gasp for breath, wipe your eyes and prey the author will have mercy. She doesn't. It's one hilarious page after another. You will laugh. You will cry. You will fall in love with the characters and the community in which they live. And you will not want to leave. Ever. It's fun. It's sexy. It's moving. It's intelligent. It's everything you hope to find when you pick up a new book. And you will not want this one to end.Susan Elizabeth Phillips is an amazing author with many top, top books under her belt. This is one of her best. The story is well thought out and beautifully told. For even an established author, sometimes a story comes along that so supercedes all expectations it attains a class all its own. This is one of those books.I won't go into the story... several have already done so. But if you haven't read this book, if somehow you missed it on the first pass, I encourage you to run - don't walk - to the nearest bookstore.

I read six more of her books right away just based on how much I loved this. I actually bought not one but TWO books on this presumption of awesomeness alone. I NEVER do that. But SEP was worth it. The Chicago Stars series is great I've read most of them and they were all good. But this is still my favorite. She leaves no stone unturned and no character perfect. Instead they are all perfectly imperfect and you can't help but cheer them on. Jane is headstrong to hide her vulnerability and Cal is a typical guy with the Peter Pan complex.

So let's go for number three. nobody's Baby But Mine is about a TSTL woman with highly questionable morals and a caveman who needs to go to anger management. The plot is unbelivable and should insult most reader's intelligence. I have read other works by this author and know she can do better than this, I just don't know whether I'll be sticking around to find out."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I'm only halfway through this book, and will probably just skim the rest. I have read one other book by this author and enjoyed it enough to want to try another, but I don't care for this one. My major problem is that the main male character and his father are hateful. Perhaps as they go along they might show better qualities, but so far whatever traces of likeableness are overshadowed by how mean and cruel they are. The main female character is okay except for liking a jerk. Some of her actions seem awfully unrealistic for a person who otherwise is portrayed as mentally stable. To me the things she does that generate the plot don't seem in keeping with the character she is portrayed as having.The mother just seems to have martyred herself for a husband who was too weak to honor his supposed love for her. Then again since she married him as a young girl and had no education, perhaps she didn't feel she could manage on her own with two kids. He treats her badly for thirty years or so, then after a death in the family he suddenly decides she should be like she was when he hadn't totally alienated her. The means he uses for getting her back as the joyous loving person she used to be is to demean her. Shouldn't he be falling down on his knees and asking her forgiveness? How can he expect her to be the way she was thirty years ago when he has done his best to kill it off, anyway? His character really doesn't make sense. The best ending for the wife would be that she divorces the jerk husband and begins a fulfilling life of her own.Getting back to the hero's behavior, he just doesn't seem like much of a man when he has that thing about only dating twenty year old girls when he is thirty-six. Also, he gets way too hung up on revenge. It seems awfully petty when he helped to get himself into the situation. Plus he's planning this big revenge on the woman who is pregnant with his child.. You'd think it might occur to him that hurting her too much will hurt his child.Okay, I skimmed and then read the last seventy pages. The book finally improves at that point. Suddenly the father and son start acting better, but in the father's case, how after thirty-seven years of his being a jerk to her can his wife stand him even if he did have a sudden personality change? I realize that a story needs some sort of conflict, but I think an author shouldn't make main characters in a romance overly hateful to provide it. I think she went too far with that."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Nobody's baby but mine is one of the best books around. It has so much passion and love.

I fell in love with it. It made me cry it made me laugh and it also made me think. This book is not only for adults but kids should read it to. It helps you on your vocabulary and reading skills. This book shows you how the poeple speak in certain parts. This book is full of so much love and hate. About a plan that back fires but and so much hate between two people that suddenly turns into true love. U should really read or even better buy this book it was one of the best book i have ever read. I am sure you would say to.

It was all so wrong but so fun to read!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"The third book in the Chicago Stars series; it's as great as its prequels. Jane is a top of the line physicist she just turned thirty and she desperately wants a baby. Her biological clock is ticking. The problem is she has no man. He has to be dumb and healthy, since she doesn't want her child to be different \\"a genius\\". She spots Cal on TV and thinks he would be perfect, he's so dumb. Here is where Jodie a bartender comes in she's looking for a classy hooker for Cal's birthday she convinces Jane to take the job and get a baby in the bargain. She didn't make the best hooker, it was sooo funny. A month later she still isn't pregnant so she decides to go to one of Cal's games. She finds his hotel room and this time she ends up pregnant. Cal is not stupid on the contrary he is one of the smartest players in the NFL. So he senses something fishy is going on he asks Jodie about the hooker.... Jodie tells all and Cal is furious. He doesn't want his child to be raised as a bastard so he forces Jane to marry him till the baby is born. He takes her to North Carolina to his family since it would be strange to the press if newlyweds separate after just marrying. Can this marriage work out?

Mmmmmm a Romantic Comedy"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this book while driving in my car.

I mean, a physicist and a football player?? She tricks him into sleeping with her, getting her pregnant and then he marries her?? I had a hard time pushing myself to read this book. The last 50 pages were the best part of the book, though. However, I still never felt any chemistry between these two. I think the story of Cal's parents would have been much more interesting. In fact, Cal's family was much more interesting then the main characters themselves. Like I said, not bad, but not great either!!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"After reading the second book, Dream A Little Dream, (read backwards on accident) I felt like I knew this family well. Nobody's Baby but Mine is the first book in this wonderful series about the Bonner family.On Jane Darlington's 34th birthday, she realizes that one thing is missing from her life, a baby. Although she desperately wants a baby, she doesn't want a husband. After some research she finds the perfect &quot;sperm donor&quot;, Cal Bonner, the aging quarterback for the Chicago Chiefs. The reason Cal is picked is because he is presumed to be &quot;a dumb hillbilly&quot;. After being set up as Cal's 36th &quot;birthday present&quot;, Jane finds herself pregnant. She is thrilled. Unfortunately, (or fortunately??) Cal finds out about it. Being no dummy, he doesn't want his child to be raised without a father so he forces Jane to marry him (planning a convient divorce after the baby is born).After the quickie marriage, Jane and Cal leave for North Carolina to spend 3 months. There they fight a lot and finally fall in love, although without a lot of snags.When I first started this book I didn't like Jane and Cal. Dowdy Jane seemed too straight laced and boring and Cal seemed like a jerk. Throughout the book I began to love the couple as I did Rachel and Gabe in Dream A Little Dream. With the second book, this book also had a secondary story that was wonderful. Cal's parents Lynn and Jim are having problems and finally realize that, although they were forced into marriage at a very young age, they have a true love for eachother. I hope that Kevin is in a book sometime in the future. I really liked the guy.If you're a fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips (or if you're not become one!) this book is a must read."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This was one of the books I read after reading SEP's Breathing Room. I loved that book, but this one left me alternately cold or angry. I hated the 'baby-fever' aspect of the story (she had so much going for her, and while she didn't feel she needed a man to complete her life, she felt she needed a baby?), I HATED Cal's indignation when he found out what was going on (he had sex twice with a woman he thought was a stripper but then has the gall to suggest that He was raped somehow? I saw red.) The story also had way too many inconsistencies in character and plot and they weren't just annoying, they were also vaguely misogynistic. A smart physicist humiliates herself by posing as a high-paid stripper? Getting bullied by a man to get married in this day and age? The list just went on and on. I was completely disgusted by his he-man antics mixed with modern age entitlement-- on both sides actually. I was too repulsed by both characters to enjoy some of the side stories. I did like Cal's brothers though. All in all, seriously disliked this book and wished I'd bought it used for 2 bucks instead of new on Amazon for 8 plus shipping. Despite all that, I still really appreciated SEP's way with dialogue, and I found some bits of it very funny. Too bad the premise and the characters killed it for me."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This book had me weeping with laughter. The premis is pretty flaky, but the characterizations were hysterical. Descriptions of a jock-guy trying to play the part of an incredibly stupid (I mean, really stupid) stereotype jock-guy were great. Descriptions of a brilliant- scientist-woman bumbling her way around in the persona of an 'in-charge, sex scientist' were great. The ending was standard romance-story-ending, and didn't match with the howlingly funny beginning and middle, but altogether, it's an awfully funny book."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I read a lot of romance books, by many different authors, but no one can compare to Susan Elizabeth Phillips! Nobody's Baby But Mine was the first book by her I read. I read it so fast, I was mad because it was over so fast! I loved all her characters because they were so real to me I was truly caught up in their lives! Nobody, I mean nobody has a sense of humor as Susan does! Besides at the time I read the book, which was about a year ago, I had just embraced the sport of football! (Thanks to my son!) I pictured her hero as Howie Long! I kept telling people that this was so obvious! (Or maybe just wishful thinking on my part!) I love all her books, but the football themed ones are my favorite. After reading Nobody's Baby But Mine, I had to read everything by Susan I could get my hands on! She is truly unique! I usaully read about 4-7 books a week, so it gets pretty expensive, I frequent most all the libraries in my area to search for her books. Finding a Susan Elizabeth Phillips on the shelf is next to impossible they're so in demand! Still I managed to pretty much read them all. I always purchase my favorites though! Even reading as many books as I do, I sometimes read hers more than once! Susan I love you, you are simply marvelous!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I have great respect for Susan Elizabeth Phillips as a writer. I have read Fancy Pants, Hot Shot, Kiss an Angel, Dream a Little Dream, and this book. She researches her unique topics and really captures the essence of her characters' unique interests and careers (in this book, we learn much about Jane's research in particle physics, and Cal's trials as a late-career athlete are well-drawn). Her dialogue is funny and zippy. Her secondary characters add color and spirit, populating the book with charming secondary plotlines. Her opening scenes are strong, colorful and interesting, grabbing my attention so that I buy the Kindle edition immediately, and then I am just as quickly disappointed.She can't tell a love story to save her life. Her heroes all seem to be snarling jerks (and I would love to use a stronger word here). Which isn't to say that you can't have a snarling jerk who sees the error of his ways and is redeemed. However, her characters in this novel never do that. The hero, Cal, laments early in the novel that he likes to yell when he is angry and wants a woman who will stand up to him, unlike the young groupies he has been with before. Why doesn't it occur to a man of 36 years old that perhaps he shouldn't yell at woman like a neanderthal, and perhaps then people around him will feel more secure? The motivations of this character make no sense to me. After Jane goes through a number of convoluted machinations to get pregnant, she makes it clear to Cal that she doesn't want to take anything from him or force his actions in any way. She doesn't want money. She doesn't want marriage.Cal, who doesn't want the child at all, insists on marrying her. What? With the intention of divorcing her immediately after the child is born. Why? Why not skip the sham marriage altogether?Then he insists that she come with him to his hometown for the summer, even though he supposedly hates her. Why would you force yourself to spend time in the company of a woman who deceived you horribly? He asks her to go through the motions of meeting his family, but manupulates her into acting cold and condescending to them, so they will not be upset after their divorce? Why? Why not just explain to the family that their marriage is a convenience for the sake of the baby, which they will find out about soon enough? Instead, Jane and Cal go around hurting people with their inexplicable actions, especially given the fact that the family is already hurting from a death in the family.Then there is the relationship between them. Cal decides he wants revenge against the woman who is currently carrying his child, something which makes him look like a jerk no matter how justified his anger is. After she treats his family horribly (at his request) he rewards her by taking her on a date. Why would he do this? Why would he deliberately create distance between her and the people in his life, then take her out on a date, which is designed to bring people closer together?Obviously, Cal is falling for her even as he is angry at her for what she did, but his actions make it seem as if he is a cretin who is unaware of his own emotions and, when he figures it out, unable to act in a rational way. He had a number of hang-ups that made him seem marvelously stupid, such as referring to Jane as 'elderly' when he finds out she is all of 34 years old. Now, Jane might be older than his preferred type; this isn't a problem. But to refer to her as a senior citizen several times and complain about her age loudly and endlessly as if it were a betrayal on the same level as her pregnancy trap? Grow up! Get real!I really just want to know what is wrong with these two. I am focusing on Cal for the majority of my review, but Jane has just as many flaws and illogical actions in the book. As other reviewers have said, the method by which she gets pregnant - posing as a prostitute - and her reasoning behind choosing Cal as a mate - he is a dumb jock, therefore her child will be of average intelligence - is ludicrous. As an intelligent woman with a career, connections and money of her own, there were lots of ways she could have gone about achieving this goal.There is plenty to like about Susan Elizabeth Phillips' novels, but I don't think the main characters are one of them, particularly the heroes. There simply isn't anything believable there."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This was my first book from SEP and though I've read others from her since, I believe it's her best. Cal Bonner is a quarterback who's coming close to the end of his career, despite what he wants to think! He is also a university graduate, but Jane Darlington doesn't know that. Instead she thinks him completely damp and proceeds to seducing him posing as a stripper in order to ger pregnant, since she thinks that her baby will get the average of their two IQs and thus be less intelligent than she ever was and happier too. Ok, not the most realistic of stories, after all such a brilliant physicist probably should have read an article or two on biology and find out that this is not the way IQ or nature work, but anyway... This unlikely begining makes up for the funniest, most passionate and heart warming novel I read lately. Cal is a hero to die for and Jane's not so perfect appearence that appeals to my also less than perfect self, make for a wonderful and so well matched couple. SEP's writing is fast paced (no dull moments here!), humorous (the scene were Jane appears on the stairs naked when Cal's brother is in the house is hilarious) but also tender and loving. I absolutely loved this, as well as loved Heaven Texas, its sequel. If you're looking for something light for the beach, or for something to blow you off your feet and away from reality look no further; Satisfaction is guaranteed here."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"As usual, I love SEP's writing. She writes wonderful romance and characters, with great humor. I love Jane's character being a brilliant and gifted physicist and that she doesn't let anyone intimidate her. And that she's in her 30s and that enhanced her attractiveness instead of being compared unfavorably to a 20 year old.The first seduction scene had me laughing out loud.The main issue I have is that the plot is pretty unbelievable. I'm sure lots of crazy women want to have babies with famous sports figures, so if Cal was truly smart, he would have always provided the condom, and not risk one that's been 'tampered' with. And then of course, the second time, there was no protection at all...I usually love this author's secondary characters and their stories, but this time, they weren't as strong as other books."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I loved reading this novel the characters are loveable and they all have their reasons for acting the way the do. Dr. Jane, a genius, is looking to love and thinks that the only way she can do that is to have a child. Because of her own negative upbringing her biggest fear is to have a child with a genius IQ like her, so she sets her sights on football player, Cal Bonner, who purposely comes across as being \\"stupid\\". With the help of a neighbor, who has her own agenda, she plots to have Cal impregnate her without his knowledge (I know morally wrong on so many levels) because to the professor, genius parent + stupid parent = normal child.It turns out Cal isn't dump at all, but is just playing into the \\"dumb jock\\" stereotype. The way this story unfolds leave you laughing out loud and rooting for all involved. The silliness between Cal and Jane is so funny you wonder how such smart people can be so dumb.There is also the added bonus of Cal's parents love for each other that has never been truly expressed and they find themselves questioning their marriage and working to save it.This book has it all love, laughter, romance, friendship, silliness confusion and some pain. This book is definitely a keeper and a VERY ENJOYABLE READ"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I loved this book. Susan Elizabeth Phillip's strength is her ear for dialogue. She allows the readers to understand the characters and their growing attraction to each other through their dialogue.If you enjoy funny romantic novels, you will love this one. There are scenes in this book that had me laughing out loud. Most memorable was Jane Darlington's awkward striptease to the \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" music. I knew after reading that part early on in the book that this was not going to be a boring romance.I also liked the fact that the heroine, Jane Darlington, is a plain Jane with insecurities like any other woman. Her strength is her brilliance and innate goodness. As her feelings for Cal Bonner grows, she faces up to and stops making apologies for the fact that she's not a twenty something model. She realizes and makes Cal realize that she's better than that.If you have never read Susan Elizabeth Phillip's book, I would recommend this one because it is a very good example of her story-telling abilities."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"At thirty-four, Dr. Jane Darlington is a brilliant physicist with the sort of genius that has always set her apart from contemporaries, inspiring envy and discomfort. She's buried so deep in her work, she's accepted that, but it does limit her social options. On her thirty-fourth birthday, though, those limitations are felt keenly and she wants nothing more than a baby. Her intellect hampers her options and she's determined not to subject her child to the same hellish childhood she had, ostracized and segregated by the very mind that has brought her such professional success. She needs a man with limited intellect to balance out her genes.Enter thirty-six year old Chicago Stars Quarterback Cal Bonner. A man in the twilight of his career and clinging to football with everything he has, Cal comes off on camera like a slow-witted good ole boy, his accent and his predilection for the word \\"ain't\\" convincing Jane that he is a worthy potential father for her child. Driven by desperation, she goes against everything she believes is right and takes a wild chance when it falls in her lap, using Cal in the most heinous of ways. She gets pregnant, but when Cal finds out, rage burns through him, and he demands...and gets...a much deserved retribution.Now living a farce of a marriage, sequestered in the mountains of North Carolina, Jane's future is double damned when she finds out that the illustrious QB isn't the dumb yokel she thought he was. He is, in fact, a highly intelligent summa cum laude graduate of a prestigious university with a degree in biology. Now her baby is going to be doomed to be a freak like she was. To make matters worse, Jane starts to have feelings for the man who has every reason to loathe her for her actions until the end of time, no matter how much Cal seems to have softened towards her in the months that she's been hidden away with him.Never let it be said that two highly intelligent people can't also be such total idiots.In all fairness, I was monstrously leery about this book before I even started it. I love the Chicago Stars series, but the premise of this book really bothered me. I was unsurprised by the fact that I loathed every aspect of the first 25% of it. Jane's behavior was utterly contemptible and grotesque, and definitely something I consider a heinous cross between rape and theft. And that's not even mentioning the idiocy of someone of Jane's education being so flagrantly ignorant of basic reproductive concepts on genetics and their relation to intelligence. Then there was her distasteful desperation to have a child and her willingness to prostitute herself to do so. Ick. Ick. Ick. There was nothing remotely redeemable about her character or actions for the first few chapters of the book.Cal was slightly less reprehensible, but he was a man with a habit of dating girls young enough to be his daughter, and had a willingness, however it came about, to have unprotected sex with a woman he had reason to believe was a prostitute. Ewww. I'm not even going to mention the grossly over-the-top stereotyping of football players and the disgusting behavior of jock groupies. Gah! There was so much that completely repulsed and offended me about the first five chapters of this book!Oh, sure, it was well written, but the concept and characters just didn't work for me at all.Then came Chapter Six. And what started out as one of the most offensive books I've read lately swiftly and irrevocably morphed into one of the most entertaining. I'm actually a little agog at how quickly I became enchanted with the story after such a rocky start, and found myself, much like Cal, completely falling for Jane right around the time she found out how smart Cal was, and totally loving them together from the moment that the marshmallows went missing! Uh...that'll make sense when you read the book.I almost can't believe it, but SEP managed to not only completely win me over with one of the most humorous and perfectly fit couples I've had the pleasure to read lately, but she also impressed me with the way that the comedic aspects were blended in with some valid and realistic serious issues, such as the crumbling marriage of Cal's parents and the trouble Cal was having with the idea of his career coming to an end. And as for Jane and Cal, two characters I loathed almost from the start, I found myself understanding and sympathizing with them on more than just a surface level.Honestly, if it wasn't for those first five chapters, this book would have been the most enjoyable contemporary romance I've ever read. Even with those first five chapters, I loved the rest of the book so much that it's my favorite of the series so far, even though I rated it to include my impressions of the first part.There was just something that worked for me about Jane, Cal, and Cal's family, about how the characters evolved, how the relationships evolved, how issues arose and were dealt with, even about how some issues were mentioned but stayed out of the purview of this book, like the loss of Cal's brother's family. It all came together to feel like a very genuine, heartfelt story that had little or nothing to do with football and more to do with families and love and values. Shocking, really, after such a repugnant beginning. Now I'm ready and raring to go with the next in the series, my faith in SEP restored.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Ok, genius physicist Jane Darlington wants a baby. But doesn't want a freak child like she felt she was ... but a child of normal intelligence. So she chooses a \\"dumb\\" jock and after a couple of encounters (rather distasteful encounters!) she finds herself pregnant. The jock is a well known quarterback, Cal Bonner, and when he finds out about the baby, he is outraged! A quick marriage and close quarters lead to funny situations. Jane has this whole \\"don't see me naked\\" thing and the sexual tension is great as Cal tries to persuade her to let him see her as she really is! Jane also finds out Cal isn't dumb at all - he is well educated and his father is a doctor. So much for toning down the intelligence factor!The storyline was interesting ... but this is why this book is no keeper for me. First, as smart as Jane was, she should know finding a \\"dumb\\" partner may not have helped in her case. After all, geniuses are born to average intelligence parents - so an average child could be born to her despite the IQs of each of the parents. That's just one little thing that bothered me. The other was Cal himself. He was plotting revenge against Jane from the beginning. Even though feelings changed, how would destroying her life have made the situation better? Oh, here's your mom kid - she's forced to live in a cardboard box??? I thought he was rather cruel through most of the book.Now, Cal's grandmother Annie was the best secondary character I ever met! Loved her! The other storyline about Cal's parents and their marriage turmoil was ok, but rather sad to me. Everything worked out in the end. I liked the style of writing and I understand this is part of a series. I may check out the others... this one just didn't leave me with a warm fuzzy when I was done. Bossy, ego-maniacal men don't change overnight and so far all the Bonner men in this book - except maybe Ethan did not impress me. I read other reviews here and I must be in the minority ... but that is what I feel."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I will never look at a box of Lucky Charms the same way again! This book is hilarity and emotion at their optimum. Jane Darlington wants a baby... a NORMAL baby. Because she's a genius and lived through a childhood of being called FREAK, she thinks that the way to get a normal baby is to breed with a stupid man. But she doesn't find out until too late that the stupid man she chose is nearly as smart as she is. A marriage of convenience is anything but in this wonderfully, character-driven story. Pick it up, and Susan Elizabeth Phillips will become one of your must read authors forever."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"At first I had reservations. Jane's sneaking around to have sex with Cal really got on my nerves. But when the story got past that it really got cute with good humor and I really enjoyed it. Cal Bonner is the star quarterback for the Chicago Stars. He is in his late-thirties and is fighting to hold onto his position. But physically it is becoming harder and harder to do. He just isn't ready to give it up though and what for? What would he do if he didn't have football in his life? He has been taught strong values by his parents about marriage commitment and pictures getting married and having kids as being put out into the pasture as far as football is concerned. He is not ready to face that yet. So he fights it by partying with the younger members on the team and dating only YOUNG women in no older than 24, preferably 21.Dr. Jane Darlington just turned 34 and her biggest desire is to have a child but forget about the husband. She is independent and looks at having a husband as having unnecessary baggage. But she is picky about who she wants for the father of her child. To equal out the IQ of the child, Jane wants someone dumb to equal out her HIGH IQ. When she is offered the opportunity to be the \\"present\\" to a football player from the other team members, she thinks 'why not? football players are dumb right?!' It works. Jane is pregnant and Cal knows nothing of it- until a football fan who wants Cal's attention gets jealous and leaks out the information that Cal has fathered a baby. Cal is now out for revenge and forces Jane into marriage so his child will have a name. Due to the publicity (the press is having a time with this news) Cal and Jane are forced to live together for the next 3 months before spring training making everyone believe this is a match made in heaven. Cal's family gets involved and things really \\"mushroom.\\"Jane is real cute, real smart but nerdy- brought up in a broken family and really needs someone to love her. Cal is extremely good looking and plays the \\"dumb football\\" part real well. But he is actually \\"a brain\\" having graduated with honors from college in biology. He comes from a strong family that is very involved with each other.It is a great story! and I very much recommend it! It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"A friend recommended SEP's books to me and this was the first one I picked up. It really hooked me for several reasons...one was the very unusual female lead. Usually romances don't have genius scientists as heroines, and this one was drawn in a way I found very believable...and touching, that she didn't want to pass on the problems of her difficult childhood to her prospective baby. But also, SEP absolutely hooked me with the first chapter, which is one of the best uses of POV that I've ever seen. The reader meets the heroine through the point of view of, frankly, a bimbo who's a sports groupie...talk about opposites, but the way it was written gave a good deal of insight into the main character and was actually pretty sympathetic to the pov character. The rest of the book lived up to the promise of the first chapter ...it combined humor, conflict, and romance for a truly wonderful mix.

Calvin Bonner has to be every woman's dream man the way Susan discribes her charecters is superb. I was inspired to say the least. I read books all the time but this hit my top list.

The scenes in which Cal does the deed that result in Jane getting pregnant (NOT a spoiler since that's what the whole book is based on!) require a huge leap of faith, and the way he treats Jane when he finds out is worse. You really start to hate him.That said, the book is delightful. The plot is just slightly predictable but you do come to understand Cal, and Jane is really adorable throughout the entire story.

Mad actually :)Sure it is unbelievable, unlikely, ridiculous and the \\"iculouses\\" anyone can think of, but the light-hearted way SEP tackles this unlikely tale and the family dramas within the drama, together with the humorous dialogue, makes it a fun read. Just treat it as a fantasy and you will recover your senses in no time!It will continue to lurk on my shelves long after worthier novels get cleaned out...oops, what AM I saying? A bibliophile cleaning out her books...I must have a fever..."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This is one of her best!! The characters are lovable and the story will make you laugh and cry. I read a lot of romance novels and this one is in my all time top 5!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"The premise of Nobody's Baby But Mine is familiar, typical territory for SEP, including her own inventive tropes (i.e., the supposed dumb bombshell; the supposed dumb jock, etc) and inclusion of family drama, heady sex and emotional upheavals on every level imaginable, but it's always done with a lot of heart, depth and humor.Genius Jane is rather too stupid to live at times but redeems herself early on and just in time. I have to admit though, the first fistful of chapters had me appalled at how she went about conceiving and her narrow minded assumptions and presumptions. It was also awkward, embarrassing, kind of strange and SEP is smart enough to have written a different way about setting up those first few chapters without potentially turning off newbies to her work. As I said, it got much better quickly and most importantly--and I see this so often in romance books where one lead gets away with murder and the author doesn't address it, corrects it, or resolves it--Jane doesn't get away with what she's done all that easily. I was SO glad the author didn't just brush that aside but delved in WHY Jane did it and did it her way, and WHY Cal eventually forgave her and it was handled beautifully. When they eventually travel to Salvation for Jane to meet his family, is when the plot really takes flight and the characters shine with a great supporting cast that do their work to showcase Jane's and Cal's characters.One oddity, besides the opener, was the insertion of Cal's parents rocky marriage. It was, unfortunately, a non sequitur and I wasn't sure what the purpose of those scenes were, other than to, indirectly, show us what makes Cal, well, Cal. I think, still not sure of its purpose of SEP's intent, or I'm dense. *shrug*. However, Cal's entire family were well written and worked well as 'breaks' from the primary story line. Again, SEP manages to give us a modern commentary about contemporary female-male relations without really getting into it, and is excellent at showing the reader what and who the characters are while managing a meaningful, compact plot with lovely characters you'll root for and hope to see again."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"If you're familiar with SEP romance's, this book won't disappoint. The banter is wonderful and you'll find yourself devouring the book in 1-2 sittings. Despite a slightly implausible plot, the main characters are well-developed and a joy to get to know. Cal Bonner, particularly, has a shining sense of humor and rogue-ish hero quality about him.As usual the plot falls apart a little at the end as it careens into implausible SEP humor. And the side romance plot between Cal's parents is completely unnecessary and reads as totally out of place in the larger context of the novel. It does occasionally have some beautiful moments, such as when Jim sees Amber selling cookies, but on hole it's such a short interlude you just wish it will end. Annie, the cantankerous grandmother, plays the beneveloent nosy senior who immediately sees the young people belong together. There's a required asinine explantation given for why none of the characters ever curse. Everyone's christian even when it doesn't make sense for their character or demographic.As usual, I immensely enjoyed this romance novel, but I was left wishing SEP would occasionally break her own mould or some of the conventions of her genre in order to write a really great romance novel, rather than just a good one."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Nobody's Baby But Mine made me laugh and cry and years after reading this book, I still vividly remember the characters as if they were friends of mine.

I love the way you can laugh your guts out and then still have the \\"tender romantic moments\\". This story is one that some may say \\"like that would ever happen\\" but I would respond with isn't that why we read this genre? To get away and enjoy ourselves?My best explanation for this book and many of Susan Elizabeth's books: Funny, charming, witty, and sweet with just the right amount of sparring and romance. I love that she always includes a secondary story. You feel yourself rooting for these characters."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Published in 1997What I Loved: Jane is a brilliant and independent lead character who is rocking the book smarts but is so clueless about other things. I love her journey to love, acceptance, and family. Great Grandma Annie is the best character in the book and she is stubborn as all get-out. Plus she loves her some Harry Connick Jr so you know this shotgun toting grandma is smart. She really did understand and see everything going on. She was also brilliant in letting everyone figure it out in their own time without letting things go on to long.What I Liked: Cal was a great lead for Jane. She needed someone stubborn enough to finally see through to her core even if he didn't realize what he was doing. Also Kevin, I loved that boy and how it became clear that he and Cal could be friends! The guys definitely had a strong line in this story and it was great to read. The whole family aspect of this book was great and very important to the story.Complaints: I wanted a little more time of them together after realizing they loved each other (that isn't a spoiler--it is a romance with a happy ending). I always want a little more time with the happy couple :)Why I gave it a 4: The book made me grin, giggle, and get a little teary-eyed. In other words, it delivered the way romances should.Who would I recommend it too: Romance readers who like a little old school romance writing.Author Website: [...]Books in this series (not sure about the order):IT HAD TO BE YOUHEAVEN, TEXASNOBODY'S BABY BUT MINENATURAL BORN CHARMERMATCH ME IF YOU CANTHIS HEART OF MINEDREAM A LITTLE DREAM"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"First of all after you finish reading this you have to read Dream a Little Dream a great book not a part of the Chicago Stars books but a sequel to this book alone. Anyways I love this book... The heroine is a genius and at the start of the book she thinks the Hero is just another dumb jock. The hero is getting older and he won't let himself think about what happens after football, so he dates young girls and tries to look younger through them. The play between the H/h is great I love how they fight; they both seem to enjoy it.

It was so funny that sometimes I have to take a break because I could not stop laughing. It was cleverly written with enough jokes and charms to satisfy any reader. The story starts with Dr Jane Darlington, a total genius that wanted a baby that is as normal as possible (neither clever brains nor dumb). So, who did our PhD doctor choose? A sport man who was dumb (in her opinion, all sport persons are dumb) and have a one night stand with him. Cal Bonner, the quarterback of Chicago was a prefect choice. Jane was pregnant in a short time but Cal find out about her pregnancy. Cal forced her to enter a marriage of convenience and divorce her after she she delivered the baby. Both of them falls in love and (gasp!) she found out he was actually a genius. That piece of information frustrated Jane but all ended well at the end. There is another love story that is developed by the author. I wouldn't tell you about it, but it did touch my heart about searching and questioning our old love. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I think this book was the best book i've ever read.

Susan E. Phillips has a great gift to open up the romantic side in everyone. She tells the story of two people in desperate need of one another but yet unaware of that very fact.Jane Darlington believes to lead an empty life, so she sets up her mind on having a child of her own and the lucky sperm donator is quickly chosen, our own football star Cal Bonner. Unfortunately, Dr. Jane cannot (as planned) keep her pregnancy a secret from our great quaterback Calvin Bonner. With his sense of duty he forces her to marry him and chaos breaks loose all aorund them.This is a heart-warming story full of passion, fun and love. Jane Darlington is warm and intelligent woman with many all too human flaws at the same time. And Cal Bonner is at first a man not from this world, until we realise that he is in fact a very believable and loveable man who needs someone to settle him down.If you have a romantic vein running through you, you'll never go wrong with Susan E.

This lady always comes up with some really original tales. I will have to say that I don't care for the antagonistic approach that she used between the 2 main characters; That is something that bunches of readers enjoy - but not me. Parts of this one were really funny, but I don't care for it when they spend all night long making love, then wake up the next morning &amp; decide they have to save-face by spouting off the most offensive thing they can think of...... that really annoys me. However, SEP did save me from a real let-down by also writing about the good times they had together. They spent time getting to know each other &amp; acting like civilized beings. My favorite romances are ones like this one where I can actually see why the main characters are falling in love.SEP also put in really good secondary characters (as usal). I simply loved Cal's family... especially his grandmother!Although this one won't be on my keepers shelf, it's still a pretty good read. If you like SEP, then definitely read it."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"After all this time, I still cannot forget Nobody's Baby But Mine. I had never before laughed out loud reading a romance novel. I have never found another book as sweet, hilarious, and tender. I loved all the characters. My favorite scene is in the woods when Cal and Jane are forced to be alone. I laughed so hard I was wiping away tears. I passed the book along to a friend, who passed it to her friend, who lost it. I cried, but happily purchased a new copy. Buy your own; you won't regret it."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This was a great book. My first I had read by her and certainly not my last. The rapport between the hero and heroine was so witty and spunky, I just loved it!

Great 2nd plot with Jim and Amber Lynn's relationship, fantastic ending. I have found another author to look forward too. Thanks SEP!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I'd read great things about this author from other authors whose works I like, so was surprised to find her work slow going. There were a few catchy dialogue exchanges, but haracterizations were a bit heavy handed: Genius with angst meets jock with genius to make a baby to turn off the alarm on her biological clock. She stupidly (for a genius) assumes the jock is stupid and that his dumb genes will offset her overly intelligent ones to create a 'normal' baby.Ms. Phillips rightly says in the back of the book that she was too tempted to write about a subject (physics) about which she knows little and is a 'doofus' (her words). She's a bit more of a doofus about the characters, which are almost bi-polar in their good guy, bad guy/gal impersonations. By the end of the book everyone is brought round to be a good guy or gal and the poor heroine who wanted a normal baby to love, is stuck with a potential genius offspring. There's some agist rhetoric, a tacky embezzling evangelist to bash, and a hillbilly granny with an irascible temper and a heart of gold (natch!). Characters and plot are shallow, giving the impression that Ms. Phillips should stick with city characters and beef up her plots a bit. Something beyond 'will-they, won't-they get/stay together.'The book could do with some serious editing (lose 100 pages). The author seems cheerful enough, with flashes of entertaining dialogue here and there, just a bit undisciplined overall. Three stars is kind, in this reader's opinion."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I just love Susan Elizabeth Phillips.

She turns 34 and what does she have to show for it? Sure, she's been praised for her intellect, but what about love? She's been bottling it up for years, yet was never given the chance to receive it or give it; not from her ex and certainly not from her father. She has all this love to give and wants to give it to a baby. Her own baby. Problem: She does not want her child growing up to live a life of isolation and loneliness, to not know the cruelties of other children, to not be treated like the freak Jane was. Solution: Cal Bonner.The famed quarterback of the Chicago Stars. This brown-haired, gray-eyed warrior detests anything resembling to permanence; why deal with that when he'd rather entertain himself in things that are loose and easy? Anything but that would make him lose his edge, make him feel old, make him feel aimless since football has been his life. Problem: Who knew the impostor with the pink bow around her neck, pretty green eyes, and one who who couldn't leave his mind had deliberately meant for him to impregnate her? Solution: Make sure she never deceives him again and stick with his old-fashioned moral code; gotta marry the woman.Okay, so at first, Cal was SUCH a jerk. I mean, yeah, he was wronged and such, but you have to have patience for the guy in order to truly stick with the story. This man loves a challenge and Jane is just that for him; the biggest challenge he's ever faced. She makes him feel conflicting feelings and thoughts about his future! This strong woman can actually hold her ground and still keep him sweating! What is it? Could it be love? Can he accept that kind of permanence? And for Jane, when the challenge is gone for him, will he remain with her?I loved the characters! You have witty, powerful, loving Jane. Humorous, complicated, and loyal Cal. He's even rather intelligent and can be unexpectedly sweet. He endears her with nicknames like \\"Rosebud and Professor.\\" Then you have insecure and charming Kevin Tucker, no-nonsense and sassy Annie Glide, and the rest of Cal Bonner's family. There are a lot of touching moments in this find; when Jane finds out Cal has a degree in biology, for one. Extremely comedic situations; a Lucky Charms crime, a family confrontation with a shotgun. The leads in the story are endearing, sexy, funny as they find themselves in Salvation, North Caroline and trying to figure out their futures. The love scenes are not detailed immensely (my preferred taste), yet have this undeniable sensuality about them. This story ABOUT love, whether to receive or to not, to give or to not, is not something to take for granted. Don't miss this read that tickles your sides, makes you tear up in understanding, and makes you want become a member of the Bonner family!!Happy Reading :)"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Nobody's Baby But Mine by Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a contemporary romance about a genius physics professor, Dr. Jane Darlington, who orchestrates a one-night stand with the Chicago Stars quarterback, Cal \\"Bomber\\" Bonner. Jane knows that her biological clock is ticking so she sets out to seduce Cal into sleeping with her with the sole purpose of getting pregnant. She choose Cal because she wanted the father of her child to be stupid, thus by giving her child the opportunity to be free of ridicule that she suffered as a child genius freak.What she never counted on was that Cal would find out about her scheme and about her pregnancy, and that Cal is actually very intelligent having graduated summa cum laude with a biology degree. What follows is a marriage of convenience between them with the intention of a divorce after the baby is born. Cal whisks his new wife away to his hometown of Salvation, North Carolina to get away from the media circus taking place when news of their marriage hits.Cal is taken with the plucky and sassy genius professor, but won't admit he has feelings for her. He has her act hateful to his family so that they won't get attached to her. And he tries to hide her away in his home, but Jane decides to show him just who he is really dealing with. The witty banter between them is hilarious, and this story just tugged at my heart strings. I don't know if SEP can write a bad story. I didn't give this particular story 5 stars though because Jane's manipulative scheming to get pregnant and then her not having any intention to tell the father that they had a child just didn't sit well with me."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Absolutely loved this book.

The idea of a woman being baby crazy and insecure bothers some but you have to realize that there are people who do not have high self-esteem and are looking for something to complete them. Now the reasons I believe that smart capable people in society can feel this way is a whole other story. The book brought a smile to my face and while some things in the story may be considered unrealistic how many books in this type of genre are not the fairytale type story. If you like funny scenes with quick witted dialouge then this is a story you will enjoy."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I found an excerpt from this book online, and had to buy it after reading it.

The characters' banter was so entertaining, and I didn't roll my eyes once!Cal Bonner is a loveable masculine hero who has just the right combination of alpha and beta, and Dr. Jane's combination of intelligence and vulnerability make her a great heroine.

But because of the hurtful childhood she had due to her intelligence, she seeks to become impregnated by a stupid man, hoping to balance the brain scale. She sets her sight on legendary quarterback, Cal Bonner. She pretends to be a whore in order to bed the &quot;dumb jock&quot;. After two nights, she becomes pregnant. But soon her smooth plan goes haywire when Cal finds out what she's done. Unfortunately for Jane, Cal is not the dumb jock she thought him to be. He is a highly intelligent man who uses his keen intelligence coldly and calculatedly against anyone who crosses him. He forces her to marry him only for a temporary basis until their child is born. Well, sparks practically explode when the two are under the same roof. But though they fight against it, they soon fall madly in love. We also meet Cal's parents, who are also having marital problems. We meet the youngest Bonner, Ethan, a gorgeous minister and their blunt but loving grandmother. Fortunately for us, Jane and Cal, after a funny showdown, finally admit their love. They decide that they cannot live without the other. Cal's parents, particularly his father, confront old demons and win, allowing their love to blossom once again.

He's incredible - a star quarterback with a killer body, tremendous wit, an impressive intellect and great values. Sure, he can get a little grumpy and stubborn, but usually in a sexy, kind of adorable way. Thank goodness Susan Elizabeth Phillips created Jane Darlington, a woman worthy of Cal. Jane is an egghead physicist intent upon finding a physicially perfect but intellectually challenged sperm doner. She mistakenly assumes that Cal is going to fill the bill, but boy is she wrong. The ensuing struggle between these two is hilarious, touching and very sexy. SEP always writes great books, but this is one of her very best. Even if you're not a big romance reader, I promise that you're going to love this book!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and I liked it alot. Although the plot was far-fetched and a little ridiculous (but, hey!, this is a romance novel!), the characters were well developed and the writing style light and witty.The heroine of \\"Nobody's Baby But Mine\\" is Dr. Jane Darlington, a lonely physics nerd who has just passed her 34th birthday, and--boy!--is her biological clock ticking! Deciding to have a baby and believing that her own miserable childhood was due to her genius level IQ, she wants a healthy and relatively dumb father for her child. Her reasoning is that the baby then would end up with a more normal IQ due to \\"tendency toward the mean\\"--(this being probably the most ridiculous part of the book, but necessary for the plot to move forward.) Jane picks out Cal Bonner, hunky football quarterback of the Chicago Stars, after seeing him on TV responding to an interviewer in his \\"good ol' boy\\" Southern drawl (hmmmm, obviously a moron.) But Cal is far from the dumb jock that he appears to be, as Jane finds out when he discovers her scheme.Cal was a pretty great character--gorgeous, sexy, smart, and honorable, but also commitment-phobic and so insecure about his impending middle-age (in a young man's profession) that he never dates any woman over 23 years old. Jane is a pretty good heroine despite her intellectual arrogance and rather unscrupulous initial behavior--an intelligent, witty and lonely woman who is looking for someone to love. The secondary characters are well done as well--particularly Cal's parents and Kevin, the young, cocky second-string quarterback who wants Cal's job.The plot is improbable but moves along pretty well, and some of the scenes are *very* funny indeed. I particularly liked the initial seduction scene with an inept Jane posing as an call girl and doing calisthenics to \\"The Flight of the Bumblebee\\" when a suspicious Cal asks her to dance for him. That (and the rest of that scene) are worth the price of the book.In summary, this is a sexy, humorous romance with a really dreamy/hunky hero and an unusual plotline.Recommended!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"It really pains me to be the lone ranger here and give a SEP book such a mediocre rating, but it pained me more to finish the book. The plot seemed overly contrived with a desperate physicist setting out to get &quot;knocked-up&quot; by a dumb jock so that her baby would be &quot;normal.&quot; I thought the author used a lot of stereotypes about athletes and southerners even as she condemed her heroine for doing so. For example, Cal, the quarterback was from my home state of N.C. Maybe, I'm being overly sensitive, but to prove that Cal really was smart and not a dumb hick, the author had him graduating from Michigan. SEP, ever heard of Duke or the Univ. of North Carolina?, two of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Although I found a lot of humor in this book and loved the characters of Annie and Lynn, (the secondary plot of Cal's parents was very touching) I couldn't get past how stupid Jane, the genius physicist, and Cal, were. For two smarties, they acted really dumb. I suppose this must have been an attempt at irony but it didn't work. And for someone who was so desperate to have a baby, I think there would have been more mention of her pregnancy along the way. The actual labor and delivery was too unbelievable as well. Don't doctors wash their hands before delivering a baby? And Cal chooses that moment to announce he wants to go to medical school. Yes, I know I'd be thrilled to give birth and have my husband announce plans to be away. Thanks, hon. For me to enjoy a book, I have to respect the hero or heroine or they must redeem themselves. Although, SEP tried, I never felt anything but contempt for both the main characters. Yes, I know we must suspend our imaginations when reading romance, but when one is reading a contemporary, it helps if the plot is at least a little believable. Maybe I am a bit jaded because SEP's previous book, HEAVEN, TEXAS just blew me away. Although the characters were just as mismatched, the story was much believeable and the characters endearing."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Never have laugh so hard about Lucky Charms! This is the first book I've read of SEP, and I'm so glad I picked it up. I couldn't put it down, had to finish in one night! Cal and Jane are such sweethearts, and I especially loved the secondary characters in this books, Annie, the shotgun toting grandma, Ethan, the handsome as sin minister brother, and Kevin Trucker, the arrogant yet insecure quarterback, I was ecstatic to hear he's getting his own book soon, he quickly became a favorite for me. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I didn't particularly like Cal in the first 100 pages or so, he seems too cold and unforgiving, but I am so glad I stuck with the book, it really got much better and I was left wanting more at the end. Read this book, you won't be diappointed!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Hard to believe I would like this book. I wanted a diversion and found this book as free book from a book club and said, why not, try it. On vacation with the kids I decided to read it (the first romance I ever read) and loved it. It was fun, pure escape. It's a better read than I thought and I will buy her other books. There's nothing wrong with some pure fun reading."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Jane Darlington is a 34 year old genius. She really isn't a very sociable person. She is a very nice person, but always believed that people thought she was weird because she was so smart. Her next door neighbors daughter Jodie comes over to borrow some coffee. She realizes that Jane has been crying and starts trying to find out what is wrong with her besides being a weirdo. Jane confides in the young girl. The young woman for her own selfish reasons tells Jane that she can help her with her problem. Jane's problem was she wanted a child of her own, but didn't want the child's father to have any intelligence whatsoever. She felt is the father was stupid, her child wouldn't be talked about and critized the way she was. Jane sees Cal Bonner and football player and she thought he was stupid because of the way he talked to the interviewer. She said he would be perfect aloud and the young woman said she could set it up. Jane was going to be Cal Bonner's birthday present. They even tied a pink bow around her neck. Jane couldn't believe what she had to do, but I don't think she counted on Cal finding out her little secret.Cal Bonner was nobody's dummy. Yes, he was a football player, but he happened to be one with a degree in Biology. Cal came from a family where the men seemed to get caught up with having to marry a woman because she was pregnant. When he first met Jane, he knew she was no ordinary hooker. He didn't believe she was a hooker at all. He overheard Jodie talking about how she set up his birthday gift. Cal made Jodie tell him who Jane was and everything. He was so mad he could have hurt Jane. He confronted her and made her marry him and that's when the fun starts.I don't want to go on because I know I will give it all away. You will love this book. The characters were good and you could actually visiualize alot of the scenes in the book. This is my second book by Ms. Phillips, the first one was First Lady. I am now trying to find all of her books. She is a good writer and I enjoy her stories. They aren't as heavy with issues as some others I've read recently. I'm glad my friends told me about her."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I will preface this review by mentioning that I loved the first two books in this series. Unfortunately, the plot of this book made little to no sense. The truth of the matter is that if someone tricks or manipulates you so that they can get pregnant there is no way that you would ever forgive them let alone marry the person. These two had nothing on common and would not ordinarily be together. Its also not that simple tobe put in contact with professional athletes. The ridiculous plot doesn't end there: SEP never even addresses the fact that a woman with an IQ of 180 would a) seduce a man in that manner Oe b) think that her child would be of average intelligence because one parent is dumb. The book doesn't ever address the obvious self esteem/delusions of the heroine.I loved the first two books in this series so I will be reading the next one."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Cal Bonner - football jock; Jane Darlington - scientist and brilliant geek. Jane is looking for an average, if not a little on the stupid side, man to father her future child. She doesn't want her child to grow up as a \\"smart\\" freak the way she did as well as a social outcast. This is the basis of the funniest story you will ever read. Through a sequence of events, Jane meets Cal (clueless to her plan) and begins her journey to motherhood. However, her best laid plans come apart and the laughs begin. There is plenty of Bonner family turmoil to deal with and the characters are extremely well-developed as each of their stories is told. A secondary storyline/plot of the elder Bonners lends more drama and laughs to a wonderfully-told, down-home family fun time tale. Annie Glide (grandmother to Cal, Gabe and Ethan) is my favorite character. She is a straight shooter and a no-nonsense woman with a heart of gold and insight to everyone's secrets! I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate the love and warmth of a good family story."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Brainy physics professor Jane Darlington figures the only way to give her offspring a chance is to choose a daddy who's dumb as a post. Enter jock Cal Bonner, quarterback for the Chicago Stars. Jane secures an invite to Cal's party as the \\"entertainment,\\" and hopefully will come away with a party favor of her own. Her disturbingly geeky rendition of an erotic dance has him scratching his head, but does not preclude the two from hooking up.The only problem with Jane's logic is that despite his chosen profession, Cal is no dumb jock. When he discovers that he is about to become a daddy, he insists that they marry to make the baby legitimate, and Jane begrudgingly joins him at his home in North Carolina to wait out the baby's arrival so they can part ways. The two are like oil and water, and the shenanigans they engage in to one up each other are hysterical, particularly her role as a \\"cereal killer\\" to his beloved Lucky Charms. What neither strong willed combatant counts on is falling for the other.The third in Phillips Chicago Stars/Bonner Brothers series of novels is one of her best, mixing comedy, drama, and romance to tell an engaging and heart tugging story. The series includes (in order of publication): It Had to be You; Heaven, Texas; Nobody's Baby But Mine; Dream a Little Dream; This Heart of Mine; Match Me if You Can."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I just love this romance! This is my favorite book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I've probably reread it at least six times! This book has everything I want to read in a romance novel plus more.Beginning with incredibly interesting characters like Cal Bonner, the quintessential football hero we've all dreamed of, not only an amazing athlete, and beautiful, but with a great flaw, the fact that he can't face growing old. Don't we all love those guys that are forever the Peter Pan's? He's in his thirties and should retire, but he's the ultimate competitor, both on and off the field.Then there's Jane. Again, I just love this character for her perfection and flaws. On one hand, she is reported to be a brilliant, but lonely nuclear scientist, working feverishly on \\"The Theory of Everything\\", who desires a baby so badly that she tricks Cal into believing she's a groupie of the football team and sleeps with him twice to get pregnant. The twist is, she wants a normal child with a normal IQ, and she thinks Cal is a moron because he plays football, hence, an average IQ. That's not her only mistake, as we discover; Cal is not stupid. Then she thinks he won't care that she's gotten pregnant, but she finds out that she's picked the wrong football player in more ways than one. The baby is his, too, and he takes Jane to his southern home to wait out the pregnancy and the press when they discover the most eligible Chicago Stars football player has married a professor.There are so many great scenes where Susan exploits Cal's need for competition with his reluctant bride. Jane is always one up on Cal, though, and it's his brawn vs. her brains. Like the time \\"Miss Big Brain\\" locks him out of the house and he enjoys the challenge of climbing over the roof to break in, or when he sees her drivers licence and learns her real age, or when she messes with his Lucky Charms cereal and he calls her a \\"cereal killer\\" and the bar fight between Cal and Kevin, just to name a few.The anticipation of when Cal will actually see his wife naked leaves you turning the pages. There's page after page of newlywed discovery under the most humorous circumstances. I love the banter between the characters, especially the way Cal tries to talk tough to her and she is wise to his firecracker temper as all bluff.The secondary characters are a roar, too, from Kevin, who thankfully we see again in my second favorite book, \\"This Heart of Mine\\", who is the young perfect quarterback replacement. He follows Cal to Salvation, North Carolina, and seeks Cal's professional help, but he falls for the beautiful Jane Bonner and is adopted by the rest of the female family. There is Amber Lynn, Cal's mother, and we learn of her courage as she raised Cal from a mere child herself, with Cal's father, Jim, who became a doctor and took care of a young family. I especially will never forget the character of Annie, Cal's rifle toting maternal grandmother who lives on Heartache Mountain, and has the reasoning of the wisest of men with the plainest of speech. All she wants to do is be left alone with her Harry Connick Jr. music (great taste in music!) and country garden.I love how this tale takes the reader from the motel room to the classroom to the country with simple pleasures like resting in the sun while your baby grows inside you as the most important thing in life. The wholesome theme of family love is clear on so many levels that this story is truly refreshing in a world where people sometimes treat new life like an inconvenience.Ms. Phillips never fails to disappoint with her intelligent, witty, endearing characters, and seemingly implausible situations. Her plot twists are constantly fresh and surprising, and in many situations I found myself roaring with laughter so many times I lost count. Ain't nobody who does it better than Susan!I supremely recommend this book, and like the fan that I am, eagerly await her next. So if you're like me, this book won't make it to your keeper shelf, it will remain in your nightstand!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Dr. Jane Darlington, a genius physics professor, wants nothing more than to have a baby. She has a couple of obstacles in her way though. She currently has no prospects for the father. And growing up as a genius made her feel like a freak, so she wants to spare her child this pain. Therefore, she needs a very special man. A stupid man. When she sees Cal Bonner, the famous Chicago Stars quarterback, her prayers seem to be answered. He's handsome, a jock, and with his good ol' boy ways, he must be slow-witted. But when he figures out what she's done, he's not about to go along blindly with her plans. On top of that, Jane begins to realize, a little too late, Cal may be a whole lot smarter than he looks.This is the third installment in the Chicago Stars/Bonner Brothers series. A funny, fast-paced, interesting love story between real people, each with their own set of insecurities.SEP has an uncanny gift with writing complex, three dimensional characters. They become so real, I half expect to look up from the page and find them in the room with me. Her stories and characters wiggle themselves under your skin and in your heart where they stay.There is a secondary story with Cal's parents that was quite good as well. Overall, I certainly enjoyed this book, except it was difficult getting through the portion where Cal was so angry and spiteful toward her. Even after considering this, it's still a favorite book of mine. Once Jane decides she will no longer sit back and tolerate his behavior, well then it really gets good! I still smile every time I see a box of Lucky Charms cereal!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I've read hundreds of Krantz, Garwood, Lowell, Cameron, Roberts -- why hadn't I heard of Susan E.

I strongly recommend this book -- and, having read so many romance novels, I'm rather hard to please. And, as a final endorsement, after I read this book, I jumped on line... and ordered three more of her books!

You can imagine the looks people kept giving me as I was giggling outloud!! The characters were great! I felt like I really got to know them and I cared if there was a happily ever after. I haven't been a huge fan of contemporaries, but SEP has changed my reading habits. This is an author that knows what romance readers want and she gives it to them. Thanks!!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author. If I don't want to be publicly embarrassed, I'll read the next one in the privacy of my home. People tend to look at you strangely when you're laughing out loud by yourself. If you think you've read all the possible plot twists surrounding a woman who decides to have a baby without benefit of marriage, you're in for more surprises than the characters of this very entertaining book."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Once you get past the ridiculous premise of this book, it's actually quite entertaining. The idea that the heroine wants and average child is a pretty thin plot device. I didn't view the heroine's logic as anything a rational person would come up with as a solution to their \\"problem\\" (I'll sleep with a dumb jock, thereby increasing the odds that I will have an average or stupid child). The heroine didn't like being treated like a freak as a child because she was so smart? So, be an attentive parent that makes sure the child has \\"normal\\" activities as well as intellectually challenging ones as they grow up - problem solved.Anyway, all that aside, most of the book, despite the silly original plot, is very funny and quite entertaining. The banter between characters is very good. The characters are also wonderfully unique so they donot come across as typical women's fiction cardboard cutouts, which was great. Like others have mentioned, the \\"Lucky Charms\\" scenes were laugh out loud funny - at least for me they were.This was the first SEP book I read, and I enjoyed it enough that I have sought out her other titles. If you, as a reader, are willing to suspend belief, you will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I discovered this book through my Amazon.com friend Janlouise's review and decided to check it out - and I'm glad I did! My only prior SEP book was BREATHING ROOM, but now I think I'm going to have to read all the books in the Bonner Brothers/Chicago Stars series. BUT I must say that you have to suspend belief a bit in the beginning. For a woman supposedly so smart, some of her ideas and the way she goes about getting pregnant are kind of ridiculous (since when are only smart guys sperm donors?!).Brilliant physicist Dr Jane Darlington wants a child desperately, but there's no man in her life and she has some specific requirements for a potential father, so she decides a dumb jock like Chicago Stars quarterback Cal Bonner will perfectly suit her needs. See Jane had a very sad and lonely childhood isolated from the other kids who thought she was some sort of brainiac freak (she was in college at 16). She figures that his lack of smarts will balance out her abundance of them (?!) and her kid will have a better life than she did. So she poses as a hooker and allows herself to be Cal's birthday gift from his teammates. Soon she is ecstatically pregnant but her ecstasy doesn't last long. Unfortunately for Jane, Cal finds out and he's NOT happy about it (nor is he as dumb as she assumed he was - summa cum laude not dumb - how did her plan go so wrong?!). His strong sense of family drives him to marry Jane with every intention of divorcing her once the baby is born. But the press won?t leave them alone, so he takes her to his hometown of Salvation, NC to hide out for a bit.Slowly their mutual anger and dislike for each other starts to fade, but Cal doesn't want his family to get too attached to Jane and asks her to be cold and unpleasant around them. She reluctantly does so, though it hurts because his family is so nice. But time spent together starts to change things between them (there's certainly a strong sexual attraction) and as they get to know one another will they stay together or is there just too much between them to make this marriage work?I liked Cal's character a lot (some disliked him in the beginning, but I felt he was totally justified in his anger toward Jane) and I laughed out loud at Jane's tampering with his Lucky Charms! Then there's his attempt to give her the make-out session at the drive-in that she never had as a teenager. That was sweet - and, okay, self-serving! And I loved how he would put on his \\"hillbilly-from-the-sticks-dumb-jock\\" act on for people he disliked or disrespected. I also found Cal's family enjoyable to read about: his brother Ethan (who gets his story in Dream a Little Dream), his sassy grandmother Annie and his parents who are in the midst of a mid-life marriage crisis. A really enjoyable book and I will definitely be checking out the rest in the series. A recommended read!"},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Normally, I can really trust the customer reviews on Amazon, but I can not believe someone (let alone several people) rated this 4 and 5 stars. Was I reading the same book? I don't have a problem with the kind of far out story line (after all, it is a romance novel, so you can expect some of that) even though I can not imagine what intellegent woman would have the thought process the main character does.... (example: I'm so incredibly brilliant that I honestly believe sleeping with a stupid guy will produce a normal child... Really? I must have missed that little tidbit in biology class.) But mainly, this story was just boring. The characters were one dimentional. Even their huge personal problems were boring.

What can I say, it did have some funny moments at the beginning but overall I found more amusing moments than funny ones. Two people fighting through out a book is not what I call funny. The writing is not bad even if the story seems a bit unbelievable. It's the first I read about the author and I might be willing to read another one of her books, but felt like 6.29 was too much for the book. I have recently read better ones for free.

I have hardly ever been so disappointed with a book. The heroine (others have described her as flawed in a good way) is quite possibly one of the most grating characters I've ever encountered in fiction. Her plan (if it can be dignified with such a word) to have a stupid or average child is not only irrational and absurd, but demeaning! I can understand a mother not wanting her child to have similar negative experiences, but this is ridiculous.

I have grown quite attached to the Chicago Stars and look forward to reading about them.This is the story of Cal Bonner and Jane Darlington. Cal and Jane had great chemistry and it was fun to watch their relationship progress. I enjoyed their interactions and was rooting for them to be together.Cal was a strong, sensitive football player who feared retirement because he didn't know what he would do with his life without football. He needed Jane because she stood up to him and kept him grounded.Jane was a physicist and physics professor who was mostly alone. She had some problems growing up, it was hinted that she had issues with her family, but aside from the teasing she received from her peers, her back story was never explored. She needed Cal because he was equally intelligent and made her feel less freakish.I liked the story of Cal's parents Jim and Amber Lynn and thought it added a nice dimension.I wish more had been explained about Cal's other brother, Gabe and how exactly his wife and daughter died. Their death was mentioned as a catalyst for the change in the relationship between Jim and Amber Lynn and why Cal wanted Jane to distance herself from her parents, but I never understood what happened. Gabe's presence was missed and I kept waiting for it be resolved.I also didn't like the character of Jodie. She was very cardboard. And while she was only in the few beginning chapters of the book and mentioned again at the end, she was done a disservice by the author. Jodie's primary motivation was sex. She was spiteful and shallow and that was it. There had to be something redeeming about her. In fact, I kept waiting for her to be redeemed. It never happened. Jodie was but a plot device and it was bothersome. She would have been good for Jane and Jane would have been good for her.How Jane becomes pregnant is a little far fetched and a lot ridiculous but thankfully it doesn't last long and serves only to set up the rest of the story which is so good it makes up for the beginning. The end is also a little drawn out and is too neatly wrapped up but overall, this was a book worth reading."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"This is the first Susan Elizabeth Phillips book I ever read and I was instantly hooked.

The banter between the hero and heroine was so funny I found myself laughing out loud a alot and when not laughing I did alot of smiling and the other characters added to this with their humor as well. The banter bwtween Cal and Jane kind of lost its edge between them near the end of the book because thats when they realized they were falling in love instead of in hate, but the scene with the lucky charms has to be funniest thing I have read and let me gain a new found respect for a greatly written heroine that I have not found in alot of books I've read, you'll have to read it to find out what I'm talking about.

Two smart individuals / two strong characters make the dialogue fun to follow."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"I love the author's ability to flesh out her characters. By the end of most of her novels, the reader really cares what happens to them. This one didn't lack in that, but it took a while to get there. It was hard to get past the heroine's dishonesty (to put it kindly) in the beginning of the book and sympathize with her dilemma. Once I got past that, the pacing, tension, and usual sizzle between the hero and heroine was a little off, making the book lag. It ended up being worth the read, and had a good ending (with the usual grovel scene), but it wasn't one of her best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE (BONNER FAMILY)","review":"Of all of SEP's Chicago Stars books, I connected the least with this one.

The patterns themselves can be adapted for throw pillows."},{"Title":"Jerusalem: The Endless Crusade","review":"I found the first few chapters of the book very interesting, the foundation of the city by King David of Israel, the architect Hiram of Tyre, and the rabbinic tradition of the Shamir, the giant worm that could cut through stone.His history of the Greek,Roman,Byzantine,Persian and Arab occupations of the Land of Israel are also interesting, and I was fascinated by the stories of the Crusader Kingdoms, and of their different orders like the Knights Templars, the Knights Hospitallers and the Teutonic Knights.But I began to detect an anti-Jewish bias. After writing about the Jewish Commonwealths of Israel until the destruction of Judea by the Romans in 70 CE, he writes almost nothing of the continued Jewish presence in the Land, throughout the period between this event and the birth of modern Zionism.How dare Sinclair compare the Crusader Kingdoms in the Holy Land to the modern State of Israel? The Crusaders, like the Arabs and Moslems, were aliens, intruders into the Land of Israel.The State of Israel is the living embodiement of the return of the original inhabitants of the Land of Israel, the Jews, to their own land and the sovereignty of the Jews over their own land , the antithesis of colonialism!But it is the last three chapters that are insufferable. Here he really reveals his prejudices.Ignoring his own evidence of the roots of the Jews in Israel, he refers to Zionism as a colonial movement, and even lies about the War of Independence, recreating the libel about the destruction of the village of Deir Yassin, dishonestly reffering to men, women and children as being wilfully murdered and mutilated, this has been proved to be a hoax.The Jewish fighters identified Deir Yassin, as a base for Iraqi troops,and Arab terrorists to attack Jewish communities and Jewish convoys. They warned the civillian population to leave, and then after an exchange of fire with the Arabs from the village, the Jews won the battle and Arab civillians had been killed in the crossfire.There was No willful murder of innocents, no rape, no mutilation.He refers to Deir Yassin as the worst atrocity of the War of Independence, ignoring the thousands of Jewish men, women and children murdered by Arab terrorists and the invading Arab armies.But it was after he referred to the Israeli declaration of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel in 1949, as meaning the Israelis wanted to continue the conflict, that made me unable to finish the book.Jerusalem, which was founded by King David as his capital 3000 years ago, and which Jews have lived in ever since. Jerusalem, which is mentioned 600 times in the Torah and not once in the Koran. Jerusalem, in which Jews have been the single largest group of residents since 1840. Jerusalem, which contains the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the holiest Jewish site in the world. In 1948, Arab forces swept into East Jerusalem and massacred her Jewish inhabitants, driving out the survivors and desecrating the Jewish holy sites.Andrew Sinclair's Lawrentian British prejudices, made me discount this book as a credible source."},{"Title":"Jerusalem: The Endless Crusade","review":"Not a bad book, although there are a few rather blatant editing errors, such as the date of the first Zionist Congress. However, Sinclair approaches the history of Jerusalem from the traditional European perspective, one which sheds a less positive light on the Muslims and Palestinians. Read Armstrong's Jerusalem instead."},{"Title":"Jerusalem: The Endless Crusade","review":"Sinclair's &quot;Jerusalem&quot; reminded me of Stoppard's &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.&quot; Both center on subjects that are often at the edge of the main drama. Sinclair attempts to tell much of world history from the perspective of Jerusalem.If you're looking for a book to read while flying traveling for business, this would be a great one."},{"Title":"Dance in the Distance/There's Alway's Tomorrow/Free to Love/Love's Silken Melody (Inspirational Romance Reader Contemporary Collection #3)","review":"These wonderful short stories are great. My favorite was by Brenda Bancroft. The charactor had real flaws that endeared her to the readers. The plot was fanatatic, kept me so engrossed I could not put it down.

This book is a must for all of them who want to know what it was like at the beginning. It describes in beautiful detail the historical setting of the second summer at Fair Point,NY. The year was 1875 and the multitudes slept in tents or commuted from Mayville by boat. President U.S. Grant made a visit. It is not about girls. This is the story of four young women who come in search of amusement or information, but return home with more than they ever imagined.

Four girls go to Chataqua camp and come home very different than when they went. I have loved everything I've read by this author and named my Kindle after her. There is the Chataqua series and Ester Reid series and other books as well that I have yet to read. The stories were written in the early 20th century and show how people of different classes were treated. The main character(s) are searching for a better way -how can they lead a better life, whether poor or rich.

Thanks for the free download."},{"Title":"Inside the Concentration Camps: Eyewitness Accounts of Life in Hitler's Death Camps","review":"It is hard to believe that this book is only now available in English. Consisting entirely of eye-witness accounts of life in German concentration camps, the work served as an important source of evidence during the Nazi trials. The accounts, however, are compiled so that they form a narrative that is roughly chronological, beginning with the experience of deportation and ending with the grim business of counting bodies. In between lies the whole experience of the prisoner: the forced and brutalizing work, the whimsical or studied methods of torture, the grisly medical experiments, the routine executions, the gasing of ever larger groups, the ovens that burned night and day, and constantly, throughout the story, the capricious beating, kicking and whipping. Primo Levi, who wrote so eloquently about the danger of forgetting, would have appreciated this book.And Thomas Whissen, the translator, has performed an admirable and selfless job. He has rendered this story in a language that is so clear, so transparent, that one forgets that one is reading words on a page. The book leaves one feeling bruised and battered, and not quite willing to go back into a world of comforts. It leaves one deeply suspicious of humanity. And this perhaps is a good thing.Incidentally, it is difficult to imagine a book better suited for university courses on the holocaust.Carmine Di Biase, Ph.D. (cdibiase@jsucc.jsu.edu)"},{"Title":"Inside the Concentration Camps: Eyewitness Accounts of Life in Hitler's Death Camps","review":"I purchased this book hoping I might be able to use it in the course I teach on the Holocaust. It includes a vast and rich body of testimony that would be invaluable if it were placed in context. However this work is a list of statements, usually identified only by an individual's name. For most of the statements, it is impossible to determine which camp is being described. This book suggests that there was a general concentration camp experience, and that it is not necessary to distinghish one camp from the other. I believe that premise is problematical on both counts. Even the photographs have generic captions that do not identify the camps they depict. While the first-person accounts of the Nazi order of terror are often gripping, this book should be used with caution by those seeking a precise historical understanding of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Inside the Concentration Camps: Eyewitness Accounts of Life in Hitler's Death Camps","review":"This book is a compilation of statements made by hundreds of different Holocaust survivors. The statements are pieced together in a way that makes the readers feel they are reading a story told by one person. The book takes stories from survivors of all the different camps and compiles them to depict the horror felt by all victims of the camps. I would say this book is an excellent introduction to what life in the camps was like."},{"Title":"Inside the Concentration Camps: Eyewitness Accounts of Life in Hitler's Death Camps","review":"This book reads like a single history...beware. The author has taken original testimony from many people and woven them together as though they were from a single source (some pages actually have between 15 and 20 references). Appears to be the same sort of propaganda used to create the anti-semetism that fueled the holocaust. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"Those crazy Hunsenmeir sisters are back, and this time, it's personal.... Julia and Louise, after 80+ years of sibling rivalry, still don't have it right. And when Ed Tutwieler Walters saunters into Friday night bingo, the fireworks are on autopilot. Vying for the attentions of the town's newest bachelor, Julia and Louise pull out all the stops. And often at hilarious consequences....Told through the perspective of Julia's adopted daughter, Nickel, readers are treated to small town life in all its glory. Gossip, disputes, affairs, friendships and, yes, even pesky family troubles, run amok in Runnymeade, Maryland, and Rita Mae Brown uses every ounce of her literary talent to create this unforgettable story. I was very impressed by what I read, and despite all their cat-fighting, Julia and Louise are two women I'd love to have lunch with!I read the first book in the Hunsenmeir series, Six of One, a couple years ago, and I truly enjoyed Bingo so much more. Funnier and more wisecracking, Bingo will have readers yearning for weekly bingo dates in the Catholic Church basement, socializing at the town square, and the chance to take your pets with you everywhere you go, even to the doctor's office during your annual check-up. Wonderfully endearing. Can't wait for Loose Lips."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"I really was bored with this book. I had found a great author (and still think she is) after Rubyfruit Jungle and Six of One, but Bingo was a BIG disappointment for me. I was bored stiff and found myself reading and re-reading lines because I'd fallen asleep. Read Rubyfruit Jungle or Six Of One for some great entertainment."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"A girlfriend of mine from work lent me the book - you've got to read it she said. As I was reading the book, people thought I was crazy because I would just &quot;bust out&quot; laughing constantly. I could not put the book down! I knew nothing about the author, Rita Mae Brown, at the time. A few months later I ran into another girlfriend who was a &quot;big&quot; Rita Mae fan. She has lent me &quot;Six of One&quot; and I'm about half way through it - it is just has hysterical. My suggestion: Read &quot;Six of One&quot; first and then read &quot;Bingo&quot; (Have &quot;Bingo&quot; on your lap when you finish &quot;Six of One&quot; because you will not want the story to end!)"},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"Nicole \\"Nickle\\" Smith's life is more than slightly schizoid: she lives in Runnymead, a small town that straddles the Mason-Dixon line, with all the cultural division that implies; her life is dominated by her elderly adoptive mother Julia \\"Juts\\" and Juts' equally neurotic sister Louise \\"Wheeze;\\" the tiny newspaper she loves and works for is about to be sold out from under her; and she is a self-avowed lesbian having an affair with her best friend's... husband? Needless to say, the situation is ripe for comedy--particularly when St. Rose of Lima's weekly bingo game, at which most of the townfolk meet without fail, begins a move toward a big-pot game known as \\"Blackout\\" and Juts and Wheeze, both in their eighties, begin to compete over the same man.BINGO is not one of Rita Mae Brown's most literary efforts--it is too loosely structured for that--but it is surely one of her most beloved novels, effectively juggling eccentric characters and ridiculous situations with Brown's own take on modern morality. A particular joy are the supporting characters, which are presented with tremendous appeal: Mr. Pierre, the town's effeminate hairdresser; the massively overweight Verna BonTon and her endless family; the feuding law enforcement officers; the yuppie cub reporter--all presented with considerable aplomb and charm and sharpness. Everything adds up to one of the most hilarious things you'll ever read, a real can't-put-it-down, laugh-out-loud book that will have you sitting up half the night trying to silence your hoots lest you wake the neighbors. The setting, characters, and one-liners are extremely memorable, funny, and remarkably honest, and this is one you'll return again and again. I know I have! Recommended."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"Runnymede, MD has to be the oddest town ever created in fiction. Full of well-intentioned nuts such as the feuding town sheriffs and the protagonist's mother and aunt--Juts Smith and Wheezie Trumbull--Bingo picks up where the equally implausible _Six of One_ left off. This time, the story is from the POV of Nickel Smith, the adopted daughter of eighty-something iconoclast Juts. Nickel watches as the town newspaper battles corporate takeover and her mother and aunt battle one another over, well, everything, particularly the available octogenarian Ed Walters.At times, it's hard to believe that the town could be so crazy--there's no way Nickel's pets could be unconditionally welcomed wherever she goes--but if you stop and think about the desperate actions a small town will take to shake itself up, then perhaps there really is something believable about local yokels who fire a Civil War-era cannon in an attempt to separate two brawlers, and who obstruct justice to pull Aunt Wheezie's fat out of the legal fire. Who knows.Despite the frequent necessity to suspend disbelief, I laughed out loud several times and felt good whenever I dipped into _Bingo_. Rita Mae Brown obviously has fond memories of her past, and that reverence is clear and convincing in this semi-autobiographical look at Runnymede. If only my hometown had a cannon."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"First off, I loved Bingo and have re-read it many times. Many of my general thoughts are already well said in other reviews, so I want to add an offbeat one. Bingo also tells a story about a woman's love for her career, newspapering, and how that career is endangered by the sale of &quot;her&quot; paper to a big company. Brown nails that part of the story -- her descriptions of how it feels when the &quot;big guy&quot; arrives on the doorstep of the little paper are dead on. I lived through that same situation, with less happy results, and Nickel's reactions ring very true. In this era of mergers and buyouts, that's another reason to read Bingo. Share the book with a friend or three."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"I simply cannot imagine that ANYONE could read this and not absolutely LOVE it!! I've read it at least 10 times, and I've loaned out too many copies; time for another one. It's funny how you can learn so much from works of fiction; there's something to love and hate about all the characters and that's what makes this book so wonderful. I can honestly say I have a new appreciation for living life to the fullest and accepting people for who they are. Although I've enjoyed Ms. Brown's mystery books, what I really want is a third book to complete the stories told in Bingo and Six Of One. If you love books that are REAL and oh so touching, this and it's prequel are must haves. I also would like to see a sequel to &quot;Southern Discomfort.&quot;"},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"&quot;The stands cheered the skunk, not Ursie. The skunk stood her ground and shooed her babies back into the nest. She waited with cool precision for the arrival of this rabid human.&quot; A big grin covers my face and I chuckle as I read about the snobbish Ursie Yost being publicly humiliated as she chases a skunk. A gift of love to the main character, Nickle Smith, touches my heart. Bingo is a book that I will read time and time agian. It is a book filled with everything: joy, sorrow, pain jealosy, laughter, failer, success, romance, mischief, and love. Set in the New England town of Runnymede, the unforgettable characters weave in and out of the story,, always with a tidbit of gossip to share. Middle aged Nickle Smith is going through a period of time in her life that requires some major decisions. She is trying to by the newspaper wher she works as an editor. Her affair ends in an unexpected manner. And on top of that, her mother and aunt, the spirted Hunsenmeir sisters, argue and make public displays as they hanker after the same man. With the loving support of her family and friends, Nickle somehow pulls through. I recived a book for christmas called Loose Lips. I liked so much that I bought another book in the triogy, Bingo. There is another, Six of One , which I have yet to read and am looking forward to."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"My husband and I are Rita Mae Brown fans for sure! This book is no exception.

I guess she ran out of things to say in this one."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"This appears to be the first in the Juts and Wheezie series, told by Jut's daughter Nickel. The story moves well and the antics of the two elderly Hunnsemeier sisters are as amusing as usual. Brown harps a little too much about Nickel's alleged lesbianism(the only affair she has in this book is with a man)and the storyline is often inconsistent with either of the sequels, but it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"I read more than half the book and still nothing much had happened. I found not a whole lot to really like and cheer for in Nick. She seems flat and one dimensional.It seems the characters were used to advance a cause. I felt as though I was being preached to. The women in Six of One were gay and they lived their robust, colorful lives in the book with out any comentary on what we should feel about them. I loved them because they were real and and reachable. They just were what they were. They were a part of the beautiful woven fabric of Six of One. I felt like I was supposed to feel sorry for Nick in Bingo because she is gay. Why?"},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"I have read this book several times. I laugh, I cry. Then I tell someone new they need to read it for a good time. Rita Mae Brown has a great sense of humor and the human condition."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"If you were as enamored with the childhood antics of Nickel Smith as I was in Six of One, you will also welcome her adulthood antics in Bingo. Although Dr. Brown introduces new vibrant characters, none of them seem to reach the complexity and sheer genius of Celeste Chalfonte, Ramelle or the beloved Cora. However, the fact that I miss these characters, might prove that Dr. Brown has succeeded in stimulating within her readers a nostalgia for those who have died and for time past. Brown Brilliantly captures how time can change people and places alike in the most subtle ways. Good read."},{"Title":"Bingo","review":"Whenever I need a good laugh I read Rita.

Shelley's twin sister, Silke, calls to let her know that another girl has been found dead and like LaTonya, her body disappeared. Shelley knows the only way to find out what the connection between the two girls' murders is to go undercover as Silke at the local Goth bar, Heart of Darkness. There Shelley meets the enigmatic Jake DeAtley, but is he a friend or a potential suspect? Shelley knows evil exists, but is she prepared to accept that the murderer she seeks might be a vampire?Patricia Rosemoor does a wonderful job of pulling the reader into the Goth scene. The paranormal elements are well done and don't override the overall mystery to be solved. The dialogue is quick and laugh-out-loud funny. The interaction between Silke and Shelley is fun and I'm hoping that we will eventually get a story that focuses on Silke. Jake is extremely sexy and the chemistry between him and Shelley sizzles on the page. The only draw-back is the first person narration. The story flips between being told by Shelley and then through the eyes of other characters in the third person. Sometimes, it took me out of the story, but only momentarily, as Ms. Rosemoor does an excellent job of re-immersing the reader.

The tale never lets up until the climax as Shelley digs deep into a weird world that she knows should not exist.

An archeologist in South Africa, Camelia believes that she is poised the brink of a major discovery. Others, however, doubt the value of her quest, and encourage her to give up her career to return to a more ordinary existence. Instead, Camelia seeks out an inventor whom she has thoroughly researched, believing he can create a steam engine capable of ridding her archeological site of water so she might continue her dig.Inventor Simon Kent has little use for London society. His family periodically patents his inventions, but he is much more interested in discovering new things and allowing others to elaborate on the possibilities that might better society. Hard at work on a washing machine, he does not notice his interloper until she has been drenched with water. While he might be flattered by her interest in his work, Simon does not become willing to aid Camelia's quest until a mysterious fire guts his home. Then accompanied by a variety of guests, including Camelia's pet snake, bird and monkey, Simon embarks upon a life altering journey to South Africa.Author Karyn Monk presents a light and amusing read in EVERY WHISPERED WORD. Days after finishing the novel, I could not help recalling especially vividly realized and humorous tidbits, which would once again have me giggling. Camelia's intelligence, determination, and career choice nicely compliment Simon's own unorthodox lifestyle. Startling original, marvelously humorous, and wonderfully told, EVERY WHISPERED WORD is a must read.

So does Rupert (a two and a half foot long tiger snake), Harriet (a neurotic Grey Lourie bird), and Oscar (a mischievous, undisciplined monkey).Simon Kent did not hear the banging on his front door and would not have answered it even if he had.

Simon has too many inventions going on to consider stopping to help, no matter how beautiful and intelligent the odd lady is. He could not see how digging up old bones could possibly help the world. But someone out there does. Someone that will go to dangerous lengths to stop her, as well as anyone associated with her. Needless to say, Simon is soon traveling with Tisha and her strange companions to South Africa.***** Simon is one of the charming band of street urchins that was first introduced in \\"The Prisoner\\". That novel was followed by \\"The Wedding Escape\\" and \\"My Favorite Thief\\". Author Karyn Monk has endeared herself to thousands, if not millions, of readers by telling the love story of some of the now grown street urchins. Simon's tale is just as riveting as the others too! I found that I was unable to pull myself away for long. Tisha's animal friends often stole the show with their delightful antics and obvious intelligence. I did not want the story to end. I am counting the days until this author's next release. *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews"},{"Title":"Every Whispered Word","review":"From the back cover:In a conspiracy of hearts the survival of love depends on every whispered word...When Lady Camelia Marshall barges uninvited into Simon Kent's London laboratory with a business proposition, she finds the famous inventor not at all as she had imagined. Far from the elderly scholar she expected, Kent is handsomely disheveled, suprisingly brawny, and decidedly uninterested in helping her pursue the archaeological work of her late father that could make known to the world the stirring secrets of an ancient culture and the mysterious cave paintings of the lost Tomb of Kinds.Though intrigued by the strikingly unconventional beauty of Lady Camelia, Kent cannot fathom leaving behind his inventions and research to scrabble in the African dirt. But while he may not grasp the magnitude of Camelia's proposition at once, someone else does--someone willing to go to dangerous lengths to stop Camelia...and anyone associated with her. Suddenly, seduced by the sun-kissed hair and bronze skin of this gifted and indomitable woman, Kent finds himself drawn into a risky adventure that will lead him to an astonishing paradise he could never have imagined.And my review:I didn't expect to love this book, but I did expect to like it, as I'd enjoyed Karyn Monk's ONCE A WARRIOR, and never once had to force myself to finish it. Unfortunately, that was not the case with EVERY WHISPERED WORD.On the plus side, this book is written with Monk's trademark humor and attention to historical detail. Her characters are well-rounded \\"real\\" people. I especially liked the idea of two misfits (the mad inventor and the female archeologist) falling in love.It should be noted that while this book is part of a series, it also works as a stand-alone. I wasn't left feeling lost, even though I hadn't read any of the other books in the series. I won't get into a plot synopsis here, as I think many of the other reviews on this page do that quite nicely. But I will give you the reasons why this book got only two stars from me.I already mentioned the humor, which is always a plus in a romance. The problem here was that a lot of it was out of place. For example, there was a scene where the heroine, Camelia, gets attacked by a couple of ruffians intent on stealing her money and giving her a warning to stop her excavation work. The author goes off onto this completely unrelated tangent where the attackers are discussing about how one will know if the other's being sarcastic or not.(Paraphrased) \\"Well, I'll let you know when I'm about to say something sarcastic so that you won't pay any attention to it,\\" the first one says.\\"If I'm not supposed to pay attention to it, then why bother saying it at all?\\" the second one replies.\\"Okay fine, I just won't be sarcastic at all\\" the first one shoots back.Funny? Yes. Appropriate to the scene? No! The heroine is being restrained with her arms behind her back and a hand over her mouth. She's fighting for her life and the two men are taking the time to discuss their communications problems. It just didn't fit.The author also liked to do pages and pages of dialogue, often with no prose in between the phrases. After awhile, it was really annoying. I constantly found myself having to go back and count the lines of dialogue so I'd know who was speaking (odd lines: hero, even lines; heroine). This was distracting and made it a lot harder to lose myself in the story, which is ultimately what I want from a book.Fans of Monk's will no doubt want to buy EVERY WHISPERED WORD anyway. If you're a newcomer to this author's work, I suggest you borrow this book from the library, or try ONCE A WARRIOR, which was an enjoyable read, even if it's not a keeper."},{"Title":"Every Whispered Word","review":"Lady Camelia Marshall is a desperate archaeologist. She in charge of a dig site in South Africa that's flooded, plagued with setbacks, plus she's running low on money. Camelia decides that Simon Kent, a renowned inventor, is just the man to help her out of her predicament. However, she fails to convince Simon to do what she wants, which is to build for her a steam-powered pump.Camelia and Simon part ways, with Simon's detailed drawing of a steam-powered pump in Camelia's reticule, which she discreetly \\"borrowed\\" from his lab. But then two thugs, who have been hired to terrorize and warn her away from Africa, attack Camelia in an alleyway. Simon comes to her rescue. After making sure Camelia is safely ensconced in her carriage, he returns to find his house on fire. Camelia had unwittingly set her and Simon on a dangerous path to finish her father's archaeological work and to unravel the identities of those who are trying to prevent that from happening.This was an easy read and had a nice-flowing plot to it, even a little suspenseful. However, something was missing that would've made the story complete. The writing was okay but perhaps didn't adequately do justice to the characters. Our hero and heroine, Camelia and Simon, had only a few moments alone within the entire story but by the end, we're supposed to believe that they're desperately in love with each other. I think further convincing was definitely in order. If the author had spent more time developing the relationship between Camelia and Simon, and their feelings for each other, their love for each other would've been believable."},{"Title":"Every Whispered Word","review":"I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THE PRISONER WAS THE BEST BUT I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THATAFTER READING \\"EVERY WHISPERED WORD\\" WAS EVEN BETTER. \\"JAKES\\" STORY WAS GOOD, IENJOYED IT, CHARLOTTES WAS ALRIGHT, DRAGGED A LITTLE, BUT SIMON'S WAS FUNNY,INTRIGUING, HEART FELT AND NOT A SINGLE PAGE WAS BORING.

I LOVED THAT JAKE HAD A ROLE IN THE BOOK AND BY THE TIME IFINISHED THIS BOOK I FELT LIKE I KNEW ALL THE ENDEARING CHARACTERS PERSONALLY.HOW I WISH SHE WOULD WRITE ABOUT ANOTHER ONE WITH THE SAME CAST!"},{"Title":"Every Whispered Word","review":"In 1885 London, Lady Camelia Marshall visits the house of scientist Simon Kent hoping to persuade the genius to help her by building a special steam engine for her to use at an archeological site in South Africa where water has filled the hole. He says no and sends her on her way. Just outside his home, two thugs accost Camelia, but Simon rescues her using firecrackers to scare off her attackers. He escorts her to her carriage near a museum where he sees her driver is a black African Zareb and he has a monkey Oscar with him.When Simon gets home he finds his home on fire. He looks inside and realizez arson occurred. He visits Camelia to accuse her, but she logically explains why she would not cause the inferno that destroyed his inventions. In spite of Rupert the Snake and Harriet the Bird, he reluctantly agrees to accompany her to Africa to build a steam engine for her unaware that the De Beers Company covets her land and will do anything including sabotage and blackmail to prevent her excavation.This unique Victorian romance stars two delightful different protagonists than those who typically star in this sub-genre. The story line brings to life the South Africa late in the nineteenth century monopolistic influence of the De Beers Company even in an environs in which the \\"sun never sets on the British Empire\\" and the Boer War is over a decade away. The villain is a stretch, but readers will not care as Karyn Monk provides a powerful historical romance starring two fabulous lead characters and a terrific insightful comparative look at a bygone era in London and South Africa.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Every Whispered Word","review":"I liked the premise of this book--it had a different twist--nerdy inventor, etc. But, it was boring. I couldn't get into it and the book never got going. I finally ended up skimming, which is the death knell of a book. I happened onto a love scene and from what I could tell, it was one of the first. I couldn't believe it. The heroine went from an inexperienced young lady to woman of the world lickety split!! I felt this scene really bordered on the unbelievable. As far as I could tell, the couple had barely even kissed before. Unfortunately, that scene didn't improve the book for me.

However, I felt the look of the comic itself was too scatterbrained. There are so many shots of character's mouths speaking to one another, and in general there are far too many frames per page.

It also tries to do too much, providing page after page of hotel, restaurant and museum listings by city but only a page of two of specific rail tips by country. The guide pushes Eurailpasses, as is to be expected from a publication endorsed by Rail Europe, the main stateside pass vendor.Points to watch out for...The guide is too optimistic about reservations and supplements. As the various continental railways move toward inevitable privatization, more and more premium services are being introduced. Most of the trips that tourists are likely to take will require reservations and supplements, in addition to Eurailpasses.The guide doesn't give point-to-point tickets a fair shake, listing full prices and only the most basic discounts. For example, SNCF's \\"Prem's\\" specials (advance purchase online tickets to French and international destinations) aren't mentioned. For many tourists, these specials would make point-to-point tickets cheaper than Eurailpasses.The guide lists only expensive, tourist-class hotels. I didn't see a single listing below 100 Euros in Paris, for example. There are many excellent, if humble, hotels throughout Europe. Use the Web to get current hotel information.My favorite example of out-of-date information in the guide has to do with the regional express train (\\"RER\\") from Roissy Charles-de-Gaulle aiport to Paris. The guide lists both first and second-class ticket prices, even though the first-class designation disappeared years ago."},{"Title":"Frommer's Europe by Rail","review":"I found this guide very useful in plotting out where I wanted to go, how to get there, and what to visit. It was also nice to know about the student discounts at various attractions. I didn't use it for the hotel recomendations, and I used a few of the restaurant ideas, which were usually excellent choices. I traveled all over Europe (12 countries) using this book, the maps provided, and my Eurail. It was helpful in figuring out the ferry options to get from Western Europe to Scandinavia as well. I definately recomend this book to anyone traveling to Europe, as I found it very easy to use as well as useful."},{"Title":"Frommer's Europe by Rail","review":"In trying to decide which book to get for traveling around Europe for a few months by rail, I looked through this book, Let's Go Europe 2008, Rick Steves Best of Europe 2008, and Europe by Eurail 2008. The latter of these was broken down into sections devoted to major cities, and day trips by train from those cities, which seemed too much like a trip organizer for me. Rick Steves didn't really include the practical point-to-point info I was looking for. Let's Go Europe was comprehensive, but the city maps just weren't that clear.At the beginning of each chapter (one per country), there's a map of the whole country, then in each city's subsection is a map of the city center with the train station clearly marked. There's a paragraph on each city's train station information, followed by information elsewhere and how best to get around the city. This is important to me, as I wanted a book that'd help me get my bearings upon arriving in a city. Let's Go is similarly formatted, and I think Fodor's is too, but this was the only one with this format geared specifically toward rail travel that I came across. This book also includes a nice laminated tear-out rail map, but I bought a separate map with more detailed city-to-city schedule info, and am also supplementing with timetables from eurail.com.Before buying this, I had read the review mentioning that there's some out-of-date train ticket info in this book, but I feel like that's a risk you run with any book. It's true, though, that this book alone won't give one a clear understanding of specific ticket options and prices. Europe by Eurail gave a better explanation of these; you may want to glance over it in a store, or just visit www.ricksteves.com/rail or wikitravel.org/en/Eurail."},{"Title":"Frommer's Europe by Rail","review":"A very well written guide for anyone traveling in Europe.

And then a whole new world was presented to me - this is one of the most engaging novels I have read in a long time! William Kennedy's realist Albany drama about the humanity behind bum-dom is vibrant, humorous, grotesque and ultimately unforgetable...If you have seen the movie, you are at a loss - even though the movie is not bad. However, the film is such a sanitized Hollywood version of the hard-core images presented to us in the text - the feelings, the thoughts, the humor, the smells, and the alternate realities of the two main characters can only really be felt through the clenching prose.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"I have to admit that I had never heard of William Kennedy or IRONWEED when I ran across the book on the sale table at a local book store. I picked it up because the price was right and I'm always interested as to why certain books get a Pulitzer Prize.With no knowlege of Kennedy and his work, I did some research before I started the book. An outline that I found on line with discussion questions for each chapter was great. Getting background on the characters is a must for this book.This is not an easy read and would be totally confusing if the reader did not understand the technique that the author uses wherein he has the dead talking to the main character.In some respects this book is like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is about the permanent underclass and how they live. It is about a man that is hopelessly lost in a situation of proverty. He has caused the death of his own son and other men and in a sense he is cursed. But Francis does have a good side that shows throughout the book.There are tragic women in the story and tragic lives of men who have chosen a path in life that has no happy ending.IRONWEED is certainly not long.

In 1938, for some reason that even he doesn't know, he returns to his hometown of Albany to face the people he loved and left behind, and the ghosts of his past.

This is the kind of book that makes you reconsider those you ordinarily dismiss, like those imperfect men and women we see everyday on freeway offramps with a sign in one hand and a cup in the other for change. This novel rightfully earned Kennedy a Pulitzer. A few more like this and he should get a Nobel."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"I read this book for the first time over 10 years ago.

Several of the characters are in both, and several plot points from the earlier novel enhance the tapestry of &quot;Ironweed.&quot; This is a great novel, one that I will treasure forever."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is a highly evocative book of the life of a skid-row bum in 1930s America--in many ways one of the most evocative accounts of this type of experience I've read since Grapes of Wrath. And yet, I found the book ultimately disappointing. Francis Phelan's character fails to advance in a meaningful way; and thus, the story itself seems static. The story failed to pull me along, and I found myself strangely uninterested in the ultimate fates of the major characters. Part of the problem, I think, is that Phelan's character is a bit implausible. He is portrayed, in some ways, as too good to be true. It is hard to reconcile his altruistic behavior toward the deserving with his murderous past. I also found the sex scene with Katrina overwritten to the point of being incomprehensible. What does this mean, for instance: \\"Francis embraced Katrina, and shot into the her the impeccable blood of his first love, and she yielded up not a being, but a word: clemency.\\""},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"I was a bit underwhelmed by this book- although that might have been part of the point. As it gives us a glimpse in to the tragic lives of a few locals, it also gives us a taste of their aimlessness, their rage, and their sorrow.You cannot help but sympathize for the characters (which almost feels condescending), but also it made me wonder: how close are all of us to the edge? What might happen in my life that might cause me to become lost? If anything, this story shows that no one can ever really know what their future holds, and that we should appreciate what we have because it could ALWAYS be worse."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"William Kennedy's Ironweed is a skillfully crafted work of art. Billy Phelan is an often-drunk, murderous bully and, at other times, a very compassionate and generous person. This is not an unusual combination. He is running from mistakes of the past, and creating new problems along the way. Billy is an unlikely likeable character, and we want him to overcome the ruinous side of his personality.The book successfully employs unusual literary devices and great metaphors. These literary devices include (1) the \\"living\\" dead in the cemetery, (2) the seemingly real ghosts that constantly haunt Billy Phelan, (3) temporary shift from past to conditional tense near the end of the book, and (4) the mixing of vivid memories into the current situation which tends to blur time and place.Kennedy composes many haunting metaphors. Here's one: \\"Helen now sees the spoiled seed of a woman's barren dream: a seed that germinates and grows into a shapeless, windblown weed blossom of no value to anything, even its own species, for it produces no seed of its own; a mutation that grows only into the lovely day like all other wild things, and then withers, and perishes, and falls, and vanishes.\\""},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This novel is highly stimulating for the mind's eye, but lacks the impetus to draw one's heart to any of the characters. The statement that \\"Phelan's character is implausible,\\" is the strongest statement that I agree with. The character of Francis Phelan is definitely to good to be true. Someone in his circumstances would definitely not be in the hunt to do good deeds.The scene in the book that captures this implausibility inexplicably is in the final chapter. It is where Francis, Rudy, Old Shoes Gilligan, Andy Which One, and Michigan Mac were all standing around the fire in the jungle. A drunk Francis was told by Andy that a guy in a piano box had a baby who had not eaten. This drunk Francis rips the food from Mac, the food that he just gave him, and runs it over to the family of the stranger? This is not the attitude of a man who, just a few minutes before, kicked the crap out of a man for asking them to keep quiet! His schizophrenia of being a total drunk and whack job to being an angel to a stranger and his family in just a few minutes entirely supports this fantasy of him being a conceivable character. The continuation of him being a saint in his own eyes, while he kills and maims other human beings, helps lend to the unbelievable thought pattern of Mr. Kennedy.The two whole days spent in this bum's life, with the never-ending flashbacks to murder, mayhem and lost loves, leaves the reader lost and confused. All these glimmers of ghosts and how their deaths were brought about makes it nearly impossible for the reader to put themselves in the shoes of any of the characters (unless they have killed someone).In my opinion a good novel should have the structure of good verses evil. This novel had none of this structure. The dividing lines of good verses evil were at best fuzzy gray. There was no one character that stood out from the crowd. There was not one character that would make me want to be that character or even want to be around that character. The supposed good of Francis Phelan was never portrayed as a turn for the better. The good portrayed was quickly over shadowed by his arrogance, self pity, guilt, and murderous deeds.Here is one prime example of this never-ending cycle of almost being good. He goes home after twenty plus years to see his family, a good deed, leaves because he feels guilty and then goes out and gets drunk with the money his son willingly gave him. Then, after feeling ten foot tall and bulletproof, murders a policeman doing his job. Francis does something good, then he is pushed into some horrible evil. These same kind of acts happen all through the novel.This novel left me disheartened, empty, confused, and filled with despair. If this novel is what great writers are about, then I need never read a novel again."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"A mediocre diversion, sententious and banal, grossly--or rather, grotesquely--over-rated."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is the absolute worst Pulitzer winner I've ever read. Were there no other books written in 1983? The author is constantly switching around in time and place in his story. Just when you think someone's dead, they show back up again in the narrative. This makes for a very confusing read. I suppose it's written like we remember things from our lives: out of order such that the past and the present, the dead and the living all intertwine.Frankly, I wasn't impressed. The main character, Francis, leaves his wife and family and becomes a bum after he accidentally drops the baby on its head and kills it. 20 years later, he's a nearly toothless drunk drifting from mission to abandoned building to stripped car every night looking for a place to lay his head. And he carries all the ghosts of the past with him in his memories. He refuses to come home even now because he still feels the need to do penance for dropping the 13-day-old baby on the head (among other deaths he has caused along the way involving cracked skulls).

It is a quick and easy read, but as a story it is too obscure for me to rate 5 stars. it opens at a moment in the life of its main character, a hobo \\"bum\\" picking up a few dollars for his next bottle of wine by filling holes in a cemetery, and ends a few days later with the protagonist leaving on a freight train going \\"somewhere\\" warm. There is violence, humor, death and reflections on life and death.A chronicle of lives wasted, it presents no optimistic moments, no hope for a change and a bleak catalog of lives heading for death without meaning or purpose.A strange book but one that I recommend."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This book was a real page-turner. I could not put it down. It is alternately entertaining and depressing but the writing is top notch throughout. It reminds me of Grapes of Wrath in plot but so much better and tighter. Light years better.

While we certainly come across characters who fit this description, we see that beyond the rot and filth, these people still have a history, a past, and a soul....although they may not necessarily have a long future ahead of them.FULL REVIEW:[...]"},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is the story of a man who has faced tragedy and has lived the rest of his life paying for it. Francis Phelan has returned to his home, Albany as a drunk and a bum. He drifts from place to place sometimes sleeping outdoors, sometimes working and more often than not drinking heavily. He is not atypical in that it is the Depression and there are many poor, down and out people.His life wasn't always this way. He was a great baseball player who enjoyed a stint in the majors. He was married. He did work. He did have a child. During a strike, he killed a man with a rock. This still haunts him to some degree. More haunting is trhe fact that he accidentally dropped his baby son. This is what drove him to his current life.For the life he lives, he has tried to maintain relative goodness and he is, for the most part a good man.He sees and talks to the dead people of his past. He has drifted with the same woman for the past nine years.This is a sad story of a man in pain.

The gravity of the sorrowful lives of the characters with unconsolable past and precarious present is so palpable without the drama, but the emotional impact is powerful. The writing is perfectly balanced and insightful inspite of the dramatic nature of events and circumstances. The protagonist's unforgiving attitude toward self and the world is beautifully described throughout the book, \\"But because his vision of the next world was not of the hour of heaven where the legion of souls in grace venerate the Holy Worm, but rather of a foul mist above a hole in the ground where the earth itself purges away the stench of life's rot, Francis saw a question burning brightly in the air: How should this man pray?\\" A good book!"},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"William Kennedy is, at least in his Albany stories, my kind of writer. He writes about the trials and tribulations of the Irish diaspora as it penetrated the rough and tumble of American urban WASP-run society, for good or evil. I know those people, their follies and follibles, like the back of my hand. Check. Kennedy writes, as here, about that pervasive hold that Catholicism has even on its most debased sons and daughters, saint and sinner alike. I know those characteristics all too well. Check. He writes about that place in class society where the working class meets the lumpen-proletariat-the thieves, grifters, drifters and conmen- the human dust. I know that place well, much better than I would ever let on. Check. He writes about the sorrows and dangers of the effects alcohol on working class families. I know that place too. Check. And so on. Oh, did I mention that he also, at some point, was an editor of some sort associated with the late Hunter S. Thompson down in Puerto Rico. I know that mad man's work well. CheckThe above, in a tangential way, gets you pretty much all you need to know about the why of reading this book (and other stories by Kennedy), except a little something about the plot line. Well, that is fairly simple. Old time baseball star Fran and his erstwhile companion, a gifted singer, Helen are drunks working their way through the edges between skid row and respectability. And, mainly, losing to the lure of the bottle and to the hard, hard struggle that it takes just to get through the day when your options are limited. Put that task together with trying to survive in the jungles, with its endless twisted characters, of Great Depression (that other one in the 1930s) Albany, trying to figure out when life went wrong and trying to figure out why it all went wrong- while fighting a losing battle against society's expectations- and one's family's. This will provide enough dramatic tension to keep you interested. Oh did I mention that Kennedy writes with verve, with an uncanny understanding of his characters (although only Fran and Helen get the full treatment here) and with no holds barred, or punches pulled down there on cheap street. See, that is why Kennedy and Thompson connected in the literary world. They KNOW the under side of life. Read this thing, please."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"With Ironweed, William Kennedy completes his three novels of Depression-era Albany, wrapping up this study of time, place, and people with an emotionally gripping Pulitzer Prize-winner (1984) that focuses on those who call themselves \\"bums,\\" all of them living apart from society because their dreams have died. Francis Phelan, long-absent father of Billy Phelan, the main character in the previous novel, Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, returns to Albany for the first time in twenty-two years. In the previous novel, which concludes a week before Ironweed begins, Francis reconnects with his son Billy, who, stunned by Francis's reappearance, gets him out of jail, gives him money, and begs him to visit his mother and the family.Francis, a former pro ballplayer, lost his career when he lost part of a finger in a fight. He abandoned his wife Annie and his family when he accidentally dropped and killed his 13-day-old son Gerald, an act for which he still atones. Francis, however, now discovers from Billy that Annie has never revealed to anyone how Gerald died, a proof of forgiveness that Francis finds astounding.For the past nine years Francis has been living on the road with another down-and-outer, Helen Archer, who managed one year at Vassar studying classical piano before her father died and her life fell apart. Smart and perceptive about people, Helen, like Francis, has tried unsuccessfully to find solace in the bottle, and now, suffering from a tumor and the effects of alcoholism, she tries to make peace with herself and her life. Both Francis and Helen understand that they have chosen their lives, and they cast no blame on others or on fate. Their many acquaintances all have similar stories, and as these stories interweave and overlap, Kennedy endows them with a tenderness of feeling and, sometimes, with an overwhelming violence which stun the involved reader with their power.As Francis relives events in his life, his inner world takes shape. The opening scene, a trip to the cemetery, where Francis visits his parents' graves and that of baby Gerald for the first time, is one of the most dramatic openings ever written, and as Francis converses with his lost family, he establishes the contrasts with his present life. Scenes in which Francis, cursed with a hair-trigger temper, literally fights to the death alternate with scenes involving Annie and his family; scenes of his childhood and adolescence alternate with sad scenes involving the deaths of his homeless friends.A book so good it will leave you reeling, Ironweed tears at the heart without showing a trace of sentimentality, depicting hard lives lived by down-and-out people, most of whom still possess the redeeming virtues of the more saintly who live \\"normal\\" lives. Hard-edged, sometimes violent, and even cruel, it also reveals human kindness, sweetness, and love. Kennedy's naturalistic style and ability to create realistic dialogue give life to the stories of these characters and leave the reader with new insights into the nature of family ties, the choices we make, the forgiveness sometimes offered by others, and the nature of redemption if we choose to accept it. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"In life, we all make mistakes, some more than others. People do not grow into faultless perfection. That is something that is done through hard work and deep thought, and even then, it is not fully achieved - much to our dismay. People sometimes unsuccessfully surrender themselves to their fantasies, their ideologies, and thus, make big mistakes, for to err is human. The protagonist in William Kennedy's Ironweed - Francis Phelan - is certainly no exception. He is a man who has made one too many mistakes. From the murdering of a scab, to his accidentally killing his son, to taking refuge in alcohol, to family abandonment, it becomes a grim picture of a life not worth living. All this stretches out before and beyond the Great Depression of 1929.In youth, Francis had looks, health, vitality and a burgeoning baseball career that included such notables like Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker and Eddie Collins. But then it all disappeared to mediocrity and then into something even less than that. One would figure, like Job in the Bible, Francis would scream, &quot;God, wht hast thou forsaken me?&quot; He does not do that. In that respect, that is what makes this novel so refreshing. It does not evolve into a pity party, although the theme, plot and environment would lead a reader to think otherwise. Francis and his associates, specifically Helen Archer and Rudy, just propel themselves onward, despite or until mental and physical difficulities impede them. The characters don't whine or pout; they just deal with it. When the joys of life ebb away into that which we do not think we can handle, that's when the true self emerges, the thick skin manifests itself during adversity.Despite what I have written, it is not all grim and tragic. Far from it. In darkness there is light, and that is especially true in the latter part of the book. The jocularity of the dialogue and semi jocund personalities of the characters give this novel an uplifting air of hope and possibility. And it makes one belive that no matter how dark our times may be, no matter how tragic our circumstances are, somewhere, in the far off distance, there is a gleaming ray of hope at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"I had to read this novel for my AP english class and i wasn't exactly looking forward to reading it. But once i got down to reading it, the book took on a life of its own. William Kennedy's brilliant prose and selection of words defined the character of Francis Phelan. The reader can truly feel sorrow, joy, disgust with each action of Francis, all through the excellent writing of Mr. kennedy. The book is a sad look on a depressing era, but it is also a novel that demonstrates the love and bond of family and the tenacity of human nature to hold on. A great book...highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is a novel about a bum in Albany, New York in 1938. It won a Pulitzer Prize and got a lot of critical praise. Right off the bat, you have to wonder. Serious fiction writers love to write books about bums and down-and-outers in America because they know they'll never be criticized for doing so and everybody will pretend to love it. Anything that shows the good ole U. S. of A. in an unsavory light--whether true or ridiculously impossible--is bound to be adored by the oh-so-enlightened literary set, so it is prudent to be suspect of something they seem to like so much.But this is a good one. Our hero, Francis Phelan, is a bum and he knows he's a bum and he routinely and humorously refers to himself and his acquaintances as such. When we meet him, he's 58, but much of the novel is in flashbacks so we get to see how it is that he got to this decrepit state. It's a great character study.Phelan, you see, is an angry man. A fighter. When wronged, he lashes out violently. These episodes occur throughout the course of his life and right up to the end of the novel, and though few in number, always result in his having to flee. First his job, then his town, and then finally his family after a catastrophic mishap with one of his children. Not an introspective man, and certainly not one to ever apologize to anyone about anything, the reader gradually begins to perceive that Phelan nevertheless has a sense of remorse--if not outright guilt--about all of this, which is what causes him to seek refuge on the outskirts of society. This is where he thinks he belongs. This is what he deserves.It is a tough, no-nonsense novel, about a tough, no-nonsense guy. Best of all is the novel's tone. Despite the fact that life has not always been fair--and that it occurs during the midst of the great depression is only one of his problems--there is no self-pity from the character whatsoever. None. And none from the author either. No tear-jerking sentimentality here; no turtles crossing the road and getting flipped over by swift and oblivious automobiles.The style is excellent also. Though told in a relatively straightforward manner, the reader is constantly aware that there is much going on right under the surface. There are also a couple of dreamlike, surreal sequences that are very effective, and towards the end the author dazzles us with the use of the future-perfect tense in a remarkable, extremely moving scene. This is great writing, and an accomplished, first-class novel."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Both dark and astoundingly, funny, IRONWEED is one of those books that never leave your memory. It doesn't last long on your bookshelf, though; you are always lending it out or re-reading some, if not all of it. Set in Depression-era Albany, IRONWEED is an unforgettable tale of one man's search to reconcile himself with a past riddled with calamity and many loves gone awry.The opening chapter, where protagonist Francis Phelan and his friend, Rudy, work as gravediggers for a day is as great a piece of dark comedy as the scene where Hamlet meets the gravediggers. I felt a sort of uneasiness about laughing at all of Francis Phelan's wisecracks, though. We know that they all stem from a life filled with pain, alcoholism, terrible coincidences, and frustrated dreams. Yet, he is a generous man. He will give those even more down-and-out than himself the last bite of his sandwich or the last sip from his bottle of cheap wine. And it is this sort of attitude--slivers of hopefulness out of seemingly permanent bleakness, generosity out of poverty, humanity out of an unfeeling world--that gives the book its life, humor, and appeal.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This Pulitzer Prize Winning entry in Kennedy's Albany Cycle of novels tells the story of Francis Phelan, an ex-baseball player, now bum, who is haunted by ghosts in Albany, NY in 1938.

No one in my family can discuss the particular incidents, for as they happened they were deliberately ignored.Of Kennedy's many achievements in &quot;Ironweed&quot; I'm most impressed by these two: the archaeology of our heritage of private suffering, and the poetry of our inarticulate ancestors. First person accounts of the isolated lives of the hapless poor are more than rare. Kennedy is well-educated in the history of his native Albany, and with threads of this great story he weaves Francis Phelan's humble tale. It is a lyric ballad for the poor souls who managed to bring children (like my grandparents) into this harsh, new world before meeting their unceremonious ends. In isolated moments of grace and dignity, Kennedy brings flickers of indelicate humor, intense beauty and slangy sweetness."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"The most intriguing aspect about William Kennedy's &quot;Ironweed&quot; is that, for a novel about so many depressing characters, it somehow manages a cheerful, if not optimistic, mood without degenerating into sentimentality or contrived plot devices. It takes place in 1938 in the poor Irish neighborhoods of Albany, New York, still reeling from the Depression.The protagonist is a 58-year-old bum named Francis Phelan. He didn't spend his whole adult life as a bum, though -- he used to be a third baseman for the Washington Senators, and a pretty good one at that. But a history of personal problems has brought him to his present station in life. It all started when, at twenty-one, he killed a scab trolley car conductor during a workers' strike, for which he was neither caught nor punished. Fifteen years later, his baby son died when he accidentally dropped him on the floor. Since then, he has been in self-imposed exile from his wife and his other two children, wandering around the country as a vagrant, a time in which he happened to kill another bum in a fight.Eventually Francis returned to Albany where, destitute and homeless, he works at odd jobs like grave digging and junk hauling. He maintains a somewhat distant relationship with his family; even though they love and forgive him and would like him to be a part of their lives once again, his lingering guilt keeps him from fully reaching out to them. Adding to his guilt is the fact that the story of his crime at the trolley strike was the subject of a play by a local writer, whose melodramatic, manipulative seductress of a wife had been Francis's first love.On the street, he drinks and hangs out with several other homeless friends, including a woman named Helen to whom promiscuity is a way to get a place to sleep on a cold night. Helen is an archetypal tragic figure; she came from an affluent family and was studying at Vassar to be a classical pianist when her father committed suicide, leaving insufficient funds for her to continue. Now, fattened and disfigured by a tumorous stomach, she drinks away her sorrows while waiting for death.The chronological structure of the novel is fairly complex, made more so by Francis's common subconscious visions of ghosts from his past, where he tries to rationalize his actions. There are recurring motifs of junk and weeds, symbols of the uselessness and ugliness of the unpleasant lives these homeless people suffer or have brought upon themselves to suffer. Despite the overall bleakness, however, some of the characters almost seem to enjoy their lives, even if just to drink; they're inspirited by their fatalism. Likewise, Francis -- a poor, hardworking man who made a few mistakes in his life and is willing to do the right thing by his family, and also a sort of labor &quot;hero&quot; with regard to the trolley strike incident -- often reminded me of Tom Joad, making this novel a worthy successor to John Steinbeck's epics of the down-and-out."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Good period piece (late depression) and geographic novel (upstate NY/Albany). The protagonist is a long homeless depression era bum and the story follows his life and the cast of others like him. Neither glamorizes nor justifies their lives, merely tells their story in a well written novel. This is the third book in a trilogy, but I was given this book as a gift, read it first, and it stands alone fine. I was told it was the best of the author's work. The story is full of tragedy, and steers clear of an unrealistically happy ending. Reminded me a lot of On the Road, set in a different time, with a different set of parameters. Not a light hearted novel; it is one that will grab those who are willing to invest themselves in reading a deeply insightfull book"},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the latest selection for a book club I've recently joined. The premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel. As I expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by Kennedy himself. Jack Nicholson plays the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his \\"wanna be\\" socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel.Set during the \\"Great Depression,\\" IRONWEED is a great look at the underbelly of society: drunks, homeless, impoverished, and in that regard the story is timeless. I enjoyed the characters' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots, but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption, forgiveness, and love. The love aspect may be hard to spot, but it is there, unconventionally, in many of the character's interactions.This favorable recommendation comes with a warning: it can be a depressing read, definitely not a happy one, and while I found it inspirational, it will not conjure any blithe emotions. IRONWEED is definitely not a June beach read, being more apropos to a long winter night, indoor, by a warm fire."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"It's difficult to know what this book is actually about as I assume Kennedy did not go the trouble of writing around 150 pages on the goings-on of riffraff - or \\"bums\\" as they are called in the US* - in the 1930s for no reasonIs it meant to be symbolic, with these members of the lower depths - mainly Americans of Irish origin - representing those for whom the American Dream became the American Nightmare?Or is it supposed to be some kind of American \\"Ulysses\\" in which the reader passes the day in the life of a character - a mutilated alcoholic called Francis Phelan - who is trying to escape from his past in which he killed several people, including his baby son?Don't ask me but be warned this is pretty hard going and depressing, right from the opening chapter where Phelan is working in the graveyard where his son is buried and ends up confronting the other people he killed.The writing is certainly powerful but I'm not really sure it is worth the reader making the effort to reach the end.* A term used for \\"buttocks\\" in UK English confirming once again that the US and the UK are two states divided by a common language."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"At 225 pages (a short 225 pages at that, with large type), this Pulitzer Prize winner can best be classified as a novella. It can be easily read in one sitting. Part of a series of short novels from the same era and featuring many of the same characters, it is the tale of a down and out, former baseball player, Francis Phelan, who turned to drink after the death of his infant son. Set in the depths of the Great Depression, the imagery and descriptive writing is excellent.Throughout the novel, Francis is beset by flashbacks and visits from ghosts of his checkered past, many of whom met their ends as a result of Francis's actions. A former streetcar conductor, with a wife and family, Francis fled his home in Albany following his murder of a strike breaking scab. A decade later, he returns to Albany, living on the streets as a \\"bum\\", with his common law wife, Helen, and a ragged collection of homeless winos.This is a very well written, powerful story. I do wonder, however, if many of the superlatives being accorded this short work are because it is a Pulitzer winner and not the other way around. I suspect that given this book to peruse, without awareness that it won the Pulitzer, most would acknowledge that it is a nice, little six hour read. That is pretty much how I found it."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Ironweed is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel focusing on the down and out Francis Phelan, a homeless bum living day to day on booze and whatever cash he can make on odd jobs. The novel is set in Albany, New York during the depression, from which Francis hails, and he spends part of his time trying to avoid his family and old haunts. Francis was once a professional baseball player with talent, but is now simply a homeless wreck. He lives is deep guilt over accidently dropping and killing his infant son, Gerald, as well has other violent and deadly acts he perpetrated. Eventually Francis makes contact with his family which provides some balm for his fractured conscience. The opening scene, where Phelan is working a day job as a gravedigger where he visits his dead child's grave sets the tone and emotion of the entire novel and all his actions, good and bad, have a deep meaning in understanding Phelan and his plight.This is a fairly short novel at just over 200 pages but it is a very deep and intricate portrait of man who has thrown his life away through bad choices and a violent temper. Given the brevity of the novel and the way all events hang together in one kaleidoscope of a somewhat fractured psyche, it's really best to read the book in on sitting."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"None too often does a book come along that makes you think of life, the wrongs done to yourself and to others.

This book has made its way into my personal top 10, and each time I read it, it never fails to bring me to tears.

The story, set in the thirties, is as true today as it was then. Gerald Phelan's violent nature and the accidental death of his infant son, cause him to hit the road.

Gerald's companion, Helen, is a former musician who fled to the street after a series of disappointments. They survive with all the other homeless eating at missions and sleeping in flop houses, old cars, seedy hotels, or cardboard boxes.When Gerald pays a visit to his family, he is amazed to discover that they would forgive his past and welcome him home.Kennedy's novel grittily describes the brutality and ugliness of life and survival on the streets.

I always find it humorous when I read reviews for great classics (The Lord of the Flies, The Grapes of Wrath, etc..) written by students required to read them for class, and they write a review referring to it as \\"the worst novel ever written\\", \\"boring\\", etc...2. Yet I picked up and read Ironweed, a Pulitizer Prize winning novel as well as being listed on the Top 100 Books List, and this book just didn't work for me.3. Where can I start: the dialogue is bad, the characters are overwrought caricatures...I kept getting the image of a Hobo Clown walking around with one shoe on, wearing a tattered checkerboard jacket.4. As Kennedy goes to great lengths to write about drunkeness and self-wallowing, I kept saying to myself \\"Let's get on with it!\\"5. To convey a sense of greater tragedy, Kennedy uses the manipulative technique of throwing out past tragedies/and strange deaths of almost every person that the main character, Francis Phelan, remembers from his past. (got hit by a truck, drowned in a bathtub, tripped over his shoes and fell in a well, etc...) There's another scene in which teh main characters are traveling down a road and a building in front of them explodes and bursts into flames. (I'm not making this up.) It's all actually pretty comical, except we're talking about a Pulitzer winning novel.6. Think I'm being too harsh. Check out this little snippet from the book:\\"He walked with an empty soul toward the north star, magnetized by an impulse to redirect his destiny.\\"And here's some dialogue between Francis and his drunk girlfriend:\\"It'd choke me.\\"\\"It won't choke you. You'll be glad for it.\\"\\"I'm not a phony.\\"\\"I'm not a phony either.\\"\\"You're not, eh?\\"I actually have to agree with some of the reviewers who wrote \\"I learned nothing and came away with nothing.\\"7.

The fiction that I've been randomly pulling off my shelves has been really good to me this year.This is part of William Kennedy's multi-volume Albany Trilogy, which would now be better-named the Albany Cycle. The subject matter didn't immediately speak to me, and sounded depressing (which it is). A Depression-era man named Francis Phelan lives in Albany, New York who leaves his family in shame after accidentally dropping and killing his infant son, and has decided to live on the streets. The rest of the novel is about meeting characters from his past, both alive and dead. In fact, one of the major themes is summed up by Kennedy in the first extraordinarily beautiful paragraph of the book:\\"Riding up the winding road of Saint Agnes Cemetery in the back of the rattling old truck, Francis Phelan became aware that the dead, even more than the living, settled down in neighborhoods. The truck was suddenly surrounded by fields of monuments and cenotaphs of kindred design and striking size, all guarding the privileged dead. But the truck moved on and the limits of mere privilege became visible, for here now came the acres of truly prestigious death: illustrious men and women, captains of life without their diamonds, furs, carriages, and limousines, but buried in pomp and glory, vaulted in great tombs built like heavenly safe deposit boxes, or parts of the Acropolis. And ah yes, here too, inevitably, came the flowing masses, row upon row of them under simple headstones and simpler crosses. Here was the neighborhood of the Phelans.\\" I was unable to put it down after those few sentences.The dead have a life uniquely their own, which they sometimes use to haunt the living. In fact, some of the major characters in the novel are dead.James Atlas has said that \\"his [Kennedy's] cycle of Albany novels is one of the great resurrections of place in our literature.\\" I can't help but agree. Robert Towers, in the New York Times Book Review, said it's \\"a kind of fantasia on the strangeness of human destiny, on the mysterious ways in which a life can be transformed and sometimes redeemed.\\" Sometimes, despite all the mulling I do over what I read, I simply have to leave it to people who have the words - better words than I have, certainly."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"I usually love books about the down and out, and this book is full of some very haunted, guilty and broken people, but it all feels just a bit too melodramatic and humorless for its own good. And that isn't helped by Kennedy, who is a very gifted prose stylist, but just can't seem to settle on what style or perspective he's going to tackle these people's misery from. That kind of bouncing around isn't necessarily a bad thing (hell, Malcolm Lowry makes it work great), but it seems like he's just trying to attack everything from every direction at once, which is too bad because when he does linger long enough on a single point of view he creates some really beautiful passages. If you're desperate to find out what it feels like to be a destitute Irish American living in depression-era Albany, go for it."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"We find ourselves on the seedy side of Albany, NY during the great depression in William Kennedy's novel, Ironweed. Francis Phelan who lives one day unto the next by any means he can with his lady friend and fellow bum, Helen, finds he must work to pay off the lawyer who defended him for registering to vote 21 times. First he works in a cemetery and then as a rag picker. When he is not working he drifts in alleyways, missions, and bars.Kennedy's work is full of emptiness and loss and a strange futile sense of hope. It is heavy and atmospheric. The winter is coming on and the reader cannot help to feel the chill of the bums in their tattered clothing. Throughout the book there is always the sense of what might have been for the characters. Francis, a former major league baseball player with heart and emotion, what would he have become if not for losing his grip and Helen we get a glimpse of her potential when she shyly steps to the microphone in a nightclub. Now in their 50's it seems they have nowhere left to go.Kennedy's prose is strangely beautiful and evocative in such a cold and squalid setting:\\"The new and frigid air of November lay on Francis like a blanket of glass. Its weight rendered him motionless and brought peace to his body, and the stillness brought a cessation of anguish to his brain. In a dream he was only just beginning to enter, horns and mountains rose up out of the earth, the horns --ethereal, trumpets--sounding with a virtuosity equal to the perilousness of the crags and cornices of the mountainous pathways. Francis recognized the song the trumpets played and he floated with its melody. Then yielding not without trepidation to its coded urgency, he ascended bodily into the exalted reaches of the world where the song had been composed so long ago. And he slept.\\"Ironweed is populated by various ghosts of the past who rise from their grave, climb aboard wagons and hang out in a hobo jungle. They chat, scold and lecture Francis as he journeys about the city of Albany. His mother braids dandelion roots in her grave in the Albany cemetary. They lend a strange and eerie air to the already atmospheric novel.Ironweed is not a novel I can say I enjoyed, but I appreciated it for its story, the relationships of the characters, the sense of beauty and depth in the midst of such desolation and its wonderful prose."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"\\"I believe we die we can't stand it anymore. I believe we stand as much as we can and then we die when we can[.]\\". This is the belief of one of the main characters of William Kennedy's \\"Ironweed\\", a sad novel about some truths of life - no matter how hard or easy it is.Kennedy's prose navigates between the crude and the poetic, detailing mostly the inner life of a group of homeless in the late 1930's Albany. Those were times of difficulties, shattered lives, broken hearts and frozen bodies. Francis Phelan, an ex-baseball player, has ghosts in his life, real and metaphorical ones. In his past he killed a man and accidentally his baby child. Now, some twenty years later, he is back to his native town, and he has a homeless friend, Helen, whose life is also a sad one.The lives of these people, how the present is a denial of the promises in the past, are truly moving in \\"Ironweed\\" - not because Kennedy makes of their lives and problems a valley of tears, but because the human condition, when properly depicted in a work of art can be something at the same time sad and moving.According to Helen, we die when we stop caring about. We don't need to be actually dead to be dead. The people in the novel are most of the time dead inside and for the world. But there are moments, luminous ones, when Kennedy penetrates inside their hearts and minds and then we, readers, can realize that their death is not so real as the characters want the other ones to believe. In these moments, the author reminds us that the human condition is something irrevocable."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Francis Phelan is 58 and haunted by his past. In his view guilt is all he has - but query whether he is morally culpable or simply the victim of recurrent ill fortune. Among the things that haunt him are three deaths: of a scab killed by a rock that Francis threw during labor violence in 1901, his infant son who slipped out of his hands, and a bum who attacked him with a cleaver. He has spent much of his life in flight from these and other transgressions, real or imagined, and for the past twenty years he has been what the settled world would characterize as a bum. In late October 1938 Francis returns to his home city of Albany, he is re-introduced to his family (wife, son, and daughter), and he confronts many of his old demons while life conjures up some new ones to deal with.Francis Phelan often has slept in the weeds and some might think of him as a sort of human weed, but undeniably a very tough one. Hence, it seems, the title of this novel. IRONWEED is the third in William Kennedy's \\"Albany\\" cycle of novels and in 1984 it won the Pulitzer Prize. I, however, like it slightly less than I did its two predecessors, \\"Legs\\" and \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\", though IRONWEED certainly is both ambitious and powerful. (By the way, I have not seen the 1994 movie starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, for which Kennedy wrote the screenplay.)Francis Phelan had a cameo role in \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" (Billy Phelan is Francis's son) and, chronologically, IRONWEED picks up on the heels of, and includes many references to people and events from, that earlier novel. But IRONWEED nonetheless is a stand-alone novel. Indeed, though all three novels share certain characters and incidents, each can profitably be read by itself. Of the three, \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" is the one in which the city of Albany (Irish-Catholic-Democratic Albany) is most prominent. \\"Legs\\" was more about gangsters and IRONWEED is more about another feature of the Depression Thirties - bums. Few novels depict their forlorn world and lives so compassionately and memorably. \\"By their talk to each other they understood that they shared a belief in the brotherhood of the desolate; yet in the scars of their eyes they confirmed that no such fraternity had ever existed, that the only brotherhood they belonged to was the one that asked that enduring question: How do I get through the next twenty minutes?\\"IRONWEED contains some brilliant scenes (perhaps foremost is the one in which Helen, who once attended Vassar but now is plagued with an abdominal tumor and sleeps in an abandoned car, sings \\"My Man\\" in a piano bar and brings down the house). It also contains many passages of superb writing. For me, however, the novel does not hang together. Kennedy tries to do too much; he and the novel are pulled in too many directions. Towards the end of the novel, Kennedy writes: \\"Francis was now certain only that he could never arrive at any conclusions about himself that had their origin in reason. But neither did he believe himself incapable of thought.\\" That seems also to summarize author Kennedy in this novel. There is an ambivalence, or ambiguity, as between reason and insanity, order and chaos, that I ultimately find mildly unsatisfactory. That said, I am glad I finally got around to reading the novel after having owned it for a quarter century.P.S.: The title to this review is from the novel's epigraph, which in turn is from Dante's \\"Purgatorio\\"."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"In a slim volume which won him the Pulitzer, William Kennedy brings us deeply and emotionally into a world most of us will never experience: we are in the life and in the head of Billy Phelan, a homeless, alcoholic Irish-American with talent, street smarts and an unshakable sense of ethics. This combination proves captivating as we follow his movements and conversations over only a few short days. Though stark and honest in his handling of tragedy, Kennedy brings a believable and much appreciated redemption to this story. It is one of the most masterfully written and moving novels I've read in years."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is a story about Francis Phelan, ex-ball player, father, and husband who is now a skid row bum. There is also Helen who could have been a singer or a college graduate. She is a cultured, tragic lady who is on the streets with Francis.What was, what is, and what could have been is interwoven with the pain and starkness of what is now. This is a poetic and hard hitting look at street people and street life. It is a painfully hard hitting book."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Ironweed is a wonderful book but so very tragic. Set during the Depression it's very entrenched in the viewpoint of a Catholic Ireland emmigrant. One of the central tragedies is Francis, when he's been drinking, drops and kills his new born son. He can't deal with what he's inadvertantly done and leaves thinking if he stayed he'd do more harm to his family and be hated. I'm glad this book was short because I set it down with a heavy heart."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"William Kennedy paints a picture with his words of a drunken, delusional bum who wants to do good in life, but keeps running from anything he can't solve with his fists or a pint. The story is almost entirely cerebral, with conflict being internal, but with a sprinkling of physical conflict that accentuates the character's dichotomous morality. A wonderful look at the confusing reality surrounding a man trying to make the best of the hole he dug and continues digging for himself."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Ironweed is number 92 on the MLA 100...and that underrates it. This is a five-star book. A Great American Novel. A magnum opus. Canon-worthy. Kennedy is not just talented...he is brilliant. Maybe not a genius, but definitely not too far from that floor.The only caveat I can think of is that you may have to be an American to fully appreciate the book...there is a definite wavelength to the writing that may be difficult for non-Yanks to pick up and surf on. But if you are American--and especially if you are from Albany, New York--you owe it to yourself to read this book. It will not be a chore, believe me."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"William Kennedy certainly deserved the Pulitzer Prize for his novel Ironweed, a bleak and insightful tale of Depression-era Albany. It is the story of the down-and-out alcoholics who call themselves \`bums\\". Francis Phelan, the main character of the story, is a defeated man and yet throughout the novel you see glimpses of promise, of the ability to care about others, survival judgment, and knowledge of his fellow-man. Yet life has beat this man and alcoholism keeps him down.Francis has long been absent from his family and it is a telling chapter when he returns to his wife, adult son, and adult daughter. The level of forgiveness from his family is heartbreaking and yet Francis can not return to the loving confines of family.Francis was once a superb ballplayer but through his own foolishness and fist fights he lost part of a finger, making it impossible for him to continue his ball playing career. His wife Annie obviously still loves him and has never told the terrible secret as to how their young son Gerald died. It is this terrible accident, when Francis lets 13 day old Gerald fall from his hands and hit the floor, that seems to haunt Francis and for which grief and guilt still hang on his every movement. Even though Annie has forgiven Francis, it is clear that he has not forgiven himself. This novel is excellent in showing the complexity of alcoholism's interactions with grief and guilt. Does the alcoholism result as a product of the grief and guilt, or does the alcoholism allow Francis to forget his grief and guilt, or does the alcoholism keep Francis from moving beyond the emotions of grief and guilt. It is the superior aspect of this novel that it explores alcoholism without providing easy answers to these complex questions.The tragic story of Francis is not the only story we follow in this short powerful novel. Francis has lived for the past 9 years with another alcoholic, Helen Archer. In the character of Helen we see a mixture of fragility and survival. However, most of all we see how alcoholism sets up the daily insults and assaults on Helen's self-worth, her dignity, her health. A homeless female is very vulnerable and even if she and Francis have bummed around together for 9 years, Helen has been assaulted and pushed into sex acts for pitiful rewards such as being allowed to sleep in a car backseat for a night. Yet Helen was originally composed of more fragile and refined material when she was a music major at Vassar before the death of her father. Francis now suffers from an untreated and growing tumor.Yet this couple is perceptive, manipulates daily for a place to spend the night without freezing, and is part of a pitiful social network of other down-and-out alcoholics and homeless drifters. This life can be violent and we see the horrors of life on the streets from the perspective of those forced to live under these conditions.This book is excellent. It is powerful, speaks of the tenacity of the human spirit, conveys the hardships of human existence without sentimentality, and reveals human characters with whom the reader bonds despite their pitiful situations. It should be revived as the American classic masterpiece which it is."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This novel won the Pulitzer Prize for good reason. The hard luck tale of Francis Phelan is artfully written - sad, funny and inspiring. William Kennedy's imagery and insight on old Albany reveal a fascinating history that I had often felt just beneath the surface of the modern city. I breezed though this book quickly, in a trance."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"In \\"Ironweed\\", William Kennedy gives us an honest look at Depression-era homelessness, without either trivializing the hardship or glamorizing the dangers inherent in life on the road. There is not an iota of sappy sentiment in \\"Ironweed\\". In fact, the story of Francis Phelan, former third baseman for the Washington Senators, now a 58-year-old alcoholic bum, can be downright depressing, but not relentlessly so. Although Francis is living with the legacy of his lifetime of mistakes, big mistakes including three deaths and the specters of those he wronged in life, he somehow manages to maintain some measure of dignity and self respect, as do his king-of-the-road cronies. Francis, while flawed, symbolizes belief in the possibility of forgiveness and hope of redemption. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Kennedy has written a wonderfully, disgustingly, evocatively human tale that will hold up for the ages.

Unfairly labeled a Regional writer; his writing is universal, timeless.Kennedy is the most well-rounded writer of literature to be writing since the days Hemingway and Fitzgerald roamed the globe."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"\\"Ironweed\\" is easier seen as portrait than novel because this sublime book is nearly devoid of any conventional action or real conflict (it covers a mostly ordinary span of about 10 days). Still, it paints a razor-sharp picture of a down-and-out man living through the Depression. Francis' mindscape is brimming with ghosts. And they are all hard reminders of the many mistakes he's made.Francis' casual insights into the world around him (explosive labor tensions, turn-of-the-century major league baseball and the heavy drape of Depression that hung over the nation) are interesting as are the tragicomic depictions of the \\"bum\\" personalities who drank (and financed their drink) out of sheer desperation, and managed to survive on what sometimes seems like blind luck."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This is one of the great performances. Robards perfectly presents Kennedy's characters and beautiful prose, alternately blunt and lyrical.This tape is an unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"First of all, this book is well-written. Kennedy is very talented. However, the mood is bleak, depressing and one of desolation. It reminds me of the paintings by Edward Hopper, like &quot;Nighthawks&quot;. That is my main criticism - the pointlessness of this character's life. Let me quote a sentence from the book just to give you the flavor: &quot;...notable was his ability to understand...the slithy semaphores of the slugs and worms that moved above and through his earth.&quot; For me one book by this author is enough. ('slithy' isn't in my dictionary and I've only heard it in Lewis Carroll's poem 'Jabberwocky') Life has enough muck and mire as it is, thank you very much. In my mind, the book doesn't even begin to explain the mind of the skid-row bum. If it did, that would be an entirely different story."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"This book won a Pulitzer Prize and was ranked by the Modern Library as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century, and it is easy to understand why. It is a masterfully written story about an ex-baseball player (Francis Phelan) who has essentailly chosen (for reasons he is trying hard to understand) to become a bum. The location (Albany) and the era (the Depression year of 1938) are so vividly depicted that you are transported in time. The characterizations are extraordinarily sharp, and the tale is timeless. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"Having grown up in Troy New York it was with a very mixed feeling, a certain recognition and sadness I read the following passage. \\"The bus rolled south on Broadway following the old trolley tracks, down through Menands and into North Albany, past Simmons Machine, the Albany Felt Mill, the Bond Bakery, the Eastern TabletCombany, the Albany Paper Works.\\" This is the territory of my childhood in which on the junk trunk of R.K. Freedman we rolled along singing 'K-k-k-Katy.' This is the territory of those grey black gloomy skies and smokestacks of South Troy leading into the Menands Bridge and over to the capitol city Albany, scene of this heart-rending novel.Kennedy tells the story of those of one group of inhabitants of the Tri- City world, the 'bums'the drinking Irish , a group I in my childhood felt so threatened by and alien from.He however sees them from inside, humanizes them, makes them understandable and even sympathetic. He writes about them with precise unsentimental care and attention, love, perhaps.Francis Phelan the wanderer who returns home at the end of this work, the man who has left his family has his story told with unpitying realism. The other dropouts, losers from conventional society including his female companion of nine years Helen, the Vassar girl whose mother cheated her out of her inheritance and future, also have their stories told in harsh, tough, often mean dialogue. There is a power and spirit in the writing that is hard to describe. I would not actually say the book is funny or even humorous. And in fact many of the realities are truly grim and even cruel. But there is in the overall motion of the work a kind of positive, strong, life- affirming spirit. And the work has a number of incredibly moving passages."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"You may have seen the movie. You may feel it evokes Albany, NY.

Many are most likely surprised of the excitement over this book because of the difficulty Kennedy had trying to publish it. Kennedy immortalized the life of Albany in the 1930's, bringing unusual attention to all.In the novel it discusses survival on an ordinary man whose bad luck brings him to rock bottom causing him to discover in himself on things he can not understand. During Francis Phelan's life he killed a scab driver with a rock, his infant son by holding him by the diaper and accidentally dropping him, and killing an insane bum for self defense.Throughout the book the people he killed and others are ghost interacting with Francis as in the novel Hamlet.Overall I felt this was a very well written book and would recommend it for reading on the enjoyment level because of Kennedy's use of real life in the Big Apple during the 1930's."},{"Title":"Ironweed","review":"What a wonderfully written novel this is!

The ghosts appear to Francis as real people, each with a memory to a relate or a past wrong that Francis must make peace with.His past is full of regrettable mistakes: the &quot;scab&quot; he killed with a well-aimed rock, the infant he accidentally dropped, the insane bum he killed in self defense, the woman he left behind when his grief became too overwhelming, and the woman he now keeps company with, who has borne his rage and misery.Francis is a lost man, but the story of his coming to terms with all the pain in his existence is both haunting and uplifting.

His powerful, blood-seeped, historical novel &quot;All Souls Rising,&quot; traces the vibrant African will to freedom as it collides with the arrogant and brutal Colonial settlers of France and the mixed-bloods and others who sought to ride the horse of horrors. Though the land of Bell's imagination is confined mostly to the isolated half of the island known to Columbus as Hispaniola, and to the modern world as Haiti, the reader's imagination will be carried to events as fresh in their humanity as tonight's news reports. Through Bell's brilliantly informed imagination, the souls he births ring all too true-to-life, shudderingly so. Bell's creations will resonate forever in the minds the readers and chillingly so for those who have ever visited Haiti. The awful reality of Bell's world tell us, yes, it must have been that way and it reminds us that there can no other explanation for the world of the races as we know it today"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"Tremendous read!! Perhaps having background knowledge of Haiti and the revolution was helpful but I found this book immensely enjoyable! Unlike other authors, Professor Bell translates nearly every Kreole quip. The local language creates ambience and authenticity to the book. The characters are very personal and enjoyable developing a believable perspective of the slave uprising from every angle. The violence is not excessive or unnecessary. Haiti continues to be a country of extremes. The people can be incredibly gentle or horrifically cruel! If you don't mind feeling the oppressive humidity or continually swatting the stinging mosquitoes from your neck, this is a must read!! Thank you Professor Bell!!!"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"The book is a metaphor of what it means to be human. If you have ever asked yourself who is evil in the the world, where the line can be drawn between the good and evil in humanity then this is a book that will change you. Madison shows his virtuosity in literature in a brilliant display of what it means to be human and what humanity clings to as food for the soul. You learn of the grotesque poisons that one soul inflicts on another and the embrace of inner conflict when one accepts another, faults and all. The characters are for the most part deeply entwined in the the plot, in many different ways, and there are many of them, so be sure to make a list of characters, in the back of the book or somewhere, as you encounter them throughout the story. Rest assured this book is not perfect, but no novel is. At times you will face slowerer parts, and surely this book will test your anylytical skills, it will not be at the same level as &quot;See Spot Run,&quot; it is a difficult novel, but you will not be dissapointed at the end. At its conclusion you will feel as though you accomplished something more worthwhile than your job, and satisfyingly so. Don't be discouraged if it gets hard! Its worth it!"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"Very enjoyable, particularly from the point of view of the prose. Bell makes excellent use of the English language and uses a classical descriptive style. The result is a beautifully written book where the horrific, indeed sometimes gruesome, content is almost overlooked in it's lyrical descriptions. Stout plot, rousing period of history, lots of blood-curdling action, spoiled for me by a somewhat flimsy characterisation of the principals involved. Characters appear &amp; disappear with alarming regularity. Most are under-developed. Also the &quot;Frenchness&quot; of the background is intrusive to an &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; reader. Would have been happier with a final chapter that dealt more fully with the fate of the main characters. The book is certainly worth reading, but try to concentrate on the names from the start. I spent a lot of time checking back to see who was who!"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"The Haitian slave revolt was both extremely violent and extremely inspiring. Bell does a fantastic job of representing both sides of this. He begins with painting a picture of what pre-revolt life was like in Haiti. We develop an understanding of the characters, and establish a relationship with them.And then all hell breaks loose! I cannot over-emphasize the violence of this book. It is not unnecessarily so, however. To do any less would be a disservice to the facts. In order to appreciate the events that took place, we need to understand what people were experiencing.But it is appreciated that the violence is mostly limited to the middle of the book. Once the initial rebellion settles into more of a resistance, we begin to move forward and follow the stories without fear of the gruesome.The relationships in this book are beautifully painted, showing the love between races and the difficult emotions associated with being the half-breed child of a cruel slave master and his slave-woman mistress. When you're running for your life because the other side wants to kill everyone who is of one race or the other, what happens when you're half of each? Who do you trust? Who can trust you?If you are interested in Haitian culture or history, African-American history, or just history in general, or if you like a really good book, this is an excellent read. It was helpful for me that I understood some of the French (although translations are provided for some of the longer phrases) and that I've been to several of the places mentioned in the book. Anyone can read the book and enjoy it, but if you understand a little bit about Haitian Vodou and/or the history and culture, you'll appreciate it even more. There is a helpful chronology of historical events at the back of the book, as well as a glossary of Haitian Kreyol terms which helps the reader.Again, the book is EXTREMELY violent. Do not under-estimate my warning if you cannot deal with vivid mental images."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"So far the book is hiolding my interest.

The book was OLIVER WISWELL by Kenneth Roberts, and it was electrifying. I must have been about 13 at the time, and that tale of the American Revolution, told from the Loyalist point of view rocked my world. It not only put a completely different spin on the fundaments of our nation that I had been taught in school -- it showed me that history comprised opinion as well as fact. Further, I learned then as I have relearned through the years that intentional fiction tends to draw us into another era far more effectively than the purportedly factual histories writ lten as textbooks. (Although, certainly, a work like Howard Zinn's brilliant A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES (Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005), written from the point of view of men and women left out of the official records of the American epic, can be an exciting read.) It is a lesson I have just relearned again. ALL SOULS' RISING is a stunning work. The tale is that of Saint Domingue (Haiti) during the French Revolutionary era, when the French colony was in complete upheaval. It is a story of slavery and commerce, of plotting and armies, of racism and custom. Bell has managed to tell a tale of utter horror in a humane and compelling way that continually draws the reader in. Could human beings ever behave thus? Oh, yes, of course. We did and do, and the sections about hand-to-hand combat cannot help but cast shadows over the prospect of street fighting in Baghdad, if current plans pla ky out. Bell tells the story in multiple voices, letting us witness events from the European view, that of the African born slave, the island born creole, the soldiers and the planters. The primary tale is that of Toussaint Breda, a slave and self-educated doctor who became the first black ruler of the island nation (and who died in a French prison, during the course of a long and painful de-colonization process. Throughout the novel we are challenged again and again to answer: what makes us human? A brilliant work (and a National Book Award Finalist), I cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I loved this book.It is not to say that it was pleasant to read or that it was not horrible but it rang believable and true to me. The ugly reality of slavery and the poison that institutionalized slavery inflicts upon the human soul is different for each person. You see the different human reactions to anarchy within a slave revolt. There is heroism as well as horror contained within these pages."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"For any student of slavery or history, this is a great historical work. As a novel, it reads equally well. There is much to learn about not only Haitian but French history from this work. The sequence of events in the back of the book enriches greatly the historical context of the novel itself. I have often read of the relative brutality of Caribbean slavery compared to North American slavery - the events described in this book make the brutality abundantly clear, disturbing and historically consequential.A great book with no simple phiosophisizing or side taking."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I have been told by several friends that it was difficult to read, and thinking back I suppose it was, but don't let that keep you from checking out this great book."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"First, I have to admit, this was not my cup of tea. I read it due to the fact that I, over the years, have had a number of friends from Haiti, children of those who have fled. That being said, I did give this one four stars in that I feel it is a book, or series of books, that probably should have been written. For a country so close to us, we know so little about it. Actually, I like my history books just that, history books, and am not all that enthusiastic about \\"historical fiction\\" good or bad. But, from what little I have read, this seems to be pretty good, well written, and I can only speculate, well researched. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a difficult read. It is difficult on several levels. I cannot say I particularly enjoyed the vivid accounts of rape, torture, killing, etc. etc., but I suppose they were indeed apart of the story and should be told. I do admire the writers unusual use of the language, syntax, et al. All in all, I do recommend this one."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"how race relations realy were during slavery then this is your book. Bell takes us deep into the souls of cruel slave owners and rebellious slaves.This is one of the few books where the events are explained the way they happend,without restrictions.A very informative novel about the first days of the Haitian revolution,an awsome read.Buy this book you won't regret it."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"Having recently read C.L.R. James's fascinating, Marxist account of the Haiti slave revolt, &quot;Black Jacobins&quot;, I was excited to learn of a literate, fictional account of the same subject. Now that I've read it, I agree it is literate, but it is more an exploration of the depths of race hatred than a treatment of the Haiti uprising. Most telling is Bell's decision to develop the character of Toussaint only slightly, preferring instead to focus mostly on a fictional white doctor. How Toussaint and his illiterate allies accomplished one of the greatest miliary and political upsets in history is of little interest to Bell. The goal of the book seems to be to impress upon the reader to what appalling depths mankind, black and white, will stoop when a conflict is racial. Although Bell paints many shockingly violent scenes, he didn't convince me that racial forms of hatred are uniquely virulent."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I had never heard of Madison Smartt Bell when I picked up this novel from the public library. After reading a few chapters, I began to wonder how this author could possibly not be famous? This is a moving, haunting book, panoramic in scope and often extrememly violent, bringing a unique event of human history to vivid life.First, background about Haiti and its revolution ---->The Haitian revolution is special in that the Haitian slaves were the first people of the world to throw off the white man's yoke and become free. At a time when India and Indonesia were just getting used to European rule and the slaughter of the North American natives was continuing apace, these blacks of Haiti (the majority of them directly brought in from Africa in slave-ships) overthrew their masters in a grand revolt and provided the Europeans with a taste of their own medicine of violence. It helped that France was going through it's great egalitarian revolution -- the slaves just happened to take the message of \\"equality liberty fraternity\\" seriously.The post-revolution history of Haiti has not been happy -- including in the 19th century a succession of corrupt rulers and huge sums paid to France, and in the 20th century direct rule by the U.S. and then by brutal U.S.-allied dictators. But this does not make the unique revolution any less important! For a rapid history of Haitian revolution and the ensuing 200 years, have a look through the Library of Congress \\"Country Study\\" on Haiti, available online. For a modern (mid-20th-century) literary description of Haiti and of a voodoo ceremony, read Graham Greene's \\"The Comedians\\".Now, about the book \\"All Souls Rising\\" ---->Not knowing the author, as I read the first chapter, I decided unconsciously that he was white; the first chapter follows a white character (doctor Herbert) spending a night at a local plantation, describing breezily a disobedient slave woman crucified alive on the lawn for disciplinary purposes, and other minor tidbits. Moving onto the next chapter, I couldn't imagine that it was the same author writing, as we're following the viewpoint of Ri'au, an escaped slave who roves with a band of maroons, becomes (is possessed by) Ogun in a voodoo ceremony, and describes \\"whitemen\\" in the third person as totally alien beings.(Later, a websearch on Madison Scott Bell told me he's white. But one of those that rises above his color and his imperialistic heritage; to hear all voices! What a writer!!)The book is told from multiple viewpoints, alternating from chapter to chapter. Some of the characters are real historical characters. And some of the characters are very memorable.-- A central character is the doctor Herbert, a peaceful Frenchman freshly arrived and unable to adjust to Haitian society based on slavery, throughout this book searching for his sister who appears to have disappeared. Through his experiences we witness much of the devastation and extreme violence of the times, perpetrated first by the white masters and then by the rebelling slaves.-- A second central character is Ri'au, brought from Africa and escaped from Haitian slavery as a youth, who like doctor Herbert is mostly pushed around by fate, from one rebelling group to another, dancing to the voodoo spirits, burning and killing, and also under Toussaint's direction learning the white man's writing and discipline to use against his former masters.-- Perhaps the most important character is Toussaint, the real historical figure we see mostly through the eyes of the fictional caharacters. A true tragic hero of the revolution -- one who went on from being a house-slave to learn the white man's writing and create a formidable, structured army from mostly Africa-born rebelling slaves, one who realized the importance of prosperity after freedom, and attempted to keep the white man's expertise in peaceful coexistence. The white man, however, wanted to reinstate slavery, and so imprisoned Toussaint after he had made peace and took him to France to die.-- A side character I liked was a white priest with his mulatto wife and children - the character introduced and drawn lovably, and finally his execution described in horrific detail.The book is so full of extraordinary events and situations that it's hard to give a taste in this review. There is the plantation-owner's wife cutting open a female slave made pregnant by her husband, and then being haunted by the murdered embryo for months. This haunted woman's confrontation with marauding rebel-slaves is one of the most unique literary descriptions I have read -- it's told first from the viewpoint of the white woman and later from Ri'au's. There is the (hilarious if tragic) situation of whites captured in the black rebel camps, the ex-slave women getting pleasure out of making the white women wash clothes as they always had done for white women. There are the voodoo ceremonies, often described by Ri'au, the practitioner's version of reality becoming the viewpoint of the chapter, as the residents of the spirit world are called forth and take control over the voodoo dancers.Read \\"All Souls Rising\\". You won't forget it easily."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"Toccante, il libro mi ha coinvolto sin dall'inizio e a distanza di un anno ancora penso a quegli accadimenti.

What was it that kept that from happening? No character that really held my interest. Shifting scenes that were hard to hold together. Why didn't I get to know Toussaint, of all people, better through this book? It is indeed an epic, and it does collect evidence for the texture of life of the times. It horrifies, it blasts. But for me, this novel didn't sing"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I suppose I can understand how others could have enjoyed this book - its subject matter is interesting, and it is descriptive and evocative. However, I found all of this atmosphere to be at the cost of character and plot. If you want page-long descriptions of flaying scenes, this is the book for you. If you're more interested in character development and engaging storylines, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"When every reviewer uses the same set of words or phrases to describe a book, it means either that the tale is universal, transparent and easily understood or the exact opposite; it is impenetrable &amp; the reviewer gave up and went with the consensus viewpoint. So when you see these words--&quot;intricate&quot;, &quot;labyrinthine&quot;, &quot;byzantine&quot;--in all of the reviews of this book, you know you are in trouble; these are not adjectives that lead one to believe that the story will be readily understandable. But, they are accurate; this book is so complex as to be incomprehensible. I finally gave up on this one after trying to read it about five different times.The best Historical Fiction takes great events with which we are familiar but brings an added human dimension to them, first by fleshing out the basic situations via fictional narrative techniques (dialogue, characters thoughts, etc.), but second, by taking the historical context and peopling it with living characters. There is a great difference between the Claudius of a Roman History book and the Claudius of Robert Graves' novels. Graves' achievement is that he breathes life into Claudius and makes him a virtual contemporary of ours, which adds immediacy to the historic circumstances and gives us a vested interest in what occurs. History essentially is transformed into the present.In All Soul's Rising, on the other hand, Bell plops the reader down in the midst of the incredibly violent Haitian revolt at the turn of the 19th Century and through the use of shifting perspectives, allows the reader access to the experiences of those caught up in it, but he provides no context for what is occurring. Basically he's trying to tell the story of a riot from the viewpoint of the rioters; there's just a whirl of events, the meaning of which is impossible to decipher. There are scenes of elaborate torture and violence, but we are so deeply thrust into the story that we have no idea how they connect back to the tides of history. The book seems to be about nothing more than the racial violence itself, disconnected from any rhyme or reason.Perhaps this is partly Bell's intent, to demonstrate that all racial violence is senseless? I do know that in one of the interviews online, he says that he sees the Haitian Uprising as a metaphor for American race relations. Huh? In what conceivable way are they comparable? The only really significant outbreak of violence in the history of American race relations is the Civil War, when whites fought each other over the issue. Jim Crow, while a repellent feature of our History, was brought to an end with virtually no violence at all (the murders of Civil Rights workers the sporadic church bombings and the police attacks on demonstrators stand out precisely because they were the exception to the rule). Perhaps Bell's interest in tying the Revolt to American History caused him to lose sight of Haitian and French History and to cut the story loose from it's historical moorings. Whatever the case, with his focus wholly on particular isolated events, Bell fails to place the entire story into any broader context; like the blind men describing an elephant, all is detail, there is no whole.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"If you like the tease of adultery and fornication, mutiliation from excessive torture in every third chapter then this is the book for you. Bell knows how to stimulate the reader and does so often. The other reviewers have captured his ability to poignantly describe the atmosphere."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"This is the kind of book that can make you seem obsessed. Once you enter Bell's world, you're disturbed, excited, and depressed, but you can't stop talking about the book you're in. It's like having a secret that's too heavy to really divulge, but you keep alluding to parts of it, as if you were talking in code. People look at you like you're sort of cracked, but generally they think it will pass. The blood-soaked history of Haiti is cause for despair, but the revolutionary spirit of the 1790's makes you hope in spite of what you know. Toussaint is one of the great heroes of all time, and Bell makes him both human and epic. In this book, you don't develop much emotional connection to him -- that's the province of more fictional characters like Doctor Hebert and Riau -- but you care immensely about his success as a leader. You want him to be as great, as visionary, as Martin Luther King, but he belongs to a different era, a violent one. The backdrop of the French Revolution, with its mixture of rights and terror, is essential to the drama of All Souls' Rising, and most readers will need to read the appendix several times to stay abreast of royalists, Jacobins, and emissaries from the Mother Country. Some knowledge of American history might help --Jefferson, for instance, opposed the Haitian slave revolt because he feared something similar in the US which would deprive him of slaves plus the boost he got from the 3/5 compromise which gave white planters more votes, while Adams and Pickering favored emancipation and liberation -- but you can follow the essential plot without historical annotation. It's the kind of gravy that lifts the book to a higher level, but readers looking for love, betrayal, courage, devotion, cruelty, sex, and perverse logic will be sated. Contemporary maps won't help with many of the locations, but Bell has a map in the second volume of the trilogy, Master of the Crossroads, that helped me get a sense of place. The themes and the style of the book are managed with power and grace. Bell's a hell of a writer, and I believed each of the voices in the narrative. Big books like this sweep you up and carry you away, but this book sweeps the reader into a present time of continuous revolution in Haiti, slaughter in Sudan, disease and unending horror in much of Africa, war in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc. The blood drama of Bell's Haiti gives us a red filter for understanding our own time. At the end of the book, I'm thrilled by the revolutionary possibilities, depressed by the inevitable destruction and failure, and grateful for every moment of compassion and kindness however small. I can't wait to read the next volume."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"This story of the Haitian revolution is violent and disturbing, but its violence is handled with care and placed in the context of each character's psychology and motivations. The characters are believable, the history seems painstakingly accurate, and the sensory descriptions are rich and vivid. The book leaves you with new, unresolved questions about what race is -- a topic which obsesses many of the characters in the book as well.An unforgettable read and an important one."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I found this an extremely difficult read: I was 16, knew nothing about Haiti's history, and spoke no French. I took nearly three months to finish reading the book, because every so often I had to take a break from the horrific violence Bell portrays. In the end, however, this novel remains one of the most impressive I have ever read, in terms of the way it really made me think. The depths of terror and violence to which Bell's characters resorted shocked me. But I did not lose sight of the novel's bigger picture. Ultimately, I have little sympathy for the book's reviewers who could not see past the novel's violence and complexity. Five tries to get through the book? Try a Dick and Jane reader, then, and come back in a few years."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"This very good book describes the beginning phases of the great Haitian slave revolt. Bell is a talented writer with a real gift for descriptive prose. This long and dense book reads easily and is very informative. Bell depicts a society in which whites, blacks, and mulattoes are locked in a mutual embrace of hatred and exploitation, leading to the horrific events described graphically in this book. This book is not for the squemish, it contains many scenes of horrifying cruelty. This book is very ambitious in scope and has some deficiencies. I find Bell's efforts to emphasize the role of voudon, the syncretic Afro-Haitian religion, somewhat contrived. For a useful comparison, see the brief and evocative novel The Kingdom of this World by the great Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier. Bell's characters are also somewhat flat. This may be deliberate choice on his part; part of an effort to show the consequences of a society where almost all human relationships are based on asymmetric and exploitative power relationships. Bell does not deal with the role of events in France or how these events shaped what happened in Haiti. This is an understandable but crucial omission. Consequently, we never get a sense of the collision of the ideals of the French Revolution with the reality of colonial exploitation."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"Bell's novel recreates the Haitian revolution through the eyes of several different vibrant characters. We as readers come to experience this event as though we were really there. The Island is transformed before our eyes from a slave colony to a surrealistic Hell on earth where bands of men travel the countryside in search of blood and cities burn with regularity. Delving into the minds of slaves, masters and soldiers equally the book shows every side of the event in vivid life. The themes in this book ring out every bit as pertinant today as when the revolution unfolded. The issues of racial hatred and class warfare exist now in America even if they live subdued beneath the surface of everyday life. This novel explores what happens when the shroud is pulled back and the passions and hatred of men is let loose."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I have read all three novels in the triology. The set is breathtaking in scope and in demonstrating the control that Mr. Bell is able to bring to such a sprawling project. In retrospect, I cannot imagine how he had the courage to undertake something of this range and ambition; perhaps once you get in too deep you just have to keep digging. Mr. Bell fortunately has the tools: historical context, racial intermixing and tensions, international intrigue, dynamic characters, characters who serve as surrogates for the reader, exotic setting, religion, and blood and guts -- all based on fact and history. This is literary history, but grounded in fact not just the imagination, which makes the narrative all the more unbelievable and compelling.Because it is such a large commitment to read the whole set, I've only been able to convince a handful of people to bite off reading this fabulous work, but they too share my extraordinary degree of enthusiasm and sheer gratefulness for the books and Bell's effort to compose them. As one moves from book to book one sees greater development in Bell's power and sophistication as a novelist, including regarding his use of more vivid language and more elegant sentences. Judging the three novels together can only lead one to conclude that they are a work of great art and power.No doubt because the complextity of the story one must give a bit of time to ease into the work, more than the usual 100 pages or so. Also, I would recommend reading the triology over reasonable together in time, rather than say one-a-year due to the fact that you will lose some of the minor threads that come back into the narrative, say, 400 or 700 or 900 pages later in the books.Though there are several strong women characters -- and one who undergoes perhaps the greatest transformation (or maybe one would say two out the major-transforming three characters are women), the militarism and gore could be turnoffs to some, especially in the final book. I believe that any ordinary negative reaction to such things surely will be overwhelmedby the overall power of the work, and the fact that depicting the wars is not the object but that depicting the people is, both the ultimately revolutionary leader, Toussaint L'Overture and the other characters, and the moral context in which they are forced to act.This is a book that merits some serious concentration but that pays serious dividends. I'll certainly remember these far more than other works I've read. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to learn about the subject and to read such an example of what novels can be.My thanks to Madison Smartt Bell for writing this."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"And not just because of the frequent French, either. This was a difficult read, containing some of the most shocking descriptions of cruelty I have ever read. That said, it was worth the effort. Madison Smartt Bell's sentences shimmer and his characters come alive. Bell's use of the rebel slave who eventually abandons the rebellion for the bush and the unrepentant plantation owner well make his point that violence, as practiced by white or black, is senseless. So why the preachy epilogue? After suffering, to Bell's credit, through chapter after chapter of human sacrifice and dismemberment, I didn't need to be told that race hate is a bad thing. Still, if you quit before you get to the italicized words, you'll have an important and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I read this book because of &quot;Ten Indians&quot; and because I am a history buff. It is nothing like &quot;Ten Indians&quot;, except that many scenes are described from the differing viewpoints of several characters. This is a fine historical novel. I learned a lot of new and interesting facts about Haiti's history and people. It was a little slow going at first because of the necessity to look up French words and phrases (in the dictionary provided). If you read French, I think you can get more out of the book. Also, it would have been nice to have a map for orientation as to where events occurred. Overall, a good book and worth the time. I recommend it"},{"Title":"All Souls' Rising","review":"I read all three of the books in this trilogy. None is better than the others. They form a wondrous composite whole. This work is brilliant, stunning in it's complexity and it's presentation. The research must have been phenomenal. The characters are well drawn inside of the history that the events represent.I was amused by other writer's comments about too many words and too gruesome or violent. If you read and there are too many words, then what are you reading for? If you understand the course of human events in the recorded world then you should know that human beings are not shinking violets when it comes to killing creatively, or rape or a host of other truly horrid human activities. The glory of Bell's achievement here is that he makes it all so real. Not too real, just humanly real. You can feel the heat. You can taste the coffee with a stick of sugar cane stirred in it. You can feel the characters love and hate based on their natures which are influenced by their experiences in life. This is not a read, it's a journey and one well worth taking.

It is something we cannot judge, yet Bell does it so convincingly you have to believe he actually got a look inside."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"I think the book will appeal to two groups. Those people who want to use a web service from a company described in the book and people who are interested in learning about some real world applications using web services. The number of companies discussed are few, but they are the big players. I liked the discussion of web services in general and how they can be (and are) used in real world applications.This book shows you - with copious amounts of code - how to use various services provided by real companies right away. For me, this book was a great way to gather ideas about different approaches to provide and interact with web services. It does a great job at proving how simple web services really are.Although web services are not language-specific, the book and all the examples are in Java. You should be pretty comfortable with Java, Tomcat, and similar technologies to be able to get the examples working. The companies/web services discussed are: Amazon, eBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB. It also discusses interacting with bloggers."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"Real World Web Services starts with a recitation of the history of the internet, thendiscuses some of the web service offerings currently available, including Java codefor programming remote procdure calls to them, then concludes with a short visionarychapter in which the author relaxes his prohibition against opinionating and speculating.The discussion of N-tier architecture, and the checklist of things to be careful about,when considering deployment of a web service, and the nod to capitalist realities -- ifyou don't have a business plan, you're just playing around, not like that's bad or anything,but the angels aren't going to kidnap you and issue you your very own beach house -- aremost useful, and come from a solid perpective.How do you choose between raw CGI, SOAP, REST, binary, and XML? What arethe good points and drawbacks of each? Real World Web Services discusses thesegeneralities. Is UDDI worth the trouble when WDSL already comes with commercialSOAP development tools? Real world web services will tell you, probably not.As a developer of web services since before the term had been coined, I tend touse the traditional Comman Gateway Interface key/value pairs data declarationmethod for passing data to my web services rather than XML. Iverson touches onthis legacy method, in a box, on page 99, while discussing PayPal's Instant PaymentNotification system: \\"Using a simple HTTP request/response is perhaps the most basic,universal web service. It works with virtually every programming language and requires nospecial configuration to use. It's a classic case of the simple solution being the bestsolution.\\"There is no further discussion of simple HTTP request/response, also known as\\"common gateway interface.\\" Perhaps he wishes to discourage reinventing toomany wheels, when the available ones (SOAP) take care of a mess of details.I suppose the plentiful Java example code will be welcome to fans of Iverson's previousbooks on Jakarta and J2EE"},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"This book is mainly code applied to several web services case studies. There is an introductory segment at the beginning which has some nice illustrations. After that the book uses a combination of Java code and screenshots to demonstrate eight example uses of web services. The most handy one, in my opinion, is the News Aggegator, which uses web services to retrieve information from sites like Amazon. Then it turns that information into RSS so that you can retrieve it with your news reader.There is a lot more code than text in this book. If you learn well by looking at code then this book should work for you. This book is a little looser than the O'Reilly standard. There are more screenshots than usual, the UML graphics are not as well done as usual, and the code is not as well annotated. That being said, it's a fun and informative read that finally injects a little reality into the web services hype."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"Since Domino 7 will start to incorporate web services more readily into application development, I figured it was time to start getting a little more versed on the subject. To that end, I got a copy of Real World Web Services by Will Iverson (O'Reilly). Coupled with a detailed tutorial/reference manual, this is a really good selection.Chapter List: Web Service Evolution; Foundations of Web Services; Development Platform; Project 1: Competitive Analysis; Project 2: Auctions and Shipping; Project 3: Billing and Faxing; Project 4: Syndicated Search; Project 5: News Aggregator; Project 6: Audio CD Catalog; Project 7: Hot News Sheet; Project 8: Automatic Daily Discussions; Future Web Service Directions; IndexWhile the book is smallish (206 pages), there's a lot of value packed in it. Iverson takes you from the beginning of simple HTTP request and responses, through data scrapping, into RPC technology, and then finally into web services. The overview really helps you to understand how we got to where we are. He explains how to set up a simple test development environment as well as what you'll need, and then it's directly into the example projects. Here's where the book shines. These projects connect to live data sources such as Amazon, Google, FedEx, and eBay, so you're not dealing with simple examples that don't translate to the real world. Each of the projects are applications that you could easily see yourself using on a daily basis, either exactly as written or with some moderate tweaking. And since you're learning the mechanics of connecting with that service, it's easy to extrapolate the information into the areas that might interest you more.If you have no background in SOAP or WSDL, I'd recommend you get a foundational book that has a good tutorial and reference material. You won't get it from this book, nor should you expect to. It's not his intended purpose for the book. But this is the book that will help you go from theoretical to practical, and that's worth its weight in gold.Very good book if you're looking to take the next step in your web services development..."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"Real World Web Services by Will Iverson is more of a \\"here's an example of something someone might want to do\\" type book. The book contains a lot of Java source code to connect to some web services from big names like eBay, Google, and FedEx. Whether these examples are useful or whether the reader can glean out other uses of the code depends on the skill the reader has in programming. The book also goes over some basic concepts and tools the reader can use to get started with web services. All in all, Real World Web Services will give you a taste of what web services are, yet leaves out the low level details of how it works."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"Hurray. At last. A slender book that tries to show you the essence of Web Services, in as simple a fashion as possible. Unlike much larger texts on this subject, Iverson eshews a comprehensive approach. Instead, he strives to describe the gist of WS.He gives this substance by showing how to hook into the WS APIs published by eBay, Google, Amazon and FedEx, to build a composite WS. This modular approach to constructing from independent sources is the driving force behind WS. The code examples are necessarily verbose. But not really that intricate. Here is your chance to be demystified about WS. Now if you find afterwards that you still want to continue, then you're probably ready, and need, one of those other texts."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"While the samples are straight-forward, to the point and easy to follow, the book doesn't really provide enough under-the-cover view. Generally speaking, if you are looking for some insight into WS used with Google, eBay, FedEx, etc. this is a wonderful book.If you are looking into information for things such as \\"using Axis for real-world WS\\", this just scratches the surface.However...This book provided a wonderful set of quick, easy test setups for use against generic WS implementations (such as those provided in B2Bi software) for comparative results. The peer into the provider-specific details made it wonderful to have provide expected output and check the diffs on files.Recommended for QA, unit testing, automated testing, etc.Recommended for those interested in quick samples but not in a core understanding of the technologies."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"I thought that this is a book very specific to certain aspects of web services and examples are overly detailed...I dont expect the book to be compiled mostly with elaborative examples."},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for something that would go into detail of the various Web Services solutions offered by Amazon, Google, etc. Instead it is just another Java book filled with mostly code (is it a sin to use prose anymore?) and lacking in any kind of detailed discussion at all. It basically talks about very specific problems, offers some code, then moves on to another specific solution. I found it completely uninteresting.The only person I would suggest this book for is someone who wants code to Cut and Paste without really understanding what they are doing. And good luck to them ;-)"},{"Title":"REAL WORLD WEB SERVICES","review":"Then the world got more complex. We started connecting the web to databases so that much bigger sites could be developed with huge amounts of data. ==Then we wanted to do eCommerce, and we needed a way to do credit card validation. So our servers talked not only to our database but connected to some other system to get data about the credit card's validity and to deposit the money received.There have become a huge number of web services available. To list just a few, there's Amazon, eBay, Google, FedEx, Pay Pal, InterFAX. From a web site you can link to these sites and get information from them that you can then integrate into your own site.With this huge number of web services that have become available, there have become a new set of problems. Which services, which interfaces work in the real world? ==In this book, Will Iverson presents his experiences with several real world, actually operating web services. He provides detailed examples of contacting several big web sites including the programming necessary to interface to them.This book is written for the Java journeyman. To quote from Chapter 3, \\"You should be familiar with basic object-oriented development, know how to add libraries to your class path, understand TCP/IP and basic networking, and be familiar with basic JSP-based web application development.I'm not. I use Cold Fusion to do my web programming. I found the descriptions in the book entirely adequate to get me started in programming what I needed. I'm glad he did the programming because that proved that the services worked. What's important in this book is not the programming, it's the real world experience of what's really working right now out there in the real world."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Italian (Listen and Learn: Audio Cassette Plus Book)","review":"I came across this old program at the library... The format is almost the same as the modern &quot;Learn in your Car&quot; series where you hear a sentence once in English then in Italian for the entire duration of the recording and comes with a booklet containing the complete transcipts. The only difference is on this tape, the Italian is spoken only once instead of twice like on the &quot;Learn in your Car&quot; series. And of course, this isn't meant to really &quot;teach&quot; the language, but instead to present the right phrases a traveler would find useful to get by on a trip.Since this is a much older program and recording (from the 50's), it's only natural that a few phrases will be outdated, overly-formal or simply not applicable in today's world. But I gave it 4 stars because personally I found that aspect very interesting compared to today's programs which I usually find boring and repetitive. And another big reason for the rating is the slow and very accentuated enunciation of the Italian speakers. It really makes the phrases &quot;stick&quot; more than other programs I heard, and of course many beginning students need a solid foundation in the right pronunciation and inflection (often very overlooked by people).The only negative is that the Italian speakers in the recording for some strange reason pronounce the s the same exact way throughout. Anyone who knows Italian will tell you the s changesfrom the &quot;s&quot; sound we know to a &quot;z&quot; sound when it's between 2 vowels... so the word &quot;Inglese&quot; is pronounced &quot;een-gleh-zeh&quot; and NOT &quot;een-gleh-seh&quot;. As a matter of fact, the transcript which shows the written pronunciation for every word of every sentence does correctly indicate the &quot;z&quot; pronunciation when called for.Also related to the first problem, the speakers pronounce certain &quot;ce&quot; sounds as &quot;sheh&quot; instead of &quot;cheh&quot; which is how it's supposed to be, like in the word &quot;piacere&quot; (pee-ah-cheh-reh.. NOT pee-ah-sheh-reh). Could it be the speakers have a reagional accent that uses a slightly different pronunciation?I'm sure some people will be immediately turned off by some of the outdated phrases and production and assume that means the entire program is useless. But while it's true that in Italy you may not ever need to say to a dentist &quot;I've lost a filling&quot;, if you really love the language and want to learn new words not used in most other programs then definately give this one a try."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Italian (Listen and Learn: Audio Cassette Plus Book)","review":"I would be surprised if there is a worse Italian language learning tape on the market. A phrase is said in English, then once in Italian. Some are long and complex, and some are obsolete.

I didn't notice that when I bought it; otherwise, I would have chosen a different product. The responses of the Italian translators are not always clear. The examples are typical 50's: lots on the topic of smoking! I chose a CD format so that I could listen to it before retiring or while driving, so that's the good part. But in conscience, I won't resell this particular CD, and would not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Italian (Listen and Learn: Audio Cassette Plus Book)","review":"This cassette and book is ideal for Italy travel purposes and great for anyone with a cassette player in there car (older car).

It takes the language apart bit by bit (or problem by problem) so that it never becomes threatening or overwhelming. The book is targeted at English speakers who have begun to learn German by a phrase approach or by listening to tapes, and have already mastered some basic phrases and vocabulary. It is an excellent supplement to self-study by tapes or books, or a refresher for those who learned some German in school years ago and are looking to brush up on their grammar. I am an American living in Germany and attempting to learn the language, and this is the best tool I've found for grammar.

The author says you will hardly need it as you will mostly be using the formal form of address; HOWEVER, I have not found this to be true. You will hear the du/ihr form all around you and sometimes you will be included in that \\"ihr\\". Also, you will hear it on the news and in music lyrics and see it in writing. Even if you don't use \\"du/ihr\\" that much in the beginning (always wait for the native speaker to invite you to use \\"du\\"), why not learn it from the first rather than later having to go back and try to add it. When I was 12 and started learning Spanish, my teacher told us we didn't have to worry about the \\"Vosotros\\" form, but I went ahead and learned anyway and by golly I have used it and needed it.If you really want to learn German (and not a few phrases or very simple things to say), you will find yourself looking for increasingly comprehensive grammars."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Essential German Grammar","review":"I bought this book with little knowledge of the German language.

This book is excellent for clearing up confusing concepts and with teaching compound words. Additionally, you don't have to remember what each tense (present perfect, accusative, past participle, etc.) means from English classes taken long ago. There are plenty of examples of forms in English and their German counterparts that don't require you to revisit high school English to get. After 5 levels of Rosetta Stone, I was still confused with when to use war and wurde because they both seemed to mean \\"was\\" to me. This book made me understand it instantly!! Some have remarked the lack of use of the du/ihr forms, but I applaud the author for keeping it simple. If you use the Sie form of something with your close friend or relative because you do not know the du/ihr form, they will not be offended since they will know you are learning.

I believe that grammar is important in learning a language, but it is not extremely necessary on the first stage of such a process.I would recommend you to spend about four months with the Assimil book of you choice (apply Luca Lampariello's &#34;full circle method&#34;), do one lesson a day, six days a week. At the same time try to listen to radio, watch TV, and even read the news in that language. Soon your brain will start to adjust to your new language. It would be helpful to speak to natives of that language just to practice, although it also helps to speak to yourself, and even record and listen to yourself to correct your accent mistakes. Within a year to a year-and-a-half, you will have a great understanding of the language you started learning a while ago.Of course you could use other courses, you just have to have to motivation to learn a language. Most people have to work or go to school, so they don't have a lot of time to spend on language learning. An hour a day would work perfectly.

Throw in the fact that it's also an excellent romantic mystery and holiday tale and Burnes' accomplishment is even more remarkable.Sylvie West has never been a big fan of the holiday season. It doesn't look like that's about to change when she's kidnapped from her job in a toy store by a gunman dressed as Santa Claus. Hunter Semmes insists that Christmas is about to be ruined by those determined to get their hands on his new toy invention--so determined they might harm children to do it. Sylvie's head tells her Hunter has to be a madman; her heart isn't quite so sure. And with just three days til Christmas, there's no time to waste finding out who the true threat is.Burnes manages to find the right balance between light and dark elements, suspenseful action and holiday warmth in a tale that never fails to delight. The characters are in a constant state of motion, yet Burnes is still able to develop them into three-dimensional characters we truly care about. Hunter and Sylvie are both strong, intelligent people, and I appreciated how, with one big exception, there wasn't a multitude of distrust and misunderstandings--just smart thinking and working through the situations thrown at them. These two were using their heads, and I liked them that much more for it. The mystery is consistently surprising, where no one is what they seem to be. The ending alone is packed with twists until the final villain is revealed. And of course, there's the intrepid feline detective Familiar, as entertaining as ever. The scenes with the credit card alone were wonderful.Truly original, first-rate entertainments like this don't come along very often. It doesn't matter if this is your first encounter with the series or your twelfth, don't miss out. Heart-tugging and action-packed, &quot;Familiar Christmas&quot; deserves to become a holiday classic."},{"Title":"Familiar Christmas (Fear Familiar, Book 11) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #542)","review":"This was a very good book and I really enjoyed it.

I hope we see a lot more of these books."},{"Title":"The Dark World","review":"1946 was a very good year indeed for sci-fi's foremost husband-and-wife writing team, Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore. Besides placing a full dozen stories (including the acknowledged classic \\"Vintage Season\\") into various magazines of the day, the pair also succeeded in having published three short novels in those same pulps. The first, \\"The Fairy Chessmen,\\" which was released in the January and February issues of \\"Astounding Science-Fiction,\\" was a remarkable combination of hardheaded modernist sci-fi and almost hallucinatory reality twists. \\"Valley of the Flame,\\" from the March issue of \\"Startling Stories,\\" was an exciting meld of jungle adventure, Haggardian lost-world story and unique fantasy. And that summer, in \\"Startling Stories\\" again, the team came out with \\"The Dark World,\\" a work that is pretty much a \\"hard\\" fantasy with some slight scientific leavening. In this one, the American flier Edward Bond is whisked from the Pacific theatre during WW2 and transported to the eponymous Dark World, an alternate Earth that has diverged from its parent in space as well as time. His counterpart on the Dark World, Ganelon, head of a coven of mutated overlords who are busy keeping that realm subjugated, is sent to our Earth with Bond's memories. The book's plot is difficult to synopsize, and gets a bit complicated when Ganelon is brought back to the Dark World sometime later, his body now housing two distinct minds and personalities. Thus, the understandably mixed-up warlock can't quite decide whether or not to help his fellow \\"Covenanters\\" wipe out the forest-dwelling rebels, or join those rebels and destroy the Coven, not to mention the dreaded, sacrifice-demanding entity known as Llyr. Though called the Coven, Ganelon's fellows number only four, and include Medea, a beautiful vampire who feeds on life energies; Matholch, a lycanthrope; Edeyrn, a cowled, childlike personage whose power the authors choose not to reveal until the novel's end; and Ghast Rhymi, an ancient magus whose origin really did surprise this reader. Peopled with colorful characters as it is, and featuring a nicely involved plot and ample scenes of battle, sacrifice, magic and spectacle, this little book (the whole thing runs to a mere 126 pages) really does please.

But it is equally compelling an addition to the &quot;literature of creativity&quot; and so of interest to anyone concerned with the phenomenon of artistic production. Anderson had a vivid personality, warm and generous but often combative and sometimes hysterical, a character Lambert renders in telling detail. Anderson's world of theatre and film from the 1950's through the '90s is also drawn in fascinating if hardly encouraging terms."},{"Title":"Mainly About Lindsay Anderson","review":"Gavin Lambert has written many books about the motion picure business, both fictional and non, but this is far and away the most remarkable. A tribute to a great filmmaker and a through examination of world he lived in, it's also a partial autobiography -- with Lambert's digressions on his affair with Nicholas Ray sharply constrating with Anderson's difficulties in having the lover he longed for. Anderson was capable of producing some of the most indelible homoerotic images in the history of the cinema, yet his own life suffered from sexual and emotional constraint.No one who wants to know about the British cinema, or one of the most remarkable creative talents Great Britain has ever produced, can afford to pass up this book."},{"Title":"Mainly About Lindsay Anderson","review":"British filmmaker Anderson's films were witty social commentaries for the late 20th century, while his documentaries were revealing and educational.

You're inserting, updating, deleting, etc. All this book tells you is how to print out rows that you retrieve. Actually, let me rephrase that. It prints the code on the page and prints out the results. Everybody knows that Perl is powerful but it's also cryptic and needs explaination. The authors think that they are doing great jobs because they tell you how to connect to the db. Great, I can only get that through 2000 different search engines! Tell me something I don't know. Tell me how to store the result of a select statement in a matrix for later use. This is simple stuff. How the heck can you decide how to update a database if you can't get a handle on the information in a matrix to evaluate it?Unfortunately, the majority of tech writers are very VERY bad at conveying what they know. Very basic database operations are completely ignored. I think before these books are published, people need to evaluate them so that they can be re-written.

Another problem is not completing started examples. For example, the book talks about SELECT statements and uses a simple SELECT statement such as, SELECT * from TABLE. But then the book gets around to talking about getting the data from a SELECT statement, it switches the SELECT statement to SELECT name, address, number from TABLE. They do not explain how to grab the data from the previous SELECT statment, something that is quite fundamental if you are generating a report. As it stands, it looks like one has to specify every field in the table the SELECT statement is issued against.

It sounds like the perfect book for information-starved developers looking to go beyond the trivial examples of using DBI that are easily found on the web for free. It sounds too good to be true. That's because it is. Unless you're a complete beginner or an internet millionaire with more money than brains, do not buy this book.This book is 8 chapters long plus 3 appendices. The first 3 chapters are pure filler (intro, a discussion of non-DBI databases, and an SQL primer) while the remaining 5 do little more than provide a long-winded version of what can be found in the DBI man page. Two of the appendices are practically cut and pasted from man pages while the third is a forum for one of the authors to get on a soap box and ramble about his pet cause (which, incidentally, has zero to do with programming the Perl DBI).The examples are hardly illuminating for anything other than the most basic applications. And there's no discussion at all of using DBI with mod_perl and Apache, an increasingly popular way to use DBI (&quot;Apache&quot; and &quot;mod_perl&quot; aren't even in the index). In short, there's nothing here for an average or better programmer that can't be gotten easily off the web for free.This is one case where the old adage rings true: &quot;Do not judge a book by it's cover&quot;. Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This is a good book, IF:- You want the online documentation with some extra fluff on databases, extra examples and the DBI spec. in one handy place (pages 187 - 333 are pretty much available online, the rest of the book is the online material filled out).- You are interested in learning about the DBI, the book is about the DBI rather than database programming.This is not a good book, IF:- You want to learn how to program databases from the web (the widest application of Perl today is covered on one example/page and is an absolute joke).- You want to learn how to program databases other than Oracle (the massive Windows market, and other markets are left to you, the reader, to extrapolate techniques from the book to practice).This is a terrible book, IF:- You are a Perl/programming beginner.- You want to learn about databases.- You want to troubleshoot your application (to not include much more driver specific material, when the DBI relies so heavily on the database's driver, means that essentially the book's use is very limited in the real world).The DBI is a great tool in the Perl armoury; this book does not do it justice. You will learn more from the online documentation, DBI mailing list and the very generous Perl community than you could ever get from here - save your money (The forthcoming 'Web Databases with Perl' from Manning looks far more promising, but it's not out until Oct 2000).Of course, if the book is supposed to be nothing more than a guide to the DBI in the very limited scope of being a recycle and slight expansion of existing material, then you can't fault it, and it is a nice read. A lot of the reviews for the book reflect this sentiment. However, if you are after more, you will end up questioning what O'Reilly were thinking. On these grounds three stars is generous."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"I am by no means a DBI master . . . but, I still expected more from this book. To be fair, I did get some &quot;finer points&quot; clarified for me, and saw some features of DBI I hadn't used before that I will try in the future.

They wanted to know if they could buy a package to do this. After a little research, I fell over the DBI. They were amazed at the &quot;cost&quot;, and delighted with the speed.I finally got the book about a week ago. Lo and behold, it also covered flat files. A large part of this shop's income comes from a custom doc library, flat files exported from many different DBs. So not only did the book aid with optimising the script I'd already written for the Oracle interface, but it's going to make all our lives easier for the next release of their commercial app.The book is extremely well-written. (In a past life, I was a tech writer. Nothing worse than a badly written techie book.)The flow is well thought out. Not being a DB meister, the first few chapters were extremely helpful. In my case (and I'm sure, many others as well), I had to get up on DBs in a large hurry. With the Cheetah book, I was able to do so.The examples given are concise, easy to follow, and they _work_. The latter point is invaluable.I would recommend this book to anyone who uses Perl and the DBI."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"Programming the Perl DBI continues the long O'Reilly standard of providing accurate technical information for a reasonable price. If you develop or use Perl DBI, BUY THIS BOOK!Chapter 2:Humble beginning to start a Perl DBI book with how to use other types of data storage and retrieval features. I found this very enlightening as a solution to persistent data challenges not requiring a full database system.Chapter 3: A basic intro to SQL. Simple and to the point.Chapter 4-6 Describes development using Perl DBI. The information is excellent, as DBI is only an interface to the database systems. These chapters describe how to use the interface, the standard features supported, and expected results. Do you want to learn about reading BLOBs or binding output columns? Need to use bound input parameters? The information is all contained in these chapters.Chapter 7: I enjoyed the quick comparison between DBI (DBD::ODBC) and Win32::ODBC.Chapter 8: The description of DBD::Proxy and how to begin, is worth the price of the book. These simple pages make interfacing Linux to Win32 (NT/9[58]) easier to explain and do.The appendixes provide information about the DBI interface, what properties are available from which handle, also, a brief description of the drivers available. Good reading. I'd reference this section if selecting a database provider for a Perl solution. Enjoyed reading which driver supported what features. Is this information available in pod format, yes, however, this book provides it in one cover with an index. I'd check the driver pods for changes or additional features, as the development of DBD drivers continues.Interacting with a database system is a complex process. Using Perl DBI gives a standard interface to this complex process. This book does not explain how to use advance features of a particular database system. This is left to the reader and the large number of database references available. If you want to use a stored procedure with a trigger or execute a stored query, Programming the Perl DBI explains how to make the call, however, you'd need to know what to execute, and results to expected.As I stated in the beginning, this book is a must for anyone serious about using Perl DBI."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"this is a solid book that's been needed for a long time. it's a good introductory text for perl programmers on how databases work, and how to use the dbi to access them.i'm one of many who has spent hour after hour bashing my head against the dbi. of everything i've developed in perl, database interactivity and the dbi specifically has had by far the steepest learning curve. what i would have given to have this book six months ago.even though it comes after my painful experience, though, i've already found information in this book i hadn't gleaned elsewhere that will help me immediately in projects i'm working on. the chapter on dbish alone is worth the price of the book to me.i'm also glad to see a very detailed breakdown by major dbd drivers. my most significant problems were sussing out the specifics of dbd::informix; even with the generous help of jonathan leffler, i had a hard time figuring out some of what's clearly stated here.the one thing this book is missing is a detailed explanation of installing the dbi. addressing the basic issues for each major driver would probably easily double the size of the book, but this information is some of the hardest to learn on your own. since the book is targeted at perl programmers, it would be valuable to include the rdbms-specific information about installing the drivers that perl programmers are unlikely to have experience with. this information would also be crucial in easing communication with the various sysadmins and dba's whose help will likely be needed to get any perl-database project off the ground.i'd like to see an expanded second edition, or perhaps an advanced title, to expand on this complex topic. it would be nice to see an explanation focused for db developers and dbas on how to use perl for their work.kudos to alligator descartes and tim bunce for an excellent book that makes the dbi more accessible. once i got a rudimentary understanding of the dbi under my belt, i was quickly able to demonstrate perl's power for database connectivity in my work environment. by easing the initial learning curve, descartes and bunce are helping perl prove its reputation as an easy-to-use, powerful programming language."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This is a good DBI reference for experienced perl programmers.

There you will find good explanations on connecting to databases, executing SQL statements, and some advanced features such as binding variables. The authors give a good treatment of the various ways to execute queries with performance tradeoffs.Chapter 7 is only useful if you are working on a Windows platform. My database is on Solaris so this wasn't something that I needed.As I said, though, what's there is good, but I there is definitely something missing. I needed to be able to call Oracle stored procedures as well as executing simple SQL queries. It would be nice to include some examples of calling stored procedures using the major vendors: Oracle, Informix, Sybase, etc. This information is hard to come by on the web. There are subtleties in using inout parameters in stored procedure calls that require some extra work in perl. You have to size variables large enough to store the largest value that is in the database. Since perl handles all string sizes dynamically, I used sprintf to force the strings to be large enough before calling the stored procedure. I don't know if you would run into these issues with outher databases, but it would be good to have this information with the rest of this text. That would make this fine book complete."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This book is very much a regurgitation of the docs you can find online.

And I bought my copy of the book.The Cheetah Book has a lot of useful information in it. Obviously, it describes the core DBI functionality very clearly, but it also contains a lot of information that was not previously available in a form comparable to what is in the book. For example, the extensive Appendix B, which lists a lot of details about each of the various drivers, is very useful and informative indeed. The information is not yet available elsewhere in this format, and you'd have to download all the drivers to be able to get all the information in one place. The guide to using the DBI Proxy Server is invaluable. The non-DBI database information in Chapter 2 is interesting; it shows how diverse the Perl modules are. And the comparison with Win32::ODBC is illuminating.There is information in the main text which has not been documented before, such as the &quot;use DBI qw(:sql_types);&quot; -- that isn't in Appendix A (the DBI Specification), either, but that oversight will no doubt be fixed so that it is in 'perldoc DBI' by the time DBI 1.14 is available on CPAN.This book does not attempt to teach you the rudiments of Perl, and nor should it. It does not teach everything about SQL, and nor should it. It doesn't teach you about every possible use of DBI, and it shouldn't try to do that either. It is a pity that the use of DBI with the Apache web server and mod_perl is not covered at all, but even that would be difficult to do sensibly. Half the effort would be in explaining how to handle HTML and CGI and not in using DBI per se. Nevertheless, should there be a second edition, this is something that should be covered in outline, even if not in complete detail.If you have any intention of working with DBI, either as a regular user or as a driver writer, you need this book.

The inclusion of advanced topics such as transactions and database proxying provide the meat that would satisfy any advanced user. And of course, no database programming book should be without a chapter on Microsoft's ODBC, and this book covers it in sufficient detail.And to top it off, a copy of the DBI specification, as well as an outline of what constitutes a DBI driver (DBD) provides enough incentive for those who want to dig a little deeper, or to add to the long list of supported databases.This book is a great addition to any Perl/RDBMS programmer's bookshelf, and will remain in my library for a long time."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"I received The Book a few days ago from Amazon and have read it cover to cover.As an early and long-time user of Perl DBI, I was delighted to discover ways and means that were previously unknow to me.Maybe I'm not alone in failing to study the docs after each new release of DBI.

I bought the book soon after it was released and continue to use it - sometimes on a daily basis depending upon the project I am currently developing. I realized from the beginning that much of the material in this book came from the online documentation and have still found the book to be useful enough to stay on my A-list of reference materials. Applications like CGIScripter need to utilize up to half a dozen different databases so I have found the reference section on each database be the section I often turn to first. I have not found this info available anywhere in the online documentation. When you program and debug on multiple computers with multiple windows open simultaneously, having a reference book is often more manageable than opening another window on the computer. And for those times when I am struggling with an especially troublesome programming issue, I have found it very helpful to sit in my easy chair with a reference book like the Perl DBI book in order to research the problem.

Most importantly, I finally have a comprehensive reference, instead of a bunch of miscellenous man pages sitting on my desktop :-)Knowing about the intricacies of each driver (in my case Sybase) clarified several issues and helped us solve some thorny problems at my job.More mod_perl stuff would have been nice, but when was the last time you bought a book with everything in it?"},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This book does just what it proposes, and no more - provides a clear, clean, readable explanation of the DBI module in perl, along with a collection of handy notes for most of the popular DBD driver modules. Not a book for learning SQL, not a book for learning perl, but perfect for learning DBI/DBD and some handy techniques for optimizing db access in perl!"},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This book is slim. About 1/3 is a DBI reference, which you can get free from the distribution. About 1/5 of the book (in the beginning), it describes Berkeley's dbm (and thus why DBI is necessary). So, what we have left is mere 130 pages to describe DBI features. The author uses these pages to explain only very simple things like: How to connect to the database, and execut very simple queries like &quot;SELECT name FROM employee&quot;, get the result set, and so forth. The book never describes more complex real world problems, such as how you would execute stored procedures (for example, in Oracle, PL/SQL packages) get the result back through arguments, and other intricate problems. If you want to learn the very fundamentals of how to connect, execute, and get the results for very simple SQL queries, this book will help you. But then you can visit free web sites that offer such things. If you want to solve real world problems using DBI, this book offers NOTHING !"},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"The man pages and perl doc just do not cover the details in depth enough for professional use of the perl DBI. While this book contains a lot of introductory material, the later chapters include many details that I have just not seen in any other reference -details that can make or break a program.If all you are is a hacker that uses -&gt;do() everywhere, never check error returns, don't know what an array of hash references is good for, then the contents of this book are not for you. The man pages are plenty. But if you really care about performance, and how to write programs that make the most of the facilities at hand, this book gives the details that aren't in the man pages.For Perl programmers the Perl DBI is one of the most important facilities in the language. Understanding it depth is one of the requisities of Perl guru-dom."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This is a (the definitive) book on Perl DBI. I swapped book-for-book with a former co-worker for this. I keep it in the office for the newbies.If you're already a pro at PERL, you should be able to get by with just the CPAN documentation. However, if your employer is footing the bill, get it. :-)However if you're new to PERL and need to use DBI, get it.Very nice tips and tricks you can pick up, even a few for the pros."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"The database-oriented view of programming has become increasingly popular, and it is of great importance for all serious programmers to understand how to use their favorite language to manipulate the database systems. With the variety of database systems out there, it can be a real challenge to learn what there is to know. For the Perl programmer, however, there is this book on the matter, and it will probably be all you'll need to get started working with database programming in no time. Other reviewers have stated that this is a regurgitation of the docs. This is partially true. But the docs are very bland, and this book presents the information in a much more informative, and easy to read manner. With it, you can begin programming the DBI within a week (a day if you already know SQL and skip the chapter on the Berkley DB system). Recommended for anyone interested in learning how to use Databases with Perl. If you already know the DBI, the book wont be of much help, maybe as a reference, but I'd only pick it up if you don't know it, or are still inexperienced at it."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"I typically go to O'Reilly for manuals FIRST because they are well-written and contain coherent explanations and good examples which the reader can use as models.This book has neither. The examples are insanely limited (for example, there is nothing whatsoever about using UPDATE: the authors apparently believe that all databases on the planet are complete and that no one will ever want to change any of them), and one find oneself hopping around the book trying to get SOME indication of how things are supposed to work - therefore its usefulness as a reference book is also limited.In short, wait until something else comes along and until then either read the documentation that comes with the DBI module or the source code itself. You'll save yourself more time that way."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"There's little in this title that cannot be found in the online Perl DBI and DBD documentation. If you've never done any DBI, you can just browse the perlDBI docs and then go to this book to clarify one or two concepts (like should I use DBI or ODBC?). After that, you'll never touch this book again. It is just too shallow. For a DBI book, it is horribly bad. There's a lot of DBM which does not belong in it, there's no discussions of extremely important classes like Persistance, the SQL introduction is useless, very basic &amp; incomplete and does not belong here either -you'll still need a SQL book-, there's no discussions on implementing secure Perl scripts for both web &amp; stand-alone applications, no discussion on how much or what to program on Perl or on the PL/SQL (or similar) language of the database Plus... there's hardly any discussion of the real DBD modules (Oracle, Informix, etc) as they apply to production. Information that should be bold and highlited (like Perl's DBD::Oracle does not support Oracle's 8 new structures or new OO datatypes). And there's hardly any real example of production code, only snippets of basic sample code. To tell you the truth, &quot;Advanced Perl Programming&quot; -which is not a great book either- has most of the DBI material covered here &amp; with better explanations."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"I think, what is covered in the book is more theory. No practical examples on how to connect to various databases (ex: MySQL, Oracle). I would rather say, it is outdated and more useful information can be found on the web. I shouldn't have bought it although it just costed me [...]."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"I really appreciate having this book around. Sure, there is much material on the internet on how to use the DBI, but I prefer it all in book form. I used to do a little PHP scripting, but I think that Perl and it's DBI is a better choice than it (but a little harder to learn, however). The DBI is quite a portable, flexible, and powerful system that I have come to love :)If there was one thing I would add/change to this book, I would have added more real life examples. Not much was focused on using databases for web sites, but that's ok, I guess, since it's not that much different.If a 16 year old like myself can follow and understand most of the stuff in this book, there's no reason why anyone else shouldn't be able to :)"},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"Contrary to what some people have written about this book it does contain plenty of example code and it does contain working code. They do an excellent job of telling you what results from method calls and give example code using those methods. Having some knowledge about Perl does help when reading the book. They tell you what the DBI is, how it works, why it is useful, and then go on to show you how to make it a very useful tool. They clearly explain how to deal with retrieved data and give many examples of retrieving data and working with the retrieved data. They explain how to use the power of the DBI to make db connections easier and faster as your programs grow. Once you understand what statement handles are and how they are used, what database handles are and how they are used(which are both clearly explained in the book), you can use the Appendix A as a quick reference for the method calls you might forget. Appendix B is a bit dated but gives detail about many database drivers you can use with the DBI. If you want something that has a better flow than the man pages this book is what you want."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"The Cheetah book is an invaluable resource for those who with to access databases with perl. The book contains almost exactly what I'd hoped. It provides detailed documentation for perl programming with DBI in a much clearer and more user friendly format than the man pages.

Getting 10,000 records from a 'matrix' and putting them into an excel file CLEARLY is not what this book is about. That is NOT a 'simple' example. That guy obviously does not know what he's talking about. And then he goes on to rave about how it covers waste-of-time subjects like select, insert, and update, which are THE fundamentals of SQL.Don't trust those reviewers' judgements and pass up an opportunity for a book of this calibur. This is a great book, it starts you out with a plan of a simple database, walks you through developing it and processing it through flat-files, DBM, and DBI, and introduces new problems and challenges. This book is for intermediately-skilled Perl programmers that are interested in taking their skills to the next level and joining in one of the most widely-used practices in the Web, database construction and management."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"This book is very high on theory and light on tutorials. I bought the book because I need to interface perl programs with my MySQL database (One that the book doesn't cover explicitly). On P79 they finally get around to telling you how to call the DBI. Then they talk extensively about handles and error handling (Before you can even write anything which could have errors!). It is P86 before they tell you how to establish a connection to the database (Not ask it anything, that doesn't come for another 20 pages, just connect). You need to know the data source to do so, they recomend the DBI-&gt;data_sources() method; unfortunatly they do not tell you what that method is, or how to implement it. (You ready to scream yet?) They include a small program to look up the information, but when I typed it in, it only gave me cryptic errors (Undefined variable in concatination - there was no concatination, or any &quot;.&quot; in the whole program, and the line number was that of a simple 'print &quot;\\\\n&quot;;' statement). I am only 1/2 way through the book so far, I am hoping it gets a bit more practical in the following chapters, but am not optimistic.The authors seem to be very knowledgeable in their subject. They should have talked to someone who doesn't know anything about DBI (Preferably someone who is short on time and long on stuff that needs to be run) when they determined the content and layout of this book."},{"Title":"Programming the Perl DBI","review":"The only thing I learned from this book is what region in the UK where some popular megalyths are and how I should act while visiting them.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you.

One of the more striking features of this book is the appendix section which gives a list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as messianically applied. An absolute must for any who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the coming of Messiah surrounding the days when the Carpentar from Nazareth walked the Earth.

Alfred was obviously a world class scholar. He adds meaningful depth to the scriptures as he follows Jesus through his time on earth. I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it. Alfred brings in many comments from both Jewish and non-Jewish scholars. He explores the scriptures with insights and depth challenging the reader to do likewise.

It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages. Buy that book, along with Darrell Bock's Jesus According to Scripture and Ben Witherington's The Christology of Jesus, and you should have everything you need."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors.

It includes submission to Emperer Tiberius Augustus in Rome as well as the cruelty of Pontius Pilot. If interested in biblical history it is a book at I would recommend.

Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic.

I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking.

The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus.

This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

The book is easy to follow- I have bought many a cookbook promising me the recipes of my childhood, only to find one or two in a book of hundreds. This cookbook one delivers- I have been cooking like a Trini since I came home...infact my macaroni pie was so good my husband asked if I'd improved upon his mother's recipe...that is probably the biggest compliment I have ever got from my Triniman!!! I did add a little something extra to the recipe in the book...but it was good as written too. I bought mine on the last trip home and it was recommended to me by the lady in the book store. I purchased it for $125 TT so I was a bit taken aback at the pricing on Amazon...all I can think is some one here didn't do the conversions from TT dollars to US dollars. If you are not a Trini but love Trini foods this IS YOUR COOKBOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago & the Caribbean","review":"Amazon must be posting the sticker price that was in $TTD as the for sale price.

One didn't know whether to make Alloo & Channa first, or currants rolls. I think every Trini who lives abroad should have one in their pantry, right next to their curry powder and char sui sauce.

It took me months to decide whether or not to buy this book because of its high price, but I finally bought it and it was well worth it. It has everything...currant roll, coconut roll/salara, black cake, coconut drop, sweet bread/buns cake, guava stew, macaroni pie, samosa, jamaican beef patty, jalebi, kurma, buljol, sausage roll/vienna sausage or salami roll,cheese straws, gauva jam, fish and chips, ketchup (caribbean ketchup is different, eh), white bread, hops bread, cheese pinwheels/cheese roll, pone, vinegar candy/taffy/gatta, green seasoning, paimie, paleau, souse, curried eggs, dal, flying fish, fish broth, calalloo, pholorie, breadfruit chips, lo mein, sorrel, ginger beer, etc...it's a good book. My mom, who wouldn't pay more than 10 dollars on a book, wants to buy her own copy of this book, after browsing through mine...yeah, it's that good. It is well worth the high price. My only critisism is for the peera, goolab jamoon and ras gulla recipes;they are the Trini version, the other islands make them in the tradional Indian way, whereas Trini's have created thier own versions, so I think they should have included both versions for those 3 recipes, considering the title is Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago AND THE CARIBBEAN (although the Trini versions do look tasty) but other than that, it's a great book.P.S- As for the peera, goolab jamoon, and ras gulla recipes, I found out that 'Caribbean Desserts' by Dr. Betty 'K' has those recipes, I havent purchased the book, but I think it has the non-Trini version since the author is Guyanese. So, you can purchase both books if necessary."},{"Title":"The Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago & the Caribbean","review":"This is an excellent well-written, beautifully illustrated cook book! Having grown up in the Caribbean the dishes in this book are all familiar and ones I have been cooking all my life - not from written recipes, but from memory - and it wasn't always easy to remember all the specific ingredients or methods. This cookbook saves me the trouble. It is awesome. It takes me back to my childhood and I can now share my favorite dishes with my 12yr old daughter who is just learning to cook. The author(s) go beyond just providing recipes and pictures... they include Notes on Metric conversion for solid and Liquid measure, oven temperatures (in Celsius and Fahrenheit) for mixtures and deep frying, a nutriion index for each dish right on the same page of each recipe, a table of contents, an index, and a comprehensive glossary of terms for those who may not know what \\"Kuchela\\", \\"Chip-Chip\\" or \\"Phulourie\\" is. They even include guidelines for substituions, converting to microwave cooking and a table of abbreviations for measurements. It's all in there. I do wish, however, that they had included a bit of the history of Caribbean cuisine and the sources of the many influences found in it. With that said, the pages are glossy and not flimsy. The recipes are simple and showcase the diveristy of Caribbean cuisine which reflects our african, indian, chinese, japanese, middle-eastern and european heritage. I received this as a gift from my mother (she probably got tired of my \\"how-to\\" calls) and the first time I flipped through it I literally squealed with delight at seeing all my childhood favorites.

The Blue Book saves the songs of the Civil War period through about 1920, the people's songs that would otherwise be forgotten - Tenting Tonight on the Old Campground, the works of Stephen Foster - no longer politically correct but still melodically beautiful, Annie Laurie and a host of Scottish ballads, the Little Brown Church in the Vale, Alouette, songs my grandparents loved and my children have never heard of. And that's the beauty of the Blue Book of Favorite Songs - the songs are there, with playable piano arrangements, from the obscurity of One Vacant Chair to a fine collection of Christmas songs to selections from popular operas to national anthems and patriotic songs before the Great War. It's a pleasure to sit and play through. The songs encapsulate their times and still have meaning today in many cases."},{"Title":"The Storyteller: Memory, Secrets, Magic and Lies","review":"History through the eyes of a child has never been so beautifully told.

He is ever-present in this story of one family in the turmoil that was Hungary in the 1940s and '50s. But the tale reaches much farther back, illuminating corners of Eastern European history too long forgotten. Savour this book for it shows how powerful the simple stories that comprise our collective past can be."},{"Title":"Walk with peril","review":"I read this book when it was still newly published, and ever since I have wanted a copy of my own, but could not recall the actual title.

It is a good historic novel about the Lollards in England in the early 1400's."},{"Title":"Walk with peril","review":"Book Summary (from dust jacket): \\"Two young men walked with peril during those months of 1415. One was Robert Fairfield, in danger because of his religion, and because of the enmity of the Duke of York. The other was King Henry V, who knew he was always surrounded by deceit and treachery and who let no man stand behind him. Robert Fairfield came from Wales to London to become King Henry's loyal follower in the hope of winning the accolade of knighthood. Since Robert was poor he rode alone, with his long sword, a belt of golden bells, and a shield bearing the device of a sleeping lion on a green field and the legend \\"Wake Me No Man.\\" The wealthy merchant, Lewis Chappelle, hurrying citywards with his lovely daughter Constance, grudgingly asks Robert to join his party for the sake of his sword, and then to stay in the vast mansion by the Thames. Here Robert sense strange and secret currents, and is on his guard as a stranger and as a member of the Lollards, the sect that even so early believed in religious freedom and whose members were now banned, persecuted and killed. And in a tavern brawl he met again the Duke of York, cousin to the king, whose enmity Robert had gained in Wales. York's hatred is to follow Robert through the roads and battlefields of France to Robert's mortal peril. This is an exciting and colorful novel about two fascinating men. Robert is brave, resourceful, loyal, and his love story is as touching as it is honorable. But even more fascinating is the picture of Henry V, brave, determined, hard and cruel on behalf of England, kind and winning to his friends, who moves alone among his courtiers and his men, with his hidden dread of the assassin's knife or poisoned cup, yet always pressing forward to make England strong at home and abroad.\\"I first read this novel probably in junior high, and most likely because my sister was reading it. She'd checked it out from our local library. Judging from how much I had forgotten, much of it must have been over my head at the time. But I was struck enough with the characters, that I remember going back to the library, checking it out for myself, and reading it at least a couple more times between junior high and when I graduated from high school.I lost track of the book when I went off to college, and only \\"rediscovered\\" it this past March (2008). By then, of course, the book had since gone long out of print. But I ordered a used copy through Amazon, and have just finished reading this splendid book again. I was afraid I might be disappointed, that the book might be somehow \\"less\\" than I remembered from my youth. Instead, it was much, much more. The subtitle of Walk With Peril is An Exciting Novel of Henry V and Agincourt. Fortunately, that subtitle only appears on the dust jacket, so I'd never seen it on the bookbinding or on the inside pages of the book. Otherwise, I might have dismissed it as \\"a book about battles\\", instead of \\"a book about characters\\" and never picked it up to read it. I've never been much interested in reading books about battles. But catch me up in a character, and I'll go all the way with him. And that's what Jackson does in Walk With Peril. She spends the first ten chapters developing the hero (Robert Fairfield), the woman he loves (Constance Chappelle), her merchant father, a surly servant who ultimately becomes Robert's most faithful companion, and even in some nearly heartbreaking scenes, a great mastiff dog. (Don't worry, she stays strictly in Robert's POV to do so.) By the time the hero Robert joins the troops of King Henry V and follows him on the campaign that will end in the famous battle of Agincourt, one is no longer worried about it being a \\"battle book\\". One merely is as ready to follow Robert wherever he goes, as Robert is ready to follow the king.Walk With Peril was published in 1959. If you're looking for a \\"hot romance\\", this book isn't it. The romance is tender and touching and a little sad. It is also honorable, for above all things, Robert Fairfield is an honorable man, but the author does leave us with hope for him and Constance at the end. Neither is this book filled with page after page of detailed battle scenes. Yes, the battle comes...more than one, in fact...but once Robert leaves Constance to follow the king, the focus shifts to introducing the characters of Henry V and his plotting cousin, the Duke of York. And what characters they are! Each one shines like a jewel...each a flawed jewel, perhaps, but each all the more human and, therefore, intriguing and heroic for it.Walk With Peril is a long lost jewel of an historical novel. I would love to see it reprinted some day."},{"Title":"Buckeye Women: History Of Ohio'S Daughters (Ohio Bicentennial Series)","review":"My mother bought this book and loaned it to me to read. If I had a daughter, I would give it to her to read. These women are the unsung heroes of time and history. From frontier days to modern civilization, women have always been the backbone of any social change. Women have fought for equal pay, equal rights and better working conditions. Women have fought for the right to vote. They fight to better society. They fight to keep the family farms. They raised children and worked in factories to keep food on the table. They may have been subjected to men and laws ~~ but they have always fought to have a better life.This book is very inspiring. Buckeye women are strong and intelligent women who didn't let prejudice stop them from achieving their goals. They fought for what they believed in. And some of the Buckeye women have moved onto the national platform ~~ bringing Ohio into the forefront of history. It's a fascinating read ~~ very insightful and for those who don't care for long descriptives, this book is brief and straight to the point. I didn't feel like they've left anything out ~~ in fact, this book has piqued my interest in Ohioans and read more on Ohio history. It's a fascinating look into time. It also makes me very thankful that my foremothers fought to give me better opportunities in life ~~ it's a book that everyone should read.4-17-03"},{"Title":"Isaiah and His Interpreters","review":"Why do people write books when they have nothing profound or original to say, and nothing in the way of serious scholarship to share?

This book is very useful for the identification of a few birds such as turkey, quail, and other similar birds. However, there are only 2 pages dedicated to the ulna (Only shows a turkey ulna and a turkey vulture radius in single pane view). The drawing are good (beautiful actually) but detail tends to be fuzzy. Many of the drawings could use more detail, and more multiple views are necessary for this to be a stand alone lab manual. The good points are the following:1. This is essentially the only affordable book of its kind out there.2. This book can help guide the researcher, when a comparative collection is not available (in the field).3. This book will help you identify turkey, quail, and grouse with little difficulty.The negative points:1. Detail can be fuzzy, making it only possible to identify a few species of the many within the book.2. Very few lateral views of bones (mainly front and back).3. The ulna and radius are visually represented by only a single species (despite the many other species covered within the book).I may have reservations about some features of the book, however, I would recommend this book to those who need a quick reference, and Gilbert's book is a good quick reference when used with actual bones from a comparative collection. The book is fun to look at and the information within is informative. And luckily there is plenty of room on each page for your own notes and observations, which many books of its kind lack."},{"Title":"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews","review":"This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in this subject. For all of us who think of the holocaust as a fast, furious and random event, Zucotti corrects us in showing a no less devilish but organized, punctilious horror. I am truly in awe of my grandparents, people who always respected the law and wouldn't think of not responding to a summonce, for having the wits and the luck to escape anihilation in occupied france."},{"Title":"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews","review":"\\"The Holocaust, The French, and The Jews\\" is a book full of stories that we should never forget because they are filled with teachings for all of us.The powerful capacity that we, human beings, have to bring pain and or sorrow on other human beings is astonishing. The hardships that the Jews had to endure while Hitler was in power was a vivid proof of that. But I don't believe that their suffering was in vain. And I want to learn from their past. I want to remember the ones who died and honor the ones who survived. To learn from their past, I have to know their past and the writer of this book, Susan Zuccotti, helped me do so.To understand their past, I would have to imagine what it could be to breathe the heavy and dreadful air as the profound anguish rose with the German ordinance that dictated that all Jews must wear the David's star. I supposed that Hitler figured out that if he was going to slaughter the shepperd's sheep, what a better way but to mark them?To learn about the Jews, I would have to imagine exactly what it could be to be an eight-year-old boy who went home beaten up every day because on the upper left side of his shirt, a six-pronged yellow star with the word \\"Juif\\" in the center had been sewn. And to wonder how many people thought that the boy was a dirty \\"youpine\\" (foreign Jew). To understand I would have to know what it could be to leave one's childhood at the edge of a bench as one watch a flock of children, women and old people carrying bundles of cloth while being herded to a dark destiny. To hear the sound of their cries reaching all the way to heaven with \\"All the human pain that both life and death provide\\"I would have to know or experience seeing the young worker's face--the one who carried in his wallet the false identity cards and baptismal certificates of his wife and child-- at the news that his family had gotten caught up in a massive roundup at the other side of the city.\\"The Holocaust, The French and The Jews\\" is a book filled with downcast stories like those. In most of these stories, the main character did not live two months after the incident occurred. These stories have helped me understand what it was to be a Jew and what consequences this brought into their lives, the lives of others and the making of history. It has also helped me see, had I been there, that just as during the holocaust each person took a place in history, so I could have taken mine. I could have taken the place of the policeman, the traitor, the helper, the accuser, the guilty, the damned, the indifferent, the youpine or the \\"Friend of the Jews\\", the dictator, the orphan, the lost, the hungry, the powerful, the widow, the blind, the hopeless, the saint. And now should another holocaust occur, and after reading this book, I can choose more freely the place I want to take."},{"Title":"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews","review":"This is for Ellen, the last person to post a comment. I would recommend the film \\"the shame and the sorrow,\\" a great documentary chronicling French participation in the Holocaust. Unfortunately, the French Catholic church not only was complacent when French Jews were being rounded up, many among them actively encouraged it. Some started sermons with the \\"Heil Hitler\\" salute. The author did not create the Catholic problem, the Catholic church did. The Church's history of perpetuating the deicide myth, blood libel and its insistence that Jews deserved eternal condemnation and punishment throughout history, played directly into Nazi ideology. Denying history will not improve the Catholic Church's image; active denunciation of past hateful preaching will!"},{"Title":"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews","review":"This book is a balanced study of the French efforts to save Jews during the Shoah, but it seems to have a Catholic problem. One of the strongest groups defending the Jews and hiding Jews was the French Catholic conference of bishops. The author seems to have a problem admitting this. She blithely ignores the pastoral letters denouncing racism and anti-Semitism. She also ignores the turning point in the relationship between the Vichy regime and the bishops. It was precisely the anti-Semitic laws of 1942 which moved the bulk of French bishops from cautious support of the Vichy regime to clear opposition to a racist government which they found appalling.

But it turned out to be an autobiography of a man I had never heard about. While he doesn't have any of the neat gadgets Mr. Bond always has handy, Sammy Tippit does seem to be in the right place at the right time. He is an evangelist to nations in crisis. What a gripping book! Told with humility, this is an account of the amazing hand of Our Lord on the life of a regular guy. But this regular guy is compelled to tell others about his best friend and how this friend changed his life and can changes their's too. Sammy seems just as amazed as the reader while describing the various places and people his travels have taken him. I am giving this book to 5 people for Christmass 2001."},{"Title":"God's Secret Agent","review":"I personnally thought that this book was a great read.

He has written a number of books, and those featuring Geneva Crenshaw are among his best. This latest book focuses on racism, and takes a deeper look at Jewish-black relationships, and the property rights in white skin color. While most thinking black Americans wouldn't find much to challenge here, many whites will find this a disturbing book on a number of levels.The statement made by the fictional president of the USA that &quot;we can no longer afford whiteness as an assumed right of citizenship&quot; is one which should engender serious thinking among whites who want to really understand 21st century America. Even though this book was published in 1998, the issues it raises have not disappeared with the change in the century, increased numbers of &quot;mixed&quot; race children, and increased intermarriage between American blacks and others.Would I buy this book? Yes. Would I keep it? Yes. This is a worthy read with plenty to think about."},{"Title":"Afrolantica Legacies","review":"What I found most impressive about this book is the way it challenges assumptions and attitudes about Jewish racism and hegemony. Bell is a courageous and brilliant writer, and this is the best novel I have read in several months. And as a feminist and white woman, I found it much more interesting than many other books by white writers who attempt to address these issues. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Afrolantica Legacies","review":"This book reads like it was written by someone whose entire existence was lived inside a bubble of racism, self-hatred, hopelessness and fantasy. To fully appreciate Bell's book you must take the man, himself, and his personal views into account as you read his writing. Desegregation was the very antithesis of his theory about racism. Bell refused to acknowledge the extraordinary, quantifiable gains made by blacks in America since desegregation. The progress in racial equality and race blindness that had resulted in America by the time Bell wrote this book profoundly undermined the credibility of his theory about racism. It is blatantly obvious that this story book was a desperate effort by Bell to restore life in a philosophical theory already proven wrong by the real world application of desegregation. Bell's entire life and renown were all about his theory. To admit he was wrong was not an option for him. Even his attempts at levity in this book fall short because they read false. Had Bell lived in the real world, rather than inside his insulated bubble of unrealistic theories of race and hatred, he would have written an entirely different book - an uplifting one, filled with encouragement and hope for the future of blacks in all countries around the globe. His was a sad, tormented life of self-delusion. You come away from this book feeling pity for the author. The book has a Don Quixote feel about it, sans the literary quality."},{"Title":"Afrolantica Legacies","review":"Derrick Bell returns to his &quot;legal fiction&quot;, which again proves fascinating. Prof. Bell amplifies the sub rosa elements of race relations in the US, and holds them up to the light. This is a great read for any thinking person. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"End of Time","review":"Taking in the vast cultic mileu - doomsdayers, new agers, evangelicals, pentecostalists, fundamentalists (both Christian and Muslim), liberal democrats and, naturally, millennialists (technically, those who await the thousand year reign of Christ prophesied in the book of Revelation) - Thompson's treatise uncovers the historical and sociological motives we have for putting ourselves near the end of history rather than at its beginning.The approach of the calendar millennium has been a catalyst for the current wave of Pre Millennial Tension sweeping the globe but there are much larger issues at stake. Thompson argues that there is a powerful confluence between apocalyptic belief and the universal human experience which allows that belief to fit within the personal horizon of the individual.Our urge to celebrate the passing of time fails to conceal an even deeper urge to escape from it, which is why our celebration of 2000 is set to have a bittersweet edge and a tinge of desperation."},{"Title":"End of Time","review":"This fun overview of religious wackiness is still surprisingly readable a decade and more post-millenium; you could supplement it with the baggier How to Win a Cosmic War (of course 9/11 was a game-changer) and the specifically Jerusalem-focussed (a hoot, this one) *The End of Days* by **Gershom Gorenberg** Not to be confused with the egregious and 'internationally best-selling' Sylvia Browne's book of the same title - and no doubt innumerable others.."},{"Title":"BASEBALL IS A FUNNY GAME","review":"There was a time when baseball was truly America's favorite sport, and this book is an excellent choice for those who want to relive a slice of those times.

It is not an autobiography, it's a look at what goes on behind the scenes in baseball. This being 46 years later, the information is dated, but it's still an interesting look at what baseball was like in the \\"good old days\\".

Her work reads much like a critical commentary. Reimer's reconstructs the history and setting behind the text pertaining to women in Acts. She examines in detail the stories of Sapphira, Tabitha, Lydia, a prophetic slave girl, Priscilla, and other assorted women mentioned briefly. Reimer's work is a welcome contribution to a growing appreciation ofthe roles of women in Acts. Whether you agree with her assumptions and conclusions, the point remains that Reimer has successfully helped to open the door for a new and fresh look at the role of Women in the Acts of the Apostles.

In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, practically everything Jesus taught was related either directly or indirectly to what He called \\"The Kingdom\\". John's Gospel has Jesus using an equivalent expression: \\"Eternal Life\\". John Bingham discusses the parables of Jesus in a contemporary language and brings the parables to life for a modern Christian. Bingham illustrates that Carl Jung's psychology and orthodox Christianity are altogether compatible. According to Luke 17:20, Jesus was asked: \\"When will the Kingdom come?\\" Jesus explained: \\"The Kingdom is within you.\\" Jesus used everyday, earthly images to teach His disciples to become \\"perfect\\", i.e., to grow into a complete, whole person. Jung wrote about what he called the process of \\"Individuation. A woman once wrote to Jung with a question: \\"Dr. Jung, are you a Christian? Please answer simply. Please answer 'yes' or 'no'.\\" Dr. Jung replied that he stood in the mainstream of the very next development of Protestantism.\\" The format of Inner Treasure lends itself to individual meditation and/or group study. The chapters are short yet remarkably complete. Inner Treasure is a veritable gem."},{"Title":"Inner Treasure: Reflections on Teachings of Jesus","review":"Inner Treasure assists us in reflecting on the kingdom of God - the kingdom that is at hand, that is within us here and now, the kingdom which gives its all for us, which heals us and urges us to grow.

But we must get serious about it, become disciples (learners), become conscious of the inner and outer forces that fashion our lives.

The role reversal between USA and USSR puts a mirror to the real world: to especially telling effect when there's no change. For instance, &quot;In the Air&quot; has a lot to say about the double standard that makes people see identical behaviour - platoons of children in military uniform honouring war heroes, and saluting the flag - as healthy patriotism in their own country, but sinister militaristic indoctrination in another. Other targets are the US Vietnam movie mythos (&quot;Teddy Bears' Picnic&quot; features classic English comic characters conscripted to a British Indochina war); British royalty (&quot;Abdication Street&quot; is a bad-taste mimic of the Charles/Diana wedding); and the late tycoon Robert Maxwell. This may not be to your taste; many of the TV and movie in-jokes are far more accessible to UK readers. But if it is, you'll find it a wonderfuly dark and witty take on the major events of this century."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"I thought USSA would be a better book, and indeed the beginning of it displayed much promise. However, past the Revolution itself it slipped downhill. You never get a good feel for the events that surreound the individuals. Also, the mixing of real-life and fictional characters just didn't work for me. USSA could have been a much better book, given its premise."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"The premise is that Teddy Roosevelt was assassinated by Annie Oakley after a successful presidential win by the Bull Moose Party. His Vice President, millionaire Charles Foster Kane (yes, watch out for the fictional characters who appear in the narrative as well as the historical ones who appear in new personnas), plunges the USA into a disastrous early entry into the Great War. This leads to a violent Revolution and the establishment of of a new Socialist state in America, while Russia evolves into a constitutional monarchy.This is quite a trip! The book is told in the form of separate narratives, from the young Buddy Holly under the regime of Chairman Capone (the USSA's Stalin), a wonderland mirror version of the Untouchables and the Grapes of Wrath, a tale about Ed Gein coldcut supplier to the Party big-wigs, the British experience in the Vietnam War (&quot;Teddy Bears Picnic&quot; -- a wonderful sequence), television under the csar during a Royal Wedding, and much more.Newman and Byrne are mishugah, and I like it."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"Most other AH books are meant to be serious-this one most definitely isn't. It's great mix of alternate history as well as characters and scenes &quot;borrowed&quot; from other great works of fiction. The scenes in the Indochinese War were taken straight from &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Tigerland&quot;, and especially &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (complete with the musical chopper raid, an analogue to the 'napalm' speach, and even a Kurtz); Hannibal Lector is a USSA Communist Party psychologist; after the USSA falls, the Blues Brothers ride around a war-torn USSA remeniscant of &quot;Mad Max&quot;. All in all, a good romp, although the authors should be on the lookout for people seeking to terminate them with extreme prejudice for their borrowing of other fiction."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"This novel is a complete trip thru the history of the United Socialist States of America. You heard me correct, Eugene Debs lead a revolution and established a socialist republic during WW1. Byrne and Newman paint a vivid picture of an America that could have been. Their use of characters both real as well as fictional is incredible. This is a must read for anyone interested in Alternative History. It is much more than a novel. This book deals with British and Russian involvement in the Vietnam War, the Great Purges of Capone's dictatorship, to the creation of the Common Wealth of Independent North American States. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"This book is the most I've enjoyed an alternate history since reading Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South.&quot; Byrne and Newman do an excellent job on extrapolating from their premise of a United States gone communist.The one flaw with the book is that the authors go a little heavy into the &quot;oh, so that's what so-and-so is doing&quot; alternate history scenarios; some of the &quot;real&quot; characters seem to have little purpose more than just to be mentioned in the book. But this is only a trivial flaw."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"Kim Newman is the most accomplished practitioner of \\"alternate history\\", as evident from his astonishing Anno Dracula series, as well as his dark & daring tales of the Diogenes Club in 'this' world. But in this book, perhaps because of the geography (the United States of America is, after all, much-much bigger than the comparatively tiny UK or Britain envisaged by Saki, in his \\"When William Came\\" or in the Anno Dracula books), the gallop never becomes canter. There are intriguing flashes of Newman's magical touches here & there. The way pop culture and history mixes into imagination to give it a pseudo credibility is also very good. But it could have been great. Perhaps the authors would give it a new flourish, adding a few more taut novellas to the main body, when they (hopefully) re-release this book at some point of time. Recommended."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"The book tries to make parallels between the rise of communism in the USA in this other reality and the rise of communism in the USSR and barely pulls it off. Then it tries to follow how the lives of certain Americans would have turned out diffently in the USSA and does it most uncovincingly. Finally it just seems to give up and tries to be cutesy after a while. I wanted to like this book but it just never got off the ground for me."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"Authors approach the fictionalization of history in a variety of ways. Some choose to illuminate events with behind-the-scenes information or through the use of unusual perspectives--George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series and Lewis Shiner's Glimpses are examples. Borges proposes a garden of forking paths, where each decision creates another reality. Writers like Howard Waldrop warp reality to suit their purposes. Finally, there is the \\"what if\\" kind of alternate reality. Stephen Baxter's Voyage asks: What if John Kennedy survived Oswald's assassination attempt and went on to champion the space program? Robert Harris' Fatherland proposes a world where Germany won World War II. Terry Bisson's Fire on the Mountain depicts a United States where slaves successfully revolted during the Civil War and founded an independent southern country.Back in the USSA belongs to this last school, asking: What if the Communist revolution of 1917 took place in the United States rather than in Russia? Byrne and Newman posit a world where Eugene Debs takes the place of Lenin, Al Capone the place of Stalin, and First Secretary Kurt Vonnegut leads the USSA into a new era after communism fails. Composed of seven novellas, this collection explores the political, global, but most of all the personal repercussions of this change in history. Historical figures take the lead roles, but famous fictional characters are also prominently featured. Thus, Charles Foster Kane, champion of the robber barons, becomes President, and Norman Bates, Lou Ford and Andy Taylor appear as peripheral figures in a story about Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Gein.The first story, \\"In the Air (1989),\\" takes place shortly after the fall of communism in the USSA. Charles Hardin \\"Buddy\\" Holley reminisces to Brit newspaper reporter Lowe about the events of Labor Day 1951. On that day, the Revolutionary Fraternity Squadron visited Holley's hometown of Rosewell, Kansas. These \\"flying aces\\" of W.W.II --Lt. Lafayette R. Hubbard, Joseph \\"Bomber Joe\\" McCarthy, Gen. Curtis LeMay, Gen. \\"Duke\\" Morrison, and Col. Charles Lindbergh--are considered heroes by an adoring populace unaware that their superlative war records have been fabricated by the Party. Holley learns the truth about his former heroes from an unlikely pair of itinerant fliers named Howie Hughes and Jack Kerouac, and from that day forward questions the veracity of the Party line.\\"Ten Days That Shook the World (1912-1917)\\" provides much of the backstory behind the socialist revolution in the United States. Here, we learn that abuses by the robber barons precipitate unrest and, ultimately, revolution among the working class. The story covers such seminal events as President Teddy Roosevelt's assassination by Annie Oakley in 1912, the Mexican-American War of 1917, and Eugene V. Debs' triumphant seizure of the White House from President Charles Foster Kane on July 4, 1917. Also included are the sinking of the Titanic (in which escape artist Erich Weiss proves himself a hero), the assassination of Aleister Crowley by Nick Carroway and Tom Buchanan (paralleling the murder of Russian mystic Rasputin), and an appearance by Noah Cross (of Chinatown fame) as an unrepentant robber baron.\\"Tom Joad (1937)\\" is like a Frank Capra movie, but with an edge. I-Men Elliot Ness and Melvin Purvis are sent by Director Hoover to discover the truth behind the legend of Tom Joad. The migrant workers massing on California's borders consider him a combination of Robin Hood and Moses, someone who will protect them on their journey to the promised land. The powers that be think he's a myth, albeit a dangerous one. Ness and Purvis discover that everyone, including themselves, has a piece of Tom Joad inside (a piece of \\"one big soul\\"). The story is notable for appearances by Lyndon Johnson, Charlie Chaplin, and Boxcar Bertha. Frank Nitti, Beria to Al Capone's Stalin, also appears, gleefully slaughtering, among many others, John Boy Walton and the rest of his clean cut clan.Contemporary war movies like Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon inform the next story, \\"Teddy Bears Picnic (1965-1969)\\". A British soldier, identified only as Bob (not Tommy?), returns to the UK after fighting for King and country in Vietnam (referred to here as Indo-China). Bob writes a book about hisexperiences there, which is adapted into a motion picture by British director Michael Powell. A commentary on how perceptions can supplant reality, the story features some clever business about Alfred Hitchcock, director of \\"Nutter\\" (the story of a young man \\"who keeps the mummified corpse of his mother in the attic of his boarding house in Skegness\\"). Failing to produce a major hit in England, Hitchcock becomes a restaurateur rumored to have poisoned several customers he disliked.The focus returns to the USSA in \\"Citizen Ed (1945-1984),\\" a story about serial killer/cannibal/ghoul/transvestite Ed Gein. Besides being an aberration in a society that can't admit such figures exist, Ed is also a highly valued member of the Party, a butcher who, like his mother before him, rations choice cuts of meat to party officials. This tale, both satire and horror story, features cameos by a number of fictional serial killers and lawmen (and some, like Lou Ford, who are both). It also plays on the legend of Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street.\\"Abdication Street (1972)\\" is set in Tsarist Russia. Charles Windsor, the Duke of Cornwall, is in Russia to meet his future wife, Grand Duchess Ekaterina Nicolaivna, daughter of Tsar Nicholas III. Charles, however, falls in love with a commoner, Cinzia Davidovna Bronstein. Charles renounces his throne in the name of love (echoing the story of Edward VIII, who, in this reality, managed to retain the throne despite his marriage to Mrs. Simpson) only to discover his intended is far from upset--it seems she has fallen in love with Russian cosmonaut Pavel Chekov. Byrne and Newman also give us Harlan Ellison as a cultural attach&eacute; from the USSA, and Isaac Asimov as a famous television prognosticator.Reporter Lowe returns in \\"On the Road (1998),\\" a story of post communist America. Lowe is in the US to cover media mogul Sir Robert Maxwell's Freedom and Enterprise Roadshow, \\"a circus that would spend eight weeks traveling from Chicago to Los Angeles, bringing Americans the gospels of capitalism and Christianity--and selling all sorts of rubbish on the way.\\" The jaded journalist finds love in the US in the person of Lady Penelope Creighton Ward. For those who might not know, Lady Penelope was a character on Jerry Anderson's THUNDERBIRDS, a show produced via \\"puppetmation\\". Byrne and Newman have some fun with this, describing her as follows: \\"Her skirt seemed to restrict her movements, forcing her to bob in tiny steps, as if she were on wires.\\" The story also features appearances by Jake and Elwood Blues and easy riders Billy, Hanson, and Comrade America.A book like this depends in large part on the frisson of encountering a familiar character in an unfamiliar context. Byrne and Newman recognize this, salting these novellas with many such moments. Because of this, the stories reward rereading, as I found out firsthand when I went back to the text--the book is packed with nice flourishes and witty in-jokes. Of course, using icons as characters simplifies the authors' job--readers have an easier time relating to characters they already know. All the same, this is sometimes dangerous, as the authors assume a certain degree of cultural awareness that not every reader may have. For instance, \\"Abdication Street\\" and \\"The Teddy Bear's Picnic\\" will mean more to those familiar with the long running British soap opera Coronation Street or the work of British director Michael Powell. Readers in the UK and other countries will doubtless experience similar difficulties when confronted with certain American cultural references.The collection suffers slightly from repetition. Things that are witty in the first stories seem less fresh by the seventh. These pieces have more power when read on a stand alone basis with short breaks in between, the way they originally appeared in Interzone. Separately, each story shines. Taken together, they tend to steal each other's luster. Still, the stories work well--surprisingly little suspension of disbelief is required. Byrne and Newman create convincing scenarios, populating them with vivid characters, much as Newman did in his solo \\"alternate world\\" efforts, Anno Dracula and The Bloody Red Baron.With the majority of the twentieth century as a canvas, ample storytelling opportunities remain. As with the Flashman series, I look forward to reading about the areas of history that the authors have not yet explored--World War II would seem an obvious choice (given the huge amount of alternative history that uses that conflict as a springboard), and the Cold War also seems promising (perhaps 007 of SMERSH, Austin Powers, John Steed and Emma Peel could team to battle Derek Flint, Matt Helm, and the IMF?). Of course, Byrne and Newman will probably offer up something totally unexpected, as they have done in the past."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"This is an ambitious but very odd and uneven book, more an anthology than a cohesive--not to mention coherent--tale of alternate history. It is also a very British book, filled with character and pop-culture references unfamiliar to the average Yank. Even so, it's often laugh-out-loud funny, and occasionally moving.Alternate history most often falls into two categories--plausible, and farcical. This book doesn't even attempt realism; it mixes historical figures and fictional characters into the same batter, which results in a surreal batch of Special Brownies. (Charles Foster Kane is a contemporary of Teddy Roosevelt; J.R. Ewing is shot in the White House rather than on Dallas...)Each chapter is a story in itself, and (unless I'm mistaken) are deliberate spoofs of literary and other media genres and styles. Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (with Absinthe replacing Thompson's pharmaceuticals of choice and a Rolls Royce providing transport) and Ernest Hemingway are three of the most glaring examples, and there are references to and styles reminiscent of other writers, lyricists, poets, talking heads, et al. Sometimes the names are changed, slightly or severely. At times they are restored to their birth names. Sometimes, they just use whole cloth.The Russian/American ideological swap doesn't always translate, especially when the emphasis on the European audience leaves Americans scratching their heads. Even so, the AU version of the Vietnam War, with the British shouldering the burdens and the losses, and the parallels to Apocalypse Now, was simply brilliant.All in all, it was a worthwhile read, but I did come away disappointed. It's hit and miss--but when it hits, it's fabulous."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"Some reviews below may be missing the point here. This isn't intended as a hard core alternate history tale (actually several tales adding up to a schmorgasboard). I think Newman and Byrne wrote BACK IN THE USSA to have FUN with the WHAT IF? concept, and taken at this face value, the book is a playful hoot and a half. Other tales have a deeper soul. If you're up for some fiendishly sly and clever REMIXING HISTORY Funky Dub fun, then this may be your speed. Very creative, very clever, highly recommended. If you liked the &quot;spot the reference&quot; sense of humor in Newman's DRACULA CHA CHA CHA (aka JUDGEMENT OF TEARS in the US), you'll have no prob &quot;getting&quot; this book. It's not just a lark, though. The tales all have something interesting to say about human nature, hippocracy and the American spirit."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"If you have never read Kim Newman's fantasy series about England after Prince Dracula ascended to the throne as prince consort (_Anno Dracula_, _The Bloody Red Baron_ and _Judgement of Tears_) then go out and purchase them, right now. On the other hand, once you've read these fantastic books don't bother purchasing _Back in the USSA_. The idea behind _Back in the USSA_ is that the Germans ship socialist Eugene Debs back into the United States (in a sealed boxcar, thus paralelling how they shipped V.I. Lenin back to Russia during WW I) during World War I to foment a revolution and take the United States out of the war. The book is a loose collection of stories based upon what life in the United Socialist States of America was like in the 20th century and pokes fun at such figures as Ed Gein, L. Ron Hubbard, John Wayne, Rupert Murdoch and Hunter S. Thompson by examining how their lives would have turned out in such a country. Unfortunately, as promising as this book sounds it never manages to pull it off, a work of alternate history should be plausible and the idea that the US would have had a socialist revolution under Eugene Debs and a reign of terror under Al Capone (the Joe Stalin analog in this book) just isn't. While a novel about an alternate socialist America might be interesting attempting to write one by paralleling the history of Russia and the Soviet Union just doesn't work."},{"Title":"Back in the USSA","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. From a historical perspective, other than the fact that the Socialist/Communist revolution takes place in the USA instead of Russia, it is an exact recap of our 20th century timeline. In addition, the authors have an annoying habit of throwing famous real (Colonel Van Damme) and fictional names (the Blues Brothers and President JR Ewing) into the stories for no apparent reason. On the positive side, the book does start out promising. The first three stories are rather interesting, but for the rest of the book, the authors seem to have run out of ideas and simply filled pages to complete the novel. In short, don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"We have several great books of Laura Numeroff's in our library, yet I must say this is THE favorite of our 3 yr old boy, our 8 yr old girl and myself!

The illustrations are darling too. A true gem of a book for all!!"},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"This is a cute story that my daughter enjoys reading. The illustrations are very nice. For adults, it may seem odd that the the characters are intolerant of the wolf's past (he is now old and harmless) and run him out of town, but this will be lost on kids. It is a humorous story, our 2 year old understands some of the humor, while other parts are geared toward the adult funny bone."},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"After reading the quirky synopsis of this book I bought it for my daughter and have been reading it to her since her birth 11 months ago.

This is a book you won't mind reading again and again and again..."},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"all i can say is this is a lovely whimsical precious book with superb drawings. the author and artist are visionaries."},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"I'll admit that I bought this book on a lark with no idea what was inside--I have two daughters whom I call \\"chickens,\\" so I thought it would be cute to have a book called \\"The Chicken Sisters,\\" but this book has become a literary staple and mainstay in our house. The three chicken sisters live together and love each other despite their shortcomings. One of them bakes horribly, but doesn't know it, and her two chicken siblings, out of sisterly love and respect, eat her burned creations, enthusiastically say \\"yum,\\" and hence, the baking sister feels needed, loved, and encouraged. The other sisters also have similar talents that are not appreciated by their neighbors, but are lifted up daily by their sisters. They annoy their neighbors who are quick to judge and ridicule (these are the types that would go to a development's advisory board to complain about someone's lawn mower not being adjusted for the board mandated setting of 1 1/2\\"), but when the sisters in their natural benevolence, loving nature, and naivete frighten a wolf away who previously had frightened the neighbors, the sisters are then appreciated for their kindness and no longer ridiculed for their imperfections. OK, so I've basically explained the plot, but if you are reading this, the book is not for you, right? It's for your children, and isn't it a lovely lesson for them to embrace? My 4-year-old loves it, and more importantly, she GETS it! This is a book that reinforces a very important lesson that I try to teach my children each day. I can't say enough good things about it!"},{"Title":"The Chicken Sisters","review":"My youngest daughter loved the story. I gave it to her for her 5th birthday.

In this superb monograph/catalogue that accompanied an exhibition by the same name, Kuspit makes the case for the resurgence of meaningful art, art that is based on observation, conceptualization and execution by artists thoroughly trained.Descrying the current movements in art that deal with installation, graffiti, video, etc. Kuspit exclaims \\"Making art has become a case of putting on the emperor's new clothing and getting away with it - calling raw life interesting art and convincing people that it is.\\" For Kuspit art has become a 'decadent farce', that the art scene now is like a cult rather than an ongoing platform for artists to open the aesthetic pathways for viewers' eyes and souls.The book features the art of such fine representational artists as F. Scott Hess, Marc Trujillo, Ron Rizk, Dan McCleary, James Doolin, Enjeong Noh, Guy Diehl, Masami Teraoka among others. The reproductions are good and the placement of dialogue with art is thoughtful.But by far the most interesting aspect of this very readable book is the philosophy of Donald Kuspit. It is reassuring that a man of his dignity in the field of arts writing is here to champion representational art of lasting effect and elegant workmanship.

Most people are not taught by family, friends, or school how to find an apartment, buy a car, meet friends in a new place, get a 401K and insurance, etc., but these are the most important things EVERYONE has to know BEFORE they graduate from college or even high school, in some cases. This wonderful book taught me everything I needed to know and even gave me sample apartment leases and resumes to learn from.The most useful part of this book for me was the chapter on how to find and live with a roommate. I just moved into an apartment with someone I don't know too well yet, and we are getting along great, all because of &quot;Graduate.&quot; Ms. Gustafson provides a roommate questionnaire with great questions to ask, so you know beforehand if you will get along with your potential roommate.

De Toledano examines the early start of Kennedy's career and how it inversely affected the political star that was Kennedy. Sure the man was part of a political dynasty that was the Kennedy Family, but Robert in his own right was a force to be acknowledged. The most eliciting part of the account by De Toledano was the information regarding Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa. For those unaware of the connection Hoffa and Kennedy shared, the two were public enemies of each other. After Kennedy became the chief counsel of the 1957-59 Senate Labor Rackets Committee, he clashed with Hoffa in the argument that glorified the Hoffa testimony. These constant clashes with Hoffa burned the future star that became Kennedy. But he didn't exactly claim total praise from the Hoffa situation, but was attacked for using this as a personal vendetta to further grow his own political career. At the end of the day, De Toledano's style of writing does not suit the facts and reading this book became very tedious even as a professor of history. I suggest for the average American wanting to learn more about the figure of RFK to read his Wikipedia article and save themselves the time I lost.If you would like discuss more about this book contact me atDr. Daniel Phillip Traugott, Ph.Ddanielptraugott@JHU.mail.edu"},{"Title":"Environmental Contamination in Antarctica","review":"I haven't read the whole thing yet, but in summary, the articles in this book describe the difficulties of creating extremely accurate results due to the sensitivity of the mediums in Antarctica.

WOW! One of my favorite books is the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People because it empowers me and now we girls have something that gives us the facts. It also gives great ideas for deciding what you want - do you want to go out for a one night affair - then there are ways to dress to attract the one nighters. Or, are you after a quality relationship with a quality person? If so, you better present yourself as a quality 'catch' and evaluate those you meet - we only live once so we need to choose wisely.

I am already viewing men and relationships in a different light."},{"Title":"Attracting the Man Over 30","review":"I have bought a lot of books on dating and relationships. Most are written to be funny and entertaining with little real advice based on a factual survey. This book is different. It offers suggestions on how to improve things about yourself.

It tells you how, why and what men think and it's not what you see in the news or on TV everyday. Also, I enjoyed learning about the history of men and women and how the 'caveman' days influence us in ways we don't even know. I am picky about recommending books but I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Attracting the Man Over 30","review":"The book, \\"Attracting the Man over 30\\" is definitely a unique way of reintroducing the historical nature of the beast so to speak. The beast being the male and I do not say that in any way shape or form negatively. The book also reminds us of why women are driven to be women. This book shares with its readers the results of a survey involving 2,500 men over 30 years old. Also an added feature to Teresa Barton and Mark Alexander's book is when they asked 60 women to test out their survey findings in order to confirm that their data was valid and achieved an amazing 73% success rate.Teresa Barton and Mark Alexander have worked in the information technology field for 25 years and have been happily married for 10 years at this point. Together they worked to bring their readers a very well put together survey in hopes to give more women a better chance in determining their future relationships.The beginning of the book is very interesting and curious as it reminds the reader of the beginning of man, and how he has evolved to this date. I will admit that I was very curious as to exactly where this subject was going to take me. As I moved along in the book, it all seemed to make incredible sense. The importance of understanding the habits of the first men and women so that we can understand the why's of certain questions today.Attracting the Man over 30 shares and awakens so many real facts in regards to the do's and don'ts in regards to exactly what type of person does one want to invest any amount of their life time in. Teresa Barton and Mark Alexander spent a huge amount of time and energy in being exact with their survey results. The audience that they are trying to reach through their book is women and men over 30 that are single and unattached. Although I am neither of the latter two, I still found the information from the survey very good hind site material. The material in this book is straight forward and very well written. You will read no slander or negative remarks in regards to either males or females. It is simply true grit facts, facts that will explain to its readers the black and white of the human being and how important these facts are in the dating game of ones life. If you just read the cover and expect just what it says, you will be in for quite a surprise! The Book, \\"Attracting The Man Over 30\\", is full of great information for women seeking the right man and also for the woman that wants to keep the man that she has. It tells what men want and also what they look for and need in a relationship. If you want some insight as to what it takes to make a man happy, this will be a wonderful book for you."},{"Title":"Attracting the Man Over 30","review":"Hi, a friend of mine recommended this book for me. It's a quick and easy read with so many great suggestions. It talks about evaluating yourself to see what you can improve and evaluating what you're really after in a man.

The only thing better than reading a book you love, is having the book read to you by someone you love.We adore books, not only for the thoughts they contain, but for the thoughts we compose when we immerse our minds in them. Finding a book to amuse is sometimes not enough. Delving into the minds of the greatest authors of our time and then reviewing their works, can be a very satisfying journey...and I have only just begun.How does one tame the desire to prowl in libraries and online stores for that perfect book. How do you stop the quickening of your heart as you feel your feet following your desire, straight into the book ambush.That trap of books that so entices, it makes you dizzy with the perfume of the soul and the voices of authors calling to you from the shelves. Surrounded by living books, you only wonder how many you can carry out of the store and not feel the least bit guilty for the pleasure. The only question is will you find the book or will the book find you and jump from the shelves into your hands?The sensual experience of owning books and actually reading them takes you above the level of a bibliophile. When you reach the point in your life where you need a good read to survive in life, you enter a world somewhere between the existence of a bibliophile and hell. When you start to believe in books that write themselves and find you so you can breathe, then you are in serious danger of book addiction.In the pages of Speaking of Books, you will meet your reading soul mates and lose or find yourself in their minds.

As such, the book deepens the pleasure of your reading to another level by suggesting benefits that you may not yet have considered. On the other hand, I found that the book could have benefited from more editing. Many ideas are expressed in very similar ways, and many authors are repeated a bit too much for my taste. At the same time, the book's information on compulsive book collecting seemed a bit off the mark for my own interests.Review: The book opens with an essay on how electronic books can never substitute for the look, feel, and experience of handling a physical book. On the other hand, the authors fail to give electronic books credit for the things that only they can allow readers to do such as make very extensive easy references, allow the insertion of detailed notes and cross-references, and permit shared thoughts with many other readers in more detailed ways as you mark up a common electronic text. That essay seemed a little too conservative.The book is divided into reading, book, and book collecting subjects. Each one begins with a few paragraphs of commentary with an illustrative quote or two. Then the bulk of the section is comprised of aphorisms and sections involving a few sentences or paragraphs on the subject. In general, I found that the aphorisms worked better than the longer quotes.The book's sections are imaginatively named. I think a good example is using science fiction to help imagine what must be done in order to create a better future for all.May your thoughtful reflections on your reading build beyond the author's sound foundation!"},{"Title":"Speaking of Books: The Best Things Ever Said About Books and Book Collecting","review":"Finally a book full of hundreds of quotes for book lovers everywhere.

The collection is much bigger than that - in conception and execution.Having culled the opinions of well- and lesser-known writers, humorists, thinkers, and fictional characters, the editors have managed to put together a lively tour of bibliophilia and its satellites (education, censorship, and more). Chapters such as &quot;What to Read,&quot; &quot;What Books Do - and Don't Do - For Us,&quot; &quot;How to Read,&quot; &quot;Books and The Young,&quot; contain quotes that are by turns thoughtful, funny, sensible - and sometimes wonderfully silly. So there is James Thurber (presumably answering the query, &quot;How do you read?&quot;) offering, &quot;I always begin at the left with the opening word of a sentence and read towards the right, and I recommend this method.&quot;To readers who imagine that books will necessarily change their lives, George Bernard Shaw offers the tart and deflating remark that &quot;People get nothing out of books but what they bring to them.&quot;The editors give the issue of freedom of the press plenty of room, and Terence Qualter's remark that &quot;The weapon of the dictator is not so much propaganda as censorship,&quot; from his 1962 book &quot;Propaganda and Psychological Warfare&quot; is cited. Jimmy Walker, past Mayor of New York, weighs in with &quot;No girl was ever ruined by a book.&quot;Critics everywhere can laugh at the words of Sydney Smith of &quot;The Smith of Smiths&quot; (1934) by Heskith Pearson, who asserted &quot;I never read a book before reviewing it; it prejudices a man so.&quot; And cat lovers everywhere will be offended by Mark Twain, who wrote,&quot; I like a thin book because it will steady a table, a leather volume because it will strop a razor, and a heavy book because it can be thrown at a cat.&quot;There's an index of people quoted, but not a subject index (which would have been nice).

From the well known such as Edgar Allen Poe and Ralph Waldo Emerson to the obscure, people have been writing and talking about books since the book was first published.\\"The trouble with this book is that its covers are too close together.\\" - Christopher Lehmann-Haupt>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Speaking of Books: The Best Things Ever Said About Books and Book Collecting","review":"A great effort by the editors of another great book \\"A Passion for Books\\".As a lover of books and reading I am attracted to books on books.It takes a pair like Rabinowitz and Kaplan to do a real good job of producing such good results.Books on books and books of quotes seem to be topics that edited book producers and publishers seem to believe are a snap to produce.I haven't checked ,but I would suspect R&K could but wouldn't crank out a book on some other subject ie.Birdwtching even if prompted by a publisher.I think this is why these two books are so good.I find editors that pump out books on a variety of subjects produce mediocre results and fall in the same realm as those referred to by Francis M Cornford on page 209 \\"University printing presses exist,and are subsidized by the Government for the purpose of producing books which no one can read;and they are true to their high calling\\".These kind of books can often be identified as having received some sort of grant by a government or other body that believes that they,rather than the buyer, should decide what is worth publishing."},{"Title":"Will the Real King Arthur Please Stand Up?","review":"The Arthurian cycle has inspired and engendered any number of books this century, both fiction and non-fiction. However, very few of them have taken such an original approach to the subject of the \\"real\\" Arthur, nor have many of them been quite so completely overlooked at the same time. In all my reading on the subject over thirty years, I have never once heard or seen this book mentioned anywhere. Yet it is a very good addition to this mighty body of literature, whether it be, as some are no doubt inclined to think, completely fictitious or not. It certainly deserves to come out of its present obscurity.It seems as though Millar stumbled on his theory pretty much by accident. He was living in Brittany for the purpose of writing a book about the Breton tunnymen (or tuna fishermen), when it occurred to him that some of the local place names could be mistaken for those, long argued about, relating to the legendary battles of King Arthur. Indeed, one of the book's strengths is that, basing his enquiry on information coming down from a ninth century monk named Nennius, he has been able to completely override the arguments which have sought to place the battle sites in various parts of England, Scotland and Wales. It has been the great weakness all along, that nobody has succeeded in naming all the sites and when they have identified one of them, someone else has insisted that it is some hundreds of miles distant, instead. Everyone wants Arthur for his own. And so it goes on. So Millar decided to investigate and, if he could, to try and place all nine sites into the Breton landscape. The story of his bus ride around the province doing just that, makes terrific reading. Of course, taking Arthur right out of Britain is hardly politically correct, but.... Whether you agree with him or not, this is great detective work and, if you have been interested in Arthur for any length of time, it will certainly leave you wondering."},{"Title":"Will the Real King Arthur Please Stand Up?","review":"A very interesting book making plausible and reasonable suggestions as to the locations and reasons for what little is really known about the Arthurian legends. Mr Miller suggests in a light and amusing way that there is a lot more evidence that Arthur fought his battles in what is now called Brittany than in Great Britain. He discusses his sources of information and ultimately leaves it to the reader to judge what, if anything, is the truth. It is sufficiently beguiling that I've reread it three times and taken a holiday in Brittany just to check out what he says, and am now researching the early monks who are his main sources of information. Whether he's right or just being a stand-in, I'd vote for the Breton Arzur to be the one to Stand Up."},{"Title":"Fun with Mythical Creatures Stencils (Dover Little Activity Books)","review":"There are six different stencils in this little book, printed on sturdy cardstock. They're perforated for easy removal, pre-cut, and neatly labeled. The designs are simple without being simplistic, and a perfect size for many projects. I've used them to make posters, to add color to bookcases, and just to draw on windows and mirrors with dry-erase markers. The creatures included are a mermaid, a minotaur, a unicorn, a griffin, a dragon, and a centaur."},{"Title":"Adolf Eichmann: Engineer of Death (Holocaust Biographies)","review":"Although this book is written for the adolescent student, do not let its brevity fool you. Ms. Sachs went to the heart of the matter of the life of Adolf Eichmann, his association with the Nazi Party, and the stamp he placed on history in connection with the unnecessary slaughter of European Jews in the 1930s-1940s. The weight of this book leans towards Eichmann's simple nature, yet shows how ironically this simple man played an important role in a complex scheme of death. My highest commendations for this work in these days of plurality and remembrance."},{"Title":"Adolf Eichmann: Engineer of Death (Holocaust Biographies)","review":"It would, perhaps, be unfair to say there is no value in the book for those who are interested in Eichmann. However, Sachs' book in a very inferior source, in part because it is poorly researched, and sometimes the author seems to have a poor grasp of the meaning of her research materials.The author's comments in the editorial section above, which completely mischaracterize the arguments made by Hannah Arendt in her book on the Eichmann trial and which also suggest that Sachs holds the ridiculous belief that Arendt had something to do with crafting the arguments used by the Defendants in the Nuremberg trials, should give any potential reader pause."},{"Title":"The Temptations of Evolutionary Ethics","review":"I must say first, this is my favorite book of all time. I have met the author, and he is wonderful. So I am totally biased.In a nutshell, this book is a call for any modern philosopher to first read what historians have to say about evolutionary ethics before they run off and write something as if they have discovered it. It is as well researched a critique of modern philosophy of evolution as you will find and should be in the backpack of any young Doctoral student (especially historians of science).It is a wonderful reminder of what true \\"evidence\\" looks like and how easy it is to see \\"could be's\\" and create links that may or may not be there.Most of you, like me, will have to read it for school. I found it wonderful and I hope you do as well!Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Temptations of Evolutionary Ethics","review":"This is a historian's view of ethical thought since the time of Darwin. It recapitulates the undramatic evolution of ethical thought, primarily utilitarianism, in the light of evolution theory. It contains not an iota of original ethical thought, and the thought most akin to evolutionary theory, altruism and reciprocal altruism, is barely acknowledged. What is seriously missing: Hume, Smith, and Hutchinson (Francis, not Woods) and their very similar theories of moral sentiments, despite their point-on-point relevance to altruism and reciprocal altruism.I'll be the first to acknowledge that evolutionary theory presents new ways of looking at moral problems. Moreover, I'll concede that Social Darwinist misused evolutionary theory to advance their fascist regimes in times past -- and maybe we're still vulnerable. But moral philosophers have not been hibernating; they've been looking for an appropriate paradigm to fit the Modern Synthesis. Where are their accounts? Nowhere in this book!Some older moral philosophers, e.g., Spencer, Huxley, Sidgwick, and Green, have unsuccessfully tried to incorporate old ethics in the new bag of wine. Robert Wright in \\"The Moral Animal\\" faced a similar dilemma (the two books were released at the same time), and Wright was found wanting. But at least Wright tried to envision a new paradigm. Farber concludes that maybe evolutionary theory isn't so great after all, because it leaves us morally bereft. What?Maybe I am too much of an optimist not to believe that new problems can be solved. It just takes a little intuition and a more expansive notion of history. And I know many people are scared by the shadow of eugenics and other Darwinian misappropriations, but fatalism is not the answer. Had Farber only gone a little farther back in history, just a century, he could have found a nice fit between moral theorists and evolutionary theorists. On the most important parallel in human history, Farber is asleep. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to... Raising More Money With Newsletters Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"This book will save you money and time. It's a quick, fun read, and there are great tips on every page. Moreover, it is research-based, with practical ways of implementing all the ideas. No BS, no wild hairs, just sound, practical advice. It will be \\"immediately usable,\\" to steal the perfect caption of another reviewer.This book turned up while I was mulling over creating two different newsletters for two different organizations. My earlier involvements with newsletters were a bit frustrating. Tons and tons of work went into them, but their impact was disappointing, despite some really good content.Reading this book, I finally understand why my earlier attempts were, well, stinkers. I was using bad models and repeating bad habits so commonl in this industry. Now, I feel that I have the tools to make much more effective marketing pieces. One of my upcoming newsletters is actually going to be a rescue job of a lackluster publication, and this book has helped me to see exactly how to fix it--and to make putting it together a much easier task.And to steal another idea from an earlier reviewer, I too am going to give this to some people I know, who really need this excellent advice.The proof is in the pudding, here. Ahern follows his own advice, and his book is totally engaging, convincing, and if he was a non-profit organization rather than an author, I'd send him a check. \\"Save the Newsletters!\\" How much is a membership?Really, get it. It will help all of your writing, not just newsletters. I hope the author writes more, on similar topics, maybe a general book on writing marketing copy.

This was my first ever Manga I've have ever bought and I knew that I had to get it since Tenchi and Ryoko and Mihoshi were on the cover! Since I didn't read the volume numbers and this was the only one left I bought it and instantly fell in love with the manga seeing Ryoko again after Toonami ended Tenchi a long long time ago back in '01 I believe and I bought this at '05 so when I bought this I was wondering what was going on and with seeing two \\"Ryoko\\"s I was like \\"Whoa!\\" (SPOILER: The other Ryoko is Minagi, who is Ryoko's clone/sister!) Then I realized that I need to get the 1st one to understand the storyline of the manga so please buy the first volume FIRST! So since I was caught up to date with the manga storyline (Which is an alternate continuation of Tenchi Muyo AKA OVA 1 & 2 btw) I kept buying and buying the Tenchi mangas until Viz stopped releasing them. To this day I am still missing Vol. 5, 8 and 9 and unfortunately an Orange Ninja had to take all the fame and readers and left Viz to discontinue the No Need For Tenchi Manga, now your only way to buy them is online and none of the local bookstores like Boarder's (Naruters I should say...) and B&N don't have them in stock. So if you're a Tenchi fan you should use Amazon to buy your Tenchi manga since all the other places have them at a steep price and if you want your wallet to stay fat you should buy these at Amazon!

Before she wound up on the streets, she was in and out of hospitals, receiving so much electro-shock therapy that she believes her nervous system has been re-wired and now tunes into the bio-rhythms of people around her.Trudy takes us, along with her two alien companions, on a discovery trip to find out what it means to be human and imparting her own impressions on life. She tunes in a wide array of people, ranging from Agnus Angst, a 15-year-old punk performance artist; Agnus' grandparents Lud and Marie; Chrissy, a recently unemployed workout enthusiast; Lily, an actress currently performing a one-woman show; and many others, both men and women, gay and straight.This play is full of marvelous insight into the human condition and life in the 1980's. This is very apparent in the incredible second act, in which we follow Lyn from the consciousness-raising times of the 1970's through her rise and fall in the business ranks of the 1980's and her turbulent family life. Also, all the characters, in one form or another, have some influence on the life of the other characters in the play, whether or not they actually meet: Lyn has an affair with Agnus's mother; Kate, a rich trendsetter, finds a suicide note left by Chrissy lying in the street; Trudy takes the aliens to see Lily's play in order to show them goosebumps.The book also includes still images, from the stage production, of Lily Tomlin, many of which were shot by Annie Leibowitz. Jane Wagner also created some montages of Lily as the many characters in the play.Full of wit, insight and tenderness, this play stands as a perfect glimpse into understanding society."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"I've been wanting to read this hilarious, thought-provoking & well-written book again for years...glad to have it in my library."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"Come on... Jane Wagner, and can just imagine Lilly doing the characters... it's great. The writing is clever, still very timely, moving, funny... Just wish I could have seen Tomlin perform it!"},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"This is the most intellectual, most poignant, most insightful slice of life I've ever seen and read. Lily Tomlin was superb on Broadway as she portrayed these characters, woven together in such a illustrious way to show the many connections that aren't always so obvious as we are in the midst of living life. Jane Wagner's words are genius. The BEST ever!!! What a terrific team. Always gives me GOOSEBUMPS!"},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"The word \\"Tour de Force\\" may not have been invented with Lily Tomlin specifically in mind, but she is one of the best people for whom this epithet should be used. I've seen her do this show live, twice, when it first came to Philadelphia, and enjoy repeating the experience via the video, and the book. She's an amazing performer, and this is an amazing piece of theater."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"As she tries to explain human beings to extraterrestrials who are searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe, Trudy, the bag lady, channels among others: Agnus Angst, a throwaway teenage punk; Chrissy, an unemployed young woman who doesn't know what to do with herself; Kate -- a rich socialite bored with everything. It's a tough job, but Trudy is up to it -- she refuses to be intimidated by reality.Wagner weaves together the stories of these separate lives with speculations about time, space, reality, art, and human nature. From Trudy's skewed perspective a vision forms of the interconnectedness of human life -- maybe of all intelligent life in the universe. Filled with laugh-out-loud one-liners and characters whose words and feelings ring true, this one-woman play is masterful writing from a deep and generous heart. If you didn't see Lily Tomlin's performance on Broadway, don't miss reading the book. It's more than a story; it's an experience."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"This one woman plays many characters, and will take you on a journey of laughter, and much more, and leave you smiling for long after you put it down..."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"This play is just what my title says....very entertaining and if you are in the theatre world, guys, but especially girls, should look into a purchase of this play for potential monologues for auditions."},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","review":"I'm in an arts/high school program, PCCA.

This is one funny script.I wasn't nervous when i performed it at all. I just kept thinking how funny the script was, and that, not matter how terrible the acting, the audience would still enjoy the performing."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"I'm a big fan of biographies, and this remains (some 10 years after reading it) one of my favorites. There is no dearth of books on Hitler, of course. Fest's accomplishment here is that each section on Hitler is straddled by a section describing other events in the world and Germany, always giving the reader a larger context in which Hitler's activities can be placed.I'm a little dismayed by [people] who suggest that Hitler was merely a sufferer of post-traumatic-stress syndrome after his experience in the trenches of WWI, and that Fest does a disservice (to Hitler?) by leaving this information out. But many people have suffered in the trenches in many wars without later moving on to attempt world domination and genocide.In any case, Fest's biography omits nothing. It is written in a clear, beautiful language, and will leave you with an entirely new understanding of Hitler, Germans and Germany."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"As a devoted reader of history, especially of the early 20th century period, I probably have gone through every popular and even arcane book on Hitler and National Socialism. I've read Albert Speer's &quot;Inside the Third Reich,&quot; Shirer's &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reach,&quot; Alan Bullock's &quot;Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives,&quot; . . . yet, these books, while informative, lack the depth of understanding of the horrible phenomenon of Hitler that Joachim Fest brings to his biography. Maybe because Fest himself is German and is therefore closer to his subject. Yes, the style is dry, and the book is indeed rather biased at times--the preface is titled incredibly &quot;Hitler and Historical Greatness!&quot; Yet, within that preface, you will find insights and observations that are lacking in all other biographies on the Fuehrer. I myself was riveted from page one all the way to the end. So, if you want to really understand Hitler, read this book. If you want to read a lighter biography, read the sections on Hitler in Bullock's &quot;Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"The life story of Adolf Hitler is so compelling that it is hard to imagine a book about it ever being boring. Fest's account is thoroughly researched and and meticulously detailed and was a best sellerin West Germany before being published in the U.S. Though not as readabled as Robert Payne's superior &quot;The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler,&quot; it still paints a fairly complete portrait of the man. If the book has any drawback, it is that it does not spend enough time on Hitler's pre-World War I activities. Payne much more thoroughly documents the humiliation and disappointment in Vienna that searled Hitler's soul and helped turn him into a monster. Nevertheless, Fest's &quot;Hitler&quot; remains one of the defining biographies of the 20th century's most evil figure."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Historian John Lukacs, who has just come out with &quot;The Hitler of History&quot;, an analysis of Hitler's hundred or so important biographers, says Fest's bio is the &quot;best long biography&quot; of Adolph Hitler. Fest fleshes out the young Hitler in fascinating detail. Especially interesting is Fest's account of Hitler's political rise in Weimar Germany from being a member of a minute political party which held its meetings in the back of a beer hall to a dynamic leader of a strong poltical party by the end of the 1920s. Fest is very interpretive and analytical. Typical is his suggestion that Hitler was an artist mutated into a politician. For an American like myself, Fest is weak in explaining how the Nazi's, who never achieved more than fifty percent of an honest vote, was able to dominate the apparatus of government so thoroughly and so fast upon joining a governing coalition in 1933. It has never happened in America even if America has had pols with tyranical personality traits- Wilson, Johnson, Nixon, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and, to a small degree, FDR. If the amateur historian has time for only one biography of Adolph Hitler, this is the one to get."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"This is a dense, thorough, anbd illuminating biography of a frightening and fascinating figure historian John Lukacs calls &quot;the man of the century.&quot; I would be lying if I didn't say it's slow going; it's not a book for the faint of heart as Fest spends much of his time trying to explain the phenomenon of Hitler to a German audience. Was he an aberration? Was he an inevitable outcome of German culture? Those are the questions Fest tries to answer. Nevertheless, the book is full of original insights in Hitler's character that will linger long after the book is finished."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"I'm certainly not an expert on WW2, and I know that there are other books out there (such as Ian Kershaw's) on Hitler that are very good. But several avid readers and history buffs told me that Fest's book was the best, so I read his first. It's true that he does not devote a lot of content to the Holocaust, but he is very graphic and adamant about what happened with that. He is harldy an apologist for Hitler, as one reviewer seems to say. In any case, the fact that he is German and lived through WW2, plus a terrific writer cinched it for me. It's a little dense at times, but if you stay the course, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Joachim Fest's book \\"Hitler\\" is a rare pleasure to read. His words create an atmosphere and a world that we can understand. Fest manages to step into the shoes of Hitler -- we sit and day-dream with that man and build castles in the air. More than that, he manages to bare Hitler's mind and soul to the reader. We learn how and why Hitler acted as he did. His actions that are so vile that we absolutely condemn them, suddenly become clearer. We begin to understand and are warned of the power that one single man can usurp, even though he is penniles, without education and friends. Fest does in no way justify Hitler or his tyranny. On the contrary, he does open our eyes so that we see how actions of such brutality are possible. He makes us understand that they can happen again, but also how they can be avoided. It is an in-depth study of a strongman--strongmen by the way come in all sizes; we encounter them in our daily lives. Since Hitler's demise, half a dozen countries have suffered strongmen as heads of state, and it is vital that we understand and recognize a tyrant before it is too late. None better to learn from than Fest's Hitler, one of the shrewdest and most ruthless strongman of them all.Roswitha McIntosh, author of \\"The Madman & His Mistress\\""},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Most books written about Hitler concentrate on the Holocaust or World War Two and rightfully so. These are the two most prominent events for which Hitler is known. Fest takes a different perspective on Hitler by writing on his life before he unleashed terror on the world.Fest is NOT a Hitler apologist though. He clearly states that in his prologue. His thesis does highlight the patriotic Hitler who was successful in bringing back the pride to Germany. Unfortunately he had to throw it away with the war.It may be counter-factual history, but Fest makes the reader think: What if Hitler had stopped in 1938?"},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"I read this book for a graduate-level course on the history of Nazi Germany. Fest provides great insight into Hitler's development and personality, in his dry, somber German way. As a reference, it is undeniably one of the best out there on the subject. As a textbook, it requires coffee to finish reading. However, any student is perfectly capable of finishing and garnering great knowledge from this book."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Published in 1973 in German and in English in 1974, this book is consistently rich in its interpretation of the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler. I have not read other biographies on Hitler so cannot offer comparisons."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Joachim C. Fest's &quot;Hitler&quot; is a superb account of the strange man that was to become the Chancellor of the Third Reich. There is a slight problem, but an affliction that is fairly commom, there is no excitement found within these pages. The story is told with no attempt at livliness, just stale, dry, but ultimately rewarding if you have the endurance to conquer this 861 page hardback. This book gives you much information, but because of the dry writing style, you do not absorb anywhere near the wealth of information in other, better-written books of this same period. However, don't think this book is a waste, is is not, far from it. It is a rewarding piece of literature, one that will greatly increase your knowledge of Adolf Hitler. However, you should only start this book if you are serious about finishing it. Otherwise you will not get past page 100. Dedication is what it takes, but lurking within the book is a wealth of information, should you wish to uncover it."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"While I am as impressed as anyone with Fest's outstanding literary achievement I do think one aspect of Hitler's life has been underemphasised not just by Fest but also by virtually all other biographers; ie the effect on his personality and outlook of four years in the trenches in WW I. In the post Vietnam era popular culture is familiar with the Rambo syndrome -'what you call hell he calls home'. As he readjusts to civilian life the Vietnam Vet gets flashbacks of things that happened during the conflict and these color his life from then on. Hitler was four years sleeping in dugouts under the ground, sharing miserable conditions, accustomed to a weekly tally of dead and wounded among comrades, risking life and limb daily. I think that four years is a long time and certainly long enough to permanently alter someone's life outlook from being sunny and optimistic to being dark and sinister.Fest's chronology more or less treats this period as another period in Hitler's life and I think he would have done better to dwell a little longer thereupon."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"Fest's brilliant survey of Hitler's rise to absolute power and defeat allows the non-European a certain, if not, unparalled account of Germany on the brink of renewed nationalism through Hitler Vis-a-vis an entirely German journalistic styling and understanding. Fest's quality and quantity of the pre and post Hitler exrerience is an Historians dream, and perhaps an lay person's nightmare. The pages seem to lay heavy on the reader with the seriousness of the situation. Afterall, humor is pointless and Fest replaces this with a staunch and stagnant dryness that only a Hitler student could comprehend or tolerate. All in all, Fest is perhaps the first and best German researcher on Hitler and thus, \\"Hitler\\" should be regarded as a staple in any curious or serious investigators diary.

I re-read it last week and can only say that I am embarrassed for Fest as well as for my own indiscriminate youth.

It is the work of a journalist, not a historian."},{"Title":"Hitler","review":"This review is written by Mr. Richard Lee Knowles from St. Louis, MO, USA, who wanted to share his review of this book.There is no doubt that \\"Hitler\\", by Mr. Joachim C. Fest, is the strongest pillar of facts, about the man, and is a monument of literary excellence. \\"Hitler\\" is a testament to one soldier's anvil will to not yield at any cost. Thanks to Mr. Fest the truth of history will be saved for the future. Mr. Fest (an ex-German soldier} makes clear that Hitler honored and memorialized the German soldier. Even though Mr. Fest lacks more information on Hitler in WWI, and of why he was awarded the \\"Iron Cross First Class\\", it is still the best book. You can find out why Hitler was awarded the \\"Iron Cross First Class\\" in the book, \\"The Arms of Krupp\\", by Mr. William Manchester on page 322. I have read \\"A Study in Tyranny\\" by Alan Bullock, and \\"On Borrowed Time\\" {How World War II Began) by Mr. Leonard Mosley, and a book of great and rare pictures of Hitler which is \\"Sieg Heil\\" (an illustrated history of Germany from Bismarck to Hitler) by Mr. Stefan Lorant. I have read many other books pertaining to Hitler, but to me this one is by far the best.I read all about WWII, for my father, Mr. Elwood Knowles, Jr, was awarded \\"The Presidential Unit Citation\\" while serving on the destroyer \\"Nicholas\\" in the battle of Kula Gulf\\", near Kolombangara Island in the Solomon group against Japanese forces on July 5-6, 1943.

To write a review of a serious scholarly study should demand that the entire work should have been read & re-read.... remember, \\"there are no readers, only re-readers.\\" That another reviewer admits to not having read this book, even one time, should serve as a notice to anyone interested in The Tale of Genji & scholarly studies to completely ignore its limited ability to actually engage or respond to an unread work. One might also beware reviews of serous studies by those who can not manage to spell or proofread.Doris Bargen has written, by all accounts, a pivotal study that explores a neglected area in Genji studies (outside of Japan). That Royall Tyler (among others) has praised this study for its exploration of \\"Spirit\\" and its relationship to social order should serve as enough of an endorsement to students, scholars & lay-readers to study, enjoy and be enriched by a scholar in love with her material."},{"Title":"Bargen: A Woman's Weapon Paper","review":"After painfully getting through a good portion of this book, I came to the conclusion that there are two main points (concerning the Genji Monogatari anyway) that Bargen is attempting to make. First, she claims that Lady Rokujo's sprit possession of Aoi did not occur because Lady Rokujo was simply envious of Aoi and wanted to spite her. Instead, she states that the angry sprit of Lady Rokujo was using Aoi simply as a vehicle to attack Lady Rokujo's real tormentor, Genji. Second, she states that, as displayed by the Aoi episode in the tale, women used sprit possession as a way to vent bottled up social frustrations which are generated by the polygamist system. In my opinion, there are three main problems with this argument. First, it seems as if her arguments contradict each other. The first argument implies that Lady Rokujo's sprit is actually posing Aoi whereas the second argument implies that it is really Aoi who is putting on a show in order to vent her frustrations. Second, the scientific hypothesis known as Occums Razor states that usually the simplest answer to a problem is the correct one. By this logic, would not it be simpler to say that Lady Rokujo is simply envious of Aoi and thus attacked her that it would be to say that Lady Rokujo used Aoi as a vehicle to attack Genji in a round about way? Why not just possess Genji himself? Finally, Bargen seems to base many of the social problems of the era on the polygamous social structure as if engaged in a geopolitical attack on polygamony. There are two innate with an attack conducted in this fashion. First, we are discussing a literary text and not a historical reference. Thus any thoughts on how to change a fictional system are irrelevant for all one has to do is ignore the book entirely if ti bothers them so. Second, one simply cannot change the past. In conclusion, although many scholars have reacted favorabily to this book, I see many of the arguements that Bargen attempts to make to be self contradictory, and thus (for the most part) the book seems to discredit itself. For a more desirable review of sprit possession in the Genji Monogatari, I strongly recommend a book entitled &quot;The Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of the Tale of Genji&quot; written by Shirane, H."},{"Title":"Secret Revelation","review":"Being an avid reader of Dan Brown's books I hesitantly veered off course looking for some similar suspence.

As a big fan of thrillers, there was a lot for this book to live up to. I'd followed the development of the book on the web site (secretrevelation.com) which looked pretty impressive as a book website.To the book.It has one of the strongest and most gripping openings to any thriller I've read, really gets you asking \\"What is this secret this guy holds\\". The book then moves at lightening pace as characters are added and the action builds. (My one critisism is that it is sometimes a little hard to know which side the characters are on at first, but it soon becomes clear.)Then the plot slowly unfolds amidst a mindwarping array of experiments and action. The book shifts gear (hard to imagine it can) and the action explodes, sometimes losing the full strength of the characters for the sake of the action. I don't mind this, but some may say it loses something.Slowly the secret unfolds and the lead character gets back his memory. But the book is far from finished. With a couple of very cleverly written chapters (I had to go back and re-read them to see just how the author did it!) the book takes a completely new direction and all becomes clear (or does it?).The ending left me quite breathless, and as all good books should, satified that it had a great conclusion.In visiting the web site, the author lays out that the book can then be read a second time, once the secret is known. I skim read it again and, as promised, with the knowledge of the secret the book reads in a different way.To top it all the book is reportedly written in \\"layers\\" with secrets within secrets (bit like the Da Vinci Code), text that has double meanings and puzzles that can lead you to the ultimate secret in the book. I don't want to appear thick, but I haven't found them (YET!). This then feeds into the \\"web experience\\" which again is secrets within secrets and all kinds cool stuff that will expand upon the book. I did find this rather refreshing and it does (even with my sceptisiscm) add something more.Over all it sits on my shelf with my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Fisherman's Son","review":"Hooked, hooked, hooked, line and sinker!

Orlando's Gloucester Trilogy, it seemed like a good time to go back and re-read \\"The Fisherman's Son\\". I am glad I did. This novel, based on Orlando's own experiences as the son of an Italian-American fishing family and as a maritime attorney, introduces two important worlds to the reader.First, is the colorful and passionate world of the immigrant Sicilian fishing families in America. Orlando's description of family dynamics, food, faith, and celebration is so colorful and so accurately rendered that this novel was chosen by a regional college as required reading in its Italian-American studies curriculum.Second, Orlando presents in vivid detail the legal issues that surround the fishing industry -- a world that very few people outside fishing communities are aware of. The regulations and inequities that have plagued fishing families such as those in Gloucester are brought vividly and somewhat shockingly to life. As a litigator himself, author Orlando is at his best in the courtroom scenes where his fictional protagonist John Palermo fights for the rights of the fishermen he represents.\\"The Fisherman's Son\\" is not only an enjoyable and fast-paced read but a significant contribution to the understanding of a culture and a part of American life that too few people are aware of.

And whats a game without a few tricky spots you can't figure out? Well if your like me you are having trouble with Evolva. And then this guide is definitly the one for you. It has everything from A-Z. Tips, tricks, strategies, and of course the basic terrain map to guide you around. It's a fairly good price for such a good guide. And hey, who can say no to a good deal like this? As I said before, if your having trouble with evolva, this is the guide for you. Rating? I give it a high 4 stars."},{"Title":"Evolva: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"This is one original sci-fi action game that should not be passed, imaginative graphics...sometimes it looks like some modern fine art. Regarding the actions, you can actually use tactics to accomplish instead of brute force since you can command individual soldier for a particular action, but just do not expect strategic implementations like Rainbow Six. Evolva game engine is excellent, but if they could make the genohunters more human-like and carry &quot;modern&quot; types of weapons that mutate with the enemies' genes, that would look much better and make more &quot;sense&quot;. Nevertheless, Evolva is a good game and at times addictive, with the nicely designed missions, very fine AI and fantastic graphics, it is one enjoyable game indeed."},{"Title":"And the Good Brown Earth","review":"Don't I just love that I have a nephew named Joe whose grandmother is called Gram! I can't wait to give this book to them as a gift along with a set of child's gardening tools. This book is a heartwarming tale for any child to read, however, so don't hesitate to ask your librarian for this one. The book carries a young child along with the cycle of planting and growing things in the garden. Every part of the cycle is the time for something, \\"digging time\\", \\"thinking time\\", \\"planting time\\", \\"weeding time\\", \\"resting time\\", etc. and this message is an especially good one for a child beginning to absorb the unhealthy concept of instant gratification - teach your children that everything happens in its own good time and to enjoy ALL parts of the cycle. In terms of gift giving, this is a good book for the winter holidays since it shows that the cycle of growing begins in the winter, not in the spring, as the earth rests and renews itself in preparation. The illustrations are joyous although they might be a little to loosely painted for some; we all have our own tastes in this regard. I loved this book and can't wait to read it each winter to remind my daughter of all the riches hiding in the earth down under the snow, waiting, waiting to be set free in the springtime..."},{"Title":"And the Good Brown Earth","review":"A story of a year's changing seasons is always illuminating for children, especially for those so young that waiting for winter to turn into summer seems an eternity. Pair that progression with the growing of edibles, as in &quot;The Good Brown Earth,&quot; and you have a peaceful story that will help youngsters appreciate the world in which we live.Joe and his grandmother are the best of friends. They spend a great deal of time together tending to a vegetable patch. As the story opens it is fall and the pair are turning over the earth. Their next visit to the patch takes place during the winter as Gram thinks about all the good things in her gardening book, and Joe builds a snowman.Of course, spring follows for planting and summer for growth. Best of all is the harvest when all &quot;Gram's plants are standing tall and ripe and lush.&quot;Repeated throughout is the phrase &quot;And the good brown earth got on with doing what the good brown earth does best,&quot; a reminder of the value of our soil."},{"Title":"And the Good Brown Earth","review":"What a sweetly simple story about the transformation of a plot of \\"good brown earth\\" to a full fledged garden!I love how Gram takes Joe with her to her garden spot and shows him what goes into the growing of a garden. Joe is even given a bit of land to grow his own garden (the results are wonderful!).There's nothing overly specific, technical or scientific here, but in a way that's what makes it so wonderful, and for children who aren't familiar with how plants grow, it's a great introduction.We visit the garden in various stages and seasons and the illustrations are so delightful and they not only illustrated the story but added to it as well.Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"THE GREAT PYRAMID DECODED","review":"This is a fascinating book which details very specific weight, volume, mass, perimeter, and interior measurements of the great pyramid in relation to the earth, solar system, stars, and events in time.

And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of Hosts in the Land of Egypt\\" (Isaiah 19:19-20). Mr. Capt reveals that the Great Pyramid of Giza is the fulfillment of this prophecy, and demonstrates through a map of the region how this \\"Testimony in Stone\\" could be located in the midst of the land of Egypt while at the same time at its border.

Some of the data, like the volume of the Earth above mean sea level and the mean density of the earth, I had not seen before.Some of the chronological data professed to be in the passageways is supported by quotes from the Bible. The author matches it up with the birth and death of Jesus, and the Israelites exodus from Egypt. And all of this was put into these stones long before the actual events occurred on this planet.This is a short book, but it contains a lot of information. I am always amazed by the amount and accuracy of the data put into this one megalith."},{"Title":"THE GREAT PYRAMID DECODED","review":"This is a relatively short book due to the many nice illustrations so you won't have to spend too much time reading it.It provides fascinating insights into the mysterious mathematical and geometrical relationships embodied in The Great Pyramid. These relationships correspond to the dimensions of the earth itself and the mathematical value 'pi'.The author correctly realized that god-like knowledge was required to construct this mysterious monument. This pyramid clearly demonstrates a knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and engineering that far surpassed what people in Egypt supposedly possessed 5,000 years ago.However the author suffered from a problem that affects other authors who are dedicated to a specific religion or philosophy. He tried to force the facts to fit his religious beliefs which in this case is Christian. This caused him to make questionable statements about how the bible relates to the pyramid. This I felt detracted from what is otherwise a wonderful book.I believe he is correct however that the pyramid tells the history of our human race. The American psychic Edgar Cayce also said this. Each 'pyramid inch' represents one year of history and important events such as the death of Christ are indicated in the pyramid's construction.Cayce claimed that Christ Himself in the form of the god Hermes was directly involved with the construction of the pyramid as was the god Horus who provided the sacred geometry. Cayce was the main architect in the form of the high priest Ra Ta.Apparently the pyramid is a monument that represents the struggle between good and evil.There are two pathways in the pyramid. One path goes up to the top and the other goes down into a bottomless pit under the pyramid. Down into the 'chamber of chaos'.The chamber of chaos is an unfinished chamber just as the evil person is incomplete I guess. Something that never really reached maturity or finished evolving correctly due to laziness.So the pyramid represents the earth and these two pathways represent humanity's journey through the earth. I think the image on the cover of Pink Floyd's album 'Dark Side Of The Moon' indicate this.I think the positioning of the three pyramids at Giza corresponds to the three stars in the belt of the constellation Orion as they appeared in the sky in 10,500 BC. This is probably the correct date of construction.This date corresponds to the final destruction of Atlantis.In his book 'The Giza Power Plant' Christopher Dunn demonstrates that The Great Pyramid was a machine like a sort of nuclear reactor.It contains a type of Atlantean crystal technology. The gigantic granite blocks contain quartz crystals.I believe The Great Pyramid was originally covered with polished white limestone that could be seen from miles away. On these outer stones were hieroglyphics that told many secrets about the mysteries of the universe.Jeff MarzanoMeditation Music of Ancient EgyptThe Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and FutureEdgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of manThe Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient EgyptInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Death StarEdgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever KnownInitiationDark Side of the Moon 30th Anniversary Edition"},{"Title":"THE GREAT PYRAMID DECODED","review":"The general layout and fact-based info was fine in this book, but once I got to the section to describe the architect of the pyramid, I must confess I was unexpectedly disappointed. I'm not an atheist or anything, just wanting more science than faith. I can understand and admire divine inspiration, but am skeptical of figures bent to represent the will of God. All in all, an interesting read, just not what I expected, I guess."},{"Title":"THE GREAT PYRAMID DECODED","review":"This book basically rejects everything modern archaeology has to say about the Great Pyramid in favor of a view that twists the facts (and don't believe anything in it that Capt says is fact without checking it) to fit into a fundamentalist religious perspective. Its author was a great supporter of the anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"I agree with other critics that some of the books that the Warrens are either featured in or write, such as The Demonologist, or Beware the Night are written in a rather melodramatic fashion. This one is no different, but it is still a must read for a dark and stormy night. No one can deny the chills they get when they read about the Smurl family's ordeal. I first read this book about ten years ago and it scared me so badly that I had to sleep with the lights on for a week. Do I beleive every single word. Not really. Do I think these things really happened in some form or another? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"Quite simply this book has it all. From casefiles of the Warren's most frightening cases to guidelines for the amateur ghost hunter, this book will have you reading all night long.(Partly because of the frightening tales) I especially enjoyed the areas in which Ed tells of times when even he feared for his well being. Ed Warren is a demonologist and his wife Lorraine is a trance medium, this combination makes for interesting encounters with spirits and demons alike. If you get a chance to see their lecture near you I strongly encourage you to attend."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"The Warrens are mostly misunderstood. When Stacy in the first review at the top of this page calls them &quot;straight out of the middleages&quot;---well they are demonolgists by God! Not only that but trained by The Vatican! And indeed they being some of the last and only in the USA, are without question very unusual people. You can probably count the number of church trained demonologists on one hand in the USA. And considering that they are classic demonologists, they do boil the bible down to angels and devils so to speak. I personally have been acquainted with them and don't get me wrong, I depart from their beliefs on a number of levels, but I can vouch for Lorraine being an immensely gifted clarevoyant. I think to appreciate the Warrens is to consider who they are. Which to tune ones perception to that askew demands a bit of patience that can be worthwhile. Their 50 year track record as genuine &amp; concerned religionists speaks for itself and they are very kindly people. We are also living in a world which responds to them because they call themselves Christians and consider themselves kind of God's helpers. Confidence tricksters they're not."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"Athough I greatly admire and respect the Warrens very much and have read all the books they have written or co-written, I was quite disappointed in this particular venture. When compared to the other works of theirs that I have had the pleasure of reading, I was surprised at the slow and almost boring pace this book took. The stories were \\" safe \\" by their normal standards. The book was so mundane (by the Warrens standard) that I decided to take a look at when it was first published (thinking it HAD to be pre-80's ) and to my amazement, it was published in '89! It irritated me the way the book left some of the stories open ended. Meaning that the rfeader was often left to wonder but not know, \\" what ended up happening? \\". They were often vaugh in their discriptions of events and seemed to actually skip what happend to hasten to the end of the story. I don't know why they would wish to do this since the book is only 150 pages long. Took me less that 3 nights of casual reading to finish it. I was reading some of the other reviews of this book and was wondering if we all had even read the same work. I can't understand why some of the other reviewers were saying things like, \\" 'packs a paranormal punch ' \\", and \\" ' best book on the subject ' \\". It is so far and away NOT the best book on the subject that I was sceptical if the reviewer had really ever read anything that WAS truly the best book on the subject. Please don't misunderstnad, I do not agree with R. Stacy either when he/she says the book is \\"fiction\\". I know that the Warrens are true blue and I tend to believe their stories. However in saying that, today I am mainly speaking on my feelings as a reviwer of this book. In my humble opinion, it was NOT worth what I paid for it and I was not pleased when I was done reading it. It is not at all written in the same vein as their book \\" The Demonologist \\" which completely outshines this book. I also very much enjoyed their book \\" Graveyard \\" which scared me and made me want to visit the spacific graveyard they were speaking of. I was hoping, if not fully expecting, this book to be just as good...but alas, it fell short. Sorry guys, 2 stars. Can't win 'em all ;-)"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"Unfortunately Mr. Stacy is someone who needs to \\"See\\" in order to believe. Had he ever experienced ANY of the things the Warrens write about--even in the smallest detail, he'd change his tune. This book gives great insight into just how far and bad things can get when you mess around with Ouiji boards, seances, and conjuring. It also illustrates just WHAT is making those \\"bumps in the night\\" and why. Take it from someone who grew up in a house with a lot of weird happenings--there is something out there and it is NOT just the house setteling on its foundation nor air in the plumbing! If you witness something move--it's NOT a ghost!!"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"This is by far the scariest book, I have ever read! In one of the stories the \\"Warrens\\" know right away what a teen is up too when they go to his parents house, and guess what? They are right!, and it's scary as hell! But, I don't want to give it away. This book was so scary I had to stop reading it. I believe in things like this, and like the other reviewer said, it made me become even closer to God after reading this. It made me realize too, that there really is an evil side of things. The Warrens are Christians, but they must have a very special gift from God, if they help people going through these things. If you like being scared order this book!"},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"Thank you to the Warren's, they've helped many families in making sense of something that seems so different to us. And just because it's different some people are scared of it. And thats fine, everyone has their own opinion but i have a best friend that her house was haunted and still is to this day and the Warren's did all they could to help. Ed Warren passed away (R.I.P) and now Lorraine is getting older but still doing everything she can, helping where is needed. The Warren's have a special gift from God just like Sylvia Browne (Another good author)."},{"Title":"Ghost Hunters: True Stories from the World's Most Famous Demonologists","review":"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but when arrogance and stupidity cloud the mind, that opinion is valueless.

Bishop's detailed research and captivating writing style make this book an engaging read, giving the reader a greater feel and appreciation for Mary (she was only 14 or 15 at the time)and Joseph (He, too, was much younger than you might think, about 18 or 19), of what their life was like, of the family ties between Jesus and John the Baptist, of what countryside was like on the 90-mile trip from Nazareth to Bethlehem, of Bethlehem's proxmity to Jerusalem and its impact on the story...Reads like the the old \\"You Are There\\" TV series, and it is good, very good. Well done and highly recommended. Perhaps the next best thing to being there..."},{"Title":"The day Christ was born","review":"For such a small book, it was jam packed with great information. This account of Christ's birth made Mary & Joseph's saga \\"real\\" to me.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the story of Christ."},{"Title":"The day Christ was born","review":"The Day Christ was Born is an excellent work of fiction describing the life of Christ. The book actually covers more than just the day of Jesus' birth, giving attention to the circumstances surrounding that important event, such as Mary's pregnancy, the trip to Bethlehem, the visit of the shepherds and the Magi, and the trip to Egypt.Bishop takes a few liberties in his interpretation of the biblical story, but maintains the crucial elements in his narrative. He explains some of the customs of the day, including those of marriage and the process of giving birth.With only two of the four gospels giving any details about the birth of Jesus, Bishop has attempted to supply the missing details, weaving in material from various ancient historical and archeological sources. He doesn't tamper with the facts, but merely enhances them with a creative dialogue and description that makes the book an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The day Christ was born","review":"There is so much to digest in this book that one reading is not enough. I found the detail and background narratives to be so full of information that I wanted to keep going back to re-read various parts over and over. This book also led to my meditating about the many aspects of obedience and blind acceptance which Mary and Joseph willingly did. I highly recommend it, both for its historical information and for its spiritual influence."},{"Title":"The day Christ was born","review":"Jim Bishop was the foremost practitioner of the \\"Day\\" historical documentary chronicles. Others he authored were \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\", \\"The Day Christ Died\\" and \\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\". He uses only extant historical materials to create a step-by-step chronology of the unfolding events of the most important day in mankind's history. This is a short, easy to read account of Jesus' birth, suitable for all ages.Bishop is very readable and suitable for any Christian doctrine. Explanations of Jewish Roman-era customs help the reader understand why various events take place.A first rate telling of a great story."},{"Title":"The day Christ was born","review":"Loved it and thought it was a great read during Advent.

It is a very short simple easy to read book which, though I was expecting it to be deeper and more insightful, the simple clear presentation of what that day may have been like for these mere mortals involved in it presented in such a simple mundane matter of fact way moved me to tears repeatedly. This book helps you to put God's coming as a human being in the flesh and all the awe and grandeur of it into a perspective that is more easy to see in grasp for us humans."},{"Title":"Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol. 4: Trials and Tribulations","review":"This book collects a few issues of the Paul Jenkins Peter Parker series (between issues 40 through 50): \\"Snow Day,\\" \\"The Big Question,\\" \\"The Big Answer,\\" \\"And Here My Troubles Begin,\\" and one other issue whose title escapes me at the moment.The writing and the artwork is pretty good for the majority of the book, but Paul Jenkins' contribution to the second part of the two-part story in this book (\\"The Big Question,\\" part one, and \\"The Big Answer,\\" part two) falls a bit on the convenient and ridiculous side at a few instances in the script. Also, the reprint of double-sized issue 50 (volume two, mind you) has a lot of potential, but the writer's execution doesn't live up to it. That's not to say that it's a terrible outing -- quite the opposite, actually. It's still enjoyable and better than a lot of other Spider-Man stuff out there.The real gems in this collection, though, are the first two chapters: An excellent story about a neglected black child who escapes into a world of fantasy, which is inspired by the few positive aspects of his life (his Uncle Ray and his school), and one story called \\"Snow Day,\\" which was just as entertaining (although not as emotionally powerful). These issues alone are worth the price of admission.Too bad there isn't a collection of Jenkins' entire one-issue stories. Those are the times when the series really shined.This is the last collection of Peter Parker that was written by Paul Jenkins and drawn by Mark Buckingham. When this series was canceled, Paul Jenkins started to write the second volume of Spectacular Spider-Man, with Humberto Ramos on drawing chores. It's a bit different from the Peter Parker issues, but it's still good. However, it is in my personal opinion that Ramos will not be able to do as good a job as Mark Buckingham, and it seems so far that Jenkins' best writing is the one-issue stories rather than a four-, five-, or six-part story arc.Overall, this was a really enjoyable book, worthy of having the name \\"Spider-Man\\" on the cover. It's high moments are truly some of the greatest contributions to the Spider-Man mythos."},{"Title":"OKB Tupolev: A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft","review":"Books of this sort, are by nature, \\"survey\\" books, looking over a large collection of aircraft and inevitably losing out on detail versus a plane-dedicated version.Unfortunately, apparently Tupolev made way too many different types of aircraft in its history. Combined with the ~360 page class length of this series, and the end result is clearly over-compression. Comparing the book with its Ilyushin counterpart, the former finds time to go over a plane's systems in detail comparable to the plane-dedicated books, development and variants in reasonable detail and even give a quick look of its service. Its IL-76 section, in particular, is 50-page class and is IMO a fair substitute for the 2001 Aerofax book, unless individual aircraft numbers fascinate you.Forget any hope of that for the Tupolev book. The description of development feels much more rushed, specs are cut down to a small table the likes you can find in Wikipedia or Globalsecurity, variant descriptions are down to one-liners and service details are ... let's just say that if your interest in any Tupolev plane gets piqued by the book, you would have to find the dedicated Midland or Aerofax book, and some of the older ones are getting harder to acquire.This is no fault of the authors - they are doing the best they can in this small space. To do as good (detailed) a job as the Ilyushin book would probably require an doubling of pages. Still, it must be said the end result just isn't as satisfying. Now let me run off and see if I can still the Aerofax Tupolev books are still available..."},{"Title":"OKB Tupolev: A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft","review":"This book is well produced and loaded with photos, plan views and information about Tupolev aircraft.

My only complaint is the lack of an index."},{"Title":"OKB Tupolev: A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft","review":"This is an awsome book revealing secrets on what was going on in the USSR.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it could use an index."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Pretty much everyone has seen the Disney cartoon, but T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone is a story that must be read. Nowhere in the movie do you get delicious bits like:\\"The cottage had a brass plate screwed on the garden gate. It said: Madame Mim, B.A. (Dom-Daniel) Pianoforte, Needlework, Necromancy.\\"Or how about the casual mention of Merlin in running shorts ... Merlin knitting his beard into the nightcap he's making ... Merlin's dishes washing themselves up, shouting, \\"Hey! Let's dunk the tea pot!\\"Or a falcon who's been mewed up too long and cannot keep from quoting all the bloody passages of Macbeth? (My personal favorite bit of deliciousness, since I have a similar character in my story.)Most people pick up the story of King Arthur from the day in the churchyard, when young Art pulls the sword from the stone and is hailed by all of Merry Old England as their sovereign lord. T.H. White, however, looks back to the innocent childhood of England's once and future king, the days when outlaws like Robin Wood (read: Hood) roamed the Forest Sauvage and knights spent their entire lives questing mysterious beasts.While certain passages did drag on and I felt like someone should remind White that young readers aren't interested in philosophy, and he harped about evolution more than once, this would make a wonderful read-aloud ... Ay say, the dialogue is absolutely lovely, what?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is my first T.H. White book, and WOW I love it! The story was written in the 1930s, published in 1938. Around the time of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series. It is not comparable to any other books I've read. The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything. I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising. It is a great read for both children and the adults. I strongly recommanded it for readers of all age."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I didn't really want to read this book at first, because it was for an English class of mine. When I started reading it I was pleasently suprised! I ended up enjoyng this book very much! I would recomend reading it to anyone looking for a humorous adventure story.My favorite character would have to to Merlin. Merlin is a good wizard. He plays a huge roll in this book. Merlin made this book funny and much more interesting. Why wouldn't T.H White put him in more of the story? My only complaint of this book would have to be Merlin not being even more invloved and humorous!This story has evry interesting character development also. Kay, Wart's best friend, future knight, and Sir Ecotr's son, is the character I enjoyed watching develop the most. Kay came across to me as a snob at the start of the book. Later in the book he shows his true colors when he crys to Wart. At the end I didn't like him again when he lied about pulling the sword from the stone, but then when he confessed that it truely was Wart I liked him again.I really enjolyed this book. It turned an unwanted English project into something I can look back and love. I would definately recomend this book.

I was hoping to read something great - and in White's defense, maybe the book is great, but it's not at all what I was expecting and because of that I was sorely disappointed. T.H. White's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is a children's book. Despite that, it's a tough read both because it takes place in a medieval time period, and because the book itself was written (I'm assuming based on its first copyright date) back in 1939. For my tastes, the book is slow, uninteresting, and a chore to read. I suspect that this exact telling of the story is the basis for Disney's children's movie by the same title.If you're looking for a child's story and don't mind the antiquated language, then you may enjoy the book. If you're a fan of current fantasy and are looking for something to read, I don't know that I could recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T. H. White wrote The Sword in the Stone. He was one of President Kennedy's best and brightest. The Sword in the Stone is a fantasy novel, intended for adults, mostly due to the difficult working. It's purpose is to tell a story and to entertain. The title is self explanatory for anyone who has heard Arthurian legends before, but if not, it becomes obvious towards the end of the book.The Sword in the Stone tells the story of a young boy called the Wart who's adventures with the wizard Merlyn helped prepare him for his last adventure as the Wart and his first as Arthur. Wart is raised on a manor with his adopted father Sir Ector and stepbrother Kay. Kay gains an increasingly important role in the end. He and Wart slowly grow apart to the extent that he serves as one of the few antagonists. The language used in the book is one of the few challenges that I had with the book. I had a hard time with the way the book switched back and forth from Modern English to Old English. One of the main arguments in the book is \\"Might versus Right, or Strength vs. Justice.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historic fiction or fantasy. Despite the confusing grammar, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author did a great job of creating three dimensional characters and a complex but not confusing plot. I especially enjoyed how the author could shift from a serious dialogue between William Twyti and Robin Wood to a comical scene with Sir Grummore and King Pellinore."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"If you like books about King Arthur and all his adventures then you'll like this book. It is filled with magic and strange creatures a plenty. It is not just fun for children, but the whole family! I enjoyed this book because of all the interesting animals and giants Merlin and young Arthur meet."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Mr. White created a world that took some time to get used to. Having not read a children's classic in awhile, I had to get used to the vernacular all over again. Once I was able to follow it, the stories unfolded and I couldn't get enough. Mr. White truly knows how to get you to step into another world with ease. He takes all different kinds of characters and historical people to make this story work. I was truly pleased.The Young Wart, Arthur, was shy at first. He knew what his station in life would always be due to the fact that he didn't know who his parents were. Sir Ector was kind enough to take him under his wing. Yet there were certain things Wart knew he'd never do. Or so he thought. Merlyn was a fantastic character! I loved seeing a new take on Merlyn. The other characters of King Pelinore, Sir Ector, Madam Mim and others brought the cast to a completion. The range of their personalities were fun to watch unfold.The adventures were so much more fun than the Disney movie. I was truly impressed with how much was followed yet the things that were left out were my favorites. The beginning dragged for me but by the end, I was sad to see it end. This was a fun romp in period fiction and I am curious to see what else was written by this author. I wouldn't read this to anyone under the age of 10 only since there is some coarse language used. There were times I was surprised I didn't burst out into song with all the bits of songs that were part of the story!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about a young boy called the Wart and all the interesting things he learns. His tutor, a magician named Merlyn, changes the Wart into many different animals. While he is an animal he learns there are many ways to look at life. He realizes life beyond castle walls is different and harder than most would think. The Wart becomes a well-educated young man who is very gentle but not afraid to stand up for what he believes. The book was very enjoyable because it always kept me guessing and had a good plot. The book kept me interested becasue the chapters never started slow and climaxed toward the end; for the most part the entire chapter was fun to read. I wanted to keep reading because the plot was never dull. In one chapter the Wart is on an adventure with Robin Wood; then in the next chapter he is watching an exciting jousting match. If you like a strong plot and exciting chapters, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by: T.H White, is about a young boy named wart along with many friends going on long journeys during the Middle Ages, through out royal land and castles, getting lost in the woods, and meeting strange mystical people along with meeting Merlin the magical magician. I really liked the book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; because I found it very exiting and extremely interesting because once you get into it, it's very hard to put the book down. It's a book for all people because it has action, science/fiction, and comedy. Even though it is a short 288 page book, there is still a lot of action and there is definitely a lot of Medieval people, events, etc. The best part of reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is that there is a lot of things to learn about and there is a lot of interesting parts in the book. If you really like a book with character and exiting action, comedy, and interesting facts, you should read &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. I really think that the author &quot;T.H White&quot; did a very well job with keeping myself and everybody interested in the book and making it an extremely lovable book. In conclusion, I think &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is one of the best Middle Ages books to read, it's an educational book, and especially, I think that more people should read it and get other books written by T.H White, because he writes the best medieval books."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a fantastic book to read for several reasons.The first reason is the title, which sounds like an exciting adventure story. As soon as I looked at the cover with a magician and a young boy on it, I knew it wouild be something I would be interested in. The short summary on the inside of the cover told me enough about the story to know that I would read this from end to end. The other thind the summary told me was that the book was about King Arthur, who I've always wanted to read about. I picked out the book and immediately decided that this was something I would read.The main character is young Arthur. He is a young boy who is typical of young people in his time. He is brave, thoughful of others, and very respectful to his elders. When his tutor, the Magician Merlyn, begins his education, Arthur's curiosity and talent for learning become apparent. Even so, Arthur and his brother, Kay, run and play as normal kids would. Not too much is made of the fact that Arthur is adopted.It would be fair to say that Arthur is shown to be somebody who will grow into greatness but will be perfectly normal getting there.I really like this book because it is a fast-moving story with a great deal of adventure and magic. Arthur's adventures put him into all kinds of circumstances and problems. In fact, each adventure is a unique hapenning. The way the author weaves adventure and magic into his tales makes the book hard to put down. I especially liked the time when Merlyn turned Arthur into a bird. When Arthur was locked in a box and almost cooked by a witch, I enjoyed how Arthur used a goat as a messenger. This kind of descriptive writing made me feel like I was inside the book. I wouild have to say that this book is an exciting, magical adventure story, which I enjoy greatly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"We got this book for my son's assigned summer reading from his school. The book itself is good and discussion worthy, and will make a good classroom topic, hitting upon some controversial topics. The book itself has some wear, but for the cost was a pretty good value. It had a bit of a musty smell, like it came from an old school or library. But, hey; it was used, so we weren't expecting perfection.I'd buy from this seller again. And, my son would recommend the book to others for a good read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I'm only in the middle of the book, but it is fantasic! My school teacher is reading the same book and can't put it down. She even reads in the middle of class! This is an amazing book to read and I am so wanting to read more and more every day. It's wonderful and an adventure with every new page. If you are most enterested in King Arthur then read it. It will tell you more then enough info about King Arthur. It is one of T.H.White's most fantasic and fanous story. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Young Arthur, (known to everyone else as &quot;Wart&quot;,) learns from his tutor, Merlin, stuff that he could only dream about before, coming to life before his eyes. Like watching Jousts, turning in to fish, birds, and other animals, and going on adventures with Robin Wood,(commonly known as Robin Hood.) but makes mistakes, gets injured, and learns from them. And all of this only helps in his future life, and his quest, which is his destiny. I rated the sword in the stone a 5 because It was a extremely good book, and the only things that might affect my judgment is the fact that sometimes they use old English. It is sometimes hard to understand because some of the wording is a little old, and, and stuff like that. But T.H. White is able to incorporate a story of king Arthur, and a story full of distinct, funny and odd people, (basically, a comedy,) in to one great book. Another reason that I think that it is a good book because T.H.White gets really in depth throughout the whole book, he can describe every detail, in other words, he can really &quot;Paint a perfect picture.&quot; So all in all I say that if you are interested in King Arthur at all, you should definitely read this book! It does not matter if you are twelve or twenty-one, thirty or seventy, you will truly enjoy The Sword in The Stone. It is definitely a top ten on my list! If you like The Sword in the stone as much as I do, then I recommend reading The Once and Future King, also by T.H.White."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I must admit, at first I wasn't keen on the idea of reading a novel based on Arthurian legend for English. Despite my love of the Disney cartoon, I felt certain that the book would be dull and slow-moving, with little or no comic relief, and cardboard characters. I was sure that knights and swordplay would hold no interest for me. Yet, as soon as I picked up The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White, I changed my mind. This well-written book was engrossing, lively, and humorous, three qualities which, based on my preconceived notions of the book, I never would have expected a novel on Arthurian legend to have.I grew up watching Walt Disney's cartoon version of the book, and it was always one of my favorites. But can you trust a Disney cartoon to be the same as the book? Because they always change the story so that it will appeal to younger audiences, it is difficult for Disney to stay accurate. To my surprse, the movie is actually rather true to the book.T.H. White's vivid characters really bring this fabulous story to life with lovable, animated personalities. As you follow Arthur (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Wart&quot;)on a series of wonderful, wild events under the tutelage of Merlyn, you grow to enjoy spending time with this eager character who is anxious to learn and is always up for an adventure. Merlyn, the slightly eccentric old magician who lives life backwards, and who has come to the Castle Savauge to tutor Arthur and Kay, is lovely, as well. Then there is the crazy, fun-loving King Pellinore, who spends his life on the trail of the Questin' Beast. With his many excellent portrayals. T.H. White makes you feel as though you've made some new friends.The unique plot of this book is one of the things that keeps you constantly wrapped up in it. From becoming a fish, to rescuing friends with Robin Wood (NOT Hood) and Maid Marian, to going on a possibly deadly boar hunt with the whole village, Arthur does it all. You are sure to be enthralled as Arthur sees what it's like to be an ant, an owl, and many other creatures. The fun, frolicking plot is like no other, so it always keeps you interested and waiting for more. And, of course, there is always the happy ending, which I won't give away for those of you who do not already know what it is. The plot is different in that it has several small dilemmas, rather than one major obstacle for Arthur to overcome. So, if you are looking for a suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a comical book with a playful, whimsical plot, energetic, delightful characters, and an all-in-all happy mood, The Sword in the Stone is your book of choice."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"It has been many years since I read the works of T.H. White, and it was quite by accident that I came across the Philomel edition of The Sword in the Stone, while browsing the bargain section at a used bookstore. I found this edition for two dollars (and in very good condition), and decided to purchase it so that I could share it with my young daughter. The book brought back fond memories of summers spent at my grandparents' home, and of reading the numerous works of children's literature in their home library.The Sword and the Stone is a wonderful work of fantasy, of Arthur's childhood and tutelage under the great wizard, Merlyn. It is full of fun and adventurous exploits, giving readers and anyone interested in Arthur a fantastical glimpse into Arthur's life during childhood. The Philomel edition is especially recommended for the beautiful, detailed, full color illustrations by artist Dennis Nolan. There are seventeen full-page color illustrations which enhance one's reading pleasure. A captivating read indeed."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword In The Stone&quot; written by T.H. White was a very exciting and interesting book. The book was about a young boy named The Wart brought up in a wealthy family of his father, Sir Ector, and his brother, Kay. He met a wizard who became his tutor but not any ordinary tutor. This tutor, Merlyn, turned The Wart into different animals and what-not to give Wart the greatest adventure of his life. I really liked this book because it was really exciting and kept you on your toes. The adventures that Wart was faced with were exciting, fun, and entertaining. One of the adventures that I liked the most was the first one The Wart was sent on. He was turned into a fish and seemed so vulnerable then because he needed to learn how to swim and to get used to the water. It was exciting! Even when the book started to get a little bleak the author would always come back with a new, fun adventure to keep you on your toes. There was only one point that I didn't like. The author would spend one out of about every five chapters just describing the scenery and the place they were in. That got rather monotonous to read.I would recommend this book to a skilled reader but no one under the age of ten. This book was wonderful and fun-filled, and if you love excitement and fantasy this is a book for you!ALWAYS, Ken"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This was a wonderful book to read,and I too was surprised and pleased at how much of the novel Walt Disney kept in his cartoon version.(Disney was either very faithful or very unfaithful in his adaptations.This is much more faithful than some.)Wart needed a lot of education,and Merlyn knew the right way to teach Wart the way to be a king.The different lives Wart led as an animal showed him the basics of human nature,as he realizes that animals and humans aren't too different at all."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Do what we will, we always become who we are meant to be. We hold a lot of power within us, but not enough to fight our fates. Fascinating theories and themes such as these are presented and strongly portrayed in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone. The inexorable power of destiny is beautifully illustrated in this book, which takes us through many adventures of the boyhood of legendary King Arthur.Readers gain a respect for young King Arthur (identified in this story as \\"the Wart\\") from the very start. Though the Wart is treated somewhat unkindly by his guardians, Sir Ector and Kay, he does what he knows is right in all situations. These situations include the first main incident of the story, in which the Wart bravely stays a whole night alone in a dark forest, simply to retrieve a servant's loose bird. He also keeps his head and his priorities straight despite his older brother Kay's naggings and his envy for Kay's station in society. The Wart is somewhat confused and unsure of his purpose in life, but soon his main guardian Sir Ector hires a wizard named Merlyn to tutor and educate the boy. Thus marks the beginning of the future king's great adventures and learning experiences. Putting to use his magical powers, the wizard educates the Wart by transforming him into several different creatures so that the boy can see life from various points of view. One day, as Arthur is trying to find a sword for Kay to use in a jousting match, he comes across a sword in a stone (which is the title's derivation). He struggles to pull it out for quite some time, then senses that something strange and unusual is in the air around him, something magical, and the sword easily slips out. His family and all the townspeople are shocked and somewhat dismayed when they hear the news, but nevertheless the meek, submissive, experienced Arthur inherits the throne. The ending ties up many loose ends and brings the whole story together in one great, triumphant, fulfilling close.Strange and contradicting as it may seem, I both dislike and love this detailed book. I dislike it because I feel that many parts are too long and drawn-out, especially descriptions of places and the Wart's out-of-body experiences. I love the story because it is very creative and poses thought-provoking theories and pieces of advice about life. I enjoy the humorous parts of this book, which are sporadically sprinkled within both casual and serious situations. I think that the young king's experiences are relevant and can be beneficial to many who seek different viewpoints of life.I personally recommend The Sword in the Stone to people who read at about the junior-high or high-school level, roughly age twelve and up, who are interested in Arthurian legend. I especially recommend it to males, as I feel that it is generally a male-directed book. I state this because there are very few female characters involved in the story, and those are very minor (yet not inferior) characters. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the author himself is a male. Nonetheless, The Sword in the Stone contains many important themes which will be beneficial to all types of people who choose to read the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times.

Sir Ector isn't convinced and has both boys try again, and the Wart pulls it out and becomes king.My opinionon on this book is that this a good book overall, I especially like the twists it made to the more commonly known legend and the characters in the book.

Wart calls Sir Ector father, but it is Sir Ector's real son, Kay, who is destined to be knighted and Wart his squire. The Magician Merlyn is the tutor of both Wart and Kay, but he puts most of his efforts on Wart.The Sword in the Stone is book 1 of a 4 book series, The Once and Future King, by T.H. White (Terence Hanbury White) about King Arthur. There actually is no direct refernce to this story being about King Arthur until the end except for a few name drops here and there which one wouldn't even suspect if they weren't familiar with King Arthur's tales. It was pretty obvious who would eventually get named King Arthur.This book was written in the 1930s like Lord of the Rings, but reads very differently. The Sword in the Stone is basically written for the younger fantasy readers. First off it's rather short and secondly there isn't the character development or plot developments that you expect to see in adult epic fantasies.Wart's education from Merlyn consists mostly of observing the world from different animals like owls, badgers, ants, etc. They all play a part in the end in helping the true sword owner pull the unnamed sword (at this point at least) out of the stone.Well I can't say this was one of my favourites, but I did buy the entire The Once and Future King series on my e-book and I am a sucker for mythology, so I'll definitely finish it. It's an easy enough read that I don't really need to force myself to read it.

Wart grew up in the castle of Sir Ector, with Sir Ector himself, and his son Kay. Wart is taught by the famous wizard known as Merlyn, how to be a man. Merlyn sends Wart on many magnificent and magical adventures, transforming him from one creature to the next and sending him on spectacular journeys and quests all through the land.The Sword in the Stone was a book that was easy to pick up and get right into, but also easy to put down and feel like you could almost fall asleep if you read one more page. It would change from interesting to dull consistently throughout the book. There were parts that were very detailed, and exciting, but other parts that were very boring, and hard to understand.The detail was so incredible that as you read you feel as though you are right there with the characters. The details help you to imagine things like Merlyn's blue and gold-starred robe to the exact movement of the sneaky snake as he approaches Wart. The exciting parts of the book tell fantastic fantasy stories that let your imagination run wild. The &quot;Wizard Duel&quot; between Madame Mim and Merlyn goes on for page after page as the two struggle to defeat one another. They use their enchantedpowers and fight for hours on end, until Merlyn thinks of a despising plan, and takes care of Madame Mim once and for all.There are parts in the book that start to get boring and can lose your attention quickly, but as soon as you are about to put the book down,Merlyn has once again performed his magic, and Wart is experiencing yet another splendid adventure. There was a part where Wart and Robin Hood travel with their army to fight against the Anthropophagi (a wild variety of ferocious beasts). They walk throught the woods for days before reaching their destination. This really bores an interested reader. There were many sections of the books that seemed confusing to me. I didn't understand the part where Merlyn transforms Wart into a bird and Wart flys down to the barn to talk with the other birds and hawks. The birds were talking nonsense words that were very hard to catch on to. I must say though that The Sword in the Stone was very appealing to me, despite the parts that I struggled to understand and read through."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as a child but \\"get\\" much more of it now.--Funny, funny, funny, and not the least realistic or representative of the Dark Ages in which Arthur must have (may have) lived.-- White's jokes at the expense of the British upper class of the thirties is first-rate; and there are a few hints of the European conflict building at the time of publication. It is a little silly to try to find anything very profound in this one; for a wonderful and more serious treatment of the Arthurian legend, start with The Crystal Cave by Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"Sword in the Stone\\" is the must-read book of Arthuriana, an imaginative fantasy romp that has inspired all our ideas about the venerable Merlin and about King Arthur's boyhood. White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the legends of Arthur."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a truly wonderful book. It is the classic story of young King Arthur, but told in greater depth and detail, and filled with wonderful, humorous characters. The tale so many times retold suddenly becomes fresh and original, as T.H. White's stunning narrative sweeps the reader into the world of Midieval England, and makes the old story come alive in a new and delightful way. Never before has anyone been able to make the old characters of Arthur and Merlyn, Sir Ector and King Pellinore come alive in such a real and fantastic way. The story is brought to life, and is better by far then the traditional telling of the tale. White does not only tell the simple story of the sword in the stone- here he tells the story of the boy who pulled it out. He goes back and tells us about the growing up of this boy, that we might better understand why it was he that was meant for this destiny, and what it was that shaped him for this task. And throughout the entire story, the book sparkles with humour, wit and charm, which is all the better because it is told in Old English. There are too many books these days written in modern language, using slang and twentieth century dialect, so the Sword in the Stone is a delightful change of pace. And while the Old English sounds perfectly authentic, it is not overly used, and is never difficult to understand. My nine year old sister understood it perfectly, when I read it to her. All in all, this story is the best retelling of any Arthurian legend that I have ever read. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in King Arthur to read this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Once and Future King, which is built upon and uses text from the Sword in the Stone, is one of my favorite books. Much like the Hobbit is a sometimes silly preamble to the Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone is the less serious story of King Arthur as a boy that sets the stage for the novel, The Once and Future King. And like the Hobbit, while it can be occassionally silly- a deadly serious and powerful story is just below the surface.White was clearly impacted by the struggle to hold views of evolution and a God-centered world view, and was also clearly impacted by the tensions of war torn Europe. He weaves some fun stories of Robin Hood, life in a hawk mew, and light-hearted jousting in with all his explaining and metaphorizing, though. I can't imagine not liking the vivid imagery and exotic story-telling, and if you are a fan of any of the other initialed British writers you'll certainly feel at home with T.H. White. Read the Sword in the Stone- it won't take much time, but then by all means read The Once and Future King one day for the real masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"A boy named the Arthur, called Wart, livng during the Middle Ages, is taught by a magician about the past, present, and future, and about all creatures living on the Earth. When the opportunity arises for the Wart to become King, he must recall everything he has learned to pull the magic sword from the stone and become the new leader of England. I enjoyed this book because it had so many exciting battles and page turning adventures. Even a small bit about Robin Hood! The plot really doesn't appear until the last few chapters, where you realized that every story within the book was connected all along. It is nice to know that there are fun and interesting books to read about the Medeival times. I think that if you are looking for a book with lots of adventure, this is truely one that you should read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is set in the Middle Ages, in a time of knights and magicians. Actual historical details are presented in the context of a fictional story. It is about the upbringing of young King Arthur. With the help of his tutor, Merlyn, Arthur experiences adventures, which help him to see life from different points of view. These other perspectives of the world will help him when he becomes king. Merlyn is training Arthur with quests, and a little magic. The quests Arthur accomplishes help him to be a more understanding person. Merlyn subjects Arthur to many different situations, some of which include; being turned into animals, meeting new people, and seeing different people living different lives. A key revelation about the magic of Merlyn occurs the first time that Arthur is introduced to his future tutor. While eating a meal, a mustard-pot gets up and walks to Arthur's plate, adds some mustard, and returns to its place. Later, Merlyn explains the order in which he lives his life, which is different from most people. As most people live time forwards, Merlyn lives it backwards. The significance of this is that it open's Arthur's eyes to a completely different way of looking at life. This is an example of one of the many perspectives Arthur will gain from Merlyn's influence. This slightly whimsical way to introduce lessons for Arthur's life is part of what makes this story so popular. Merlyn explains his perception of time in one sentence, stating, &quot;If you know what's going to happen to people, and not what has happened to them, it makes it so difficult to prevent it happening, if you don't want to have it happen,&quot; (39). This quote is essentially the reason Merlyn is tutoring Arthur. Merlyn's goal is to prepare Arthur for what is going to happen in the future. This gift of Merlyn's came in handy later in the story when Kay, Arthur's brother, and Arthur leave without telling their father. Sir Ector searches for them until he thinks of consulting Merlyn. &quot;The magician for the sake of peace and quietness to go with his nap in, had used his insight to tell Sir Ector exactly what the boys were doing, where they were, and when they might be expected to come back. He had prophesied their return to a minute,&quot; (162). Part of what makes this book so fun is the fantasy that someone can be looking out for us and protecting us while we are impetuous youngsters.While this was an entertaining and educational story, there were many unnecessary details. These frivolous details made for long stretches between the action sequences. I would recommend this book to those readers who prefer careful attention paid to details. For me, the stage setting tended to drag the story down a little. I would have enjoyed a little more action and frivolous and magical events. I like the way the character of the Wart was developed. I was able to notice his leadership ability and maturity level early on, and follow them as they progressed through the story. If knights in shining armor, castles, and mysticism fascinate you, this is the book for you. The Sword in the Stone is the most well known re-creation of Medieval England for young adults. It is a classic story that has been enjoyed by many generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many, many more."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"The Once and Future King\\" is a delightful series of stories, but this is by far the superior, and first off the rank. It is the story of Wart, a hapless orphan boy, and his adventures once his new tutor Merlin arrives on the scene (some of you may be aware of the Walt Disney animated movie of the same name).This is real adventure stuff and is appealing to both young readers and grown ups alike. Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously. This is just plain good fun and well written too. Enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"&quot;The sword in the stone&quot;I would definitely recommend T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; to anyone faintly interested in The Dark Ages or The Arthurian legends, althought I think someone between the ages 12-25 would appreciate the book more. I say this because I don't think a young child or an adult would enjoy reading, or care for T.H. White's ideas on the simple subjects about some of the parts of everyday life that aren't usually thought about out loud. Some other people I know who are reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; think it is boring, but I think you just need to be in a reading mood to comprehend what you've read so you may enjoy this exquisite book.This is the first time I have absorbed any of the Arthurian legends. In my history classes studying The Dark Ages we never really spent any time on the legends or similiar thoughts about that time, because we were pressed for time. So, now, since I liked T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much, I have a good impression on all the legends about this mysterious era.Don't be fooled if you have seen the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; It has the same general plot, but the book is mucher better (like most movies that come from a novel). The book is not just directed toawrds the taste of children, and there is much more of the story that the movie didn't present to it's audience.&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is a particular tale about King Arthur of England as a young boy. He is not the king in this story, though. Young Arthur has the nickname Wart(not as a mean gesture, but because it rhymes with Art, which is short for Arthur). This legend tells about the Wart, with his wizard tutor, Merlyn, who turns the Wart into animals to teach him about life lessons. He learns a lot from the animals he converses with. He learns things about the history of the world, the theory of life and education, courage, and respect for all types of living creatures. I think that it is quite interesting what these animals tell him. The Wart also teams up with Robin Wood (probably kwown to you as Robin Hood) and his clan and has an adventure that helped make him valiant. This lessons will help him become a magnificent king.I have always enojoyed historical fiction by authors like John Steinbeck and James Mitchner. I consider this book more of a historical fiction than a legend. I say this because during the story, it tells many historical facts about The Dark Ages, an era that I am not too familiar with. What I mean by historical facts, are not dates or names of battles and wars, or anything along those lines, but of such things that were part of the everyday life back in those days. Such things like castle structures and purposes, archery and jousting techniques, and all sorts of similar parts of their life. Mr White's reseach about this time has paid off greatly. His novel seems very complete because of the wonderful correct details about all aspects involved in the Wart's life.I love how T.H. White tries to explain the simple things that just happen without any thought involved. He explains things like how a human would fly like a bird, swim like a fish, or slither like a snake. The Wart doesn't have the instinct to do any of these tasks, so Merlyn teaches him. Someone would think it would be easy to fly, because the birds make it look easy, but I bet it would be very hard and weird. To the animals the skill comes naturally, and without thought, but it wouldn't come easily at all to a human being.Mr. White also tells the reader his theories on how some things came to be. For example he tells why all embryos look alike with their feeble hands and heavy, large heads. It doesn't matter if they are going to become a tadpole, an elephant, a peacock, or a human; they all are identical. He says that God told the embryos (in the 5-6 day of creation) to choose their specialties, and when alive they all would transform into that thing. I enjoy seeing these types of theories, true or not, about all sorts of the little and big things in life.If any of the ideas I have put across seems of interest of you, I recommend &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In The Sword in the Stone by Terence Hanbury White, fantasy and adventure are woven together to create a picturesque and suspenseful story set in Medieval England. The Sword in the Stone recreates the life of young King Arthur as he is taught how to be a gentleman by Merlyn, the powerful but absent-minded magician who lives life backwards. Young Arthur, who is commonly know as the &quot;Wart,&quot; finds himself entwined in many adventures, such as being magically transformed into a fish, a hawk, and a badger. He also meets the likes of Robin Wood, Maid Marian, and Little John on a dangerous adventure he goes on with Kay, his brother. All of the adventures he experiences in the book are part of his training. Merlyn wants him to view life from all different perspectives so that he will be prepared to become the king of England.While Arthur's older brother Kay is preparing for knighthood, it is discovered that King Uther Pendragon, the ruler of England, has died. There is word that there is a sword stuck in a stone which bears an inscription saying that whoever pulls out the sword is the &quot;rightwise king born of all England.&quot; Arthur stumbles upon this, not knowing it is the sword, and manages to pull it out, using everything Merlyn taught him.Merlyn is the key to The Sword in the Stone. If you removed his character from the book, you wouldn't have a story anymore; just a vague picture of a boy named Arthur. Merlyn personifies both humor and wisdom. The fact that he lives life backwards instead of forwards- knowing what will happen next as opposed to knowing about the past- makes him all the more important in this novel. He already knows in advance what the future holds for Arthur, and his training of the boy is really to prepare him for ruling England.Although The Sword in the Stone centers around a young boy's coming-of-age and story elements normally considered juvenile, this novel would be more appreciated by a mature audience, due to the wordiness. Those interested in Arthurian legend will love this book's twists on tradition. The novel starts at a crawl and then suddenly picks up pace, hurling one adventure after another at the reader. This sudden change is difficult to adjust to at first, but slowly you see that it is all part of T.H. White's genius. Arthur's life progressed in this same way, beginning slowly and then picking up speed, as he became tangled in Merlyn's world of magic and whimsy.I found The Sword in the Stone to be quite an engaging book once I got past all the fancy vocabulary and focused on the story. I admire how T.H. White took a historical legend and incorporated so many humorous fables. He was obviously a well-educated man who had a deep passion for Arthurian legend. The novel held some personal meaning for me, since I can relate to Arthur's never-ending need for knowledge, intellect and maturity.Give T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone a try. If you cannot swallow a mixture of imagination, satire and realism all in once shot, you might not want to attempt it. If you do happen to enjoy it, though, I promise you will want to read it repeatedly over time."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is the first part of The Once and Future King pentalogy (followed by The Witch in the Wood, The Ill-Made Knight, The Candle in the Wind and The Book of Merlyn).The Wart is a young orphan boy who lives in the castle of Sir Ector, his foster father.

It had a plot line that was uneventful and I lost interest constantly. The book had a good idea behind it but the final result was rushed and in need of detail. The book started out nice and slow describing life in the middle ages but as the middle to the end comes along, the best parts seem to leave as fast as they come. Wart, the main character, was seemed to be too childish for his age and his upbringing. He is constantly making choices that cause the book to loose its charm and originality. Merlin has a certain appeal to him and does not and is not getting the attention and time he disserves. Through out the plot line there was description (a little bit here a little bit there) and they were very good. But you can't make a good book on a couple of good parts. The middle ages theme was great and I thought it gave it some spunk, The author tells mindlessly of every thing of a young boys life in the middle ages. During the book there was some parts that were not rushed -and almost dragged out- but otherwise were not in enough detail for you to get the picture and understand it fully. In conclusion I think that The Sword in the Stone had the right though but was too rushed to its point across."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one.

I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously).

He does what he can to make himself fit in (sort of)--he doesn't apply himself or do his school work, and is able to give quick come-backs. He's been a loner for most of his life.This is another story where readers are thrust behind the scenes of a \\"misfit.\\" We see how Kirk is bullied by the burnouts (and I would guess others as well), thus he doesn't do his homework or write his essays properly so as to hide his brains. We discover that part of Kirk's problem is that his mother is an alcoholic, and has decided to move to California with her boss, wanting Kirk to join them so they can be a family (Kirk's father left when he was a baby). Kirk is against this and refuses to leave his hometown.He refuses to leave because things in his life begin to look up--he is befriended by one of the burnouts, gets a girlfriend, and starts a new job reading to a blind woman that pays more money than the library job he had. He also dislikes the man his mother ends up marrying. I enjoyed this book--the characters are real (especially Kirk--we see his growth as he branches out), there are a lot of literary references (which was fun), and it was a fast read (kept me interested). The kids do swear (strongly) in the book. Kirk and his girlfriend have sex. There is violence. But none of it is gratuitous, and Moore isn't striving to be offensive with his writing.

However, when I saw this book, my curiosity was piqued. I checked it out and went on my way.I started reading during the ride home, and I was hooked. I simply could not put this book down. I read from dismissal to about 11:30 pm. When I finished, I was amazed how good it was. I loved every page of it.It has definitely become one of my most cherished books of all time.I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique and touching story."},{"Title":"Blind Sighted","review":"This book shows a reality-close look on a teenager's life today. I ought to know because I am a teen. (13) While reading this book I found that I wanted to finish it just to see the outcome. It tells a great story of a boy and the conflict in his school and home life. As I was reading this book, I told my friends about it and teachers also---although I left out a couple of details like the cussing, and although it's not very descriptive, the SEX. I had 3 teachers read it and 1 out of the 3 liked it---but I'm guessing the other 2 don't like cussing and sex in books. Although the one that DID like it REALLY liked it. She said it's one of the best books she has ever read like it. Hope this review helps lots.---By the way teachers, if you're thinking of reading this to your class, DON'T. Although it IS a great book, stuff like this should not be read in classrooms unless you think your class can HANDLE IT! Anyways I still thought it was a good, shocking book for people my age though."},{"Title":"Blind Sighted","review":"What a great book!

This novel however moves right along is suspenseful and as the author himself notes it has the benefit of being short. It is a very fun read."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"Prior to reading this, A Rogue's Life, I had only read the most obvious and popular works by Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White and The Moonstone. Of course, I loved those books - so when I saw A Rogue's Life at my local bookstore, I picked it up. I was attracted by the description on the inside cover of the narrator, who has failed at a variety of pursuits and become 'disenchanted with life.' Perhaps I, at times, think of myself as a bit of a rogue, so upon reading the description I immediately purchased the book.This book is delightful. Wilkie Collins is all about sensation and entertainment - and his is a great writer to boot! However, the book description got it wrong. The narrator is never 'disenchanted with life.' Despite his many setbacks, he always approaches life with optimism. In fact, in the foreword, Collins mentions the tone of 'boisterious gaiety' that pervades the work, attributing it to the grand life he was leading at the time in Paris. As a result, this short novel is filled with humor and adventure, and surfs along on a tide of good cheer. Add in the fact that it was serialized, and you get those wonderful cliffhanger chapter endings that just keep you reading!"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"I just laughed and rejoiced in this short tale of intrigue of the protagonist Frank Softly. And what a rogue he is, indeed, and ever more likely to gain a place in a confidence game of the worst sort, confeiting, no less. What fun to venture across England and into Wales and Scotland with this upper middle class scoundrel and hear his adventures &quot;in his own words&quot;. Sort of made me think of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones character, and some the the delicious characters of Dickens' own creations as well. I am currently immersed in catching up on my Wilkie Collins' reads and highly recommend that other readers do the same."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"Frank Softly is introduced to a range of professions by a father hoping he'll make a fortune - but Frank finds work a challenge and by age 25 he has many failed careers to his name. He's lost and wandering - until he meets one Alicia and her rich father. An entertaining story of personal transformation emerges in a pick especially recommended for college-level literary holdings already containing his better-known novels, who want to add depth to their treatment of Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"A Rogue's LifeFrank has had many different positions, and has quite a sense of humor about him. He has gone to debtor's prison and survived it all. Upon soliciting people for a ball, he comes upon a young lady that he has seen previously and her father. The father is mysterious, no one knowing what is in the upper rooms of his other home. Frank, our rogue, decides to take up the father on a visit and becomes friendly with father and daughter. Frank decides to propose to the daughter, only she cries and doesn't accept, saying nothing instead. Frank decides to break into the upper rooms, to find out why. What happens from there, you will have to read the book and find out! You won't be sorry I promise. Lots of travel, hiding and a bit of love, sure to please every reader.This book held me captive for today. I devoured it all and wished it didn't have to end. Mr. Collins writes with such ease that you can't help yourself. I look forward to reading The Woman in White --"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"I've been on a Wilkie Collins kick ever since reading The Moonstone a few years ago, and I've read several of his other works (No Name, Armadale, The Woman in White, The Dead Secret) since and enjoyed all of them immensely. What Collins is able to do in many of his novels is bring the reader into the action, engage them, and keep them guessing at the outcome. He uses plot twists, secrets, odd events, mystery, entertaining, fun characters and a good deal of wit to give a reader hours of entertainment. It is usually not a chore at all to read a Wilkie Collins book because it has such a freshness to it.I preface this by stating these opinions mainly because A Rogue's Life was less enjoyable than the likes of No Name, The Woman in White, The Moonstone and others because it was lacking in several areas. It seemed to lack the intrigue factor characteristic of Collins' mysteries, as it was more of a comical perspective of one man's adventures. In addition, there is an indication that there will be a coming of age of sorts of Frank Softly, but his learning experience is minimal, only being based on what benefits him. He goes from job to job without much luck and is a jerk to his family, although there are some imaginatively funny episodes as he fails. I waited for a little bit of a turnabout from the main character, but Softly is never really learns much, even though he has a sharp tongue, great wit, and is entertaining. He discusses being schooled on the finer points of life by fellow prison inmate Gentleman Jones, but never really acts on this advice. Often a certain rooting point for a character exists when you read, but this wasn't so for the main character here. He remains a scoundrel throughout, despite a somewhat contrived turn of character. So, the book was more of a narrative on his adventures and nothing more, Softly mostly a flat character throughout. Also, the main conflict-- Frank's getting caught up in an illegal coining operation--seemed too conveniently dropped in so we could sympathize with him. Moreover, the ending was a little too pact and tidy to the narrator's advantage.Still, A Rogue's Life has a certain measure of charm in many spots and is quite funny at times. Reading the exploits of a man who finds interesting ways to mess up things has an entertaining value mainly because Softly doesn't seem to give a hoot with his roguish attitude. Also, as usual, Collins ends with a rash of clever plot events as a cat and mouse game ensues between Softly and those hunting him down.In total, though, A Rogue's Life is an average reading experience that didn't make me want to relish or remember the novel. I would still recommend A Rogue's Life simply because it is Wilkie Collins, and his writing is superb, even if this one was substandard. (And, it appears that most would read and like this novel based on the other reviews; I guess it just didn't work for me).However, if you want to truly experience a great Collins novel, I recommend any of the big four (No Name, Armadale, The Woman in White, The Moonstone) over A Rogue's Life.3 stars"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"Wilkie Collins is one of the great underappreciated writers. His books have an immediacy and subtlety that seems fresh even today, even though his plots sometimes creak -- for example, see his novel \\"Armadale.\\" As with Trollope, he had a very keen insight into human motivation and emotion, and is adept at descriptive writing. This little novel doesn't rise to that level, but is great fun, nonetheless. Frank Softly is somewhat of a nineteenth century Harry Flashman -- unapologetic regarding his knavery, but with his own code of honor and a fine sense of the ridiculous. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"Since it was written in 1856 it's far ahead of it's time. It's a simple, humurous, tale of the misadventures of one man. He carries on like he could be a distant relative of Don Quixote. It keeps you entertained and if nothing else, when all is said and done, will bring a smile to your face."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"This is not the best of Wilkie Collins work, not on the level of The Lady In White, for instance. However, if you like Collins, this is a more lighthearted, sardonic tale of a rogue and how he did everything wrong, but ended up all right. It made me laugh in places, and it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"After being blown away by \\"The Woman in White\\", I decided to check out a shorter Wilkie Collins book following the misadventures of a rogue. The book just never grabbed me. I enjoyed the rogue's sense of humor, but never got invested in the character. He aimlessly wanders from one minor misdeed to the next. The book culminates in what's supposed to be a suspenseful plotline, which for me just fell flat."},{"Title":"A Rogue's Life: From His Birth to His Marriage","review":"This is a review of the free Kindle version.A Rogue's Life comes in at just under 1,800 locations.It's interesting reading Wilkie Collins's views on the work 20 years after writing it. His melancholy thoughts of his dead friends definitely grabs you.The rogue is an interesting sort, making his living with as little work as is possible. It's not too shocking that he ends up in some criminal activities. This definitely falls in the classic sensation category.The ending is pretty remarkable - I definitely chuckled about how and who the rogue ends up working for.The story is marred by some casual anti-Semitism, not that unusual for the time."},{"Title":"The Family Herbal: A Guide to Natural Health Care for Yourself and Your Children from Europe's Leading Herbalists","review":"While I was upset they decided to remove comfrey - and announced this fast at the beginning - due to controversy, and replaced it instead with an herb that they said was \\"more mainstream and with more studies behind it\\", The Family Herbal is a great herbal for anyone interested in alternative healing.The first large bonus it has going for it is Chapter 8, which deals primarily with the famous formula Swedenbitters, giving tribute to Maria Treben for bringing its attention to the world again. Not very many books mention this combination enough, so it's always a delight to find one that does. They discuss it in detail and their successes with it, as well as instructions for a Swedenbitters poultice (accompanied with pictures.) Great stuff.The Cleansing and fasting chapter is informative as well, detailing several herbs they prefer for cleansing (such as Stinging Nettle), giving various recipes and skin advise.The rest of the book focuses on chapters broken into various body systems.Each chapter details various herbs best suited to the ailments, as well as formulas they prefer, and why.While not huge in length, it's clear these two truly have experience and are not just 'experts', something that endears me to this book more than anything else. Reading an herbal created from two that firmly believe in nature and God's healing power, who believe in what they're saying, who aren't just quoting but are telling their experiences and sharing remedies they've used, shared, and sold for years is priceless.An underrated book to have, the glossy pages make it an even more enjoyable pleasure to read. (Along with the detailed, color pictures of various plants and procedures)"},{"Title":"Dion Fortune's the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage","review":"As with most of Dion Fortune's works (said only because I haven't yet read them all), this piece is indispensable for anyone wanting to understand the world around them. Yes, it is about marriage -- and not only on the physical plane; that is what makes it so potent, because Fortune shows why natural marriages are as they are FROM SPIRITUAL CAUSES. But because all of creation is built up from this basic marriage of two divine halves, the book offers much to consider in contemplating any subject.The nice thing here, too, is that despite the depths that Fortune can reach in certain works, she tries to keep this one simple enough for even beginning readers. By the end she may really be pushing them ... but by then, they've been well prepared.This is a must-have for any student of the esoteric."},{"Title":"Dion Fortune's the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage","review":"This book goes into depth I've never seen anywhere else. Dion discusses the chakras, and how a couple relates on all the levels. For example, the root chakra is a magnetic connection, the heart chakra love...well that much is obvious, but an explanation is given of how a busy executive might have a strong intellectual relationship with a business associate, be able to discuss intellectual topics with her that he can't discuss with his wife, so on the level of intellect that is essentially a connection, just as if he had sex with her it would be a connection, but on a different chakra level. The goal being, to be compatibly mated so that you connect on ALL the chakras with your partner. POWERFUL STUFF! I think this book, along with The Shared Heart by Barry & Joyce Vissell, should be given as wedding gifts to every couple! They just might save a few marriages!"},{"Title":"Dion Fortune's the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage","review":"If your not the type of person who generally agrees with esoteric/occultic thought, then you may take issue with some of what is presented in this book... but, then again, if you already have qualms with esoterica, why are you reading anything by Dion Fortune?A lot of what is written in this book - I feel - must be taken in conjunction with the perspective of the author: the time period, where she comes from, and her status within that society. For example, I would question her opinion on homosexuality (even though I'm not a homosexual), given the pluralistic values of our current culture in comparison to the values of her time. None-the-less, she makes an excellent argument for her position: each chapter gradually building upon the previous chapters successively until the breadth of material becomes clear. Questions I had in the beginning and middle of the book were addressed in later chapters, leaving no holes by the conclusion.I would, though, especially recommend that the reader take their time on the chapter regarding the 7 planes. Having those clear in your mind will make the rest of the book much easier to comprehend.Otherwise, I agree with the other reviewers. I thoroughly appreciated how this book made a consideration of the energetic principles involved in how human being relate to one another (as opposed to providing a \\"thou shalt/shalt not\\" list of behavior based on some doctrine that doesn't explain the WHY of the preference/avoidance). This is one of those books which, personality being accepting to a different perspective, all youths should read as a \\"coming of age\\" into their adulthood (and the sexual liberty that comes with it). It would aid to dodge a lot of unhealthy relationships.I only gave this book 4 stars based upon my ability to test its veracity against an internal sympathy/harmony. (I would have been very happy to give it a 4.5 if that were an option). Yet, this may be simply a symptom of a lack of understanding, experience and/or ability to comprehend on my part.In any case, it's a relatively inexpensive book and a quick read (my wife and I read it together in the course of an afternoon), so there's really nothing to lose by purchasing & reading this book."},{"Title":"Dion Fortune's the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage","review":"If you are looking for new depth of understanding of your relationship with your spouse or life partner this book offers insights like no other. Dions lifelong practice of qabalistic magic and other esoteric practice gave her a thorough grounding in the true nature of love and - yes - sex.For a woman of her generation she examined the depth of sexual relations, marriage and deep friendship with clarity that few have ever managed. While she uses careful language (how could she not!) one is never in doubt of her meaning.I have found great value in all of Dions work. She is able to produce mental \\"software\\" that with practice enables us to create a framework within our own minds that reaches out to our subconscious and higher consciousness in ways that only the greatest teachers have been able to provide.She is truly gifted - and this work on the philosophy of the the sexes is one of her best."},{"Title":"Dion Fortune's the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage","review":"I think that the topics reviewed here should be included as part of the spiritual education for all the people, no matter what religion they practice.

First off, this is a book with both knitting WITH beads and beaded knitting (The former is knit fabric embellished with knit-in beads, the latter is fabric OF beads, with thread holding them into the mesh. No yarn showing.) Most of the projects are knitting with beads or even sewing them on, but Chapter Five is all beaded knitting. Some space is devoted to embellishing with sewn-on beads.The projects are varied--something for everyone from jewelry and bags to socks to sweaters. There are many pages devoted to different techniques--so despite a good selection of patterns, this book encourages the knitter or crocheter to go out on their own.A selection of projects:1. A plum colored crocheted beaded vest. VERY impressive.2. Several beaded scarves3. A &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; collar in champagne color, almost Victorian looking.4. Quite a few bags including some totes, some evening bags and an amulet bag in beaded knitting.5. Pullovers--cabled with beads, and a faux-textured knit with beads replacing the texture stitches (hard to explain, but it's very graphic looking and interesting.) A linen African-looking vest in neutral shades with oblong beades.6. Socks, hats7. Two Forties-looking short sleeve blouses with beads8. A wide-collared paillette (big flat sequin) top that looks like the wide off-the-shoulder styles out now, but harks back to the Fifties. This is crocheted.I think Lily has outdone herself here.

I put myself in the place of a person who knows nothing about beads. I was impressed. I can't wait to get started on some of the projects. One thing readers might want to take note of, when using glass or seed beads make sure the beads are from japan. The holes are bigger and more uniform. Czech beads or beads from the Czech republic are irregular and may not go through the yarn. Their are two types of beads I recommend, Toho's and Miyuiki's.

She references knitting with crochet cotton thread, so I have no idea why this was excluded.o - A great deal of emphasis was given to using a beading needle. It is possible to thread beads onto your yarn or thread without using one, and in the case of 10/1 seed beads and size 10 thread, you cannot USE a beading needle, you have to find a different way (such as stiffening the thread with glue and using the end of the thread as the needle).o - The different techniques should have been shown side by side.This is, nonetheless, an invaluable reference for anyone looking to embellish their work with beads."},{"Title":"Knit and Crochet with Beads","review":"I had great hopes that crochet would have equal parts of knit and crochet and boy was I wrong.

One very nice feature of _The New Our Bodies, Ourselves_ is that each chapter ends with a listing of resources. If, in reading a chapter, you find something on which you would like more information, several sources will be listed at the end of the chapter.

It's a disgrace. They show women naked who don't look like fashion models but could be just you or me. They write as if it's a good idea for women to be healthy in mind as well as in body. As if this wasn't enough, they go on to suggest that the quality of health care has anything to do with the medical establishment, that women should actually be informed correctly of the risks of medical procedures and alternatives available and, lo and behold, make the choice themselves, that the medical establishment is often not a wonderful haven for women who are poor or outside the cultural mainstream, as in for example when they are members of minority groups, that a woman's sex life and relationships may be influenced by power structures in the society she lives in, and other such far-fetched stuff. In reality, we all know that all women have 28-day periods, get menopausal at 48, are all heterossexual, are all white (most other books agree at least on this one point), are all fairly pretty, all get married, all want children, and that health has nothing to do with anything else in the world out there. No wonder one reader complained that this book, supposed to be about health, is also political. A disgrace indeed."},{"Title":"The New Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book By and For Women","review":"The previous edition of this book came highly recommended to me as highly informative about the many health issues facing women - the physical problems/changes women of all ages might expect to face, their symptoms and treatments. Instead, social and political essays on such topics as sexism, harassment in the workplace, lesbianism, the politics of women's health and medical care, racism and the environment, etc. have crowded out many of the subjects and the information that I, and probably most women, are seeking in a book purportedly about women's health. While political and social matters like those raised in the book are certainly valid and of interest to many, they don't belong in a book that should be dealing with women's health issues. The title itself is very misleading, and I was extremely disappointed in the book. Because of the inadequate coverage of facts and information in this edition, I am searching for another book that will provide the answers to the! many questions that were not answered by Our Bodies, Ourselves."},{"Title":"4 Book SET Animal Sound Books, Jungle Rrrumble, Monkey Too!, Dribble Wibble, Where Is Frog?","review":"Bought these books for my son and he loves roaring like the Tiger, or ribbitting like the Frog. Not so sure about the \\"Dribble Wibble\\" sound, but he also grabs the monkey book and makes the monkey noise.These books can easily fall apart in a daycare setting, and the noise maker becomes a hazard, but in a single child home - it's perfect! Almost a year later and no permanent damage done!"},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"Mountain Flying Bible is not intended to teach you how to fly, but rather all of the things you will learn *after* you get your private pilot certificate. Think of it as an opportunity to leverage Sparky (his real name) Imeson's &gt;10000 hours of experience flying small planes in the mountains. (And if that isn't enough qualification, Imeson's won the Northwest CFI of the year three times.) For flatlanders, when you see &quot;mountain,&quot; substitute &quot;extremes,&quot; because this is really what you'll get: flying the airplane at the corner of the performance envelope.This is a terrific book because it's laid out in five sections representing the phases of flight: preflight, takeoff, en route, arrival and landings. Each section is divided further into logical subcategories of things one needs to know during that phase of flight.Each page is chock full of information and there are hundreds of &quot;rules of thumb.&quot; Also supplementing the text are some excellent photographs providing a visual picture often missing in other texts. For example, the En Route section shows you how difficult power lines across canyons are to see. Coming straight at it, you *can't* see the lines, but when you're right over them, you can.The arrival and landing section shows how unusual some fo the runways can look. Included are sight pictures of Big Creek and Indian Creek(ID), Aspen, Mt Blackburn (one of my favorites in Alaska), and &quot;Gros Ventre International&quot; near Jackson, Wyoming. These pictures show the extremes, including extremely high altitudes, gravel, crooked strips, runways with varying slope, and very short fields.You'll come away with new information each time you read the book."},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"When a flight instructor recommended this book to me, I thought, \\"I really don't plan on flying over any mountains or into canyons anytime soon.\\" As it turned out, the book contained a wealth of great information on a variety of flying topics. Just the chapters on landings and emergency procedures were worth the price of the book. Imeson knows his stuff, and he has a knack for explaining that stuff very clearly."},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"Being a relatively new pilot ( 200 hours) I purchased this book to gain some insight into flying from my home base in coastal NC to the mountains of NC. I was greatly surprised that the text not only covered that subject in a very through manner but covered general aviation information just as well. I am preparing for my Instrument Rating and questions left un-answered by several Instrument Rating study guides were answered in a clear and concise manner, an unanticipated bonus.For the new pilot,as well as those seeking information on mountain flying, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"A great book for any pilot who flies in the mountains. Covers things in detail with excellent illustrations and photographs. I was lucky enough to take some lessons from Sparky years ago when he was still alive. I highly recommend his book."},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"This book had the flying I was looking for. The maneuvers, type of flying, and style are \\"bold\\" in comparison to a lot of other literature about flying. And strangely enough, it's presented with all the tips, tricks and techniques to help you fly as safe as possible. Some of the flying in this book may be a little advanced for the reader (Some was beyond my capability right now), but there is a wide range to which the reader can relate -- where the reader was in his flying during the early years, where he/she is right now in terms of ability, and what he/she may be capable of in the future. All presented in a format structured with safety and good flying practices (RULES OF THUMB - once you read, you'll get it) keep you on the safe side of this unforgiving environment.Some reading is repetitive, but there's a reason - the important rules of thumb will be burned into your subconscious.Some of it probably more technical than you desire at times.But all in all, a great read you will find yourself picking up before you go out flying to try some techniques, or sitting at your computer figuring out the hows and whys of the mountains, and which place you'll want to fly next.-J"},{"Title":"Mountain Flying Bible","review":"Excellent resource that has been revised and updated.

Story about a playwrite who becomes obsessed with deep sea diving and the bond he forges with diving instructor at the expense of his wife and friends. His wife is a former call girl who wants to make herself a better life as she tries to change him from wild playboy to respectable husband. The guilt of a past relationship with another female character in the book haunts him. I couldnt put the book down as with all the James Jones books I have read. Not as good as From here to eternity but well worth the read. I would put James Jones as the class of Post WWII American authors."},{"Title":"Go to the Widowmaker","review":"I have read this book twice. Now, when I have noticed that it was to be released for Kindle I've pre-ordered it immediately and I've already get caught into it. It is a truly masterpiece, though one overelooked throughout the years. It's been ages since last printed edition has been released and the Kindle edition is indeed a great news.Basically it's a novel dealing with the eternal war of sexes. Here, set against the wanton atmosphere of 50's New York and rakish, alcohol driven Carribean hippy resorts, Jones unleashes his epic love- affair interlaced with diving, adultery and sheer life. It is a gripping story, without any cliches, easy choices and comforting implications.All in all, one of the most powerfull novels ever written."},{"Title":"Go to the Widowmaker","review":"This is the third in a loosely related trilogy that began with \\"From Here to Eternity\\", about the pre WW2 army in Hawaii, continued with \\"The Thin Red Line\\" based on the authors combat experieneces in the war, and now this, the soldier home in the post war period. Jones leading characters seem to do better in the army where they seem to have a love/hate relationship with the structure and authority of military life. They hate it, but it seems to give life meaning. Now discharged, Jones protagonist is a renown playwright who deals with a relationship and, in Hemingway-esque fashion, becomes a skin diver in some sort of search for courage, or lack thereof.This is a re-read for me, having first encountered Jones in the 60's when I read all of his works. I was disappointed this time, as I remember this as an engaging piece. It seems to me that Jones needs war or at least the miliatry, and without it he, and his character go adrift.I must go back to his earlier books, as much in \\"Widowmaker\\" seems to harken back to them. I would recommend leaving this one for last and start with \\"Eternity.\\" I can't help comparing Jones with Mailer, and \\"Eternity\\" with \\"Naked and the Dead.\\" Mailer wrote a number of great novels and garnered at least one Pulitzer after his huge success with \\"Naked,\\" but in my estimation was never able to capture what he did in depicting a group of young Americans in war. I feel Jones followed a similar path."},{"Title":"Go to the Widowmaker","review":"You know you are reading a great book when you wish it would not end. James Jones books are like that and this is no exception. His characters are well developed and very human. While I was reading this during a cold Tennessee fall, I felt like I was in the warm waters of Jamaica thanks to Mr. Jones. While there is a lot of sex in this book it fits with the plot. A wonderful book. Read it and all of Mr. Jones' books. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Go to the Widowmaker","review":"This is indeed a great read. As a long time scuba diver his descriptions of underwater experiences are nothing short of GREAT. A non diver could read this and know exactly what it is like. I greatly enjoyed the book - to a point. I won't spoil it for you but there came a point where I quit reading it. I had a great liking for the main character and I did not like what I knew was about to happen. This was at a time when my best friend had gone into hospice and would soon die. I did not need the big downer of what I saw happening in the book and that at the same time. I will go back and finish the book eventually. It is a great read and I recommend it to anyone.One caution: there is a very definite adult theme in this book."},{"Title":"Go to the Widowmaker","review":"I read this book 40 years ago-I loved it then & I loved it even more when I reread it (e version) last week.\\"As close to an autobiography as I will ever write\\"-do not make the mistake of looking for From Here to Eternity, etc. This is the fantastic love story of Jones & his wife Gloria. The book takes place in NY & Jamaica & is a breathtakingly beautiful tutorial on scuba diving-my husband & I both got certified 6 months after I read the book.

There's a lot to gain from reading this - the Golden State is filled with horrors underneath the glistening surface. It's a state that's really mis-interpreted due to the current Hollywood obsession. There's a whole lot more to it than that and Gene O'Neill really acts as a kind of tour guide to a really scary situation.There's an earthquake that let's loose an ancient evil. The only thing that prevented the fifth star is that it feels like the first part of a longer novel. On the back cover it's listed that this will be novel length in the future as, \\"Lost Tribe\\" which I cannot wait to get more involved with these people and the evil - don't want to spoil it, but you'll enjoy it.

The length is its biggest problem, and I'm hoping that a full-sized novel will get us farther into the lives and motivations of these characters (as well as giving us a bunch more minor characters for said creature to gobble up); what we have here is outlines of characters and the occasional skeleton. It's enough to make me want more, but as it stands, it's not complete yet. If you look at this as a teaser for the hopefully-forthcoming novel-length version, it does its job quite well, but as a finished piece, it feels incomplete. ***"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Dreamweaver 4","review":"These visual books are awesome for beginners.

When I bought the book, I had a good grasp on how to use Microsoft FrontPage but wanted to learn a more sophisticated program. The book details everything I needed to know in order to build a professional site in Dreamweaver and provides picture tutorials for every step. It is the equivalent of taking a Dreamweaver class and watching the instructor go through all the different steps using a projected computer screen, but this is even better because you can go back and re-read things if they don't make sense at first (although that rarely happens).

Although Robert Royal may not appear to be so sure that Zionism was a great idea, he shows no doubt about the fact that terrorists who attack it need to be opposed.In this article, Royal explains that Israel was deliberately attacked by Hezbollah. And that \\"since negotiating-and peacemaking are self-indulgent delusions,\\" Hezbollah has to be disarmed or defeated.The other point that Royal makes is that one of the causes of Hezbollah's attacks was \\"the disastrous softness of Ariel Sharon.\\" After all, Sharon did pull Israeli civilians out of Gaza. That may have made sense in some respects: Israelis in Gaza were being attacked and were hard to defend. And the pullout from Gaza did win Sharon some admiration internationally. Unfortunately, as Royal says, it also brought more war, with Gaza becoming a base for rocket attacks on Israeli territory.As Royal warns us, \\"civilization is always compromised by present and past evils. Yet, if the civilized world cannot find it within its soul the courage to stand up to evildoers, despite the consciousness of its own flaws, evildoers will be quite happy to create another sort of civilization.\\" I agree.

Within a believable framework, it matches the thrust and parry of Jeremiah - speaking for the Homeworld vs. the head of security of the starship project. In addition, any adult reader will be stimulated to recall memories of their own childhood and the pains of growing up.I recommend it as both fun and time well spent."},{"Title":"The Quiet Pools","review":"First of all you have to care about at least some characters in a novel, and it was not clear how important Christopher McCutchen was till well into the story. I guessed the deeper connections to Chris , his father and the punchline, just a few chapters before it was revealed. The premise of genetic destiny was an interesting idea, that was treated too much as a mystery, instead of laying out the premises, and then letting the characterization refute and support the notion. The descriptions felt dated, (granted I read this in 2011). It was an unsatisfying read from many perspectives and was really difficult to get through. What made it worse was that Christopher who turned out to be the key character for many reasons, was about as annoying as you could possibly get. Self defeating, opening his mouth to switch his feet. His final decision was so ridiculous, it almost felt desperate and nothing off his personal problems had been solved to make him a healthier addition to the new community he suddenly joined.Sadly a lot of near term science fiction has this feel and pace. I gave it 2 stars because it held me for the last 100 pages or so, just when I was about to toss it out. Too much disjointed build up, and in the end, who cares!!

His characterizations have depth and honesty. Much of this novel is compelling and intriguing. Only occasionally does his writing style come off as overly verbose or inherently awkward.Unfortunately he forgot to tell a story. The Quiet Pools is little more than the build up to a sequel that was never written and quite probably never intended. One is forever waiting for this glorious Starship to set sail so that the characters Kube has so vividly painted can be challenged by the dangers of the cosmos and an adventurous undertaking.The entire book however, is just the build up BEFORE the ship launches. Perhaps I've missed the point.

Besides being a good primer for the field of artifict ethnography, it also offers a fascinating look at a culture into which most of us will never venture. But I have to say that the Newfoundland described in this book no longer exists as it did 30 years ago when the author's research was done. I was in Newfoundland this summer and actually made it a point to visit Calvert. Thanks to DirectTV and the Internet, villages like Calvert have lost a great deal of what made them distinctive &quot;places to belong.&quot; Don't get me wrong, the book is great, but just keep in mind that much of what it describes it no longer in the present tense.

He turns them all down, then feels thirsty. Only when a poor young boy offers him a drink of water does he show any gratitude. He holds his water cup with pride and joy, and cherishes it beyond all matter of treasure.Christopher Manson packed the pages with imagery. Most pages are crowded with pictures of numerous Persians, dressed in traditional garb, accompanied by their objects of art and craft. Drawn with brilliant detail, the illustrations convey a richly remembered (or imagined?) Persia of the past. Most hues are some variety of brown, gold, or earthtone, giving Artaxerxes' desert journey a realistic look.The story is predictable, but the quality retelling, illustrations, and lesson more than offset that shortcoming._A Gift for the King_ is a valuable addition to any library, home or otherwise.Ken32"},{"Title":"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision","review":"I have been studying cognitive neuroscience for a few years now, and because it is such a diverse field (and rapidly expanding), keeping up with all of the different sub-disciplines is a Herculean effort. Vision is probably one of the most established and complex disciplines in the cog neuro field, so it's helpful to find a book that aims to summarize it, and does so admirably well. It covers neuropsychology, psychophysics, neurobiology, and neuroimaging. Although this is by no means an authoritative volume (and perhaps could have used color plates for illustration), it serves as a good reference for non-vision scientists, beginning and intermediate students, as well as a refresher for those who may have forgotten some of the basics along the way."},{"Title":"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision","review":"This book provides a very thorough description of the many synergistic mechanisms involved with vision. While you are reading through this review right now, your brain is engaged in numerous streams and pathways of neural activity that allow you to follow and cognitively recognize and understand these words. \\"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision\\" describes how visual sensory input is analyzed by various visual systems to allow us to understand our environment. The book itself is not a light read. It is formatted like a textbook and is very rich in detail. In my opinion, this is a great book for those interested in how the brain analyzes the various aspects that come from visual sensory input. Farah tries to give a guided approach to visual cognition by describing the research that led to the discoveries of visual sensory analysis in the brain. Farah organizes the contents of the book in such a way that show the evolution and progression of the field of visual cognition. However, the main aspect of Farah's style that I dislike is that the figures associated with the text are not fully explained and are not juxtaposed alongside their appropriate text.The beginning of the book looks into the anatomy of the eye, specifically the retina. The story of vision is \\"with the retina as the starting point, and conscious awareness as the final destination.\\" Farah explains the retina to be a \\"duplex retina\\" and the role of the division of labor between the rods and cones. Farah structures the text by first describing components of the retina anatomically and then using research findings to explain the role of the components in vision. Afterwards, Farah gives in depth descriptions of other anatomical regions involved with vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex. The topic of local to global image representation is also dwelled upon. This entails how localized sensory input in the retina is globally analyzed and represented by different regions of the brain. Farah looks into how color perception and motion perception are aspects of vision that go from local to ultimately global representation. The hypothesis of two cortical vision systems necessary for this representation is addressed in that object recognition is an independent stream while object localization and attention are in another stream. Farah does a great job in reinforcing statements and ideas with actual researched evidence. Although much research is presented, Farah continuously acknowledges that there is much that science still has not yet deciphered about vision recognition. \\"The main problem of visual recognition is the problem of identifying a distal object using only the proximal 2-D image that arrives at the retina.\\" Even so, scientists have narrowed five criteria that they believe are useful in object recognition: accessibility, scope, uniqueness, stability, and sensitivity. The primary conclusion that research has shown with this complexity is that \\"visual recognition requires that memory be searched for a representation that resembles the current stimulus input.\\"I found the topic of face recognition very fascinating. According to scientists, humans are born to put special attention to faces rather than on other objects. \\"People are face experts...face recognition requires a finer grained, or subordinate-level classification; we recognize that this is not just a face, but John's face.\\" Farah goes into the neuropsychology and neurophysiology that pertains to face recognition in a highly detailed manner that highlights the major mechanisms proposed that allow this.The middle chapters look into word recognition and visual attention. The aspect of word recognition concerns highly specialized visual recognition systems. Farah takes a different approach and concentrates the text in describing the complexity of word recognition by using the disorder of pure alexia. Pure alexia is a condition of \\"impaired word recognition despite intact auditory word comprehension, intact ability to produce written language, and apparently intact recognition of visual patterns other than printed words.\\" Farah focuses on pure alexia by asking whether or not the brain contains a dedicated reading area and gives three hypotheses underlying possible answers. The three hypotheses are the visual-verbal disconnection hypothesis, the visual impairment hypothesis, and finally the orthography-specific impairment hypothesis.This was a great approach to take for Farah in describing word recognition. The use of a specific disorder like pure alexia and stemming researched ideas from it gives the reader a depth of understanding that challenges him or herself while also being interesting. Farah uses these diseases and disorders throughout this section to allow a greater grasp of the ideas she is presenting. By first giving description of these diseases and disorders and then following with specific research that try to find the origin of cause helps show how scientists approach deciphering the complexity associated with cognition. With vision attention, the mechanisms whereby some stimuli are selected for processing rather than others are emphasized. The main proposed reason for this is because there is limited brain processing capacity. Farah looks into these processing limitations as well as neural bases of attention.The concluding chapters focus on hemispatial neglect, mental imagery, and visual awareness. These chapters look more so into the role of consciousness in visual cognition. The disorder Neglect Syndrome is used to highlight the hemispatial neglect, which involves using one hemisphere of the brain for a certain task and ignoring the use of the other hemisphere altogether. This global point-of-view segues into mental imagery and visual awareness. The role of mental imagery is very connected with the visual systems. Mental imagery involves the streams of integrating and composing visualized objects, people, and scenes from a person's memory. The chapter on visual awareness then summarizes the role of the conscience in vision. With consciousness being an intangible aspect of the brain, its relationship with vision as well as with most cognitive activities is quite difficult to research. Farah concluding with this is a great ending in my opinion. Acknowledging that science does not answer every question highlights the complexity and fascination of the brain and its cognitive abilities.In essence, I do recommend this book. However, only to readers who have at least some background in neuroscience. Farah uses complex scientific terminology that she does not always describe aspects effectively. I believe that some of her choice of words can be highly simplified so readers can get a better understanding of her ideas. Farah entails much detail into the text, much like a textbook, but her diction can be simplified. I have a limited neuroscience background and had to look up certain terms that Farah used to fully understand the ideas presented. Another thing that I disliked was that Farah failed to mention any role that neuroplasticity may have in visual cognition. With neuroplasticity being hailed as a scientific breakthrough discovery, I think it would be appropriate to at least mention this in pioneering new ways to learn about visual cognition. Farah seems to emphasis the notion of localization of visual functions within specialized regions of the brain. This book, however, does a great job in describing the evolution of our understanding of visual cognition which may lead to newer and higher frontiers in cognitive science in general."},{"Title":"Short Stories of De Maupassant","review":"This is a compilation of short stories by Guy de Maupassant.

I love it! I recently started Weight Watchers and there isn't a single recipe in this book that is more than 7 points per serving. (That is better than the cookbook that I bought at Weight Watchers!) I have made four of the recipes so far and they have been fantastic. Some people may need to \\"tweek\\" some of the recipes to suit their tastes, (Crab cakes need a little garlic salt,etc.). But hey, I do that with all of my cookbooks anyway. Its really nice to have some choices when it comes to eating healthier! I intend to take a look at some of this author's other cookbooks"},{"Title":"Cooking Healthy Across America (A Healthy Exchanges Cookbook)","review":"The recipes in this book aren't terrible, but there are so many other &quot;healthy&quot; cookbooks out there that are far better and more original -- try any of Don Mauer's cookbooks, for example, or if you care about exchanges, I have a recent Weight Watchers cookbook that is far more interesting than this one. Moreover, I was disappointed that a cookbook with the word &quot;healthy&quot; in the title would include recipes that call for ingredients such as nutrasweet and diet Mountain Dew. And the fact that many of the recipes call for brand name ingredients without any explanation makes me suspcious, too. On the whole, this just isn't a cookbook I'm interested in coming back to, and it will not be getting a permanent spot on the shelf in my kitchen."},{"Title":"Cooking Healthy Across America (A Healthy Exchanges Cookbook)","review":"This book was a total disappointment. Several of Joanna Lund's books were recommended to me, so I thought this would be a sure winner. The recipes looked easy, straight forward and relatively appealing and healthy (aside from frequent use of artifical sweetners, including saccharin!). For Easter, I made several of the recipes and they were a complete and total disaster! The Key Lime Pie was so bitter, it was inedible (thankfully, my family has a good sense of humor). I would not recommend this book at all-- it is, by far-- one of the worst cookbooks I have ever purchased."},{"Title":"Cooking Healthy Across America (A Healthy Exchanges Cookbook)","review":"I'm absolutely shocked that this book received any bad reviews. I LOVE this book. It's my favorite of JoAnna Lund's and I love all her books and newsletters.I rarely ever have any of my family ever complain about any recipes of JoAnna Lund's. I will admit though I do spice and season to my families own taste, IE often adding garlic, or onion even if not in the ingredient list.As for desserts this book has some of the best. Every one loves the pineapple coconut bars, however I make it in a 8x8 dish instead of 9x9 they are more moist this way and I serve it more like cake. And the fruit pudding salads are heavenly!The recipes call for name brands because some ingredients off name brands are inferior, for instance instant milk can be down right inedible when you purchase off brands, you really do have to buy the name brand if you want the desired taste/texture outcome. Other times for instance with soda pop you probably could use other lemon lime sodas, but JoAnna's favorite soda was Mountain Dew, and again other soda's won't taste exactly like it, so if you want the exact flavor she was going for you should use the Mountain Dew, if you are ok with a variation on that flavor, it's totally fine to use the brand you like most. But, she was going for certain flavors and certain textures, and she had to give the name brands if you want to get the same end result she had. However, the previous reviewer would of realized this if they had taken the time to read the forward in the book, which explains exactly why name brand products were listed.I have a larger then average family, I've been cooking for upwards of 20 people (yes many children) and so far have been getting quite a few home runs out of this book. My family absolutely raves about the spaghetti-yes I add garlic and extra seasonings, but the base recipe is the same! They adore the green bean bake-just like the real green bean casserole! However, again I adjust to my families own taste, I omit the cheese and double the onions. All it takes is knowing your own families likes, these are good base start recipes. As JoAnna Lund again mentions in her forward to the book, make adjustments to your families taste. If your family doesn't like onions, don't use onions, if they love green beans, make the green bean recipes, etc. Tonight we'll be indulging in the tuna noodle casserole tonight! We love frozen peas, so I'll be adding a small amount and readjusting the exchanges and calories for such.As for this being a suitable book for diabetics, if you are a diabetic and not using this book you are missing the boat. Low \\"carb\\" is not good on diabetic kidneys. These recipes are based on the American Diabetic Association's diet! I am a type one diabetic, I've been using these recipes for years now, my A1C went from 11 to 4.9! I went from large amounts (over 150 units!) of insulin each day, to barely any-less then 10 units! To say this book is not for diabetics, is a very misinformed statement! I recommend it to all my diabetic friends and family."},{"Title":"Cooking Healthy Across America (A Healthy Exchanges Cookbook)","review":"I discovered Joanna Lund's cookbooks about two months ago quite by accident.

It's wonderful. Why did I not discover this author before now?As one reads the tale, one might think that this is the story of Selina Peake but it's titled after her son, Dirk, whom she called SoBig. What a delight! I invite anyone who has not discovered this author to pick up So Big or another of her several novels although So Big won the author a Pulitzer prize.This is a tale about a woman whose father was a gambler. When he was winning they lived well, when he was not they lived not so well. Her life changes dramatically when he is shot by accident for someone else. Selina is left with only her wits to survive. She does, marries a truck farmer and lives a life of hard work that she learns to enjoy. She has a son and names him Dirk. Her affectionate childhood name, SoBig, stays with them both whenever she shows her love.While Selina tells her son that there is so much more to life than money, Dirk chooses to strive for the good life embarking on a career to earn as much money as he can. Successful and known in Chicago for his success, he meets the delightfully interesting Dallas O'Meara with whom he falls in love. She is a talented and sought-after artist who plans to become a success through hard work and study. Dirk begins to wonder about the architectural career he left behind long ago. Has he made the wrong choices in his life?"},{"Title":"So Big","review":"This is one of Ferber's best books, and one of my favorites. A must for any reader over age 14!"},{"Title":"So Big","review":"\\"So Big,\\" won the Pulitzer Prize in 1924 and is considered by many to be Edna Ferber's best novel.The story follows Selina Peake DeJong whose father was a gambler and was killed by mistake.Selina was only nineteen at the time in 1888 and she surprises her friends in that she doesn't want to live with her two elderly aunts in Vermont. Instead, she shows her independence and determination to succeed on her own. She tries to maintain her dignity and gets a job as a teacher at the Dutch school in High Plains, ten miles outside of Chicago.At her first social event, she makes up a picnic basket that will be auctioned off. Men bid on the baskets and the winner gets to eat the food with the woman who prepared it.Selina's basket was daintly done. It was in a small box, tied with a ribbon.The auctioneer ridicules this small item but when the bidding begins, one farmer wins with an exhorbitant price. Pervus De Jong tells her that he felt badly when others were laughing. He admits he has no schooling so Selina agrees to teach him.During the lessons, Purvis receives book learning and Selina learns about farm life. They fall in love and marry.This enjoyable novel tells of the hardships of farming before the turn of the century when there were no tractors or automobiles to get their farm goods to markets.When Selina's son, Dirk, is born, she wants to make sure that he will grow up in a world of books and literature and have more from his life.An important literary work, when tragedy strikes, Selina is one of the early women who show that they can survive in a world where men usually run everything.With hard work and determination, we see improvements to farming and marketing begin and we watch Dirk growing. There is a well developed relationship with his mother and in the Chicago society.This is a well written novel in the realistic literary style that deserved winning the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"Finally, I pulled the little paperbook with yellow pages off the shelf and read it. My mother gave it to me decades ago. Enjoying it has been like having her back with me for a moment, saying, \\"See? I knew you would love it!\\" I did, Mom. And you were Selina DeJong, loving life, finding and creating beauty even when life was hard, inspiring your children to laugh, love, and live while keeping an eye out for people who may need a helping hand. And in the end, you were loved and admired, as was Selina, not for what you owned but for what you gave away - especially yourself.This book is more than a tribute to my mother's good taste; it is a delight to the soul. I rarely read novels, despising poor use of language or contrived dialogue. There is none of either in this work. Please enjoy it and pass it on to your daughter. My mom will probably smile when you do."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"In So Big Edna Ferber provides us with a fascinating insight into life in Chicago and the nearby prairies from the gay nineties through the roaring twenties. Ms Ferber brought her characters to life in such a way as to make them easily identifiable to twenty-first century readers. She wrote in the same times and of the same times as Willa Cather (the other female Pulitzer winning novelist from the prairies). Ferber's skills at characterization, however, make the people of her novels appear real enough to transcend the elapsed century.So Big is the story of a widow raising a young son on a small Illinois truck farm and the decisions they make and how their disparate choices impact the quality of their lives. Ms Ferber craftily sets characters into the tableaus of turn-of-the-century Chicago and the outlying Dutch farming community. She is so successful in painting her scenes that the authenticity of them is never in doubt. The reader (me) is thrilled to have such a detailed view of city and country life of these times."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"This book is easy to read, well-worded, and relevant. This often-overlooked American classic's protagonist, Selina, endures the roller coaster life of a gambler's child and later suffers as a hard-scrabble farmer's wife and then widow. Yet she prevails through hard work and unquenchable optimism. Chicago is a character in this novel, growing and changing through the years."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"So Big was made into a movie four times: 1924, 1930, 1932 and the 1953 version starred Jane Wyman. It was directed by Robert Wise who did many outstanding films including \\"Sound of Music.\\" I am a big Edna Ferber fan, am presently reading one of her collections of short stories--this one called \\"One Basket.\\" Every story is so good. Her writing is so good--can anyone explain to me why she is not more revered as an American author. Most of her books are love stories to America. Her autobiographies, especially the first one, are terrific. Her grandniece has also written a very interesting biography of Edna Ferber. I would love to correspond with another fan of Edna Ferber."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"This book is a great story and also very well written. The story about Selina Peake is touching if not inspirational. This book would be great for highschool book reports because of the strong themes and characters. I think the main story in the book is with Dirk Dejong Selina's son. Dirk starts of and goes to college and becomes an architect, but then drops that to sell bonds, simply for money. The book winds different plots together but in the end Dirk isn't happy, and other people who, well you could say &quot;followed the dreams&quot; (not so trite though) found happiness even though they might not have been rich. Wonderful book. One might wonder what Amazon.com is thinking about with their reading level of ages 4-8, the books not profane so a reader of 4-8 could read it, but the book is probably a little advanced for reader 4-8 I would say more like Highschool and on. If your looking for novels by Ferber try Giant or some of her plays. (her other big novel is Showboat, I'll just say the musical is better!)"},{"Title":"So Big","review":"All of Edna Ferber's novels (which are very hard to find!) are terrific.

Strong characters, strong themes, and an adamance against sentimental cliche raise it into a thought-provoking, ultimately triumphant story of pain, loss, struggle, and determination. Strangely enough, I vividly remember reading an excerpt (the basket auction scene) in high school literature. I always wanted to find the book it came from and read it, and now, quite by accident, I have."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"I don't think Edna Ferber gets nearly the attention she deserves these days. In fact, I'd say she's almost forgotten--which is a terrible shame! This book is powerfully vivid like any good work of fiction can be. It really draws you in so much that you grieve losing the characters at the end. And as someone who grow up in south suburb Chicago about a hundred years after the book's actions--it's interesting to know the Dutch heritage of the farmland that was so soon gobbled up and subdivided. I hadn't thought about it at the time, but my hometown has a Dutch name, and I grew up hearing Dutch surnames and not even realizing it. So few works of literature are set in my hometown area, so perhaps to me the book has an even more special connection. But you don't need it to enjoy it.I first read it twenty years ago in grade six. Still today sometimes I think \\"cabbages iz beautiful\\" and laugh."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"What a deceptive little book this started out to be. I kept wondering why Ms. Ferber got a Pulitzer for this. I was definitely enjoying reading about Selina, So Big's mom, but it was not until the very end of the book that I realized what a powerful message it was conveying. So Big sold out, Selina did not. Guess who was the more successful?"},{"Title":"So Big","review":"Without a doubt, _So Big_ is the best of all Edna Ferber's novels, and it was awarded the 1924 Pulitzer prize. It contains a strong portrayal of early 20th century midwestern agricultural life, which Ferber borrowed from her observations as a young women in Appleton, Wisconsin._So Big_ is the story of Dirk DeJong, and his mother Selina. After a colorful and tragic girlhood, she arrived as a schoolteacher in a Dutch farming community south of Chicago. She didn't quite fit in with the narrow-minded farmers and their overworked wives, yet she married a handsome farmer with notoriously unproductive land.After his early death, she spends the next decades finding a market and coaxing a crop to grow in soggy land. By the time Dirk grows up, the &quot;DeJong asparagus&quot; is a success, and it enables his banking career. Yet he loses a sense of empathy and beauty, which Selina retains, despite her difficult path in life.Ferber is the author who wrote _Show Boat_ and _Giant_. She could grind out popular dramatic fiction with loads of stock characters in a sentimentalized historic setting. But her later work loses the art found in _So Big_, which is peopled with multi-dimensional characters and a story which touches the reader's heart.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"I loved this book. I am currently reading through the Pulitzer Prize winning novels and this is one of my favorites to date! The story reminds one of who you want to be - one who is strong, principaled and loving. The main charachter is a woman who faces virtually every challange that life has to offer and who still remains an individual of hope and direction. I thought that the novel was inspiring. The prose and the themes were engaging and very readable. The book reminds us to push on an be the people that we know that we can be.A great inspiring book - read it."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"An interesting story of a woman's life and her struggle to raise her only son and teach him what is valuable in life. The Story is set in the late 1800 and early 1900's in rural and urban Chicago. The author called it &quot;a book about cabbages...&quot; but really, it's a story about Selina DeJong, orphaned as a young, wealthy child, who struggles to make a life for herself and her only child Dirk whom she has nicknamed &quot;sobig&quot;. She marries a dolt for a husband and begins to work on a farm. Her husband is a small man with a small brain and is afraid of his own shadow which limits and frustrates Selina and keeps her from accomplishing anything for many years. Fortunately, her husband suffers an accidental death and she is fianlly able to make some necessary improvements which allow her son (who otherwise would have been a cabbage farmer his whole life) to attend college in the city. He succeeds in college, but when he gets out he sacrifices his dream profession(architecture) to make a lot of money doing something boring in finance, and in doing so, he misses the point his mother tried to teach him about success. (i.e. that money doesn't equal it.) This is a really good book with a wonderful and inspiring ending. If the whole book had been as good as the last couple chapters, I would have given it five stars easily. Although &quot;So Big&quot; isn't a famous book, Edna Ferber made it big with most of her others... You may have heard of a couple of them... &quot;Giant&quot; from which the Rock Hudson, James Dean film was made, and &quot;Showboat&quot;, which was made into a sprawling musical. (My head aches just to think about it)."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"I read So Big literally decades ago, and the story has stuck with me through all that time.Selina DeJong's positive and hard working attitude is inspirational. Ferber does her justice in the end, when Selina achieves &quot;gravitas,&quot; the state of being satisfied with her life and wise in old age.Typically, her son doesn't appreciate what his mother has given him until his is older and can see her through his girlfriend's eyes. Suddenly she becomes clear to him as a heroine.This story even inspired me to each vegetables more! I can only hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"So Big","review":"In the early pages of So Big we learn that So Big is the nickname of Dirk DeJong, a young man who has long outgrown the childhood name from his mother, Selina. At this point I figure that the novel would be about the title character, but So Big is really about his mother Selina. Selina takes a job as smalltown schoolteacher in Illinois knowing that in two years she will be eligible to work in a city school and be better paid (the novel is set in the late 1800's). In High Prairie Selina finds out that she is nothing like the hardworking and hard lives of the farmers and farming families of the town. High Prairie is an education for her and when she surprisingly marries one of the farmers her life is ultimately linked to the town and the farming life, one which she never would have anticipated. She hopes, of course, for a better life for her son and struggles to do the best she can for him.So Big won the 1924 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and is a fine novel of argrarian literature. Edna Ferber does well in capturing the hard lives of the farmers without either idealizing their struggle nor demeaning their lives. Literature of this sort (such as A Thousand Acres, which also won the Pulitzer) is strangely appealing to me since I have no real ties to the farming life and have never worked on a farm, but when written well it comes across with great passion and compassion in a novel.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"So Big","review":"Most of my ancestors came to the area of \\"High Prairie in the 1800-1890's, of Dutch and German origin.

So John Keegan says in his introduction to this new edition of an established minor classic. The improbable combination of such disparate occupations has shaped his conception of ancient Greek warfare: he argues that the ritualistic hoplite battle formalized during the &quot;golden period&quot; of Greek antiquity was inextricably linked to the nature of Greek agriculture. To avoid devastating loss of food (particularly wine) production and desolation of invaluable land, the seemingly ceaseless wars between Greek city states and their various shifting alliances had to be short, rapidly decisive, and--necessarily as a result--brutally sanguineous. Greeks deliberately fought according to a set of mutually acknowledged rules that limited wartime injury to the participating infantrymen themselves, and kept intact the soil and farms from which they came.In his book Hanson takes us step by step through the violent clash of opposing Greek armies and reveals in remarkably technical detail just what was involved. Perhaps even more important, he recreates the personal experience of individual participants during such a battle. Following in the footsteps of many modern (post-World War II) historians who are more interested in the private soldier than the commanding general, he gives us a gritty sense of what it was like for Greek farmer soldiers to undergo combat in traditional phalanx formation. (Consequently, Steven Pressfield acknowleges that Hanson was one of the sources he referred to when writing his engrossing &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;, a fictional treatment of the famous Battle of Thermopylae.)In this sense there is a firm connection between ancient and modern warfare: ultimately it was--and is--fought by men who must deal with their own personal fears of wounding, dismemberment, and death. This has not changed, and so long as there is still a human element to war, will not change. But Hanson takes a step beyond simple individual motivation; and in the closing pages of the book he discusses the implications of modern total warfare, where the ritualized, bloody (but still carefully limited) battle of ancient Greece has given way to the usually uncontrolled, all-destructive (rather than fundamentally conserving) combat of today. It makes for thoughtful, stimulating reading.(Those who find this subject matter interesting might find other Hanson books worth looking at. His more recent &quot;Soul of Battle&quot; devotes its first third to a discussion of war between Thebes and Sparta. &quot;The Wars of the Ancient Greeks&quot; is one volume of a slick series of popular histories which have John Keegan as their editor; aimed at the uninitiated general public, this title nonetheless is a good introduction to warfare in classical Greece.)"},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This is my second time through the book and it is still an excellent read and provides an engrossing account of the orgins of how warfare in the Greek world was waged and its impact throughout history. On that note I must disagree with George Delke Sr. that the Greeks were not the inventors of this type of warfare and that the Assryians were good at it (if they were the Greeks wouldn't have slaughtered them as often as they did).Dr. Hanson makes a thorough and thoughful analysis of the Greek hoplites and the way they fought. From the hoplight to the their commander no stone is left unturned. But while the main emphasis on the book itself is the hoplight and Greek warfare in general there is much more to it than just that. The Greek hoplights were not successful because of their bravery or for their numbers, the Assyrians were brave and they outnumbered the Greeks in all their battles, then why was it the hoplight armies were so successful against the Assyrians. It was because of their orginization and their training (this is why I disagreed with the previous reveiwer). This then is the underlying theme to the book, not the heroics of one man but the performance of the whole.The Greek structure of warfare will go on to conquer almost the whole ancient world under the hands of men like Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Julius Ceasar, and the other great Roman generals of the ancient world. But the traditions of Greek warfare would go on to influence the later nations of the European world and from there the whole of the Western World.Using a plethora of sources from ancient authors, battles, archeology, and others the author has managed to write an excellent resource that is original, readable, enthralling, and most importantly is its credibility. This is a must have for any student of military history, both professional and layperson alike."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Dr. Hanson, a leading classical scholar, provides an excellent examination of how warfare among the Greek city-states was conducted. He places particular emphasis on how the individual soldier fought. On the one hand, combat in the front line must have been awful; on the other hand, because the armies were made up of men who had known each other for years, unit cohesion must have been very high. While thoroughly researched, Hanson does not fall back on academic jargon, and his points are easily understood by the nonspecialist. As he demonstrates, the method of warfare, while often fatal to the soldiers, left property and noncombatants unharmed. Unfortunately, later in the wars between Athens and Sparta a more complete, and thus destructive manner of warfare developed. This is an excellent book for anyone interested either in classical Greece or the history of warfare."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"I have purchased about forty books that deal with warfare in antiquity in the past year. Almost all of them have proven to be utterly infuriating and completely useless. You can garner from the Internet every iota of information that you can from just about all the books offered on ancient warfare. Most deal more with societal effects, cultural developments and histories of civilizations than they do with battlefield strategies, tactics and how men actually used their weapons in the thick of combat. These books are, for the most part, completely useless and should be avoided.Except this one.The Western War of War is a triumph of analysis in both the microscopic makeup of a hoplite army and the experiences they underwent during a battle. In my research I have found THIS BOOK alone to be a gem, an unparalleled necessity to discern what Greek warfare was truly like. The author pulls quotes from Herodotus, Homer, Xenophon and others to illustrate his excellent insights into the entire process of hoplite fighting. If you buy this book you will learn what kind of men donned the aspis shield and bronze cuirass; what it was like to use the ash or cornel wood spear and the xyphos sword; what an army did from the moment they rose to the seconds before the clash; the spacing and makeup of troops; the infurating conflict and the confusion of battle; what it smelled, tasted, sounded and felt like to be lost in the miasma of two phalanxes grinding against one another. On top of this you will read about examples of ancient battles and how they illustrate Mr. Hanson's insights further.The only gripe anyone could have with this book is that there are no pictures to go along wit the text, but the descriptions are so in-depth that no visuals are needed, the author's words paint a vivid picture worthy of a novel. You will not be disappointed by the lack of pictures or diagrams, this book conveys its subject perfectly.Go used if you can (as always), but don't shy away from having to pay retail. Most bookstores carry it (which is where I found it) but it's totally worth the wait to buy online. If you are writing a book/screenplay on the subject, doing research for a paper, or are in ANY WAY interested in hoplite warfare YOU MUST PURCHASE THIS BOOK! It is as indispensable of a necessity on the topic as Herodotus, Homer or Xenophon."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Hanson writes a vivid, realistic description of the horror of hoplite combat. He gives the reader an in-depth armchairview of agrarian city-state warfare. There is much to be learned from this book about battle with edged weapons.There is also much to be learned about the birth of modern military ethos. The East's mystical model for warfare (e.g. bushido and the like) concentrated on the \\"inner warrior.\\" The West concentrated on the most pragmatically efficient methods of dealing death and destruction on a large scale.When the citizen-militia of Athens met the the elite professional warriors of Persia at Marathon, it was not just a battle of the few against the many. It was a test of a pragmatic method of warmaking against a traditionalist method. The Persians, who from their youth learned three things, \\"to ride the horse, draw the bow, and speak the truth,\\" were severely outclassed by a war machine that discounted the individual but turned the group into a relentless killing machine.When first I read this book, I heartily disagreed with Hansen's thesis, but a study of the wars of the last decade bear out his conclusions."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This is an extraordinarily exacting but readable study of hoplite warfare. The author demonstrates an impressive command of both primary and secondary sources, but his pen is light and his style engaging. His attention to the fate of the &quot;everyman&quot; within the phalanx provides a rich perspective from which to examine, ultimately, the whole of the Greek way of fighting war. This book surely well deserves the praise it has earned.Perhaps the only element lacking in this book is even a modest set of illustrations, such as reproductions of vase paintings or simple diagrams. Too much about the hoplite armor and the array of hoplites within the phalanx is left to the imagination by a book otherwise intended to appeal to non-classicists (or, at least, to amateur classicists). Other than the cover art, there is not a single illustration in the second edition. The next edition would be greatly improved by an attempt to incorporate representative illustrations."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"In this early work Victor Hanson Davies (VHD) explains what has become his central thesis in military history: The origins and growth of Western military superiority in the art of war. According to VHD we owe much of our military greatness in the West to the legacy of the Greeks who made war their past-time. The Greek hoplite developed the close order formation of phalanx warfare, a hallmark of what has become the disciplined nature of how Wetsern society wages war. This method broke away from the earlier heroic tradition of fighting where battle was often a series of individualized combats between warrior champions. The Greeks went one step further by taking the warrior and making him into a hoplite. By doing so they created the most effective fighting techniques known to classical man. VHD always enjoys being controversial, and many of his ideas may be perceived as being biased and pro-Western, but his grasp of history and antiquity in particular can't be denied. Even the politically correct, the ones most likely to be offended by these views, will have a difficult time denying some of the facts presented.Greek hoplite warfare was both destructive and limited in scope. It seems the Greeks wished it to be so. By making war so horrific in the short term they ensured that only those directly involved would be harmed. This was how the Greek City State thought war should be resolved. By mutual agreement, at a set place and time. It was a brutal, yet logical method which over time developed a style of close-combat unmatched by other cultures. Over time the Greek Polis was gradually eroded, and with Philip and Alexander of Macedon the eventual dream of a united Greece was finally realized. With that came the means to export this lethal style of war abroad for more productive purposes.The book goes to great lengths to describe the various aspects of hoplie warfare in great detail. Constant referebce are made to the writers and philosophers of Classical Greece who fought in many of the battles themselves. VHD provides an anatomy of Greek hoplite warfare, describing each part of the panoply which the individual wore into battle. In fact this book gives you as close a feel for what those intense, sweaty, violent and bloody conflicts must have been like, without actually being there! From those small enclosed valleys in Greece has evolved our deadly tradition of Western war. The paradox that VHD points out is that the very means that created this tradition could well destroy itself today. Modern technology combined with the stand-up battle tradition is a deadly combination, one that can not be played with in the Atomic age. If nothing else we should learn from the legacy of the Classical Greeks what our own true lethality is."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This review is NOT for the contents of the book which is by all accounts a good read. Unfortunately, this particular printing is a complete debacle.

This book, for me at least, led to an eye opening &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in European military history prior to WWI. What I saw in this book was the beginnings of cultural obsession with limited warfare for limited gains (as opposed to the later conepts of total war) which dominated western Europe for millenia. Hence, the Western historians' fascination with &quot;decisive&quot; battles which, ultimately, led not to any decisive change in political or cultural institutions (after all, did Waterloo really change French institutions that much?).Immediately after reading this book, I read &quot;The Devil's Horseman&quot;, a history of the Mongol &quot;Invasion&quot; (it was actually a reconnaisance in force) of Europe. I was struck by the baffelment of the Europeans when, after defeat at the hands of the Mongols, they were not offered some sort of terms of surrender. It struck me, after reading Dr. Hansen's work, that the ancient Greeks had passed on much more to Western society than philosophy, trigonometry, or democracy; they had also passed on an idea of limited warfare for concessions rather than absolute destruction of the enemy and the removal of his capacity to resist.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in military history; it is well written (although dry at times), and will provide a new viewpoint from which to consider when reading new books or re-reading old favorites. For the insight alone, it is well worth the investment."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Victor Davis Hanson has recently emerged as a particularly right wing columnist at the National Review. However, anyone familiar with his writing there should be aware he is a far better historian than pundit, at least when it comes to Ancient Greece. His basic thesis is that the ancient Greeks evolved a unique form of warfare, focused on a single, short and bloody clash between two armies of citizens. This warfare arose from the circumstances of their society. The typical soldier was an independent small farmer who supplied his own arms and fought as part of a body of amateur citizen soldiers to defend his land and city-state. Generals were chosen from among the citizens and led from the front, sharing risks equally. Conflicts had to end quickly so the farmers could get back to their fields. Consequently, the Greeks developed a style of warfare that emphasized equal risk among soldiers, strength and courage over skill and maneuver, and seeking a decisive battle even at a high cost to their own side. When the Greeks came into contact with less determined cultures, they scored devastating victories. This kind of warfare became the standard for Western armies up into modern times. Hanson further argues that the reliance on citizen soldiers and the emphasis on equality produced a society of democratic, free speaking, free thinking men and ultimately accounted for men such as Socrates and Thuycidides. When small farms started to die out and states began to rely more on professional soldiers, Greek democracy and intellectual life declined as well.Hanson's work suffers from two flaws, one minor and one major. The minor flaw is that he puts most of his effort into reconstructing Greek warfare and relatively little in demonstrating how that style of warfare dominated Western armies. The focus, as the subtitle suggests is on the Greeks. John Keegan's \\"A History of Warfare\\" does a much more thorough job of developing and supporting this thesis (Keegan relied heavily and explicitly on Hanson's work when discussing Greek warfare and wrote the introduction to \\"The Western Way of War.\\") Hanson's sentimentality is a far more serious flaw. A farmer himself, he deeply admires the small independent farmers who made up the backbone of Greek armies and society. Consequently he tends to disparage later military developments. For him, the clash of amateur citizen soldiers, with generals leading from the front, is the ideal form of battle. He mocks as cowards and fools Hellenistic era military theorists who shied away from frontal assaults, encouraged generals not to expose themselves to danger and preferred professional soldiers to citizen amateurs. Here he makes selective use of the evidence. By his own account, the professional soldiers of Sparta were regarded as superior and other Greeks feared to face them in battle. Likewise, Xenophon, who had served as a common soldier and was elected an officer by his fellow soldiers, was one of the military theorists who argued against generals risking themselves in battle. Hanson is so fond of the amateur citizen soldier that he seemingly cannot bear to acknowledge that other forms of warfare might be more effective.Why should anyone in the general public be interested in a book on ancient Greek warfare? The current crisis provides a strong reason. Hanson shows how the Greek way of warfare was integrated into their society and government. A body of citizens decided elections and battle alike as equals. The shift away from amateur citizen soldiers paralleled the shift away from democracy and toward autocratic government. In our current war we are depending heavily on a professional military, rather than citizen soldiers. In previous wars the bulk of troops came from ordinary citizens. Now military service is no longer part of citizenship. As in the time of the Ancient Greeks, there are practical reasons today for relying on professionals. However, there are social costs to such a change. President Clinton's disputes with the military are only the most obvious examples. Hanson reminds us that we cannot easily separate how a society fights wars from how it is governed. There is a sense in his sentimentality. For that alone, his book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"The author certainly has an in-depth knowledge of the subject.

I like the era, and the subject. I read the reviews, several from each of the star ratings, and finally decided to buy it.I waited for several weeks for it to arrive, as I am currently living in China, and had my father ship it to me. When it finally did, I dove in.What I found really left me wanting. This book was compared to Keegan's \\"The Face of Battle,\\" but I have to say that is a poor comparison in my eyes. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did.What was I waiting for? I was waiting for it to give me an idea of what it was like to fight during that time, how it felt to be in a phalanx! What it instead provided me was passages with no feelings at all. It contained a lot of references to ancient accounts, and how various surviving artworks presented battle. A lot of the same material seemed to be presented over and over. The number of times it talked about the members of a phalanx were usually part of the same tribe, family, city, town, etc, was incredible. This along with how the strongest and most experienced men were put on the right side of the phalanx to help prevent drift, as everyone moved to be protected by the shield of the man on their right. There were times that I wondered if my wife had accidentally dropped my book and put my bookmark into a place I had already read, because even some of the sentences seemed the same, only to find that no, it wasn't that, it was just another rehash of the the material with a slight twist.I did learn a few things, since I hadn't studied any of the ancient battle accounts, and there was something to be learned in each chapter, but it definitely wasn't a good read and I found myself dreading to pick it up. In the end it was a boring account, that droned on without the slightest bit of emotion or power. In my opinion the book could have easily been written in 1/4 the space or less, and offered the same insights.I wasn't impressed and I was so let down that I decided to let others know by writing a review.

He also neglects Athenian mercantile practices and also seems to think that the Spartans were full time farmers(which they weren't as they had the Helots) he does not mention the Spartan economy or the role of the perioikoi and bunches everyone together in a nice package that is just wrong."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Ever since reading this book and being obliged to teach it to undergraduates in a staff-taught course a number of years ago, I've wondered what Hanson's real point is. I think the argument is fascinating, even if I also think his leap from hoplite battle to nukes over Japan is a bit forced. But it seems to me that the sections where Hanson is most present to the reader and most engaged with his material are the assurances of first-hand knowledge we get for some of his claims about how it felt to fight in hoplite gear and formation. How does he know? He and his students made armor and weapons for themselves and then went out on the campus lawn and staged mock hoplite combat. For all of the originality of the book's argument, I can't quite shake the feeling that Hanson's real interest is in playing soldier with his students. Paintball in the ancient world, anyone?"},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"If I were a Greek general in charge of the defense of my city-state, why would I want to stake everything on a decisive battle which might not go my way if my opponents were say the Thebans, the Athenians or especially the ruthless Spartans? In those days, the penalty for failure was the destruction of your city-state and the enslavement of all your surviving family, friends and neighbors many of whom you'd never see again as their butts would be sold all over the Med for fun and profit. In those days, \\"winner-take-all\\" was more than just a concept and I just can't think of a good reason why anyone would want to expose his community to this kind of ruin.My take is that the Greeks developed a hardy, well led infantry that could take on enemy cavalry because their city-states simply did not have the resources to support Cecil B. De Mille size armies. The Greek city-states needed to make the few resources they had count, hence their emphasis on upping quality through training and preserving their numbers through armor that was distinctly stronger and more extensive than that of their non-Greek opponents. Whereas the Emperor of Persia could afford to lose any number of times (and any number of troops while he was at it), all he needed was winning decisively just once. The armies of the Greek city-states knew that they could not afford to lose even once, given the grimness of the outcome if they lost - so their armies had to be good, effective and maintain their discipline in the face of apalling losses if they were to preserve their respective communities. A huge emphasis was placed on quality because of the swift difference quality could make in those days of hand-to-hand combat. The Greek armies armies earned their spectacular battlefield successes because they were the first armies in the Med to systematically integrate leadership, training, discipline and armor into this difficult to quantify factor called \\"quality\\".Either I am missing something or Victor Davis Hanson is missing something - and I don't think it's me."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Interesting historical observations, but the author's ideology colors the work, leading to strange moral conclusions. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Big fan of Hanson's writings, but if you read just one of his books, it shouldn't be this one. Despite its intriguing title, this was Hanson's second book (1989), and it shows: it's dense and scholarly, apparently having been written before Hanson mastered the art of writing compelling and illuminating books for a mass audience. The fact that this was issued by the University of California press should tip you off to the nature of the writing herein.I would instead recommend these later books by the same author, which are much more readable, and cover much of the same material:The Soul of Battle: From Ancient Times to the Present Day, How Three Great Liberators Vanquished TyrannyandCarnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power"},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This work by the classical scholar Victor Hanson is acclaimed in the field and readers will find references to it other books. Hanson examines the mechanics of hoplite warfare in classical Greece based on literary sources and to a lesser extent archeology. Chapters deal with the details of the armor and of hand to hand combat. This is not a book about strategy or tactics, but rather about the actual experience of a soldier in battle.What then is Hanson's thesis? The title of the book is not \`How Heavy Was the Hoplite Shield?' Hanson is addressing a bigger idea: that the Greek preference for decisive military confrontations has shaped military doctrine in the West ever since. Hence the title: The Western Way of War. The alternative, incidentally, would be skirmishing and guerilla-style war. This is where I am unclear on what he is actually saying. Is this style of war, which seeks a decisive battle, effective or not? If that is too blunt a question, then when specifically would it be advantageous and when not? Hanson seems ambivalent. He describes in detail the problems with hoplite warfare: the armor was unwieldy, the formations prone to confusion, the phalanx a mixture of novices and veterans, the hoplites were of widely different ages with different physical abilities, etc. All of these would seem to be disadvantages. And yet the hoplite phalanx was very effective, indeed probably the most efficient fighting force in the classical world. We know this not merely because the Greeks chose to fight among themselves in this way. That, after all, would be a clash between equals, with a certain ritual character, as Hanson points out. We do know, however, that they consistently defeated the Persians both on home soil (during the Persian invasions recorded by Herodotus) and abroad (as recorded in the Anabasis of Xenophon, for example). The Persians had a completely different style of fighting, and, because they ruled a huge empire, their armies typically consisted of regiments from different regions, each with its own style. The hoplites did well against all of them. The objective evidence would seem to show then, that the phalanx was ideally suited to the warfare of its time. It did gradually evolve to use lighter armor, became more mobile and was eventually replaced by the Roman legion which proved more versatile on the more complex and technologically advanced battlefield of later classical times.All this leaves me dissatisfied with the discussion of the Western Way of War. For this discussion to be meaningful, we must define some \\"non-Western\\" way of war. That is not to be found here. I understand that tribal warfare as seen in many primitive societies is quite different in character. That is not the point, however. The empire-building wars of India and China were clearly extremely bloody and indeed decisive. An example would be the battle of Panipat in 1526 that established the Mughal Empire in northern India. These non-Western wars are clearly beyond the scope of this book, but they lead us to conclude that what Hanson calls the Western Way of War is really imperial war: War used strategically as an extension of politics, as opposed to tribal war which is annual skirmishing between chieftains. The term \\"Western\\" becomes anachronistic. There is a problem with this too however, because contrary to Hanson's assertion, these Hoplite battles never actually decided anything in the long-term. The history of ancient Greece is the History of ceaseless internecine warfare, until Rome established the pax Romana. The meaning of the word decisive becomes semantic, in that perhaps this year's dispute was decided. No empires were ever built by this style of fighting, although some were stopped (the Persians). In fact, the closest the classical Greeks came to empire were the Delian league led by Athens and the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta (which fought the Peloponnesian War). The point though, is that neither was established by hoplite battle but rather arose to some extent consensually and to some extent through political coercion.If this does not muddy the waters enough, a very solid and respected line of reasoning holds that it was actually naval warfare, not hoplite battle, which was decisive. To get a sense of this idea, readers could try the recent Lords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy by John Hale. Since we don't hear much of non-Western navies and in the more recent colonial era Western navies were in fact decisive, this may be the true Western Way of War.My own thought is that empires and large kingdoms practice one type of warfare. Off necessity this type of warfare is similar all over world. Tribal societies practice a different type of war. The Greek city state (polis) is best seen as an unusual type of tribal society. Typically tribal areas within a confined geographic area coalesced into a polis. The Greeks were familiar with many peoples who still lived as tribes without a city. The question then really becomes, were there any other tribal societies anywhere in the world with a predilection for a decisive clash of heavily armed, coordinated warriors? In this respect it is quite possible that the classical Greeks were unique.In summary then, although this book's title refers to strategy, the subject of the book is really the detail of hoplite battle. Read the book to learn what that was like and mostly for its discussion of the pre-Peloponnesian War era. The theorizing about the Western Way I would ignore."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"The classical interpretation of Greek hoplite battle was that the citizen-army gathered to defend their crops against foreign plunder. Professor Victor Davis Hanson, who was raised on a farm in central California, believes that the damage to Greek agriculture by these raids was minimal. He knows from first-hand experience how difficult it is to destroy grape and olive vines.Rather, Hanson argues, hoplite battle was all about an idea, a principle. It was a rational response to the concern over trespassers and the concept that one should not violate another's land that provided the motivation for the pitched battle. The hoplite clash was actually a means by which both sides could limit the carnage by engaging a single act to settle the issue. Hanson maintains that it was the Peloponnesian War and Pericles' citadel strategy that undermined the two century tradition of the pitched hoplite battle. Henceforth, siege trains and mercenaries would destroy the age of the hoplite battle and supplant it with wars of increasing length and civilian suffering.Hanson claims that the western world inherited a burdensome legacy from the Greeks: a craving for a clear military decision in a decisive battle and a disdain for those who fought at a distance or in an unconventional manner. He argues that western conventional military might has effectively put itself out of business by so strongly dominating the direct engagement of massed forces. No non-western power would willingly meet a western power on its own turf - the decisive set piece battle.The concepts of war and battle were quite distinct for the Greeks. Set piece battles were uncommon, even during major wars clashes of great magnitude were rare. For instance, Hanson points out that during the twenty-seven years of the Peloponnesian War there were only two large hoplite clashes - Delium (424 BC) and Mantinea (418 BC). The Greeks didn't love war or battle at all, Hanson says. Rather, they settled on the structured hoplite style as a means to contain war and shield women, children and private property. The author maintains that the Greeks depicted wars so often on vases and in art more because of how infrequently happened and the close family ties associated with battle. Combat had no romantic qualities in ancient Greece and displays of militarism, such as physical training or maneuvers, played little role in daily life (Sparta was the exception). The Greeks perceived the clashes of the phalanx as economical and practical, and owing to the remarkable uniformity of battle over several hundred years it provided continuity and heritage to communities, although it was never glorified.The Greek hoplite clash was \\"rational\\" in the sense that it could keep losses within acceptable limits (estimated as 5% losses for the victor and 15-20% for the defeated). The great tradition of a one-time, winner-take-all clash ended, Hanson argues, because the Greeks came to consider even 5% losses in a victory prohibitively high, so they sought other ways to resolve decide conflicts. Why it evidently took the Greeks centuries to come to this realization Hanson does not say. But he does make clear that future wars - that included large armies, mercenaries, specialized troops and siege warfare - exacted a much greater toll on life and property than the hoplite clash ever did.All told, this is a convincing reinterpretation of the motivation behind ancient Greek warfare and a spellbinding tour of the actual experience of hoplite battle."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Interesting historical observations, and the author's ideology does not color the work, but rather leads to logical moral conclusions.

Absolutely NOT disappointing."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This is a one of Victor Davis Hanson's classiscs about the Western Way of War. Hanson's insights into the cultural elements that make the Western way of war so deadly, whether used by Westerners or adopted against them, are so profound that John Keegan, perhaps the most prestigious military historian alive when Hanson published, abandoned his customary British reserve and called them &#34;dazzlingly original&#34;.&#34;The Western Way of War&#34; has become a fundamental concept in military history, as fundamental as things like the role of surprise or the importance of logistics.Hanson is especially laudable in his discussion of Western warmaking because he denies any &#34;superiority&#34; in the moral sense, and utterly disdains any racial element. He makes it clear that Western armies have too often used this deadliness do do what they should not. But it is important for an understanding of the world, and how we can prevent some wars (NOT all) and contain the harm done by those which do start.Jay Maupin"},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"I'm not a Greek classics reader in any sense of the word; however I have been literally mesmerized by his work in The Western Way of War. The book initially starts a little slow but once you get past the first couple of chapters where he is laying the foundation for what is to follow, you'll be richly rewarded for your patience.However I was disappointed in his opinion contrasting the care a Hoplite gave to his weapon compared to a modern warrior. On page 63, first paragraph, third to fifth sentences he states;\\"This also illustrates nicely the hoplite's pride in his own weapons, for it is hard to imagine modern infantry taking such care of their government-issued arms\\"More than just a few US Marine and their M-16 brides will take offense to this statement, but besides that one mischaracterization, the book is an exceptionally sweet read."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Probably the definitive book on the Hoplite, and his ordeal in combat. It's a shame this book is not available; I'm glad I bought it way back whenever I did (I was only able recently to pick it up and finish it). It's well-researched... some parts and quotes I found to be quite repetitive, however, I guess the author needed to make his points. Presents excellent and what I found to be unique viewpoints and theories... I learned so much from it."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Much has been said about this book in other reviews, so I'll focus on one interesting aspect. Nassim Nicholas Taleb said that he thought the scientific community would be better served if scientists left their labs and spent more time going to parties. There, interacting with real people, they'd stumble upon interesting new angles to test or ways of thinking about things.VD Hanson's book is fantastic proof of that suggestion. The author was tearing out trees from his Fresno farm when he realized just how flippantly historians had been treating the phrase \\"laid waste to the land.\\" The reality is tearing out trees is hard in the year 2009. It would have been next to impossible for an army of hoplites to do much damage. From there, Hanson turns our perception of Greek battle on its head.Could generals really have given long speeches before battle when their soldiers wore helmets that covered 95% of their face and didn't include earholes? Could soldiers have fought for long carrying 70+ pounds of armor? Did the wine they carried with them have any impact on the battle?These are all questions he asks and subsequently answers in the book. They are most impressive because a large chunk of our Greek history has taken the wrong assumption completely for granted. Much respect to the author for being able to stare cross-eyed long enough to notice."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Victor Davis Hanson is America's preeminent military historian. IMO, Hanson is USA's equivalent of Britain's renowned John Keegan(Face of Battle; Mask of Command). The central point of THE WESTERN WAY OF WAR is both startling and simple. GREEKS agreed to fight brutal battle-wars...holds-barred/no-holds-barred...in single,decisive clashes of infantry soldiers(Hoplite \\"brigades\\").They met on a clean field on a clear day and with unrestrained ferocity,freight-train charged into opponent's line and slaughtered each other or were slaughtered in place.THE LAST MEN STANDING were undisputed winners and the war was over.This fair fight agreement spared civilians;the country;and the culture for hundreds of years. It was not until civil war between Athens & Sparta(27 years long including a plague)detailed by Thucydides as The Peloponnesian War,and Hanson's own A WAR LIKE NO OTHER that the Greeks destroyed themselves,and effectively delivered their polity and people into bondage and perpetual warfare under Alexander the Great.Hanson's book is an easy,entertaining yet \\"scholarly\\" read. His style is \\"narrative\\" anecdotal,yet abounds in expertise that would have made him a superb(far less theatrical than Kissinger)National Security Adviser or Secretary of State had Senator McCain won the Presidency.THE WESTERN WAY OF WAR is a deserved classic. It ends with the same terrible question John Keegan posed in Mask of Command: What can\\"the Western way of War\\" be in an apocalyptic age of thermonuclear weaponry(and fanatical terrorists)? In the Greek golden age,a peaceful...until the next Super bloodbath Bowl...End comprised both tactical and strategic means.Today \\"means\\" can be the END: Or...as Herman Kahn once warned...a final war \\"where survivors will envy the dead...\\""},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"One of the things that the other reviews don't really make clear about this book is that it in fact has two very different components. The first one to appear is Hanson's take on the ancient Greek philosophy of war, which, he claims, revolves around the toe-to-toe decisive battle that resolved the conflict in the matter of an hour or two. It's distressing cavalier about one point -- the amount of damage an invading army could do to a city-state's agriculture, particularly the impact of destroying its grain -- but t apparently much of this is a summary of arguments worked out more fully in Hanson's other work. And even if he is wrong this point, it doesn't particularly damage the notion of a \`western way of war'. That is, that there is something ethnocentric about a predilection for decisive battles. That's certainly food for thought, especially in light of the varying successes and failures of the US military over the last hundred years. Hanson begins to hint at the modern implications at the beginning of the book and typically academic authors return to such speculations at the end, but Hanson only does that in a cursory way, which is too bad because his ideas are so intriguing.The second part of the book (really parts II-VI) begins on page 67 of the copy I read (1998, revised edition). This is the part that is the reason this book receives so much praise. It focuses on the experience of being a soldier in a phalanx. Or to be more precise, the misery of being a soldier in the phalanx. It describes every piece of his panoply and the ordeal it was to wear or carry. It describes the (limited) role of generals, the place of old men in the battle, the role of alcohol and the importance of morale. Then it describes battles in all their phases, from the traditional morning breakfast to stacks of rigor mortis stiffened bodies.This section, which amounts to three-quarters of the book, can easily be described in one word: vivid. While I haven't gotten to read as much military history as I would like as an adult, I have read hundreds of military histories and this is one of the few that has created the impression of \`you are there' (or perhaps \`thank God I wasn't there'). Hanson's ability to do this, I would say, comes largely from the way he appeals to the senses, particularly (of all things) the sense of touch: the weight of the shield, the rows of men behind you pressing you toward the enemy, etc.Are Hanson's arguments and approach valid? I'm not a professional antiquarian, so I can't say for sure. But having just read Xenophon's Hellenika, I would have to say that this book provides compelling explanations for a lot of the behavior that had me scratching my head going \`Why did they do that?'That said, the latter chapters rely heavily on depictions from vases, which are not reproduced in the book and for which I have no easy way to track down. And likewise, ancient history kicks always come to an end when I get frustrated with the sweeping generalizations modern researchers make from such thin textual evidence. I got a bit of that here.Overall, the book ought to appeal to anyone interested in military history or Antiquity. While some of the arguments are technical, the intended audience clearly is an informed lay reader and the prose seems quite appropriate."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"With all of the modern movies depicting the horrors and glory of ancient or medieval warfare and battle--like BraveHeart, Gladiator, Alexander, The Kingdom of Heaven and even the Lord of the Rings to some extent--Hanson's book covers all the bases. It isn't that he has his students playing \\"paintball\\" warfare with aluminum foil swords and shields on the campus lawn--it's more that he was and is trying to make the feeling and reality of warfare more tangible and understandable for those of us who study or are interested in ancient war. His descriptions of battle make your skin tingle, just like you might feel when watching a battle scene in a movie. He is just adept at doing the same with words and without the fancy feathered costumes. The Western Way of War takes you inside the hoplite phalanx and Victor gives you a bird's eye view of what the ancients must have seen and felt at the moments before, during and after the battles.

I have been a fan of Mr. Keegan's books for many years but not quite so fond of Mr. Hanson's theories. This theory on the superiority of western warfare and its roots, though perhaps an interesting theory to explore, is a great disappointment to me. It is indeed an important work that should be considered by the serious student but be sure to read some of the opposition and I think the problems with these theories will become quite evident. I would have expected different conclusions from others of Mr. Keegan's books but his great accomplishments in the field of military history force us to consider what he has to say and challenges us to study further."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"By utilizing primary sources from first hand witnesses of ancient battle, Hanson paints a brilliant picture of what war in classical Greece was actually like.

While the Greek hoplite way of war may have been an impetus, I don't see it as being carried through to modern times. It seems there is another school that attempts to avoid standing toe-to-toe to fight through the ages - armored knights, fortresses, bow, firearms, and the nails in hoplite fighting coffin - long range artillery, armor, and air power. Still thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Good 'ol Victor Davis Hanson has been set loose on the world here in his first book. This time -- thankfully -- in his old stomping grounds of Ancient Greece. Again VDH has the truth serum of classical combat in strong measure. Make no doubt about it, Hanson knows what ancient combat was about -- let there be no other interpretations of this period: This is both the strength and the weakness of his book in my humble opinion: Hanson is making inferences about broad sweeps of history in a way a person would describe the chemical reaction of boric acid in water -- all very mathematical, and not allowing for the possibility of error, or little other interpretation.Hanson starts where it all began, and where it all should begin -- with the grand master of the Iliad and Homer. Classical battle is defined and the classic stages of warfare, down to Hellenic Warfare are demonstrated. He even goes in detail enough during the dark ages between 1200 and 800 BC and asserts certain economic theories about the time to explain the nature of the civilisation. It is at times like these, when grand edifices are constructed on Hanson's private preferences that one gets the idea that something may be amiss. We know almost nothing about the economic time of the Greek Dark Ages -- I am little more than uneasy about how easily he asserts the truth of this age.Make no mistake, this is not a politcal tract such as \\"Carnage & Culture\\" or some of his other literature that have made him a doyen of the political right in the US, this is serious scholarship. But it is certainly a lot different from the model of scholarship I was taught to worship and emulate -- one where a broad understanding of other ideas and competing theories and, and small measure of humility, yeild a wonderful read and superior wisdom. One could cite Norman.F. Cantor or M.I. Findley as good examples of the latter.But Hanson has his truth and it will reign. So be it.I learned a lot from his prose and his ability to find the locus of tactical change within the ancient Greek way of warfare make this a good read with the lot of worthy scholarship. He is particularly good on his shift from classic Greek warfare -- short depth in ranks, short stabbing spears and the panoply -- to the changes that lead to an almost baroque assembly or multiple serried ranks of 20 plus and unwieledy spears. The push of the pike was never more important, but the Greeks somehow lost the ability to engage locate and move against the evolving Roman tactics.I do not think this book is as good as Lendon's \\"Ghosts and Soldiers\\" in its experimental thesis, but it is still a very good introductory read on the subject. Although I am highly critical of Hansen and the way that he writes, he should thank me for his royalty cheques, since I do own most of his works, warts and all."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"Why read a book about ancient Greek warfare? Perhaps, because \\"classical Greece still offers us the best - perhaps the only intellectual - explanation for how the pragmatic concerns of our own daily existence in Western society have been addressed and solved\\" (page 7). As you may guess, overall, I enjoyed this book. Professor Victor Davis Hanson is knowledgeable of his subject, writes fairly well and provides some insightful comments. Exactly what one would expect from a good work of military history, however there is something of a bad aftertaste to the work.To start he takes the famous German historian Hans Delbr&uuml;ck to task for not being \\"merely wrong, but also misleading\\" (page 23). He quotes Delbr&uuml;ck as to numbers of troops engaged in ancient battle, but seems to misunderstand the German historian's point. He believes that Delbr&uuml;ck thinks that mass always decide a battle, that the biggest battalions always win, but that is not the point that Delbr&uuml;ck is trying to get across. Rather he is interested in questioning the numbers that are quoted by the ancients. For example, Herodotus records that the Persian army under Xerses numbered 2,641,610 fighting men and at least as many crew members, servants, and camp followers.Delbr&uuml;ck concluded, based on the actual size of the plain of Marathon and the contemporary estimates of the population of ancient Greece that the Greek army numbered 12,000 men and the Persians, a professional army emphasizing quality, even less. So contrary to Herodotus, the Greeks were not greatly outnumbered, but more numerous, which goes against Hanson's thesis of the overwhelming nature of the Greek phalanx. It should be pointed out that Delbr&uuml;ck is consistent in his questioning of numbers given in the original ancient sources. He also proved rather decisively that Caesar inflated the numbers of his opponents in Gaul for political reasons. Questioning numbers is a part of what is known as Sachkritik, since as Delbr&uuml;ck wrote, \\"a movement that a troop of 1,000 men executes without difficulty is a hard task for 10,000 men, a work of art for 50,000, an impossibility for 100,000\\".In all Hanson unjustly criticises Delbr&uuml;ck, fails to mention, let alone answer, the valid questions he brings up concerning Marathon and then misleads his readers as to Delbr&uuml;ck's true attitude and the quality of his contribution to ancient studies. He then goes on to use Sachkritik, that is Delbr&uuml;ck's own method, in his own historical analysis. As I said, bad aftertaste. . .Many of the Hanson's own attitudes come out clearly in the work as well, as when he seems to lament that the Greek hoplites may have gone into battle \\"drunk\\", that is having had wine with their meal before the battle. This almost caused me to laugh out loud as I was reading the book. Having worked in Europe for almost 20 years I think poor Professor Hanson would be shocked, SHOCKED, to know that hundreds of thousands of Europeans also have wine with their meals and function very well afterwards thank you.Finally he fails to mention the influence of the rise of the Athenian navy on democracy in ancient Athens, since is was the growing importance of propertyless Athenian sailors, unlike their propertied fellow citizens serving as hoplites who supplied their own expensive weapons and armor, that made Athenian democracy something trully different. This is taken pretty much as a given in historical sociology, but Hanson seems to prefer the hoplites as the limit of his elitest view of ancient democracy, and fails to mention this rather important influence of military technology on social development.In short, we see influence of highly subjective attitudes and politics in his work which leaves this reader with a bad aftertaste. In all a good book with some interesting comments on the nature of Greek infantry battle, but marred by the author's own rather obvious blindspots."},{"Title":"The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece","review":"This book is a crucial source to understand the way in which Greeks engage in War.

Dutton & Co., USA, Library of Congress#57-11250; 343 pgs. This is a c.1955 story of the \\"last Spring migration of a nomad Persian [Iran] tribe, led by an hereditary chief, Ghazan Khan, from the wintering grounds in Southern Iran to the high grasslands of the mountains. Ghazan has made this journey thirteen times in his thirty years, but the Iranian government had decreed that the free life of the Falqani nomads must cease and their leader be exiled. Despite the decree, one hundred thousand men and women with their flocks and herds set out through mountainous country. When they were returning to the winter grazing ground the nomads finally joined battle with the authorities, during which their leader, Ghazan, was sadly killed.\\" The book contains several nice photographs of the nomads. It is mainly written in an informal \\"conversational\\" style, whereby a dialogue occurs between various nomads and the author. It is not written in a college, text-book style. This does not detract from the book, just that a prospective reader should understand its travelogue-style of writing -- sort of a Reader's Digest style. It details the anger and frustration of Ghazan's realization that the Iranian government is going to curb his tribe's nomadic lifestyle -- and how he plans to lead his people to a region where they may remain free from Tehran's control. The tribe's trials and sorrowful tribulations experienced during their flight are recounted in this enjoyably easy-reading book. One gets a deep \\"I am there\\" feeling in understanding the hardy life-styles of the men, women and children living in this proud, nomadic tribe -- just before it ends."},{"Title":"This Strange, Old World: And Other Book Reviews by Katherine Anne Porter","review":"The writing of Katherine Anne Porter has slipped out of literary fashion these days -- her sharply-drawn observations and difficult, flawed characters aren't the easy stuff of today's contemporary fiction. Her one major novel, \\"Ship of Fools,\\" was published more than 45 years ago and won the Pulitzer Price in 1962. Her short stories are seldom anthologized, but they are gems of beauty and precision. This collection of published reviews shows Miss Porter, not surprisingly, was just as conscientious and thoughtful about the craft of her fellow authors as she was of her own writing.Although most of the books Miss Porter reviewed were not considered major works, their issues were of obvious interest to her as a writer: history, travel, culture (especially of Mexico), independent women discovering their social and economic equality in American society.It's a rare treat to read criticism that enhances and illuminates its subjects with such grace and style. There are nice touches of wit, too, without being cruel, even with authors that may undoubtedly deserve it. \\"Utopias are steadily on the decline,\\" Miss Porter comments on one author's conclusion that the solution to the rise of feminist ideas is a return to \\"good, old-fashioned, romantic, hearty masculinity.\\" She finds an equal target in Catherine the Great of Russia: \\"Female despots in the making do not suffer from a mother fixation,\\" she writes in a witty review emphasizing Catherine's political -- and marriage -- ambitions.These brief reviews, written mainly on deadline, still echo the finely crafted style of Miss Porter's short stories. They also require the reader to read between the lines; much is implied. But they manage to be entertaining and worthwhile, years later, and anyone interested in Katherine Anne Porter should not miss reading them."},{"Title":"The Atlas of Westward Expansion","review":"Imagine a 100 maps, arranged in chronological order, to resemble time lapse snapshots showing the growth and growing pains of the United States.

When I was warned to have tissues close by I didn't listen as I should have.We meet the three main characters as young children each of them on a very different path. Adam Reid an adventurous child who is beaten into believing that his trip to Rush was a foolish dream. Brigit, a lost orphan believing in fairytales as a way to cope with being alone in the world. And Bridin, a prisoner living on a hope of a future where she is reunited with her sister and returning to their world.

Brigit is hiding something and racing against time to save the only person she has ever loved. Adam knowing all about the myths and legends of fairies knows deep down what Brigit is and is fighting it. As we continue on in the story we follow with Adam and Brigit as they both fight with their childhood dreams of fairytales and the harsh world that has made them stop believing in the first place.The beginning is a slow start but well worth the buildup because the end was amazing knowing what fate has in store for these 3 characters and asking yourself how is \\"happily ever after\\" going to happen for them and then seeing how it all comes together.I was choked up twice during this book and found myself being whisked away into the emotional rollercoaster the last 3 chapters take you through.Overall I was mesmerized by this story and I am dying to read the next in the series.

Charles de Lint's \\"The Onion Girl,\\" Emma Bull's \\"The War for the Oaks,\\" and Terri Windling's \\"The Wood Wife\\" came out of this period.\\"Fairytale\\" is the bodice ripper version of one of the urban elf stories. Abused child Adam Reid grows to be a well intentioned but bitter academic. Orphaned fairy princess Briget, forced into crime to survive, tries to go straight and make it as a small business owner in a college town. Their paths intersect as they wrestle with a few forces of darkness, their own personal demons, and a lot of urges for really hot sex with each other.Some of the plot points were a bit of a stretch. When someone throws hysterics to the point of requiring medical intervention, the EMTs don't just knock her out with a tranq, tuck her into bed, and conveniently depart. Still, it's a cute and readable book."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I downloaded this (free!) book because the plot seemed like it could have great potential. Unfortunately, the potential was wasted and I found myself bored - yet wanting to know how the story ended. I did something I don't normally do... I skimmed until I found passages that seemed to move the plot along. The first 80% of the story is slow moving. So much of the plot and the characters' feeling are rehashed throughout the book. Then the end/resolution moved along very quickly. This would have been much better as a short story/novella.Overall, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Fairytale (Fairies of Rush)I skimmed through most of this book. Through most of the book we were in Brigit & Adams head as they went over and over and over what the other person was thinking and really doing and how they really felt. When we already knew. What we did know was rehashed and rehashed. Very little of the book was spent progressing the story. Just their endless speculating about the other. Then when we finally got back to the story. The ending was rushed. The book was hard to finish. Anything more than free would have been to much to spend on this book. I would not pay for the sequel."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Brigit was left on the steps of the orphanage as a baby with a handmade book called &quot;Fairytale&quot; and a pendant. The nuns told her she was a twin but she could never find proof of a sister. At age nine she ends up living in the streets and eventually earns desparately needed cash but using her amazing ability (magical?) to forge great works of art. She escapes to the straight life when a visitor from the past threatens her into forging a painting owned by Adam. Turns out the painting was painted by the twin and is of a glen in the fairytale world. Adam had stubbled &quot;across&quot; as a child and knows the meaning of the picture. It was in the book and so Brigit knows what it means.The book revolves around the growing romanced between the two as they struggle with both evil humans and their own confusion about the meaning of the painting.It's all pretty farfetched but the book is certainly a pleasant enough read. Not a keeper for me though - no tears or belly laughs."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"My kindle rebooted while I was near finished typing my review on this. Such problems is why I have not wrote any lately but I had to encourage readers to get this for it is a steal be it free or the .99 cents it says is the norm. I purchased it when it came out years ago as a full sized paperback book for the full price of one and it is one of my keepers, still in new condition and much loved. A beautiful cover too, so very enchanting in it'd pink background, elegant script, and if I remember right I think there was a gold web maybe. Remodeling has mine boxed in a closet atm.This is ine of those books I always wished was made into a series. If you even like this a little, you absolutly must read the second book. The world beyond the veil Ms. Shayne takes us to in that one would make an incredible series. I think this is the book that invited me into the worlds woven by Ms. Shayne's magical fingers and I am so glad that the cover caught my attention all those years ago. for her titles take up nearly an entire shelf of mine now.Fairytale is the perfect title for this book. I give it 4 stars just because I haven't read it in years. The delighted memory of it rates at a 5 though, and got me to come peck away a review when I haven't been doing them, and even retype after the reset ate my almost finished first review. That speaks for itself as one fond memory. I loved rhese two books and hope you do too.Write a third in it, please, please!!! :D"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"From the time that Bridget Malone was a very young child, an aging nun had told her she had a twin sister named Bridin. They were both found on the steps of the orphanage, wrapped in identical blankets, and each baby had her own book with her name in it and a crystal necklace. She remains a gifted artist who has overcome her shadowy past, to become the owner of a flourishing business...a florist. Now the past has come back to haunt her. She is charged to copy a painting belonging to a man named Adam Reid. After she refuses, her foster father, the man who saved her from the orphanage fire and took her in, is taken hostage to her good behavior.For Adam, the memories, of a trip into another world when he was a child, have dimmed so much he barely believes them. When he brings the young woman into his home, he knows she is lying about something, but has no idea what it is. He shows her his painting for the first time, he can see how shocked she is. He has no idea that this is the same illustration in the book she has had since infancy.Take a trip with two people who have a connection with the fairy world, but answers are difficult for them to come by. Evil people are set to stop them from ever finding out. Along the way, love blooms bright between them, but Adam knows the fate of the world of fairy must come first. After all, the twins' mother had warned him years before.This was a great work of fairy fiction! The author paints intricate portraits of both the fairy and mortal worlds. The love story was finely drawn, believable, and the romantic scenes were just that...romantic. If you are looking for edge-of-your-seat action, or erotic sex scenes, this isn't the book for you. But if you are looking for a first rate novel about the fairy world, you have found it! Cudos, Ms. Shayne! This one goes on my Kindle 'keeper' shelf. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Magic, mystery, love, betrayal, and twins separated at birth. This book has it all. It does have a typical romance type plot.

I really enjoyed this book and will definitely read other novels by her."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I have read quite a few fairy books in my time. I picked up a copy of this book when it was for free several months ago through Amazon Prime. It is an INCREDIBLE read. I loved how it was worded, how smoothly the story progressed, and as scary as it seems; it's as if Maggie Shayne and I could possibly share a brain! I just loved it a lot. Adam Reid was a wonderful character that I felt I could relate to. I wish there had been more mention of Bridin and Mr. Darque, but otherwise I have no complaints. It was simply fantastic."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"There are some erotic parts in this book so it is not for young adults.I loved this book! It was really good. This book was really cozy actually. I liked that the book is written from several people's point of view, that makes it really interesting to read. How often does one not wonder what the H*ll he/she was thinking! Well you will in this book!I also loved the characters Brigit and Adam. They have both have hard times growing up and it has marked them in different ways. Adam is very cynic and mistrusting of people but he is completely captivated by Brigit. Brigit on the other hand has been forced to do things she is not proud of in order to survive and it makes her think she might not be worthy of a happy ending of her own.It was such a lovely story and I definitively recommend this book. It was a perfect after work light reading that lifted my mood after a long tiring day at work."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"This book was very entertaining and a fast read. I kept on rooting for Adam and Brigit. I would definitely recommend it. Some readers thought this was listed under a teen book, not to give anything away but....the sex scenes in my opinion while not r rated would definitely make this at least a PG15 book. All in all a fast book and the greatest thing...FREE!"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"The book is a nice escape from the day to day grind and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys to read Fairy books. The only thing that bothered me about the book is that the author uses the words \\"God\\", \\"Jesus\\",\\"Jesus Christ\\" etc. way too often. I usually don't even notice little filler words like those but in this case it was just a little over board. Other than that it's a nice, smooth read into the lives of these characters. The author fleshed the story out very well and it is just a pleasure to escape into the dream world the author created."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Maggie Shayne keeps you on the edge of your seat with the Fairies of Rush books.

I read so much that the cheaper the better.I thought this was a well written book for the price of nothing. I thought plot was well developed and could have been just a bit more fuller than the romance part. There were the cheesy one-liners that deterred from the main story line. All in all I thought it was a great read. So much so that I paid the regular price for the companion book about the twin sister that is mentioned in this book."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"wonderful read! characters were so alive & the story moved along nicely. difficult to put down!thank you for this fun story!"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"This is one of those books that you hate to see end.

Olson:I've had Fairytale on my Kindle for quite some time. I had even started it once upon a time but was pulled away for something else and never ended up finishing it. I'm a huge Maggie Shayne fan and I can't say exactly why I hadn't finished reading it before now. Once I sat down and restarted it again though, I was kicking myself for not having done it sooner. I was thoroughly enchanted.The YA tags for this book are completely misleading and I can't blame the reviewers who went in expecting a YA, got something completely different, and therefore gave it low ratings. It's not a young adult novel, it's a beautifully written adult fairytale. :)Adam is one of those heroes that you can't help but love because while he's smart, sexy and confident, he's also a bit tortured. Plagued by memories and dreams that caused thoughts he was punished for having, he's made it his life's work to try and understand.Brigit is a wonderful heroine. She's sassy, tough, and multi-dimensional. Torn between what she knows is right and what she's forced to do, she scrapes through life the best she can and overcomes some pretty hefty obstacles. She also deals with the fear that she might be a bit crazy, though in her heart she knows she's not.The two of them together are amazing. A literal fairytale written by fate, it doesn't come easy for our leading couple. When they finally figure things out though, it's an emotional roller coaster of epic proportions.When a book pulls you along, mesmerized, and ends with such emotion that it has your heart close to bursting & you close to tears, you know it was good!While not the fastest paced read in the beginning, it was beautifully built, magically crafted, & wonderfully concluded. I can't wait to see what's next in the FAIRIES OF RUSH series.LITERAL ADDICTION gives Fairytale 4 1/2 Skulls and would recommend it to fantasy and paranormal romance readers who are searching for an emotional and action packed read."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"While searching for books on my kindle I kept skipping over this book over and over and over. One day I ran out of other books tht I wanted to purchase and kept trying to find. So I bought it on a whim....didn't read the reviews didn't read the synopsis bought because I have so many of Maggie Shayne's other books. AND am I ever glad I finally bought it. I have kicked myelf in the butt so many times I laughed and cried, and got angry and tht to me is a truelly great book, if you can feel all those things read a book. I recommend this book to anyone tht like PNR. After reading this book and find out it had second I automatically bought it. I want there to be a MORE."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Although the book seemed a little slow to start, once I got into it more I couldn't put it down. Definately a must read especially if you are on a tight budget and like books with a otherworldly type feel. Not what I would classify as a young adult read but then it depends on the reader and how mature they may be. Very different from Ms. Shaynes Wings in the Night series but definately worth a second look. Can't wait to read the second of the stories in this short series."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I highly recommend if you like Maggie shayne. Great fantasy love story. Had to download second in series right away"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"FAIRYTALE has an interesting opening and the final section of the novel is a page-turner. In between it is quite uneven. Pages {and pages and pages} are devoted to an exploration of the Angst-ridden personalities of the hero and heroine. Adam, at least, has a believable source for his difficulties. On the other hand, Brigit is a plot-forced character and her reluctance to share vital information with Adam is not believable and seriously takes from the book. I found myself wading through many of her irrational, torturous and laborious self-justifications with utter boredom. Another problem is that Brigit discovers certain protective innate magical powers. Yet the author never really uses them to inform the plot. So why have them? On the other hand, some of the love scenes--particularly the Dance are quite moving.It is worth pointing out that this is an adult book and it has a number of quite explicit scenes--in fact, perhaps they were too explicit and could well have been replaced by a more delicate approach which would have helped deepen Brigit's character.The conclusion is well constructed with a satisfying conclusion which still leaves room for a sequel."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I got this book because it was a free download and because of the 4-5 star reviews. It is only because I wanted to give this a fair chance, that I was able to endure this story to its conclusion. This book told everything at least twice from 2-3 different POV's and repeated and reiterated the story's basic points and the characters feelings over and over again. Add to that the excessive swearing limited to GD's and JC's and you just have a tedious, and impertinent narrative. The biography shows this author to be well published, so, although my own views are apparently in the minority, I had to give this my honest opinion.Bridin and Brigit are royal faerie twins rescued from the land of Rush when their parents are murdered by the evil Darque's(?) Family. Adam stumbles upon the pregnant queen before she is murdered and told to unite the sisters and show them the way home at the appointed time. He is warned not to fall in love as it will only break his heart. The sisters are raised separately and must reunited in order to get access into Rush. One is being held by the Darque(?) family and the other finds her way to Adam. She doesn't believe the fairy tale is true and Adam has had so much pain and bad things happen in his life that he is a cynic and does not trust his memory of meeting the fairy queen. MUCH of the story centers around Adam and Brigit refusing to believe what is right in front of them, much to the nausea of the reader.Things I disliked: 1) The whole prelude and first two chapters could have been abbreviated. The same thoughts are regurgitated over and over, which is just not interesting! 2) Brigit assess Adam every time she looks at him, telling the reader the same thing every time: he has conflicting emotions, wariness suspicion, well-worn anger, but basically a good man that she has lusted after and had relations with in her dreams. 3) Repeated phrases: \\"He knows I am playing him\\" \\"She can see right through me\\". The inner turmoil is interminable. 4) They both spend lots of time denying the truth of what they have seen in their past as not being real. 5) Adam continually tells us about her bewitching hold over him, being able to see into his soul and the danger of falling for her. 7) Brigit's background is reiterated several times. 8) Brigit's and her sister Bridin's name are too similar. I couldn't distinguish between them at the beginning of the story.This book could have been half the size and still said the same thing. I persevered until the end, but would never do it again. The cover art and title may be misleading, so understand that this is an adult novel that contains adult situations, sex and profanity.Would I/Did I buy it? Free DownloadWould I read it again? NoWould I recommend it to friends? No"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a whimsical story of love and intrigue. It is a read I would recommend to others. Maggie Shayne delivers a page turner again, as always."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"I own some much better books written by Maggie Shayne; please don't judge the author by this story. I couldn't find the will to finish more than half. Maybe it was written by the author as a pre-teen? If so, it would explain quite a bit. Not worth the time it took to download."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"This book had so much potential. I love the plot. It's just a shame that more time is spent describing the character's desire for each other than on developing that plot. I give the author credit, she thought of a lot of different words and phrases to describe these feelings. That took more imagination than I would have thought possible. I really wish she would have just used a couple sentences where a couple sentences were more than enough. Instead, these feeling of desire are described at great length at every few paragraphs. I got it already, there is a magnetic attraction between the two, so strong it defies the human definition of desire. Now can we spend some time on the story?"},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Loved this book. Maggie has a way of writing the most amazing stories that have to do with anything paranormal. Love the magic element in this. Hope there's more to come."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"To be honest, most romance makes me gag - paranormal romance makes me gag and moan and I don't mean in a good way. But I do love the fey folk, and so when this book was available free on Kindle, I had to at least give it a try.Don't let the genre fool you. This is a well written, engaging, interesting tale that I could hardly put down. I just bought the next book in the series. I can't wait to get started on it.I'm not sure I can express exactly why I like it so much. I think perhaps because the characters are believable, and the story line is fairly logical. There is some good hot sex that isn't laughable or insanely exaggerated, nor does it take over the storyline.Twin fairy princesses are unfortunately parted after being brought to the mundane world for their protection by their human father. One grows up well aware of her heritage, the other is raised in an orphanage and ends up living on the street under the protection of a bum. But they can only return to win their kingdom if they both return. The older (by one minute) sister must find the younger and then they must find the portal to the fairy land.As a child Adam Reid stumbled on that portal and was shown a glimpse of his future by a fairy queen - the mother of the twins. His abusive father beats the fantasies out of the boy - or at least he tries to. Now a responsible adult, Adam has one cherished possession - a painting by an unknown artist that is of the magical fairy kingdom he remembers. The painting itself is magical, and is the instrument that brings the three together to make their destiny come true.This is a very good read that transcends the genre."},{"Title":"Fairytale","review":"Fairytale by Maggie Shayne reviewI have had Fairytale by Maggie Shayne for months, I got it free from Amazon and had been meaning to read it for a while but my TBR list was just so long. Now that I have read it I can't believe I waited so long. This book was so much better than I ever imagined it to be. I saw it put on some shelves on Goodreads as YA and I am not a huge fan of YA books anymore so that had stopped me from picking it up even though I am a big fan of Maggie Shayne. This is not a YA book, it is a wonderful adult Fairytale. It is about Brigit and Adam and how the events in your childhood affect you as you grow up. It's about lost dreams that cause so much pain you shy away from any dream. My heart was in my throat for a huge part of this book. I felt for Brigit and Adam and I felt as though I was fighting for them to give in to their dreams and believe that things would work out. It reminded me of my own childhood dreams and about the innocence of those dreams. If you're looking for a book with a lot of magic, a great love story and enough heat and suspense to keep you excited along the way then this is a great book for you.I gave this book 5 stars.

They have probed deeply into the personalities and passions of individuals and groups who were players during much of the four-year period of our great Civil War.In the early stages of the war, our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, declared his first priority was the preservation of the Union - at any cost. This man and this determination, for me, became an interesting backdrop for the strife that preceded and ensued. At stake were great issues of the day - slavery, secession, white supremacy, states rights and many civil liberties, i.e. habeas corpus, freedom of speech in the press and on the soapbox. Other items of contention were illegal imprisonment, seizures and confiscation of property and the interpretation of the Constitution of the United States as to primacy vs. elasticityDuring these years fierce accusations of passivity, participation in, or even direction of abridgments of civil rights were hurled at Lincoln, especially by an archenemy, publisher John Hodgson of West Chester, Pennsylvania. Was Lincoln guilty of riding roughshod over various civil rights and manipulation of the press? If he did, was there a shred of justification for it? At the end of the book we are left to define for ourselves what civil rights we regard as inviolable and absolute at any cost, vis a vis the powers given or assumed by our nation's chief executive officer in times of extraordinary national peril. Such issues are still relevant and hotly debated today. A provocative book!"},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"Lincoln's Wrath by Jeffrey Manber and Neil Dahlstrom paints our 16th President as being somewhat less saintly than he has been generally depicted after his martyrdom. The book focuses on one particular Copperhead Pennsylvania newspaper publisher whose business property was confiscated by the Federal government. No specific charges were made against him following Lincoln's repeal of the Constitutional guarantee of the right of habeas corpus. Eventually the publisher had his day in court and won damages from the government. Many other publishers of pro-Democratic party newspapers in the North were imprisoned without charges after editorializing that there was no law against a state seceding or other opinions in sympathy with the Southern cause. Congressmen and state legislators were similarly jailed without charges, most notably the secessionist minded members of the Maryland General Assembly. The authors try to convince us that the heavy-handed actions of the administration during the Civil War permanently centralized Federal power, particularly that of the President, in a way unimagined by our founding fathers. Although we are left to judge for ourselves whether the methods of the President, his cabinet, his marshals and fellow party members in Congress were warranted. The book required ten years of research. The result is well worth our attention, since similarly tough decisions could again confront our elected officials."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"This is a refreshing, though at times complex, look at Lincoln told from the side of the \\"loyal opposition.\\" Lincoln's Wrath is a tale of greed and revenge during the Civil War, mixing familiar names from history with the editors and politicians that get overlooked by Lincoln biographies. It tells the story of John Hodgson, the publisher of the Jeffersonian in West Chester, Pennsylvania, whose editorials in opposition of the Lincoln administration offer glimpses into the constitutional debate over civil liberties during the war. Even after his office is mobbed, and then seized by government agents, Hodgson spends years fighting back while many of his colleagues languished in northern prisons. Mixed in are the stories of politicians, attorneys and others who put their lives at risk, as a result of the north/south conflict. As the book jacket says, this is certainly an overdue, untold story of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"This book has many quality elements. It is thoroughly researched ensuring the authenticity of the story. At times, the story is quite fascinating making it difficult to put it down. Finally, it is thought provoking by introducing new Civil War era American heroes while making usually subtle, and sometimes not so subtle connections to current politics."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"All comparisons to the Bush Administration and the current political landscape aside, this is a very interesting story. This gives the reader a look at the other Lincoln from the viewpoint of those oppressed by his administration. Even though he is considered a great president today, and deservedly so, to think that he had a hand in obstructing free press in this country is shocking.This books gives us a look into the lives of a number of interesting figures that otherwise may have been swept under the rug of history never to have had their stories told. Thankfully the authors have done a nice job of bringing this story to light."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"In the mainstream focus over military battles, and the rejuvenation of Lincoln mythology in Steven Spielberg's new film, the civil cost of the war is conveniently dropped from view. This book is one of the few to rescue that vision. Like all wartime leaders, Lincoln demanded and enforced national unity. There has not been a wartime US president who has not trampled comstitutional due process to some degree for the same reason. \\"In a state of war, the laws are slow\\" (p. 154).As noted, the book does suffer from some sloppy writing. Also placing these actions in the context of larger civil suppressions of \\"Copperhead\\" politicians and other antiwar elements, rather than a narrow focus on journalistic restriction, might have helped. Yet it not only sounds a predictable warning over modern Homeland Security statutes, but illuminates other infractious periods. Joseph McCarthy and HUAC were not the unprecedented anamolies many take them for.Other leaders in other nations also took inspiration from the Railsplitter's firm lines: \\"Those who are not for us are against us; every tie of friendship and association must yield to our love of country.\\" Thus when Fidel Castro stood at the feet of the Lincoln Monument during his '59 tour, he may have imbibed more of the Great Emancipator's spirit than given credit for. Perhaps a lingering guilt leads Washington to despise the reflection."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"Lincoln has always been heralded as a hero - and rightly so. And yet we learn from this book that even he has some secrets in the shadows! A very compelling read that will give you a better understanding of the Civil War and how it was fought."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"The two authors disagree. One, despite ten years of primary evidence, still wants to cling to the sanitized view of Lincoln. It's hard to let our idols go. To his credit, Manber has done the difficult thing. At first I thought, what a pity this book couldn't have gone all the way, but then it would have most certainly been pilloried in the press, at best, and at worst ignored. As it is, it's been featured on national television. The co-authors have been wise. The Lincoln apologist of the two is the one that gets trotted out to make the appearances and make the statements ---even here on amazon.com. Wise marketting! The book that does go all the way, however, is already published. It is Thomas DiLorenzo's THE REAL LINCOLN, now available in paperback, and is a must read for anyone who is buying LINCOLN'S WRATH. In fact, I'd read it first, then follow with this one. This said, LINCOLN'S WRATH does some things THE REAL LINCOLN does not. It focusses on the 12,000 political prisoners Lincoln took in the North, and the 120 editors of newspapers in the North that Lincoln silenced. There is no doubt in my mind that he had a hand in it, just as he had in the horrors of the prison camp Camp Douglas in Chicago, a camp that makes Andersonville look good. The Reign of Terror which Lincoln fomented and kept up relentlessly seems to me to be a part of sado-masochistic psychological problems displayed clearly in his private and public lives. We always say that he did all these \\"hard\\" things like making war on civilians, arresting dissidents, overthrowing habeas corpus, etc. etc. because he had the nation in mind. Rather, I say that from the beginning of his career; his overweening ambition (which even the Lincoln apologists admit) combined with self-esteem problems; a frightening maliciousness grown out of personal slights; sexual irregularities; the demons of depression leading to constant thoughts of suicide (before and during his presidency) all were volatile elements of his personality that perhaps help explain the roots of his actions. Even his virulent racism may be seen as an expression of his knowing that most in Springfield, Illinois, looked down on the ambitious lawyer as being slyly dishonest, crude, ugly, and essentially \\"white trash\\". Poor Mary Todd. She always takes the blame doesn't she? But she had money and status, and her ambitious husband-to-be needed them. Further, she apparently let Lincoln have his sexual irregularities. (Might this explain her temper tantrums in the White House? All those soldiers in the Lincoln bedroom raised lots of eyebrows. Poor woman. She had a lot to bear.) And unfortunately, we today also share in that burden. When will the myth-makers of American history honestly face facts and desanitize our history? As long as we keep up the charades based on Lincoln's centralization of power for robber barons in the making, we will keep on repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Those who think it is patriotic to praise Lincoln, ironically, are being just the opposite. They keep entrenching the lie that could lead to the destruction of all the values Old America has stood for. LINCOLN'S WRATH is a good step in the direction of de-mythologizing American history and thus of setting us on a sound basis for the future. Here is true patriotism, as it would seem to me. I hope we'll hear more from Manber, especially."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"Imagine if Woodward and Bernstein couldn't agree about whether Richard Nixon had commited impeachable offenses. Authors Jeffrey Manber and Neil Dahlstrom introduce their interesting book by conceding that after ten years of research and the publication of \\"Lincoln's Wrath,\\" they remain in disagreement about whether The Great Emancipator was justified in shutting down opposition newspapers at the height of the Civil War.The book's protagonist is John Hodgson, whose West Chester, PA. newspaper \\"The Jeffersonian,\\" a harsh critic of Lincoln's cabinet though sympathetic to Lincoln personally, was the victim of a mob attack in 1861. His printing office and equipment were destroyed; then after the stubborn Hodgson started over again, he was shut down by federals claiming jurisdiction under the new Confiscation Act, which gave the government the power to seize any property deemed to have been used in behalf of the rebellion. Hodgson's fate was hardly unique, but only he had the temerity to sue for the return of his newspaper while his rivals accepted the loss of their businesses.The authors began their research over 10 years ago, surely without intuiting how timely their subject would become. As with the present controversy surrounding Iraq, an incumbent administration claims extraordinary war powers in apparent violation of the Constitution. Another common thread is the alliance between government and friendly businesses...as Halliburton has profited from Iraq, so did Republican newspapers profit handsomely by the shutdown of Democratic papers in 1861.The Bush administration's challenge to the Constitution will seem like history repeating itself to readers, albeit the circumstances cannot be compared to the dilemma that faced Lincoln. Washington was surrounded by a Confederate state (Virginia) and a Union state that threatened to secede (Maryland). If the nation's capital were seized by the Confederacy, the war would be lost; thus Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus and even his approval of seizing opposition newspapers must be considered in the context of an immediate threat to the nation's survival. Bush can claim no such justification for illegally spying on American citizens.The authors have produced a compelling book. It's a shame they didn't hire a competent editor. Throughout, the text confuses the words \\"principal\\" and \\"principle,\\" \\"whoever\\" and \\"whomever,\\" \\"reign\\" and \\"rein,\\" and \\"rout\\" and \\"route.\\" Readers who look beyond these flaws will find much to appreciate in \\"Lincoln's Wrath.\\""},{"Title":"Lincoln's Wrath","review":"The authors explore an interesting case, and if you focus just on the facts, you'll probably learn some things you didn't know. I certainly did. However, the book would have benefited from better editing. 1.) There are a number of sloppy typos. 2.) There are inexcusable errors in fact (I suspect the authors don't REALLY believe that the Battle of Fredericksburg occurred in northern Maryland as they write on p274) 3.) And, as someone else noted, the language sometimes becomes so overwrought that it's difficult to take the book as a serious work of history.However, the history of the Jeffersonian newspaper poses some difficult questions about the role of freedom-of-the-press in a country embroiled in a bloody civil war."},{"Title":"Public Administration: Balancing Power and Accountability Second Edition","review":"Most of the times decision making in public administration is bound by forces that are beyond the public administrator's control.

If you begin with the club book and progress through the series as they increase in difficulty... club, diamond, heart and spade you will be able to teach yourself how to become proficient in bridge painlessly. Her books are written in lesson formats... and they are used by many people who instruct bridge classes i.e. adult ed. Buy one... I'm sure you'll add the other three to your library.

It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, but not in the same class as Eileen Shapiro, The Seven Deadly Sins of Business.The theme is that too many businesses have taken their eye off the ball. The critical requirement for success is looking after productivity. Successive chapters look at how corporate accounts conceal what is happening to this fundamental and how resources are wasted in 'incentivized packages', advertising, IT, greenwashing and so on.As is true of all this genre, the author has a case, but oversimplifies it for dramatic effect. But most businesses would benefit from reflecting whether they are committing any of these sins."},{"Title":"Corporate Vices, Business Virtues: What to do When Your Corporation is Suffocating","review":"This book an interesting treatise on the problems (Vices) impacting business today. They run from an unrealistic belief in advertising to mispaying top talent. The solution - productivity, defined as producing more than what is used or input.The author brings an interesting background to the story. As founder of Beenz, he has seen the ups and downs of the so called New Economy. Even at a young age, he's had more real life experience than most business writers, who seem to write more from the consultant's point of view. In addition, the book has a refreshing non-American bent, which is unique in the high tech world.The content is much deeper than \\"the New Economy was a sham\\" - it really does touch fundamental issues of business. Corporate execs sometimes to do get on Mergers & Acquisitions sprees that are in their own interests, if not their shareholders. Companies do sometimes spend a lot of energy on corporate citizenship, even if it's just PR. Dealing with these vices is important for companies, and worth thinking about.So why not 5 stars?1 - The book claims that productivity is the only thing that's important. That's kind of misleading based on his definition of productivity. Maybe productivity is a simple thing to say, but it appears that the author was alternatively meaning efficiency of capital or positive cash flow.2 - I think that it's dangerous and incorrect to oversimplify the business world as \\"Here's everything that's wrong, but if you follow this one plan/idea/metric...\\" There is no silver bullet, and there is a reason that the market is right in the long term. Productivity is important, but it's not the only thing.Not rocket science, but nonetheless very worthwhile. Still worth a read, even if it's now a bit dated."},{"Title":"Random House Webster's Pocket American Sign Language Dictionary (Pocket Reference Guides)","review":"I have this on me 24/7.

It really only contains the very most common words. It also doesn't take into account regional dialects, so it may have a sign but not the version you need locally.However, for beginner signers, including those who wish to learn and teach sign with babies and young children (or in a classroom setting), this is an incredible quick and handy reference.I especially like the fact that illustrations feature full torsos of the signers as well as facial expression.

She can't decide if her nervousness or her impulsive enthusiasm is to blame for the beads of sweat forming on her forehead as her jittery legs take her down the hallway. She stands before the big double doors and decides she is ready to enter the world of on the spot medicine.As she walks through the doorway to the emergency room she stops abruptly and allows a small gasp to escape from her lips. The turmoil and noise is overwhelming. Her eyes scan the room as she tries to comprehend what she has gotten herself into. Every available bed is occupied. A young woman covered in blood is in one bed moaning a rhythmic beat, a wailing child is in the next bed, and an old man yelling for a nurse is in the next. A tiny woman is muttering to herself as she mops us vomit from the tiled floor. The student nurse closes her eyes as she considers turning around and sprinting out of the building. Something deep inside tells her that she and her new career will have a love-hate relationship.In her autobiography, Intensive Care, (Atheneum, 1987, 370 pgs.), Echo Heron relates the story of her nursing career from her early training in the mid 1970's to the burnout she suffered toward the end of her work twenty years later. Heron compels the reader to wonder why anyone would be drawn to this occupation and why anyone, even the most caring, would want to leave it.The author's narrative reveals how she had the desire to make people's lives better from the age of eight but didn't pursue her dream until she spent many years working as a legal secretary. Heron was a divorced single mother of three and one-half year old Simon when she decided to follow her dream and apply to nursing school. She wasn't alone in her journey, her best friend Jane had applied at the same time. Together they were ready to save the world in their white stockings, crisp white uniforms, and the obligatory nurse's cap pinned to their hair. Heron quickly discovers the nursing program is extremely demanding. Intense studying into the night and long days striving to get through clinicals leaves her exhausted, skeptical, and reminiscing about the benign and boring days she spent as a legal secretary. Heron's resolve and determination prevails though even after fainting the first time she tries to inject a patient.Faced with some of the ugliest of humanity and the pain people inflict on one another, the emergency room must be one of the most troublesome areas in a hospital for a nurse to work.Though difficult, Heron learns to love the work in the emergency room. She thrives on the adrenaline rush created by the often chaotic atmosphere. The compassionate act of healing another human being among the onslaught of many patients at one time is what she has been training for. As Heron relates early in the book, \\"The familiar subtle thrill began to well up inside me as I walked to the nurse's station. Even though I had memorized my lines for the scene, no one ever really knew what was going to happen\\" (4). In one instance, Heron is assigned to work in the emergency room while she is still in training. Early one morning a man brought his wife to the hospital with burns covering 75% of her body. The couple had been drinking heavily the night before and the wife had passed out while smoking a cigarette. The husband wouldn't let her call paramedics for fear of disturbing the neighbors so they waited three hours for him to sober up. He dropped her off at the emergency room doors and headed to the bar. Compassion is not easily shown when confronted with human beings harming one another.Children are frequently the most rewarding, frustrating, and heartbreaking of all patients to care for. Heron describes many stories of working on children especially in the emergency room. Most of the stories have happy endings but some endings are particularly sorrowful. Heron relates the story of one such unhappy ending in chapter six of Intensive Care (52). An exhausted looking mother brought her young toddler into the emergency room. The child is unresponsive as the medical team rushes him into a trauma room while the harried mother is escorted to a quiet waiting room. It was discovered while interviewing the mother that her son had wandered into the family's backyard pool while she was napping on the couch in the family room. Heron, still a student nurse, was given the task of informing the child's mother that despite the doctor's best efforts, her son was dead. As Heron struggles to come up with the right words to say, she realizes nothing about this is right. Tears fill her eyes as she thinks of her own son, who is safe at home, and the mothering instinct blends with her nurse's training as she finds the words to speak to the grief stricken mother who just lost her only child. As Heron explains, \\"Nothing I thought of saying would come close to touching the woman's anguish. In the end I said nothing at all and rocked her in my arms\\" (88). No amount of training prepares nurses for this moment. It's just another time where their heart leads them to do the right thing.The population of intensive care units is often terminally ill patients. Instead of healing the sick and releasing them, nurses are frequently conflicted by tending the sick while they face their final days of life. Heron accepts a position in the intensive care unit when she graduates from nursing school. She is passionate about her work in this department although she finds it difficult to come to grips with the mortality rate of the patients she cares for. The recollection ofthese people and the continuing fight to sustain life in these patients bleeds into her personal life and memory banks on a daily basis. Heron describes the scene as one of her favorite patients, Turk, is dying. \\"Joe bent over from the waist, placed the paddles on Turk's chest, and jolted him with four hundred-watt seconds of electricity. It was one of those certain sounds that stayed with me, never to be lost from recall\\" (235). Inevitably, Heron takes her work home with her which slowly becomes a contributing factor of the burnout she suffers.Death is a natural part of life. Quite often, especially working in the intensive care unit, part of the author's duties was to increase the level of pain medication given to a terminally ill patient. Knowing that by increasing these levels nurses are essentially speeding up the progression of death goes totally against the oath a nurse takes to save and preserve lives. Heron often struggles with this during her career as saving lives is what her goal has been from a young age. Freeing people from pain for which there is no other release is another part of nursing.Echo Heron was born in Troy, New York. She moved to San Francisco in 1967 and worked as a legal secretary for eight years. Heron went back to college to become a registered nurse in 1975 and worked for the next 20 years as a nurse in emergency rooms and intensive care units in hospitals along the west coast. In 1983 she submitted a story that was printed in the Reader's Digest and from that was contacted by a publishing house to write an autobiographicalaccount of her life as a critical care nurse. Intensive Care quickly rose to the New York Times bestseller list where it stayed at number one for two months. Heron has written an additionalseven books, both fiction and nonfiction, all dealing with the medical field. She is currently an activist for patient and nurse's rights and a public speaker while working on additional books.In their review The New York Daily News reports, \\"Echo Heron is a very special nurse dedicated to healing and helping in the harshest environments. Intensive Care is unique, penetrating, and unforgettable. Her story is real.\\" Heron does a wonderful job in taking her audience through a passionate and often painful look at nursing. Nursing has many times been characterized as an overworked, underappreciated choice of occupations but it has never been described as being glamorous.Intensive Care is recommended to anyone interested in employment in the healthcare industry. The author shares her frustrations as well as triumphs as she puts into perspective the real inner workings of a hospital and the naivety of prospective student nurses entering the medical field. Little things like shaving an elderly man, foot rubs, wiping brows, and talking to unconscious people are important to the patient as well as the nurse. Heron's writing requires the reader to contemplate the decision to make nursing a career as she soundly illustrates both the challenges and rewards of nursing."},{"Title":"Intensive Care: The Story of a Nurse","review":"As an ICU/CVICU RN I loved this book...

The reality and detail of the human life portrayed in the pages of this book reminds us of the universal experience of what it is to live.

Was she the only good student in her nursing classes? According to her, you'd think so! In her hospital tales (which ar equite entertaining), she seems to know more than the doctors and much more experienced nurses. Some parts are a bit dramatic.

But I can trulysay that after reading Echo Heron's book, I am amazed. Truly amazed. First and foremost, the writingis so wonderful. Captivating from the very get-go, my attention and enthusiasm for this book did notwaver and only grew with each page.I'm going to go out on a limb and compare this book to my favorite ice cream, which is Graeter's coconutchocolate chip. Put a gallon of that good stuff in front of me, and I won't stop heaving spoon fromcontainer to mouth and back again until the gallon is empty. That's exactly how I feel about \\"IntensiveCare: The Story of a Nurse.\\" Folks, I just couldn't get enough of this book. I really couldn't. I lovedhow the author coupled personal details about her own journey with stories from her experience as an RN. Ilaughed and I cried, and her story is not only relevant to nurses or those looking to become a nurse orenter a medical profession, but also to all of those who have struggled in this journey we call life.In other words, this book has a little something for everyone.Because of this book, I have a new found respect for nurses. I actually know the profession pretty well, butEcho's book really brought the intimate daily machinations of our average nurse down to this reading man'slevel. I so appreciate the author's efforts to educate the public about nursing. And trust me, if you're onthe fence about reading this book (as I was), don't hesitate. You'll be a better person after reading thisinformative and emotionally spell-binding read.Bravo, bravo, bravo!"},{"Title":"Intensive Care: The Story of a Nurse","review":"I bought this book because I am starting pre-nursing next semester and can't learn enough about the field in the meantime. I had started reading another nurse's memoirs in the bookstore but was bored so I went back to the shelf and picked this one up. A few minutes later I was tearing up right there in my big cushy public chair sipping overpriced iced coffee. I really thought I was going to lose it, the first story was so touching. I read all day that day whenever I had the chance because it is so engaging. I have laughed out loud many times and stifled tears as well. I have lost sleep because I could not put it away before finding out how a couple of stories ended. My husband laid in bed watching me read with a dropped jaw and saying, \\"Good Lord!\\", waiting for the moment I would finally turn off the light and let him sleep. This book is excellent prep material for facing the realities of nursing (someday), yet it is not discouraging or disheartening. She tells you why it is worth the bumps and struggles.

It only gives a few hints on Jewish colonization - as if this was not the most important subject. Even if the book is written by an Israeli Jew, it recounts not the history of Israel, but of Palestine, not of Zionism but of ordinary Palestinians.The author is very sympathetic to the Palestinian narrative. In a way, this gives the idea that very much of the debate for and against Zionism is quite an intra-Jewish question (as if it were a sort of a family-problem).Ilan Pappe succeeded in his job. His work is based on the knowledge of anthropological, social-religious questions, such as: How do groups build their own identities using national or religious narratives? His diagnoses of how groups invent themselves thanks to religions, and of what Jewish and Islamic fundamentalism mean, are careful and precise.All the relevant facts are expounded, but this is not the principal interest of the book. I do not believe this is going to be the first text someone reads on the Israel/Palestine question - this means that who reads already knows the principal facts and the most important dates. The most interesting facts are expounded with an eye on what they meant for the most deprived strata of society (for example: how were Sephardi Jews \\"accepted\\" in Israel? Who bore the brunt of racism, in Israel and in the Occupied Territories?).The book ends with an eye of the future: will the war between Israel and Palestine end, without an end to Israeli colonization? Will it end, before Israel recognizes what 1948 meant, for Palestine and Palestinian refugees?"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"Pappe, the intellectually courageous Israeli \\"New Historian,\\" has written a superb history for general readers. What's unusual about this book is (1) its attempt to present the histories of both peoples, (2) its effort to get outside the potted nationalist narratives of both peoples, and (3) its profound solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggles against expulsion and occupation. As Pappe says, \\"This book is written by one who admits compassion for the colonized, not the colonizer; who sympathizes with the occupied and not the occupiers; and sides with the workers not the bosses. He feels for women in distress, and has little admiration for men in command.\\"Pappe locates the struggle for land at the very center of this narrative, and he does not hesitate to call the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 an act of \\"ethnic cleansing,\\" proceeding under the aegis of the Zionist \\"Plan D,\\" which systematically drove 700,000 Palestinian Arabs from their villages. At the same time, he notes the chronically ineffective Palestinian leadership, from the clan rivalries of Palestinian \\"notables\\" that made any unified resistance to British and Zionist encroachments impossible, to the top-down rule of the Palestinian Authority, which cooperated in the disaster of Oslo and sidelined average, suffering Palestinians in Israel, under occupation, and in exile. He notes the complexities of opinion and experience among Jews in Palestine and Israel, including those early Zionists who hoped from the beginning for a binational secular state, and the Mizrahi or Arab Jews, who faced considerable discrimination at the hands of Ashkenazi or European Jews. And with a realistic but hopeful eye on Palestine's future, he highlights what \\"The Urge for Co-habitation\\" in Mandate Palestine, and even in Israel. He finds resources for hope in the history of his own Haifa during the 1920s, when it \\"became the site of the most exciting experience of class solidarity and bi-national, or even a-national cooperation.\\" For instance, Jewish workers and Arab workers (Palestinian, Syrian, and Egyptian) came together in the first Palestinian trade union, which united workers in the railway, telegraphic, and postal services against their British employers.Pappe's keen, historians' eye for the complexities of lived experience on both sides is particularly welcome today, when reductive scholar-warriors like Benny Morris are willing to present Palestine's past and future as a conflict between Zionist \\"civilization\\" and Arab-Islamic \\"barbarism,\\" and when Ariel Sharon seems to see a wall of concrete tombstones festooned with guard towers as Israel's last best hope."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"This is a history of Palestine and its inhabitants from Ottoman rule to the Intifadas of 1987 and 2000. It complements, but does not replace, Avi Shlaim's superlative, and presciently titled, book \`The Iron Wall'.Palestine's British rulers tried from 1918 to get the two peoples to build a British protectorate, but failed. After the British allowed a division of the unitary economic system in 1929, Jewish leaders built up an independent, privileged Zionist enclave. They mobilised the Jews by intensifying enlistment, imposing coercive taxes, preventing emigration and encouraging immigration.In the 1948 war, the Zionist leaders, under the cover of a war of national liberation against the British Empire and its puppet Arab royals, expelled most Palestinians from their homes. Pappe writes of the Zionists' military Plan D's two aims: \\"the first being to take swiftly and systematically any installation, military or civilian, evacuated by the British. ... The second, and far more important objective, of the plan was to cleanse the future Jewish state of as many Palestinians as possible.\\" Atrocities carried out by Zionist forces, including the massacres at Dir Yassin and Balad al-Shaykh, forced 690,000 Palestinians to flee under threat of death.Decades of partition and occupation followed. Now Israel is building yet more illegal settlements, blockading the Palestinians (causing 50% unemployment), manning an electric fence around the Gaza Strip, abusing people at checkpoints, demolishing houses, assassinating at will, conducting mass arrests, torturing detainees, and building a wall dividing the West Bank from Israel. In the last three years, Israeli forces have killed 2,750 Palestinian civilians, and Palestinian suicide bombers have killed 892 Israeli civilians.The US state massively subsidises the Israeli state. Bush fully backs Sharon the career terrorist: ten days after assuming the Presidency, Bush told the National Security Council, \\"We're going to correct the imbalances of the previous administration on the Mideast conflict. We're going to tilt it back towards Israel.\\"US and EU interference have inflamed, not resolved, the conflict. Outside attempts to achieve a solution by backing one people against another will always fail."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"Ilan Pappe is often referred to as a &quot;revisionist&quot; historian from Israel. His work published in 2004, &quot;A History of Modern Palestine,&quot; shows him instead to be &quot;an historian.&quot; As nearly every likely reader of the book appreciates, at the point of its publication there were at best only one or two other histories of modern Palestine deserving of the name, all but lost among a torrent of mythology and polemic. Pappe's work is supported by background sources in Arabic, Hebrew, English and at least two other languages.That said, &quot;A History of Modern Palestine&quot; is best understood as a work in progress. Its 268 pages of main text in the paperback edition are far too few for such a ambitious topic. Its research apparatus includes endnotes, bibliography, glossary and chronology, but their lack of coordination makes them difficult to use in a paper format. Endnotes and glossary should have been running footnotes.The content of &quot;A History of Modern Palestine&quot; relating to periods before 1940 is based largely on tertiary sources; it is cool and disappointing. Pappe apparently knows more than he says, but what he says often leaves out people and culture. No person becomes any more than a cardboard character or a point in time. Periods after 1940 become warmer in detail, but they too are usually reduced to summaries lacking context and associations. A reader who does not already know most of what Pappe knows will find it difficult to learn what Pappe knows."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"if you do want in depth about the land of palestine... here you have one on your shelf."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"A 'New history' in the best tradition of this work of knowledge. Most of the information here is pretty well known and their isn't much revelation. One small issue is the title. The actual title should be 'Two lands, one people' since that is the actual reality today. Their were never actually two peoples in the same land, even in the much maligned and reviled 'Mandate' period.Of course, typically, this book frames the conflict as one between 'Jews and Arabs' when their are many more layers to the fabric of the diverse mosaic that is the holy land. Their were inter-Jewish struggles of Revisionists against Zionists against the Orthodox. And within the Palestinian camp their are equal divisions between the Bedouin, the fundamentalists, the socialists and the effendis. Not to mention the Druze.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"Papp&eacute; is the odd man out among the so-called New Historians. Unlike his colleagues, who pretend to base their anti-Israel writings on recently declassified documents from the British Mandate period and the first years of Israeli independence, Papp&eacute; is an unabashed \\"relativist\\" for whom historical research is a backward-looking projection of political attitudes and agendas regardless of actual facts. Aside from his doctoral dissertation, subsequently published as Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1948-51,[1] Papp&eacute;'s books are not based on archival documentation, preferring secondary (and deeply prejudiced) sources that aim at vindicating the Palestinian \\"narrative\\" of the conflict. He himself explains this in the introduction to A History of Modern Palestine:My bias is apparent despite the desire of my peers that I stick to facts and the \\"truth\\" when reconstructing past realities. I view any such construction as vain and presumptuous. This book is written by one who admits compassion for the colonized not the colonizer; who sympathizes with the occupied not the occupiers.This unabashed acknowledgment of personal bias and open political partisanship comes from a diehard ideologue who views Zionist and Israeli history as \\"more than a century of colonization, occupation, and dispossession of Palestinians.\\" The equation of Zionism with colonialism, the cornerstone of Papp&eacute;'s historical narrative, has been a staple of Arab propaganda since the early 1920s. Almost as predictable is the portrayal of Arabs and Palestinians as the hapless victims of this alleged foreign invasion.Publication of A History of Modern Palestine by a prestigious academic press is a sad testament to the pervasive politicization of Middle Eastern studies where the dividing line between academic scholarship and unadulterated propaganda has been blurred, if not erased.Even by the skewed standards of this field of studies, Papp&eacute;'s latest book ranks in a class of its own. Not only does it add no new facts or ideas to the anti-Israel literature, but the sloppiness of its research astounds. It contains countless factual errors and inaccuracies. Yasir Arafat's birthplace is Cairo and not Jerusalem. The U.N. Special Commission on Palestine (UNSCOP) presented its report on August 31, 1947, not on November 29. Deir Yasin is a village near Jerusalem, and not in Haifa. Lawrence of Arabia had nothing to do with the Anglo-Hashemite correspondence that led to the \\"Great Arab Revolt\\" of World War I. Further, this correspondence was initiated by the Hashemites not by the British. Papp&eacute; even misspells the official English transliteration of President Weizmann's first name (Chaim, not Haim).More serious is the book's consistent resort to factual misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood. Readers are told of events that never happened, such as the nonexistent May 1948 Tantura \\"massacre\\" or the expulsion of Arabs within twelve days of the partition resolution. They learn of political decisions that were never made, such as the Anglo-French 1912 plan for the occupation of Palestine or the contriving of \\"a master plan to rid the future Jewish state of as many Palestinians as possible.\\" And they are misinformed about military and political developments, such as the rationale for the Balfour declaration:Without Russia, there was very little hope of successfully surrounding Germany with a ring of enemy states, a strategy it was hoped would cause Germany to surrender. The British government expected that Russian Jews would become the agents of pro-British propaganda that would persuade the tsarist government to come out clearly in support of the Allies' effort to subjugate Germany.But Russia was a member of the Triple Entente coalition with Britain and France from the time of the outbreak of hostilities in 1914 and so needed no encouragement to join the war three years later, least of all by its despised and persecuted Jewish minority. In fact, it was hoped that the Zionist movement, by virtue of its perceived connections to the Bolshevik movement, would help keep communist Russia in the war.Papp&eacute; claims that Theodor Herzl \\"attempted to enlist British help in installing a temporary Jewish state (i.e., one that would eventually be moved to Palestine) in British Uganda, an offer which was seriously considered by some in Whitehall,\\" only to have his plan foiled by Weizmann. In fact, it was British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, not Herzl, who conceived of the East Africa idea. Nor was the \\"Uganda plan\\" foiled by Herzl's opponents, least of all Weizmann. Herzl narrowly got the plan passed by his last Zionist Congress in 1903, overriding the opposition of such Zionist leaders as Menahem Ussishkin and Yehiel Chlenov; it was only after Herzl's death in July 1904 that the idea was unceremoniously buried.A final example of Papp&eacute;'s distortion concerns the tidal wave of Arab violence that immediately followed the U.N. partition vote in November 1947. On the day after the vote, a spate of Arab attacks left seven Jews dead and scores more wounded. Shooting, stoning, and rioting continued apace in the following days. The consulates of Poland and Sweden, both of whose governments had voted for partition, were attacked. Bombs were thrown into cafes, Molotov cocktails were hurled at shops, a synagogue was set on fire. On December 3, at the instigation of the Palestinian leadership, a large mob ransacked the new Jewish commercial center in Jerusalem, looting and burning shops and stabbing and stoning whomever they happened upon. The next day, some 120-150 armed Arabs attacked Kibbutz Efal, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, in the first large-scale attempt to storm a Jewish village.Ignoring this heavily documented historical record, Papp&eacute; whitewashes this violence as intra-communal clashes \\"activated by hotheaded youth on both sides.\\" He even makes the mind-boggling claim that this violence had been triggered by the Haganah. Like so much else in A History of Modern Palestine, this is a falsehood.Does Papp&eacute; count on the ignorance of the general reader to accept it? Does he expect his peers to give him a pass? That Cambridge University Press purveys this disgraceful work suggests that they just might. It also symbolizes the crisis in Middle East studies.Efraim Karsh is director of the Mediterranean Studies Programme at King's College, University of London, and editor of the quarterly journal Israel Affairs. He is the author of Arafat's War: the Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest (Grove Press, 2003).[1] New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1988."},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"This is a work that pretends at objectivity, but is written with a clear agenda in mind. Pappe totally identifies with the Palestian Arab cause, and places the major onus for the conflict on the Jews of Israel. Thus he slants the major historical and political realities, in which the Jews have five times agreed to a peace plan based on partition while the Arabs have insistently refused to accept the Jews right to a state of their own. Pappe underplays the persistent and systematic Arab violence and terror which have been at the heart of the conflict from its beginning. He mistells the story of the 1947-1948 war minimizing the Arab agression, the calls of the leaders of Arab states for Palestinians to temporarily abandon their homes , so that invading Arab armies would be able to kill Jews more freely. He underplays the countless initiatives made by Israelis from all walks of life to live in peaceful relations with the Arabs. And does not really put the conflict into the context of the pan- Arabic, Islamic fundamentalist, and Arab nationalist processes which perpetuate the conflict even today.This is Revisionist History at its worst, a distorting and ignoring of the factual and objective reality in order to promote a ' cause' . That cause is disguised and misrepresented in the work.For Pappe as anyone who reads carefully will see is calling for a Jewish state which ceases to be Jewish in any meaningful way, and eventually becomes an Arab dominated one , in which its Arab minority will eventually become its majority. Pappe's analysis is one which aims to help bring about the destruction of Israel.Is it surprising then that most Israelis consider him to be both a hypocrite and a traitor?"},{"Title":"A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples","review":"Ilan Pappe, has taken the history of israel and changed it to fit his revisionist dialogue and prpomte an anti Israel agenda.

In real life, people do things for reasons. Historians explain what happened and (to some extent) why.

Of course, catalogs do exist from every model maker, but often those catalogs were hard to find or didn't illustrate their models as well as they should. Enter Bernhard Stein and his idea to photograph every model train in existence (in 1978/9) and assemble it into one book.The end product is a massive, yet very interesting volume that illustrates nearly everything available during the time period.How did Mr. Stein accomplish this incredible task? By putting out a call to every manufacturer and obtaining all models within their catalog, and then photographing them for the book.Incredibly, many manufacturers complied with his request. Many sent him all models, while a few sent only one or two. Not only did many send model trains, but they also sent examples of tracks, catenary, structures, signals and other related equipment for inclusion into the book.Most of the trains in this book are European. There are a decent number of American models, too, from both European and American manufacturers. What was even more interesting is that for the American models, a fair number of brass models were received from builders such as GEM, Hallmark and PFM.The entire book has about 4,000 color photos. It's almost like a website of sorts, in a printed format. Way ahead of its time, this book was!Looking through the photos brought back a lot of childhood memories, as I was a child in the 70's. I fondly recall seeing all of the European trains at POLK'S Hobby Shop on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, as well as the awesome Marklin exhibit at the FAO Schwarz toy store.While some models looked familiar (and I even owned a few I have seen in the book), many others I never seen before, and there are manufacturers I never knew of, either.One odd ommission is the lack of Japanese model trains. I don't see a reference to this in the book. Perhaps it was impossible for Mr. Stein to get them or he just focused on European and American models. It is noted in the book that the American brass models are custom made in Japan or Korea.The book is written in both English, French and German. The English translation is silly-sounding at times, but you do understand what it is saying.All in all, if you have an interest in model trains of the 1970's time period, you should definitely consider buying this book."},{"Title":"Lalla Rookh an Oriental Romance","review":"This book is very good for any projects and fine to read"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"This book is a must read for anyone comtemplating &quot;ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVING THE REPRODUCTIVE&quot; organs.

The objective of the book was to inform women of the aternatives methods of removing fibroid tumors. I assumed his associate would have the same philosophy. HRT is a VERY LUCRATIVE business and I think this associate doctor had his own agenda of maximizing his returns and creating a long term HRT patient. (He billed the insurance company by the parts removed.) He tried to convince me that I was at high risk for ovarian cancer. (I have found that this is not true.) Before the surgery, I specifically asked him if he could take a biopsy of my ovaries to make sure removal was necessary. He said, &quot;yes&quot;. I awoke to find I had no ovaries. According to him, the good news was that - THERE WAS NO CANCER!! He did no biopsy to avoid this life altering surgery. I SAY - KNOW THE DOCTOR FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THE SURGERY!!! Decisions like these show the relationship between the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors. This doctor is no different than a mechanic who, while fixing your car, breaks something to keep you coming back. THe big difference - THE STAKES ARE MUCH, MUCH HIGHER!!!!

It even explains some things that puzzled me like: I felt really good right after my surgery and then it was like the bottom fell out. According to the book it takes between 6-12 months before you start to recognize your symptoms (I really felt mine at around 6 months). I look back and realize that I got small signals all along but at 6 months they made me sit up and pay attention.

This book was helpful in finally putting the final pieces in my own mind of what had happened to me. Its not enough to say I'm sad that I can't have kids, its not enough to say my body is stressed from the rigors of surgery -- but it makes it crystal clear to say that hysterectomy and the resultant loss of hormones/chemicals that those organs produced in a cyclic fashion impacts every bodily system -- that ensures normal health and well-being.

I feel for her from the very bottom of my heart. I also believe through my own experience with my own TVH/BSO,(5 months ago at age 38 and it's subsequent aftermath, which included complications similar to the authors) that for the most part our medical establishment does not adequately inform nor support women who have these types of surgeries. I had done extensive research before making my decision to have my surgery, and had already arranged to begin natural hormone replacement therapy immediately following. Establishing the proper dosage of NHRT has admittedly been more challenging than I had anticipated, however, I feel that I am now close to being even better than I ever was before my surgery.There are always risks and trade-offs in chosing to alter yourself surgically. While I can not even *imagine* the HELL that women have endured (having gone through this type of surgery without conset, nor effective hormone replacement therapy) I feel that this book completely negates the *possible* healing options that these surgeries *can* provide. Let us not lose sight of the misery that has lead us to face the choice of whether or not to have irreversable surgery. I was really miserable! And what about those women who have no choice. Who must have this surgery to save their lives? I feel that this book throws them to the (emotionl) wolves ... so to speak.Surgical decisions should never be taken lightly, and I applaud the author's intent to inform women (in advance). I really do. I can not however recommend this book because the information here is presented in such a slanted, biased fahion. She draws wild conclusions and presents them as fact. She does not differentiate between a statistical correlation and absolute cause and effect. I am genuinely concerned that this &quot;doomed&quot; view will cause even more suffering in women who are already struggling with their own healing. Make no mistake ... this *is* a serious decision, and one that has caused a lot of suffering.

The feedback I have received mirrors my own feelings: &quot;The Ultimate Rape&quot; is an excellent book on hysterectomy and female castration. In a world full of Doctors who tell us hysterectomy and castration will cure all that ails us, Elizabeth Plourde, through her exhaustive research and over 856 medical journal citations, shows us that medicine actually DOES have a deep understanding of how truly devastating hysterectomy and/or castration can be to women's bodies and their lives. Mrs. Plourde uses easy to understand language to explain how the uterus and ovaries do MUCH more than just allowing for the possibility of pregnancy. The hormones created by our reproductive organs, the ligaments supporting our pelvic structure, the nerves that allow for sexual pleasure, our bone health and blood pressure, bladder and bowel functioning, maintenance of a healthy weight and the health of our minds, are all greatly influenced by our uterus and ovaries - and exactly how they influence our bodies is explained by Elizabeth Plourde in &quot;The Ultimate Rape&quot;. I highly recommend this book to women considering hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy as well as women who have already had surgery. I also strongly urge all partners of women facing surgery or trying to live life post-hysterectomy/oophorectomy to read and re-read &quot;The Ultimate Rape&quot;, it will give them a much deeper understanding of the multi-faceted struggles their partners face day in and day out."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"After 15+ years of dealing with severe endometriosis, I'm afraid that I bought into the &quot;Oh, you'll be better than new!&quot; theory. Or, as author Naomi Stokes called it, &quot;The Great Conspiracy of Silence.&quot; I was 37 years old and had heard from countless gyns, starting in my early 20s, that having a hysterectomy/oophorectomy was my only &quot;answer.&quot;So I did finally did it. After all...each and every gyn (all male, by the way) had told me that I'd be just fine. That it &quot;wasn't any big deal.&quot;But I knew, rather soon after my surgery, that something just wasn't &quot;right&quot;...that my recovery wasn't going as well as everybody told it would...so I started to read. And I discovered, to my complete horror and much too late, of course, that the cost of this surgery was far too high a price to pay. Had I known then what I now know...I would NEVER have had the surgery.I've now read, literally, dozens of books about hysterectomy, menopause, HRT...you name it. And I've found that Ms. Plourde's book, &quot;The Ultimate Rape,&quot; is, without a doubt, the most complete source for information about this devasting surgery which continues to be performed on 500,000+ women every year.I think this book should be a &quot;must&quot; read for EVERY woman. If you've been told that you &quot;have&quot; to have a hysterectomy...PLEASE get this book. If someone in your family, or a friend, has been told she needs a hysterectomy...please buy her this book. And if you're like me, post surgery, perhaps even many years post surgery but still searching for ways of learning to accept a body, mind, and spirit that's forever changed...read this book!I'd like to make one last comment regarding some of the negative reviews I've seen here. All I can say to you ladies is that you, sadly, continue to be part of the problem...the reason this surgery is still performed at such a high rate in this country (for reasons other than diagnosed cancer). If you're one of the &quot;lucky ones&quot; who really thinks your life is better now than before your surgery...why are you here? Having this surgery was the biggest mistake of my life.I only have gratitude and respect in my heart for Ms. Plourde for writing this book. SHE had the courage to speak out. Thank you, Ms. Plourde, for not only sharing your personal experiences but for also spending countless research hours to create a wonderful list of resources."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"I was told I needed a hysterectomy.

I had my hysterectomy in 1998 and had one ovary removed which eventually shut down. I fell into a deep depression last year, that lasted for almost a year, and couldn't convince my doctor that it was a hormonal imbalance. He insisted it was something else and I needed a psychiatrist. Elizabeth gave me the answers I was looking for. I would highly recommend her book to anyone thinking about getting a hysterectomy. You just may have second thoughts after reading this book and there are other alternatives in many cases. To those that have already had a hysterectomy and have been through some difficult times, this book offers you hope for the future. I didn't realize just how much we need to hold on to our parts and how they function along with the rest of our bodies but I do now. It's too late for me but it may not be too late for someone else.

I can only imagine what is in-between the covers. I would only suggest that OVARIES BE REMOVED BECAUSE OF CANCER ONLY! For anyone reading this...please make a well informed decision. The ovaries are key to chemical functions within the body and brain. They are not just egg factories as one might be lead to believe. THINK LONG AND HARD...over having your ovaries removed. I am only talking OVARIES here. I do trust that the author found her way out of the hell this causes...I may never know, because I don't want to live within some one else' hell ~ added to my own.

Women are not being informed of alternative treatments and are not being told of the potential problems or life altering consequences of this surgery. For those of us who have already had surgery, this book has given validation to the problems we are now facing and explains in detailed, easy to understand medical terms what has happened to our bodies. To those of you who are possibly facing surgery for non-life threatening conditions, this book will empower you to make a truly informed decision as to whether to not to proceed with surgery. Just the footnotes alone (over 500), will reveal vital information and indicate how thoroughly the book was researched.

I found this book to be very helpful even having had the surgery!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"Once again, we have another sensationalist tome on hysterectomy that is light on information and long on emotionalism. If Ms. Plourde felt that she needed to write this in order to resolve her own negative feelings about her hysterectomy, she should have kept it in a private journal, not published it and done such a disservice to so many women. I read this as a curiosity--the title itself completely turned me off. I have spoken to many other women who have hysterectomies as well, and believe me, the idea that we have been 'raped' is ludicrous and repugnant to us. It is very important to be very-well informed before undergoing any major surgical procedure, and I'm sorry to say that this book is decidedly unhelpful in that regard."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"This book has stopped me from making the biggest mistake of my life.

Matter of fact, I am mailing my copy back to the author since I would never give it to any one of my friends."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"I read this book with a fairly objective mind - I admit, I was turned off by the title. Seemed somewhat..extreme, to me. And I was unfortunately proven correct, as I read further.Whilst I appreciate Ms Plourde's experience *was* horrifying, frightening and incredibly traumatic, to suggest that the hysterectomies of other women are *rape*, is insulting, degrading and downright ignorant. Granted this IS only her opinion - but the very suggestion that we women don't know what we're doing, or haven't the common sense, intelligence or resources to investigate our own medical conditions is ultimately incredibly insulting and patronizing. Her point could have been made much better, and fairer, had she left out some of her own anger and bitterness, and included more factual evidence.I cannot recommend this book, for any reason. Wait. If you have a table with a wobbly leg, it might help.A much fairer representation of hysterectomy is given in The Woman's Guide To Hysterectomy, by Haas and Puretz."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Rape: What Every Woman Should Know about Hysterectomies and Ovarian Removal","review":"This book was written by a person that was unhappy before and after her surgery.

Feet of Clay is enjoyable throughout, but the whole experience seemed slightly less challenging than Ffyonas African experience. Although I would highly recommend this book, my advice would be to read it before On Foot through Africa, so that none of the importance and relevance is taken away from the experiences and emotions described throughout Ffyonas journey across Australia."},{"Title":"Feet of Clay: Her Epic Walk Across Australia","review":"An amazing book, inspires you to get out there and fulfil your ambitions!.

Young Daniel Boone, traveling deep into the wilderness with his father to stake a claim for a new homestead, becomes separated and must survive on his own in a land of dangerous animals, hostile Indians, and exciting adventures. What makes this old book such a refreshing contrast to the emasculating new-age cant now force-fed to little boys, is that its boy-hero shows courage, determination, and resourcefulness, and, best of all, for once is not overshadowed by some plucky little girl who can do everything better than he can. For that dwindling band of parents who want their sons to grow up to be men, instead of sensitive, self-doubting metrosexuals, this book is a pretty good start. And who knows? Some of those little guys might even find that they like reading after all."},{"Title":"Gwar Rumble in Antarctica: Miniature Game","review":"Ensure you are getting the complete game, not just the book.It's not the seller's fault.The compete game is out there."},{"Title":"Gwar Rumble in Antarctica: Miniature Game","review":"Time to sharpen up your axes and get your swords polished, Demonblade games takes you on a no-holds-barred tour through the world of the Scumdogs of the Universe, and in the process shows you how to bring all the carnage, misery and destruction to your very own tabletop.

He was homespun and a great story teller. He was a humorist and journalist and the tone is very much like Mark Twain but he also very down-to-earth. You find yourself carried away by his life, raised in Sag Harbor LI as part of the great seafaring community there, and in California in the Gold Rush. I can understand why people buy his books on his philosophy which sounds equally homespun.I bought his life story to find out more about the people of that time since I was doing local genealogy of the families and I am very pleased with it on that score.This publication by Brownstone Books is done apparently in batches and not well. My copy was missing a complete page which I had to fill in from other sources. The backpage blurb is wrong. He lived from 1834 to 1891, and he starts his recollections with June, 1847. It was copyrighted in 1889. But the blurb says 1956 to 1972 which indicates that the publishing company never read the book."},{"Title":"Prentice Mulford's story; (California relations)","review":"well i opened the book to read it and page six was blank. bad print job? i would like a replacement"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Beliefs and Religions (Wordsworth Collection)","review":"I have used this for several years and carry with me wherever I go.The format is such,one canread and retain information in short order.After using this book for sometime,I found I had &quot;learnt&quot;more of the subject in a shorter period and enjoyed doing it.

It covers that period from 1963 through the breakup and to George's death in 2001. Some of the pictures are familiar, others aren't. It's a wonderful journey to start at the beginning and see the Beatles' milestones and how they change. We see their early exuberance and eagerness to please by posing in showbizzy poses in matching suits, being feted and receiving endless awards. They morph into the ultimate cool icons, hair growing shaggier, clothes weirder. Their relationships are chronicled. First it was Cyn, Jane, Patti and Mo. Then it was Linda and Yoko. Eventually Patti and Maureen were replaced by Olivia and Barbara. I love the early pictures of the women - all those wonderful dolly dresses and Patti's amazing eyes. (I was sooo jealous of her!). The pictures thin out after the breakup. There are intermittent photos of the individual Beatles and their families (mostly Paul) through the 70s, 80s and 90s. The last photo in the book is the sad photo of Paul the morning George died. There are almost no photos of the Beatles taken in America so it cannot be called a comprehensive collection. After all, this was the English press (Daily Mail and AP)and a lot of these photos never made it stateside until now. One thing that historians will note is the plethora of shots from the middle '60s showing just how important they were during that time. I'm so happy to have come upon this book. It is highly recommended for Beatles fans both who remember when and who want to know what it was like."},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"This is a collection of rare Beatles' photos taken from pre-1964 to a period 'after the Beatles.' Each chapter of the book is titled after a Beatles' song (e.g. chapter four is titled &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;).The photos have descriptions beside them giving an explanation of what is going on in the pic, where it might have been taken, who is in the pic, and other facts that might pertain tom the pic such as record stats, radio shows, TV programs, etc.Periodically throughout this book a chronology of a certain year (i.e. 1968) will be shown. The chronology explains what happened on certain dates or days in that year. For instance, in the 1968 chronology, on 23 August it states &quot;Ringo quits the Beatles during the recording sessions for the White Album.&quot;The book contains 600 photographs selected from the archives of the 'Daily Mail.&quot; The book contains over 200 photographs from negatives never previously printed and are said to be printed here for the first time.The pictures in this book are pics taken at parties, vacations that each Beatles member took alone, or together, recording studio shots, candid shots (some of these are just plain terrible, but fun to see), and many other various settings. This is a great book for Beatles' fans, and a must for hard core Beatles collectors."},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"I love this collection of Beatle photographs taken from early in their careers to the post-Beatle years. (I have two copies of this book - the first one has a chronology that stops in 1999-2000, when George was still alive and the second one includes George's tragic demise in 2001).I love the way a Beatle song is used as a title for each chapter. The photos are well documented and include many people who crossed paths with the Beatles, such as Harold Wilson, Ed Sullivan (of course) and many lesser known people.The book also provides a rich history for each year that is being covered. Events are chronicled in the chronology and is a very \\"Beatle friendly\\" gauge indeed. The Beatles' travels and events regarding same are recorded. There are two pictures of George, packing his \\"Beatle Bag,\\" with the picture captioned about how BOAC provided the Fabs free flights from England to France provided they advertised with those bags. Harold & Louise Harrison, Sr. are shown, sending their son off to America proudly and lovingly. These make a good book even better.Many of these photographs had not seen the light of day prior to the publication of this wonderful book. No Beatle fan should be without this one!"},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"Every year at Christmas, my family pretty much knows what to get me as gifts. Something, anything to do with The Beatles. As a long time Beatles fan, I just can't seem to get enough of the group that had such an impact on my life as a young man.After all of these years, I pretty much thought I had seen most of the photographs of the group that had ever been taken. But considering the tens of thousands of pictures that must have been taken of them over the decades, there had to be many I had not had the opportunity to have ever looked at before.I received The Beatles Unseen Archive as a Christmas gift and it was one I had not asked for or even knew existed. It is an incredible collection of rare photos of John, Paul, George and Ringo and those around them, starting in the early 1960s and ending with a sobering photograph of Paul McCartney outside of his home after he got word of the death of George Harrison.Printed on thick, high quality stock, this book features 384 pages and is a rigid paperback bound collection of 600 news, candid, concert and casual photographs taken by professional photographers for Associated Newspaper's \\"Daily Mail\\" all over the world as The Beatles passed by their lenses, many published here for the first time. And I have to admit, most, maybe 90% or more, I had never seen before.The book is also catalogued by chapters, with yearly chronologies and commentary. Each photo has a caption explaining who, what, where, and the chapter/chronology gives most of the whens. All photographs are black and white and since they are from the era of film cameras, expect to see grain, especially those that are blown up to full page size.I highly recommend The Beatles Unseen Archives as a gift for that Beatles fan who can't get enough of the Fab Four, especially in the way of pictures."},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"At first I was a little hesitate to purchase this book considering that I have over two hundred books on the subject of the Beatles, however, I'm glad that I did since this book stands out from the others. Definitely, it's informative as a reference guide, and it includes a large amount of rarely seen and unseen photos of the Beatles together and apart. Also, the appearance of it is quite attractive with its lavish hardcover; moreover, the beautiful black and white, and colorful photos that it contains. Without a doubt, if you're either a die-hard or casual fan, then you should definitely purchase this book, and place it next to the other valuable Beatles items that you may own."},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"Being a die-hard Beatle fan, I've had my share of disappointments with books published about the Beatles or the individual members over the years. This book is definitely not a disappointment on any level. There are over 600 pictures that will take you back to the 60's and 70's as the group became a cohesive force in the music industry and as the world became fascinated with the four men from Liverpool and their private lives. There are some great pictures of the Beatles as a group and solo pictures with their spouses or girlfriends. There were some fantastic pictures of them as a group that made me tear up and long for a return to the time when they were together! Definitely a wonderful chronology for the Beatle afficiendo. And if you are into photography, the photographic journey is worth studying too!"},{"Title":"Beatles (Unseen Archives)","review":"I picked up this book on a whim for my 2 year old who is obsessed with the Beatles. However, I have spent several hours myself looking through it and I love being able to read about the stories behind the pictures, even if she cant enjoy them yet.

C. W. Sughrue takes a job tracking down a somewhat famous author as he blazes a trail bar hopping all the way to California. Sughrue finds his man in a beer joint in Sonoma, but a slight accident waylays his charge, and the barkeep asks Sughrue to look for her missing daughter in the meantime. The trail is stone cold, but Sughrue takes pity on a mother's pain, and embarks on a wild quest.In James Crumley's capable hands, the 1970s are so deliciously sleazy. This reads exactly like a pulp noir mystery set in the 40s, but without the rigid social conventions that were demolished in the subsequent decades. These characters run around like life is a never-ending bacchanalian orgy of booze, sex, and drugs. It kind of reminded me ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dreamthat way. I wouldn't really call this one a thriller, because the action doesn't move at a frenetic pace, but the mystery is just strange enough to smack of real life.This story is full of broken boozers, hippies after their heyday, and people who get played. Despite the easy stereotypes, no one is easy to pin down, least of all Sughrue. He has several despicable qualities, but his sense of honor saves him from coming across as a complete bastard. The founders of M.A.D.D. would have a heart attack following Sughrue as he drives around while chugging beers or nipping whiskey from a bottle. I lost track of how many women he slept with, and not once was there any mention of using protection. The guy was hitting the sauce and sleeping with anything that'd lay still long enough. *Gag* It's hard for me to fathom a time when people behaved with this kind of reckless freedom, and I suppose it dates the material and me along with it.This mystery is tight, gritty, and it fires off like a rocket from the first chapter. Crumley is a bard for the toothless drunks perched on wobbly bar stools in the forgotten [bleep] holes of redneck America. In its own way, it's beautiful stuff. Even dirt is pretty when viewed under the right light, and this novel explores some dark and dirty secrets in a plot that is anything but simple."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"As a city slicker, I don't much care for a lot of nature description in my noir reading, which is why I cannot abide the swamps of James Lee Burke. When I saw that Crumley's hero C.W. Sughrue lives in Montana, I was wary. But I heard so much praise for \\"The Last Good Kiss,\\" I decided to pick it up. Glad I did.Thankfully, Crumley keeps the Rockies in view, but only just. Some thoughts:-- The book has, by my count, four separate climaxes. Things seem wrapped up .. but no! The bear-like alcoholic writer Trahearne lumbers back into view and the action picks up again.-- Speaking of alcohol, it is being gulped on just about every single page of this book. It's one bender after another. You can get s--tfaced just reading it.-- People in this book don't just say things. They stutter, wail, whine, etc. In one case, \\" I cliched.\\"-- The book is vividly cinematic. The raid on the porno house plays like a movie in your head.-- The dialogue is terrific. Sughrue's nihilistic comebacks (he's not really a nihilist) will have you grinning.-- Way more female than male characters. Unusual in a hard-boiled.-- There is a really cool character named Stacy. Only 24 and hard as nails. Wished we had seen more of her.-- Speaking of characters, there are just too many. Plus, it moves around geographically too much. If you put the book down and pick it up later, chances are you'll have forgotten where in the United States you are. It's docked a star for that.-- As the book closes, there's a confusing murder that doesn't seem to make sense and feels like a betrayal of the reader. Crumley saves the payoff for the final two pages and it's brutally nasty. Loved it. Hard-boiled as a ten-minute egg.If you like it down and dirty and don't mind a touch of mountain scenery, check this one out."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"I've pretty much given up on trying new mystery writers, because I always wind up disappointed. There are three writers who I love -- Ross MacDonald, Raymond Chandler, and James Elroy. Everyone else I've tried is a distant fourth.I read about James Crumley's recent passing and decided to try The Last Good Kiss, and I'm glad I did. While not in MacDonald, Chandler, and Elroy's league, Crumley comes as close as anyone I've read. He's an exceptionally skilled writer, who draws his heavily flawed characters. In structure and tone, The Last Good Kiss reminded me of Chandler's The Long Goodbye or an early Lew Archer novel. (Don't expect the dense plotting of the later Archer novels or of Elroy's LA quartet. In fact, the central mystery seems to lie in the background much of the time.)I had just a couple quibbles. The inclusion of a violent pornography ring seemed like a forced way to inject some \\"drama\\" into the story. The Lew Archer novels quickly evolved beyond such plot devices, and were stronger for it. And I didn't always buy (or understand) the motivations of the characters. Sometimes it seemed that they did what they did simply because they lived in a noir world.But, still, a great read and worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"I bought this book some years ago because I liked the picture of the bulldog on the cover. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. C.W. Sughrue's El Camino speeds through the West--from Montano to California, then back again--like a bat out of hell, searching for a safe harbor. He finds it, at last, 'where he hangs his hangover.' Every now and then I run into someone who has read Crumley, and we wind up reciting lines from 'Dancing Bear' and 'The Mexican Tree Duck' for hours. I once read that Rolling Stone said 'The Last Good Kiss' is the last good hard-boiled fiction, and I truly agree."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Northern California post-hippie detective noir (is that a genre?). The main character's a dard-drinking Vietnam vet private detective who's been hired to track down a hard-drinking World War II vet who happens to write pulp novels and Nobel Prize winning poetry - on the 15 days of the year he manages to stay sober. He locates his prey on page one, dead drunk in a bar near Oakland. Alas, they become fast friends while our hero isinvestigating a second case. A beautiful, talented teenager went missing 12 years ago and her momma wants to find her. They hunt far and wide, finally turning up a death certificate. The poet has a young wife, an ex-wife and a mother (also a novelist) who all live on his estate in Montana. Some rough stuff happens. Even more drinking and cursing and whoring happens.

He devotes one chapter to books he brings with him when going on a long-distance fishing trip---books that can help fill the time when stuck in the airport or at a motel when the weather precludes going outside. He mentioned reading books by James Crumley---an author I had not previously known. So, I grabbed this book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book has that hard-boiled, Raymmond Chandler tenor about it---alot of cursing and \\"tough talk\\", but the story was surprisingly (to me) and interestingly involved. It was a good read that kept me turning the pages at a rapid rate. I'll certainly pick up some more of Crumley's stuff.

Sughrue. An alcoholic Vietnam vet not adverse to smoking dope from time to time, Sughrue does not believe in playing by the rules.The book starts out with Sughrue trying to locate a missing teenage girl last seen in San Francisco. A difficult assignment given the fact the disappearance occurred ten years earlier. Halfway through the book, however, the plot takes a decidedly different trajectory.On the positive side, The Last Good Kiss is unflinchingly and unapologetically hardboiled. Crumley took some real chances with the raw brutality of some plot elements. Evidently, in Crumley's view, there's no such thing as too hardboiled.On the negative side, the narrative is too meandering for its own good. Sughrue unwisely gets himself involved in a series of dubious activities while half soused much of the time.Bottom line: A great example of latter day hardboiled crime fiction marred by overwrought plotting."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Holy Moses, can this guy write! Instead of alleys and slums, he takes us into roadhouses and funky, drug-laced backyard barbecues. The drinking,smoking and general dissolution got a bit tiresome but his pacing, plot and characters were great and he could drop in surprise humor bombs when least expected. The before, during and after-action relationship with the two numbnuts hicks, Oney and Lester, was worth the price of admission...and, they were just minor, local color characters. The man can write!"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"When reading through this novel, it was hard to believe that it was written (and takes place) in the 1970's. The characters are much like the quirky folks roaming in and out of our lives, and stumbling out of bars with much of their dignity left on the stool they just vacated. That's the thing about this story - it's timeless. Yet, it's incredibly original. Sughrue, our loveable, drunken anti-hero is not the type of man you'd want to turn your back to, but there is something so real about him and his motives, that you route for him every time you turn the page. He is one-part tough guy bone breaker (like Spillane's Mike Hammer) with an incredible amount of flaws, which is why readers (this reader included) can relate to him. This is not your typical hard-boiled detective novel, but will appeal to the genres' fans. This is one of my top 5 novels ever, period. Incredible work. RIP James Crumley"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The praise this book has earned is well-deserved. It can't be an easy thing to write a book so divorced from what most of us would consider a normal, or even acceptable, life; and to make it so effortless and rewarding to read. I first read this about a year ago, and was completely engrossed; re-reading it, I'm almost laughing at the perfection of the prose. I haven't found a jarring note, a false sentiment, or a boring paragraph in it. But this is damning with faint praise; in fact, Crumley no more writes detective novels than Le Carre writes spy novels; they are both fantastic writers who have chosen tried-and-true plots to help you get to know their unforgettable characters.These are not admirable people; not role models. But they are as real as fictional characters can be, and reaching the end of the book is like having someone you know closely die.RIP, Mr. Crumley. Your work will outlive you for a long, long time."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"I read this book because I saw it on someone's list of greatest crime novels and because of the author's interesting background. And, I acknowledge that there are parts of the book where you can really see the author's great talent. I thought the scene where the PI visited the missing woman's father was brilliantly written. But, overall, I don't think the story has enough realism and too much of the book seemed to me like it must have been written while the author was drunk or under the influence of something. It just felt uneven and unbelievable to me. Maybe Trahearne in the book is what Crumley was in life.Even so, I think I'll check out the author's other books to see if there's another one that sounds promising. The man had skills and maybe he was better able to harness it in another effort."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Aside from having the best opening sentence of any hard-boiled mystery, The Last Good Kiss is a classic mystery. Down-on-his-luck detective searching for Hemingwayesque author who, entangled in the battles of the bottle and of writer's block, has dropped out of sight. No less than three women in the author's life (ex-wife, current wife, and mother) alternately hire, thwart, entice, seduce, reject, and otherwise befuddle the hero-detective. Lots of drinking, lots of road trips in the majestic Northwest, and fantastic writing from Crumley"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This is a difficult work to review. Partly because I don't read many mysteries, and have distinct worry of missing large parts of the intent and style. It'd be like having read a few science fiction works and then reviewing another, mentioning I liked the language and characters but the story just got ridiculous and unbelievable when the aliens showed up, and why did they need timetravel anyway? That is of course how a lot of mainstream commentators review anything SF/F (particularly through assuming that the whole endeavor is just juvenile escapism) and I'm wary of making a similar error across here. For instance, while I found a lot of what happened arbitrary and unbelievable from the setup of the book, that could be as much to not being as familiar with the genre elements Crumley is incorporating or subverting.Furthermore, and possibly due to the above, I didn't really find this a good novel. I can't say it's bad, but it seemed incomplete or off-center in some ways, which doesn't give me the strong unifying focus I'd have to rant in either praising or condemning it. The Last Good Kiss is quite effective on the level of direct writing, the prose is decent, the dialog snappy, the pace on paragraph to paragraph basis good. It's the larger picture the novel paints (or buys into) that's less satisfying.The best and worst thing in this novel is how 70s it is, reflecting both intense sexuality, intrigue and political radicalism, as well as a partial blowback against these. So, the protagonist gets eventually sidetracked into following the trail of a ten-years-missing young woman, tracking her past through porn, drug addiction, a hippie commune, and then reinvention of herself into a respectable and settled wife. It's an overview that plays at times like a metaphor for the country as a whole in the previous decade. Certainly in the trail of this, the protagonist has a lot of interesting encounters that deal heavily with the impact of \\"the Dream\\" in its late 60s manifestation, its major collapse, and how people left around after the end relate. It's the most productive part of the book, but it also forces the story into a few contrivances--is it really likely one person would have such a symbolically important set of roles? This could work in a lot of senses, but the reason it doesn't fully here is the gritty and near-realistic tone of the work undercut it's larger importance.The major plot elements make sense in retrospect, the pieces of the backstory fit the described narrative. Unfortunately there's a cost to this coherence, as it forces levels of rediscovery of the small cast, showing hidden identities and covert manipulations. It was engaging to read through, but also distanced me a lot from most of the people in this novel, and in retrospect I find it a fairly alienating tactic. The work isn't atmospherically paranoid enough to support this type of deception, and by the end several many characters were left too ambivalent for real connection.Where the book really loses me is in the end, with a bit of an improbable coincidence forcing an action-packed rescue against the local mob. It's too neat by far, too succesfull to really be believed, and in the process the book doesn't really deal with the full impact of the abuse (particularly in the sexual form against woman) that's inherent to the setup. This aspect was a factor across the work, but it became most prominent just at the moment of ostensibly the greatest narrative intensity, and left me rather cold. Still, there's a lot to like in here, and as an exploration of a largely unfamiliar genre was probably worth its own sake.This book reminded me of and was better than: Agatha Cristie's Murder on the Orient ExpressThis book reminded me of and was worse than: Stephen King's The Dead Zone"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This reminded me of those old movies and novels from the 50's, 60's and 70's.

As I made my way through it, though, I had to face it, had to reach down deep and tease out a festering dissenting voice, stop and heed my internal critic: This book, at best, is really not that engaging, more of a chore to read than a pleasure, and rather shallow overall; it does not, as I was lead to believe, boast any real depth of narrative - what depth we do see is not in the drawing of the characters, but in the measuring out of drams of aqua vitae and beers, always on ice and handy ---Miraculous! It's too mired down in the slogging passage of the two toss pots and the women are all fantastically ironic and fey; unpredicatble and dangerous, capable of causing either great life change for the protagonist or certain &quot;demise.&quot; That's new. Also, sex, porn, the skin trade pins the whole tale up and I must say that such sleaziness gets old rather quick. I wanted to embrace it and herald it, wanted to agree with Michael D. and shake my head in adoration after reading a sentence that dished a gut-punch or danced me off to a lyrical heaven, but instead I could only shrug and think that I've read this before; and it's been done better. Read Dashiell Hammet, Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald, for the real thing. Try Andrew Vacchs if you want sleaze and retribution."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Gardner Dozois recommended James Crumley's The Last Good Kiss to me as the best hard-boiled detective novel written in the last ten years. With that kind of recommendation, I would have been hard-pressed to pass it up. And Dozois is correct, as far as I can tell. Crumley's C.W. Sughrue has that quality that I thought was lost when I finished reading the last Dashiell Hammett story. But Crumley isn't just playing off of Hammett and Chandler, although he is firmly in their tradition. Crumley is as post-modern as they come, and knows that life and people are as sleazy as anything James Ellroy or Andrew Vachss has put to the page (not to even mention the real thing).C.W. Sughrue is hired to track down a derelict author who's on a drinking binge by the author's ex-wife. What begins so simply quickly soon complicates--I can't quite explain how complicated it becomes, either. There's a point in the middle of the novel where I said to myself, &quot;Well, that's it. We've had the set-up, the complication, a little goose-chase, a climax, and here we are.&quot; But I was only halfway through the book. Contrary to normal novel structure, Crumley leaves you hanging within the denouement while he sets up an entirely new climax not once or twice, but three times.Crumley has taught literature in Texas, Arkansas and Montana, and understands the directions recent fiction has taken. Although he's not about to give up the traditional, he has assimilated some of the modern tricks. The ending, in particular, is something that I doubt you would have seen in a previous decade.All in all, Crumley is a voice that is worth looking out for. On the basis of The Last Good Kiss, I plan to search out his other two novels and his short story collection. I recommend that you do, also."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"By the drawing of the bulldog on the most recent cover, one might mistake \`The Last Good Kiss' for a cozy, cute mystery. That would be a mistake of monumental proportions. \`The Last Good Kiss' is a hard hitting, gritty, graphic hard-boiled novel about some pretty nasty people doing some pretty nasty things. It's also exceptionally well written.C.W. Sughrue, a Montana P.I., is hired to track down a drunken writer. He finds his man, but along the way Sughrue takes another case, a case he knows will lead to nothing good. His job is to find a girl who ran away from home many, many years ago. The hunt for the girl leads Sughrue through a parade of despicable degenerates with no redeeming qualities.It can be a hard novel to read and a difficult one to forget. In Sughrue, Crumley has created a detective who lives in a broken world, hoping that there might just be one good thing on the horizon, one good reason to live, one good thing to believe in. The settings, characters, tone...it all works, establishing the novel as one of the greats in the hard-boiled mystery genre. But again, if you are looking for a nice, cozy mystery to curl up with for a relaxing evening, this is not for you. Definitely not for kids.244 hard-boiled pages"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The Last Good Kiss lies squarely in the private eye genre, specifically starring C.W. Sughrue from Montana, a down at heel private investigator. It is strongly American in tone, strongly written and dense, often poetic. But there is nothing staccato about it, as is often the case with modern writing when the author hones everything down to the bone. Rather, the narrative often meanders giving descriptions of the past and near present. In other words it is an excellent piece of work.The novel borders on the hard boiled and is often very cynical as C.W. searches for the well known writer and alcoholic Abraham Trahearne. C.W. catches up with him in a down and out bar in the company of a beer lapping bulldog. After that sweet meeting they join forces and search for the bar owner's missing daughter of ten years.The first half of the book keeps one on edge, then there's a lull before things get going again, but it's not as good as the beginning. I got the feeling the writer was running out of steam, whereby the writing is not quite as strong, nor the action as believable.I did not care much for the ending, far too cynical for my taste. It needn't have been that way, but then I'm not the author.That's my crit, and perhaps it sounds bad, but the book on the whole is definitely up there among America's best. I will read more by this author who demonstrates that mystery novels can reach the heights of literature."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The first hundred or so pages of &quot;The Last Good Kiss&quot; are as good as any harboiled detective fiction ever written. Crumley's vivid detail, down-and-out characters and brief bursts of violence make his story as vivid as a Hank Williams tune. His hero, C.W. Sughrue (&quot;Sugh&quot; as in &quot;sugar&quot; and rue as in &quot;rue the goddamned day&quot;) is everything a hardboiled detective ought to be; alcoholic, rebellious, cynical and beholden to no code of honor but his own. The mystery itself unfolds in a bizarre and complex manner, leading to a payoff that you know won't be pretty. It may take Crumley a bit too long to get there, but its a fun trip while it lasts.Overall, a flawed but classic novel that fans of Andrew Vachss, George P. Pelecanos, Jonathan Valin and John D. MacDonald in particular ought to enjoy."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"James Crumley, here in his second detective novel (and only his third book) penned a bona-fide classic of the genre. Let me clarify further - not only is this one of the greatest mystery novels ever written, it is also one of the best novels of modern fiction written in the last 20 years. Crumley shows in this novel his unparalled prose style that in many passages reads like the best poetry. The opening line to the book is justly famous, both lyrical and tragic in its tone, but throughout the book Crumley does what a few truly great writers are able to do - to construct passages that transcend their time and place and possess a beauty that transforms prose into poetry. Crumley with this book established that he had no contemporary equals; only Chandler in a few of his books is able to equal or surpass Crumley for unabashed poetic brillance. (In fact a close reading of The Last Good Kiss shows it's indebteness to Chandler's The Long Good Bye.) Many of the other reviews have touched upon the book's cynical and tragic elements - which are certianly there - but this only helps to contrast with the beauty of the writing."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Crumley is one of the great, underrated American writers and this novel is his masterpiece.

Absolutely required reading for people who think the detective novel can be literature."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"One of the best mysteries I've read. Crumley is a heck of a writer, part Hemingway, part Chandler, part Hank Williams (as one of the other reviewers mentions). His hero, Sughrue, is tough, moody, and completely believable. The opening pages of this book are perfect and ought to be mandatory reading for all aspiring crime writers: this is how you get your reader into the story."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The story begins with private detective C.W. Sughrue tracking down poet and author Abraham Trahearne, who has taken off on a drinking binge. Just as Trahearne is found and run to ground in a California bar, the owner of the bar asks Sughrue if he could investigate the disappearance of her daughter. Problem is, the girl, one Betty Sue Flowers, went missing 10 years ago and finding her drifts into the realm of impossibility. Nevertheless, Sughrue agrees to do what he can.James Crumley presents us with another private detective hailing from Meriwether, Montana. C. W. Sughrue is a very interesting character. While he's not without his faults, he drinks, chases women and breaks the law when he has to, he is a morally strong character who is determined to see that justice prevails above all else. He finds himself in an unusual position in dealing with Trahearne. Trahearne seems to live peacefully with his wife, ex-wife and mother, but feels the need to occasionally get away and go on a bender every so often. He befriends Sughrue and they do a bit of travelling together, but Sughrue keeps getting the feeling that something's not quite right, but can't quite put his finger on what it is.There's quite a bit more to this story than first meets the eye, and the key to it has to do with Sughrue's feelings towards Trahearne and his family. Sughrue's uneasiness rubbed off to me a little and I was beginning to wonder what I was supposed to be picking up. It was a clever device that drew me into the story, ensuring that I read every word closely, looking for a clue that would tip me off.This is an easy-going hardboiled story, if there can be such a thing. Sughrue is a very laid back character and seems to have all the time in the world to look for his missing persons, enjoying the journey as much as possible. This made it feel as though I was cruising through the book along with him until all the pieces of the jigsaw fell together towards the end."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This is the best mystery novel I have ever read.

The novel has a satisifying ending, just not the happy ending so characteristic of contemporary mystery writers. Lost of loose ends, some of the more likeable characters die, some of the more despicable survive."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"C.W. Sughrue is not politically correct, not worried about offending anyone's sensitive nature. No pretense at a morality tale here. C.W. is a loner and a cowboy, not sociopathic just asocial. A hard-boiled detective in the classic mold of Lew Archer, Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, Travis McGee. Roaming the west, from Montana to Sonoma, Oregon to Denver, C.W. drinks, fights and fornicates (loves doesn't describe him) his way across the back roads and highways of a western wilderness landscape, with only occasional stopovers on the margins of civilization, in desperate pursuit of whom and what he has, at best, only a vague notion. Crumley has a talent for story-telling but tends to stretch credibility (C.W.'s El Camino, 454 V8 under the hood, can out-corner a Porsche Carrera - I don't think so). Reader advisory: members of N.O.W. need not bother to open this book, there is no feminist view of the world herein. Crumley is to be recognized for his craft, but he is not, as some have advertised, the best in this genre (compare to, for example, Raymond Chandler's &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, similar story, better result). The story starts wearing thin about half-way and the quality of the writing fades before the end."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"After reading the glowing reviews, I thought I would be in for a mesmerizing journey. Sorry to say, I would only classify it as meandering. The hardboiled protagonist is witty, but his manner is laconic and there is little forward thrust to the story. Yes, there are some 'surprises' and suspense, but the rhythm is (no doubt purposely) bruisingly slow. One can sense the intelligence and dilligence in the author's efforts, but the book, as a whole, was not compelling."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"A critic once wrote that - typically - readers either really like James Crumley's novels or they can't stand them. The Last Good Kiss was the second Crumley novel that I have read. (The Final Country was the first). After reading it, I still can't decide which category fits me.1978's The Last Good Kiss centers on a seedy Montana private eye named C.W. Sughrue. A wealthy woman hires Sughrue to track down her wayward husband - a hard-drinking writer whose binge is taking him across the American West. Sughrue tracks the man down with relative ease, but soon finds himself on another case - that of a woman who disappeared into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury during the 1960s.As other reviewers have noted, Crumley's plots are secondary to his meditations on life. In The Last Good Kiss, Crumley uses the novel to explore the failure of the 1960s youth culture to achieve its goals. The characters in the novel are believable in that they are imperfect and struggling to deal with life. Crumley's concerns bring to mind Robert Stone's novel Dog Soldiers, which also appeared in the late-1970s.The Last Good Kiss contains some notable weaknesses. The \\"mystery\\" aspect of the plot is easy to solve and Crumley reveals the truth long before the book's end. Also, Sughrue is an ambivalent protagonist - a mean-spirited drunk who spied on \\"subversive\\" hippies for the government when he got into trouble while in the Army. But - somehow - Sughrue is still likable enough that the reader cheers for him.Crumley's fans regard The Last Good Kiss as one of his best novels.

Judging by its plot, a complicated and over-blown private eye adventure, this book is at best average. But despite this 'The Last Good Kiss' is a rather memorable (if insignificant) piece of hard-boiled fiction. Why? Well...Firstly, the book just oozes with 1970s ambiance. Yes, everyone is drunk and over-sexed. Lots of driving around with no concern of fuel economy. The language and 'attitude' of the times are captured perfectly. This is due in no small part to the deceptively effortless prose. It's all very literate without feeling like (stuffy) literature.Secondly, 'The Last Good Kiss' has some of the most strange and perverse characters imaginable. They seem like refugees from some bad early 1970s movie. Yet, somehow, they sustain the reader's interest long after the plot has fizzled out (..about halfway through).A few words on the plot? Let's see. Private eye hired by attractive woman to find no good ex-husband. Private eye then joins ex-husband to find missing daughter of a barmaid. Jump to vignettes involving porno, drugs, sex/sex/sex and some violence, and that's about it. Of course it seems everyone falls in love with our private eye ... go figure.Bottom line: ridiculous story more than salvaged by memorable characters and 1970s nostalgia."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"James Crumley's classic THE LAST GOOD KISS had me pretty riveted from start to (almost) finish, but the controversial final chapter really put me off, and left me a bit unclear as to the character's motivations for doing what they did.Can someone explain to me why Trehearne and his first wife would kill Betty Sue when she was already leaving of her own accord? Was it because, even though she was willing to pay for her to leave, Catherine (wife #1) was so jealous of Betty Sue that she wanted her dead? Was it because of Trehearne's line \\"I know that I can't live without her\\"? The grim denouement of the story really came out of nowhere for me.

It kept me turning the pages. Great summer read with lots of twists and surprizes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This is the heir of Raymond Chandler? Please. The book goes like this: Hillbilly PI is sent out to find a bearded, macho writer (a Hemingway stand-in). He finds him drinking beer with a bulldog (the novel's single instance of invention). The two of them then decide to quest after a girl ten years gone. On the way, they drink (wow!) and do drugs (while drinking? cutting edge!) and admire the thighs of blue-collar women. This book completely lacks the romance, humor, and stylistic brilliance of Chandler, as well as the narrative rewards of lesser hardboiled novels. Skip it."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This book has been praised by many, including crime writers I admire, but now that I've read the book, all I can say is that I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The story lacks suspense and narrative tension (things just kind of happen, one after another, to the passive protagonist); the characters are disappointingly superficial; and my B.S. meter was in the red zone throughout a large part of the book. It's neither a mystery nor a thriller; it's more of a period road-trip story with a weakly-motivated quest and some shady characters and dealings thrown in. The ending (with or without the last chapter) brought no satisfaction.How anyone can compare this writer to James Ellroy is beyond me. Yes, there's some superficially grim subject matter in The Last Good Kiss, but Ellroy, unlike Crumley, digs into his stories' evil in a relentlessly true and honest way. Further, where Ellroy's writing sings and bops, Crumley's is pedestrian. Perhaps sleazy subject matter was shocking in the '70s, but it sure isn't now. The whole '70s on-the-road shtick gets old fast, too. The bulldog was the best thing about this book.If you want to read fine crime writing that's grim, true, and well written, try Ellroy's The Big Nowhere and the rest of his L.A. Quartet, or anything by Dennis Lehane."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Quite simply one of the best PI novels ever written. Don't believe me? Listen to author Dennis Lehane who calls the book the same, and teaches it in his American Crime Fiction class... I mean an drunk dog, what could be better?"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"I read this book because a reviewer raved about it -- but told his readers to skip the last chapter. With a recommendation like that, what could I do but read the entire book, especially the last chapter? I'm still undecided about whether I approved of the ending, but I'm glad I disobeyed the reviewer and read it anyway.This is as much a character study about its detective as it is a mystery. It also lets the reader visit a side of America most of us have never seen.Be warned that this novel can be grim. Alcohol isn't just prevalent, it's as vital as air to these people. These characters could drink Nick and Nora Charles under the table, and would probably pick their pockets after they passed out.Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance (I have diverse tastes :-&gt;)"},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The Last Good Kiss started strong but as it progressed there came a point where the characters were going in circles. I did not know if the characters ever get out of a loop of drinking binges and temper tantrums, and personal woes involving the PI, the fictional author and his ex-wife, current wife, and mother. Luckily this cycle ended and the book ended just as strong as it began."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"I agree with the other reviewers--a well-written P.I. novel. I don't usually read mysteries these days and even though I read this one two decades ago I simply had to say a word or two about it as a way of paying respects to Mr. Crumley and the fine job of writing he has done here. Terrific read. Just thinking about it makes me want to buy another copy (I lost the first one somewhere) for a second reading. Genre novels of this caliber are few and far between. Bukowski attempted to write one entitled Pulp and failed miserably. I like Buk a lot, but to be honest he missed the target entirely with his take on the P.I. tale. What can you do? Last Good Kiss delivers."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"This is an excellent mystery novel. If you taught a University level course on the mystery-noir, this would follow Hammett and Chandler and precede James Lee Burke and George Pelicanos. Additionally, W.C. Sughrue, Crumley's (I hesitate to say hero) lead, places us smack dab in the middle of the post Vietnam, pot-smoking, alcohol drenched seventies. So we get a chance to travel back in time, a time which some of us have forgotten by choice, and recollect how foolish we were. And Sughrue reminds us of all of that, because he readily embraces the release points of that decade: sex; drugs; rock \`n roll.The dialogue is tight, realistic and sensible. I suppose the drawback is that all of the characters are such low lifes. Even the good guys you wouldn't hang around with if you had a choice. Sughrue, unlike Elvis Cole, Spenser and Dave Robicheaux, doesn't do the right thing, really isn't faithful too much and really has . . . . well, no standards.But I have to rate it high. It has no pretenses. It is what it is. A good, tight, straight, melancholy, angry story about angry people in angry times, who weren't very nice to begin with. Worth your time."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"Never having read raymond chandler I can't comment on comparisons to him, but I was blown away by this book. Crumley's style is so easy to read and yet contains so much underlying depth and emotion that you don't appreciate how good the story and writing is until your done. The author's brings home the story in about half the amount of pages that today's so called top author's would need.Although there are really no direct connections the book reminded me in some ways of the movie pulp fiction. The time setting of the story in 1979 fits in perfectly with the many themes of the book - confusion, searching for an unreachable goal, and yet gritty realism. The best way to describe this book is that it is filled with honest emotion. Read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The Last Good Kiss starts off slowly with a mildly interesting task for our hero, but soon the novel spills over into a booze-soaked road novel with intrigue, seduction and double-crosses. A must on any bookshelf."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"What a sad read ... Joe Sixpack gets mixed up looking for a famous author who likes to go on drinking binge road trips across the western states. Crumley creates in C. W. Sughrue midwestern Phillip Marlowe who's just as tough and cynical as the LA original. If you've read all of Raymond Chandler's works and are looking for something along that line of style then this book is for you. It has the fem fatales and the damisals in distress. And most of all the romance of the hard-boiled genre in general. The story carries you through at a good pace not stopping along the way with the characters as they live out their so-called lives. With the qualities of a modern fairtale there's no happy ending ... just the gritty Tao-like reality of life in the modern world. While set in the late 70s the writing is timeless as Chandler's Marlowe."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"After I read interviews with two of my favorite crime fiction authors (Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly) who both said that this book was excellent hardboiled crime fiction and a major influence on their work, I had to find a copy and read for myself. It's quirky and unusual, and it's not your stereotypical hardboiled crime ripoff by an author trying to copy Raymond Chandler, but I didn't impress me that much.Maybe if I had never read Hunter Thompson, the godfather of gonzo journalism, I would have been more impressed. But after reading this, what I was left with was the feeling that Crumley had taken Hunter Thompson's style and bizarro characters and plugged them into a crime novel. Interesting, but not as groundbreaking as I was expecting after hearing Lehane and Connelly rave about this guy.One Crumley novel was OK, but I have no compulsion to seek out more."},{"Title":"THE LAST GOOD KISS, a novel","review":"The Last Good Kiss by James Crumley is a book that will stay with me for a long time. The editorial review says that Last Good Kiss is \\"unforgettable\\" and it is. The excellent reviews by Michael Dixon and Anthony Dauer really hit the nail on the head.

Like the saying goes, \\"you'll only use half your seat.\\" Hey, where's my El-Camino?!"},{"Title":"My apprenticeship","review":"The second part of Gorky's autobiographical trilogy takes him out of childhood and into his early teens. He develops into a headstrong, tough and intelligent boy. The difficult relationship with his Grandfather in the first book develops in amusing and shocking ways, while the influence exerted over him by his Grandmother also changes - but I don't want to give too much away!What is most remarkable about My Apprenticeship, I think, apart from the humour and beauty of Gorky's rugged prose, is that the dilemmas faced by Gorky, growing up in poverty, and the dilemmas of those around him, are quite inseperable from the dilemmas facing people today (or at least, facing me), both existential and material. A remarkable passage towards the end of the book rises towards a magesterial outburst from the older writer, in which he explains why he is outlining in such graphic terms the hardship of life, that can force people to acts of such desperate barbarity. His duty it seems, is to make people aware of what is around them, to strip away the illusions that we willingly blind ourselves with, to protect ourselves from uncomfortable truths. In the age of Brass Eye vs tabloid truth-bending, this could not be more topical.A gripping read on every level. It loses a star, I think, in comparison to the first installment. My Apprenticeship meanders a little, but the characters are as unforgettable.P.S. Some trilogy's can be read out of order. This one can't."},{"Title":"My apprenticeship","review":"This autobiography covers the beginning of Gorky's adult years at the age of eleven (!) and goes until he decides to enter university at the age of fifteen. At the age of 9, Gorky is thrown to the wolves (\`the horrors of everyday life'). His \`career' goes over architect apprentice, dish-washer on boats, bird trapper, nurse, icon seller and ultimately foreman at the age of 14!He sees around him \`men with insatiable sexual hunger', \`dirt and the inevitable viciousness that came with the hard, half-starved life that people had to lead' and \`a corrosive, exasperating boredom enveloping everything'. A world full of promiscuity, obscenities, \`where all men are enemies'. Moreover, people were living in an environment of religious fanaticism brought on by a terrifying God.But, he also made crucial encounters with clairvoyant men, who teach him: \`go on, try and find out for yourself.' They force him to take decisions and make him understand clearly: \`I must do something, or I'll be finished'. At the end, he tries to enroll himself as a student at the Kazan University.This book is also a profound laudation on reading which was crucial for Gorky's escape out of darkness: \`books made me invulnerable to many things' and that notwithstanding the \`deep humiliation and the many insults his passion for reading inflicted on him'.This work is a dark and terrible portrait of Russia under the tsars at the end of the 19th century.But it shows how an individual can succeed in keeping his self-esteem and escape a certain intellectual death, here mainly through a passion for reading and knowledge.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"My apprenticeship","review":"Gorky's 2nd book of triology is every bit as good as the first. Russia's favorite Russian writer."},{"Title":"My apprenticeship","review":"Maxim Gorky's My Apprenticeship is the second part of his three part autobiography which includes My Childhood and My Universities. For those who haven't been introduced to Gorky, Maxim Gorky is the pen name of Aleksey Maksimovich Peshkov, born in 1868 in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. After a difficult childhood marked by his mother and father's death, being forced out of his impoverished grandfather's house at the age of eleven, and an attempted suicide at nineteen, Gorky went on to achieve fame writing about the destitution, wretchedness, faint joy and torpor of Russia's peasant and working classes in the late 19th and 20th century. Forced to exile by both the czarist regime and later the Bolsheviks, Gorky returned to Russia in 1929 a literary and cultural hero. I have read Fragments from My Diary and now My Apprenticeship, both autobiographical, but Gorky is also remembered for his plays and novels.My Apprenticeship begins with Gorky leaving the home of his grandfather and working as a servant and apprentice in \\"a fashionable shoe shop\\" in his home town of Nizhny Novgorod. The narrative proceeds through stints at the bourgeois home of a contractor and drafter, as a dishwasher on board a steamship on the Volga, at an ikon painter's shop, and other adventures and misadventures. The breadth of Gorky's adolescent memory and the vivid clarity of these impressions is staggering, especially so in his characterizations of the people that inhabit his past. In Fragments from My Diary as well as My Apprenticeship, Gorky's overall focus is the literary portrait; the appearance, idiosyncrasies, elaborate whims and simple gestures of his subjects. Gorky narrates his story primarily through his impressions of others, which can lead readers at times feeling as if he or she has read not one, but many biographies in the pages of My Apprenticeship. Through this approach Gorky makes sincere attempts at illuminating the life and soul of the Russian peasant and working class; what sustained or destroyed them amongst the squalor and morose of their everyday life.Reading Gorky write about himself as a child from the vantage of an adult is at times disorienting, and perhaps the adult Gorky's Social Realism literary philosophy is too present within this book filled with the impressions of his youth. My Apprenticeship is rich with description into personal suffering and struggles balanced against a portrayal of the working class, petty bourgeois and peasant culture of the time. In the pages of the autobiography we find an extremely sensitive, aware and awakened child, who, even amongst the squalor and chaos of his life, manages to keep some grounded sense of self. Gorky as a child is portrayed as a sort of spiritual novitiate on a mission to find hope and redemption within his surroundings and the people that populate his world. However, My Apprenticeship is not given over to the creation of Gorky as a hero, and therefore he does not fill his narrative with the requisite villains and a sustained narrative arc to salvation. Though certain characters such as Smury, a cook on board a steamship Gorky works with, Gorky's grandmother, and \\"Queen Margot\\", a young upper class widow that lives next door to the Gorky, are treated with reverence, many of the rough hewn characters in My Apprenticeship are instead a focus of Gorky's disappointed vitriol or humanistic compassion. Throughout the text, Gorky relates how the general pressures of his society bend and at times break his counterparts into lives of chronic malaise, petty crime, drunkenness and prostitution.Much of the narrative within My Apprenticeship is given over to Gorky's love of literature and those people who helped or dissuaded him from the lives, insights, and realities that can be found in books. As a matter of fact, My Apprenticeship could be used a sort of bibliography discussing the great Russian and European writers of the time. Many times in the text, the people who engage Gorky find him \\"different\\", give him books, and express that he should be in school. As a young boy, Gorky hungered for a reality that was better than the life in which he inhabited. Perhaps it was that dissatisfied hunger which later gave Gorky such vivid impressions of the Russian culture of his childhood, and of our common humanity."},{"Title":"How to Pay Zero Taxes (Serial)","review":"Being a CPA and attorney,I am a saavy financial person and read a lot of tax and financial books.How To Pay Zero Tax has been out for quite a while and is actually one of the first tax planning books that I have read. It is fairly comprehensive and actually better than most of the tax planning books out there. However,there are two main problems with it though for the average reader.First, it is literally much too much. It has over 600 pages and some of it isn't clear. Mr.Schnepper tries to be all things to all people, which doesn't really succeed. I guess a point in all directions is a circle. In fact, despite its length,some of the discussion on topics tends to be too brief.The second problem that has been noted by other reviewers is that this book hasn't be kept up to date. I guess Mr. Schnepper is &quot;resting on his laurals.&quot;Let me be clear about this: it's not that I disliked this book. It is just that there are a number of other, more up to date and better written tax books that I would recommend instead such as Lower Your Taxes: BIG TIME by a Mr. Botkin."},{"Title":"How to Pay Zero Taxes (Serial)","review":"Schnepper's book is not without its nuggets of ideas. However, to lead the reader to believe he or she will pay zero taxes is a bit misleading. This book is much too wordy and dense for the average reader. It's best to give it to your tax advisor and let them sort through the material. Schnepper devotes much of the book to case law, which is of more interest to tax attorneys than general consumers. Particularly frustrating is that the index must be from previous editions of the book. As I tried to reference various topics, the pages cited were not where the information I needed was. In short, this book is not particularly user-friendly and excessive attention was devoted to random topics."},{"Title":"How to Pay Zero Taxes (Serial)","review":"This book was a disappointment because it did not show meenough in tax savings to justify the cost of the book.

I'm a female, I'm a serious Sub, and I love to be dominated. Although I'm very independent, very dominating in my personal business affairs, where sex is concerned I am into utter and complete submission. So now you know where I am coming from.The Gor series is about dominance and submission, period. Of course there is the 'big' story. But the sexual philosophy is the core of the series IMHO. I love the series up until Captive, but after that I find it becomes far too brutal, (for me) leaning toward an ugly, mean-spirited sadism. The first seven books reveal the true beauty of sexual slavery, masters and slaves have a mutual need, whose end result is pleasure, pain, and an immense erotisism that only those who understand, can experience. For me, the series ends after this book.I read 'Captive of Gor' some 20 years ago. I was so excited to read the story of a slave, rather than Tarl/Bosk adventures and POV. I love Elinors abduction, and induction into the world of the Kajira. As I read it I became her, Gor entered my dreams, both awake and asleep. I loved the majority of the 'minutae' of Gorean slave culture. On a few occasions it became excessive, but hey, that is what skimming is for, to get back to the good stuff. I wanted so badly to be whisked off to the counter earth, I could hardly stand it.If you compare this book to 'Slave Girl of Gor' it is about the incredible joy of submission, while the latter is about pure sadism, humiliation, and punishment. I hated the books immediately after 'Captive' for their excessive punishment and cruelty, so much that I skipped ahead to 'Slave Girl'. I never made it through the first hundred pages. How noble is it for three hardened Gorean warriors to rape, and mercilessly beat, a frightened girl from Earth? Not very. Gone is any sense of pleasure, of rapturous joy. All that is left is brutality. In 'Captive of Gor' Miss Brintons journey is brutal to be sure, but the element of erotic joy between master and slave is what makes it wonderful for her in the end. If you are powerfully stirred by dominance and submission, I think you might really like it.My issue with Mr. Norman is his insistance that the Master/Slave relationship must be built on intense physical abuse, punishment, psychological violence, and Sadism. No master need treat me that way. I am a good little slave, obedient, and ready to serve, I need no abuse. I am ready to please my Master, but I have my own demand, which is respect, kindness, protection, and to recieve pleasure myself. I should be cherished."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.11.) Slave Girl... - 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages. Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival. Cos goes to war with Ar.21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.23.) Vagabonds... - unread.24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus with amnesia, told by a slave girl.26.) Prize... - unread.

I would argue that the signs are already apparent in both this book and the previous one.Despite her characterisation, the main character is *hardly* a liberated woman from New York. She is hobbled by her lack of discernment and lack of respect for her fellow humans. She is chained by her inability to recognise her own flaws and her avoidance of responsibility. Since freedom, one's right to friendship, respect, peace and prosperity comes from the acceptance of responsibility - not its avoidance. As the Gorean men who kidnapped her pointed out, she was already a natural slave...At times Elinor seems almost evil in the ways she manipulates and treats her fellow slaves on Gor but eventually it becomes apparent that she is simply stupid - almost beyond all measure. It takes some savage punishment (which she well earns and could easily have avoided if she wasn't so self centered) for her to recognise some of the salient, uncompromising facts about the world of Gor and about herself. The former is beyond her control and it is only the latter which she has any power to change. And thankfully, change she does. But this transformation is a long 350 pages in coming.One could quite easily skip whole chapters of this book - not because of Norman's prose - but because the main character is essentially unlikeable.Is Norman's work simply misogynistic? Anti-human? Not at this point in the series and besides, Norman's writing is, I feel, a little bit more complicated than that. So many reviewers seem to miss the point, seeing only the trees and not the forest.Submission, whether its comfortable to admit or not, is an intrinsic part of our daily lives. Do you wear a slave collar (tie) at work? Do you bare your throat to the alpha male in your work place? Or can you earnestly stand up to your boss and tell him he's an idiot? Or perhaps you can stand tall and unfettered by the chains of modern life and trade safety and an ordinary existance for the risk of adventure and entrepreneurial endeavour?No, I thought not. :)On Gor, Submission is not so much an evil enacted upon the free but a caste obligation, a dharmic inheritance of the female sex. Women are either terribly alone (like Verna in Hunters of Gor) or submissive and fullfilled."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"The first 6 books in the Gor series were good-to-excellent action-adventure stories featuring the stalwart Tarl Cabot who appears in this one only in a cameo role at the end in his Bosk of Port Kar persona. In this volume the protagonist is Elinor Brinton, a classic spoiled rich girl, vain, selfish, and arrogant, who is abducted to Gor by the forces of the Kurii, the alien race that contends with the Priest-Kings for dominion over Gor and Earth. Upon arrival on Gor she displays further aspects of her character by petty theft, lying, deceit, and betrayal. Not a very likeable character! The first few chapters recount her kidnapping and transport to Gor. This is fast paced and suspenseful but there are far too many far-fetched events which seem to be present only to increase the suspense and are never adequately explained. Once on Gor the book slows down considerably. She falls in with a slaver and the rest of the book follows their wanderings over the Northern Forest area of Gor, Koroba, and finally Port Kar. The story is notable for the series' first close encounter with a Kur, an exciting aerial combat scene between the tarnsmen Rask of Treve and Haakon of Skjern, and the reappearance of Talena, Tarl Cabot's Free Companion from Volume 1. The latter sets up the motivation for the next volume (which can be readily understood without reading this one). The previous 6 novels were adventure stories with bondage material thrown in, sometimes obtrusively. This one seems to be written in order to delve into the minutia of slave life and to show Elinor Brinton's redemption through the joys of slavery(!)and what little action occurs is little more than an afterthought. If you are interested in Gorean slave culture, you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, I recommend that you skip it."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. One of the worst books I have EVER read. Norman goes horribly wrong in this book with an endless stream of drivel about how women are really not women nor are they truly happy until they are raped repeatedly by big strong manly types who carry swords and spears. He goes on to suggest that us earthly man types are weak because we &quot;allow&quot; our women freedom instead of making them slaves, which leads to everyone on earth being unhappy. Avoid this book if at all possible. It adds only one minor plot point to the overall series which is revealed in the first few pages of the next book, so you will not miss anything by skipping this one."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"Captive of Gor is the seventh Gor novel. Now when reading the Gor Saga you can really separate the books roughly into two categories, those that move along the science fiction storyline and those that is only there to show female slavery and women being put in their place. Captive of Gor falls into the latter category. This book is about the beautiful but spoiled Elinor Brinton who off course get kidnapped, shipped to Gor and enslaved, here we get basically a whole book about this petty, selfish and spoiled woman struggling with slavery. Now do not get me wrong, it is not the subject matter I have a problem with, if one did not like stories of women being enslaved then it is not likely one would be buying or reading the seventh book in this series, my problem is that Elinor is annoying. With most of the other women from Earth sent to Gor you can sympathize with their plight and then rejoice when they finally accept their situation and find their perfect Master, Elinor however just whine, whine, whine, she get changes to escape, chances to join the Panther girls, chances to do allot, more chances than most of the other girls get, and she always messes it up. I think some of the reason this annoy me is that usually in the Gor books the slavery plots is about strong, intelligent women that yes is portrayed as very haughty and arrogant but who are still smart who then get tamed and accept slavery to a man. Elinor however is completely helpless, she can not do anything right and that reduces the enjoyment of seeing her struggling on Gor, for really in a society like on Gor that value merit in both free and slave you have to wonder why someone do not just Elinor Brinton to a sleen and be done with it.Now you might think that I by disliking the main character of this book think Captive of Gor is bad, this is not true. Captive of Gor have good character interactions, many of the secondary characters are great and the book show many interesting details around Gorean slavery. For Gorean lifestylers this book is also important, especially for those that identify as slaves as they really should read the slavery centric books, but there is also allot of good tidbits of philosophy here especially around the concept concept of freedom and what personal freedom really is.Now however if the reason you are reading the Gor books is for the science fiction storyline I think you will be disappointed by Captives of Gor. This book is about slavery and that is about it, sure it is slavery taking place on an other planet, there are alien beasts and unaging people, but the story here is about Elinor's introduction into Gorean slavery. The whole Priest Kings and Tarl and Kurii plotline is nowhere to be found. Ladies and Gentlemen it is like John Norman said let us put the alien invasion on hold, I just need to tame this b**ch first.This focus on the slavery plotline also make Captive of Gor a good stand alone book. If what you are interested in are a book about one woman's exploration of slavery then you can easily pick up this book and ignore the rest of the series. In a way this book is very beautiful, it shows a woman having to give up all her status, all her illusions and be stripped down to the barest core of her being and then stand vulnerable and naked before the men that would own her and hold her life in their hands. Like all the slave books in the Gor series Captive has that tender beauty about it, it is just that I prefer the heroine in Dancer, Slave Girl and Kajira so much better than Elinor. The other girls have personality while Elinor cam be summed up as rich bi**ch. Along the same vein if you are following the main storyline in the Gor Saga and is not interested in the slavery aspect then you can skip this book, there is little swords and spaceships here it is more boobs and chains.All in all I like Captive of Gor, it do have all the elements that make the Gor books good, and interesting setting, good characters and a delightfully unpolitically storyline. The book also have allot of the philosophy which have inspired a whole lifestyle around these books. Captive of Gor is great, but compared to the other early Gor books this stand a little weaker due to an annoying main character, this however is not a deal breaker and I still recommend Captive of Gor to any fan of the Gor Sagas."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"It seems to be a popular opinion that the Gor series went off the rails with this volume. As is almost always the case, popular opinion is dead wrong.Stylistically, Norman becomes more compact and more repetitious beginning here, but in fact it only reads even better and faster than his previous work. While Norman's prose is surely not at the extremely high literary level of an Eddison or Dunsany, he is, after all, a professor of philosophy, and writes far better than 90 percent of genre writers.Speaking of philosophy: there are no \\"lectures\\" in this book. Norman's philosophy, which is best described as Nietzschean or even Eddisonian (I again refer to E.R. Eddison, for those not familiar with the great pioneer of this genre), is expressed, by its very nature, in action and deeds of derring-do, not in dry speechifying. And there is plenty of that action here, as in the previous volumes in the Gorean canon. The use of a female protagonist keeps the series fresh; it does not diminish from its relentlessly masculine orientation.As I have explored his work in greater detail, Norman has slowly crept up my list of great science fantasy writers. His courage, originality and depth of insight into human nature, the ability to see man as he really is, are almost unequalled in postwar fiction of any genre. This last quality alone qualifies him as one of the very few true greats, along with Jack Vance, Frank Herbert, H.P. Lovecraft, R. E. Howard and even Eddison himself. And, of course, the insight he possesses and the truths he tells, so far from the P.C. egalitarianism of today, is exactly why his works are supressed and deliberately distorted by the mass-minded arbiters of taste. My advice: get all his books. They are strong medicine for the disease of the modern world, and there is nothing else like them. (And if you can, get the edition of Captive of Gor with the Boris cover, for it is one of his best)."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"This was more long winded and repetitive than it needed to be.It also had TONNES of continuity errors that - in terms of the narrator explaining complicated Gorean customs, or the mechanical workings of items - she really had no business knowing...But that is the kind of voice these stories get told with, and I still see this as a positive sum experience.I like the tongue in cheek mild misogyny, in the spirit of dominance and submissive interests between men and women. Maybe it is the Gorean male in me - or the Scorpio...I like the bondage, and it doesnt even bother me that this series always stops short of anything sexually explicit - even though if there was explicit sex it might free up the pages that end up being dedicated to ramming the \\"she was a slave, no better than an animal or piece of meat\\" theme home. Seriously there must have been cumulatively 40-50 pages of the hopeless slave plight in this installment of the Gorean Chronicles.This was the first volume in the series that wasnt exclusively in Tarl Cabot's first-person voice, though in terms of meter, and descriptiveness, it was the same voice as the previous installments. That bothered me more at the start of this, by the end I was resigned to it just being Norman's style and something I would have to embrace or ignore.All in all I thought it was pretty good."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"John Norman's study of Human Sexuality is written well in his World of Gor stories. He suggests that we humans are slaves to the society that we live in and can not truely be free until that in which we hold dear is stripped from us making us a slave to another so we as humans can find our true and hidden nature. Upon finding such we Humans can truely be free to be ourselves in the society that keeps us in collars and leashes. Being both a submissive and a psyhology major I feel John Norman has hit the proverbial nail on the head about this our enslaved world"},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I found a used copy of an early 80s printing of Captive of Gor. I had not read any of the previous Gor novels, but my father used to read them when I was young. Since this was all I had, I started in on volume 7 without having read any of the previous volumes. Although I probably would have had a better appreciation of the context if I had started with volume 1, that was not necessary to be able to understand the story.I'll admit it, I bought this book because the version I have has a very sexy cover. And yes this book is kind of a guilty pleasure for me in the sexual and anti-feminist aspects of it. But frankly this is just bad writing. The story is ok. The wold is well-developed. The protagonist is someone you love to hate. The book is just badly written. The author keeps repeating himself and coud have probably cut the length of this book to 1/3. WIth that in mind I will cut short my review before I start repeating myself."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I bought this book for a friend and they were very happy with the book and the condition that it arrrived in."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I have read several of John Norman's Gor series book and thoroughly enjoyed this one. He does well telling from a slave girl's point of view. It does make you think what would happen if you did take a spoiled rich woman from this planet used to getting what she wanted and having men cater to every whim to being a naked and chained girl on a barbarian planet who finds her true place is kneeling at the feet of a real man, her master."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"The \`captive' of the title is Elinor Brinton, a poor little rich girl, whose loveless childhood has made her both misanthropic and misogynistic. Despite her unfortunate childhood, her self-regard is huge: she considers herself brilliant and the rest of humanity more or less witless. Although psychologically repugnant, she is beautiful enough, physically, to attract the attention of white slavers who abduct her and take her to the planet, Gor, where women of her beauty are likely to be made sex slaves and sold to the highest bidder. This fate falls to Elinor: under the threat of the lash or worse she is trained to be submissive to the dominant men who purchase and dominate her. She learns, perhaps paradoxically that being beaten by a man is an expression of his regard and comes to believe that the chains in which she is kept and the constant humiliations to which she is subject are no more than the biological due owed to the sexual dimorphism of human beings, the enslavement of the physically weaker sex being held up as the ideal for managing a human society. Eventually Elinor comes to understand how loathsome her behaviour once was and how much more decent a person the regime of humiliation and punishment has made of her. She falls in love with the excessively alpha male who has captured and tortured her. Although subject to some strange neoligisms invention of the author's the novel is beautifully written and, as one might expect from the pen of a professor of Philosophy, the \`politically incorrect' philosophical underpinnings carry surprising conviction. A book to calculated to make the repressed male of Earth smile wryly and the frigid Earth female shrug with resignation. I imagine man-hating feminists who are able to find their way past the cover design would read it with self-righteous indignation."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"This is certainly not the best of the Gor series and its said that after this point that it all goes downhill.

I am forcing myself to read this tripe. I quite honestly don't understand how this was published. The author, the editor, and the publisher had to be smoking something. It's not the subject matter, it's the writing! It is repetitive **to the extreme**. It is BORING beyond belief. This same story could be told MUCH better (I have a hard time seeing it told any worse).The main character I just want to see shot and dumped in a ditch somewhere, complete waste of a woman. I have no problem with the story of a woman traversing a character development line. But this character, as written, is a complete loser. I had no vestment in her story except to see it end. I **seriously** found myself hoping that someone would put a crossbow bolt through her skull and that we'd then move to another character.First, she's unhappy to be a slave, then she's happy to be one, then she's unhappy, then she's happy, then she's a devious little... 'slave', then sad again, then happy, sad, and finally, in the last 30 page she finds herself - we think. The woman is written as a schizophrenic.I sure hope the rest of the series improves, because if not, this is the end for me.I have no problem reading about a woman captured on Earth, brought to Gor and her path of self-discovery as she goes from 'free' woman on Earth to 'slave' on Gor. But, this story is just written badly. Nowhere near the quality of the first 6 novels. I give it a 1 star and consider that rating spot-on.You can SKIP this book in the series as far as I can tell. The only thing that happens of note is that Tarl (Bosk) learns the general whereabouts of Talena.My review may seem harsh, but the hours in my life are limited, and I begrudge that this book took any of them. If this book had stood alone, there is no way I would have read more than a third of it before chucking it. But because the first 6 were good, and because there are 21 more novels after it, I decided to trudge on.If you read this in time - save yourself the $$ and the time, and move on to the next story, #8. I have not read it yet, but I know you can skip this one."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"It takes my breath away that Norman's work got published in the first place.The man cannot write. He uses the passive voice so much that you wonder how the plot manages to move forward AT ALL. For example:The girl, she is kidnapped. Then the girl, she is punished. The plant, it is watered. The men, they are satisfied. Sometimes they are angered. Then the girl, she is punished again. And the men, they are satisfied again.Years ago, someone recommended the Gor series to me. I picked this volume at random at a used bookstore, and found it comically bad.If you love to read about reluctant slave-girls, and you don't want your fantasy interrupted by a complex sentence or the active voice, these may be the books for you.But if you have any standards at all for the quality of the writing, skip these. You'll find better writing on random fan-fiction or fetish web sites. (Ok, I don't actually know that, but aside from spelling, there's no way the writing could be worse.)"},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"Tarzan this is not. Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I understand John Norman's philosophy of male-female relations. I even understand the cultural changes to which he was reacting when he conceived of Gor. And while I don't agree that all women secretly want to be enslaved, I can acknowledge that a fair number would prefer a dominant man rather than one they could dominate.So why did Norman see the need to reiterate this philosophy to the point of tedium while ignoring the concept of a plot that might make the protagonist's internal musings at least interesting? It seems that the plot can be summed up as \\"snooty rich girl from Earth is kidnapped to Gor, where she cannot seem to make up her mind from one page to the next whether in her heart she is free or a slave, better than men or worse, hating them or loving them...\\" If there were a pattern of growth in the character it might have salvaged the book, but she covered the same ground over and over with no indication that she ever gained in self-knowledge. She is shallow and boring, and the plot is a thin veneer over a socio-political rant that polarizes the genders with no thought for individual differences. I enjoyed the preceding books in the series, but they have gone downhill since this one, and the next is not shaping up to be much more interesting. Tarl, who was an interesting hero because of the balance of attraction and contradition between his personal codes and those of Gor, has become a two-dimensional Gorean cartoon.Disappointing."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"For a fan of the fighting, almost-heroic exploits of Tarl Cabot; of some of the more memorable characters in the series that I have encountered, and for the good, interwoven story lines, I have to admit that next to \\"Nomads\\" and \\"Assassin\\" I found this book highly enjoyable.I found myself fascinated by life as a slave from a girl's perspective, an Earth girl at that, a barbarian. I was intrigued by what I call an inner struggle with Elinor's transition from free Earth girl to enslaved Gorean female. Her longing to return to Earth, to be free, and her adamant and defiant attitude towards slavery conflicted greatly and constantly with her ever-growing desire to be enslaved by a strong warrior, to be collared and, to serve a master made for great reading.This has become one of my favorite books in the series.As usual, the greater story of Tarl Cabot is included although the story does not revolve around him and his adventures this time. Some questions the reader might have from the previous books are answered.I strongly recommend this book for fans of John Norman and the Gor series."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"I had a hearty laugh over a used John Norman book a friend brought over, &quot;Tribesmen of Gor,&quot; a colorful,purply-prosed desert space opera with slave girls. &quot;So bad it's good!&quot; I picked up Captive of Gor with the same expectation and was deeply disappointed, primarily because the main character, Elinor, is such a shallow, self-deceiving twit, impossible to sympathize with. The plot - such as it is - proceeds with glacial slowness, interrupted by snivelling catfights and petty snitching. Little of the color or culture of Gor is presented, and little of the amusing bombast of Tarl Cabot. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"Yes, a new Earthling comes to Gor.

The description of sex ends at \\"..as we lay back on the furs\\". Thanks God or I wouldn't read these books. I'm in it for the action/adventure on this \\"other\\" world.The first half of the book is mostly boring. I grew tired of Elinor's constant flip flopping on who she hated or loved. Also, the reasons for female slavery on Gor grow tiresome.However, a lot is revealed in the book including more info on the \\"Others\\" and what happened to Talena, his free companion from book on and the daughter of Marlenus, Ubar of Ar. We also get our first introduction to the savage Kurii beasts and the introduction of Rask of Treve.I don't believe this book should be skipped.

It's just suffering through the first 2/3 that becomes the struggle."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"which is about the best thing I can say about this story. Gorean masters are supposed to be able to do anything they damn well please to their slaves. In fact, when Rask punishes Elinor too severely, he is punished pretty severely in turn. It seems that natural law does include retribution, even for Gorean masters.It's also worth noting that Norman seems to identify with the slave women. They are, he said, often chained to their desks to write fantasies--and that's the story of his life. Unlike his other images, this has nothing to do with any form of slavery that has ever been described. And he has obviously done extensive research into them all: in Rome, Denmark, Arabia and, of course, the good old US of A.So can't he come up with some other stories, in addition to the everlasting Torture of the Shrew? What about a slave girl whose master wins her true devotion by torturing the slave trader who captured and abused her? This really happened to a slave trader named John Newton, who responded by writing \\"Amazing Grace\\" and starting an anti-slavery society. (\\"Grace on Gor\\"?)For that matter, what about a Free Woman who gets enslaved for starting an anti-slavery society but realizes that she can enjoy her slavery if she's allowed to say it is morally wrong? (\\"Traitors of Gor\\"?)And what about a powerful televangelist from Earth who is forced to live her faith, by comforting the oppressed yet forgiving their oppressors on Gor? She could wind up being crucified, even though her love master would have to pull the nails out at the last moment. You KNOW that John Norman really wants to crucify a woman, if given half a chance. (\\"Passion of Gor\\"?)And what if the slave traders capture Harriet Tubman's great-great-great granddaughter, who has heard more ways for slaves to escape than their masters can even dream of? (\\"Legacy of Gor\\"?) Sure, slavery is sexy because power is sexy, but it can be interesting, too.But at any event, IMHO, these books should NOT be read by teen-agers. No matter what variations we come up with, this is still pro-slavery S/M bondage stuff. It is incredible that teens could freely find it on the sci-fi shelf 30 years ago, while adults debated whether they should be allowed to read the great anti-slavery masterpiece, Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","review":"...First the short version. This book constitutes nothing less thanan all-out assault on humanity. Not, I repeat, NOT just women. Nowfor the longer version. While the book's misogynistic slant isobvious from literally the third or fourth line on the first page, itis my view that this book is not only misogynistic but misanthropic aswell. John Norman presents a reductionist view of human relations(not just sexual realtions!) that reduces our great race of sixbillion plus down to four personalities, two of which are consideredaberrant. Male dominant, female submissive, male submissive, andfemale dominant. I leave it to the reader to determine which two ofthese four personalities are supposedly aberrant. Aside from beingmisanthropic, the book is horrendously simplistic in its message. Imust confess, I did not (or should that be can not?) read the entirebook. But I figure that anyone who can ceaselessly chant about theglory of male domination and female submission for two hundred thirtysome-odd pages can do the same for three hundred. Or six hundred. Ora thousand. Or for a series of twenty books. Or even ad infinitum.I only hope the writer of this book, with a PhD in philosophy, noless, only wrote this book to supplement his income, and does nottruly believe that which he writes within these accursed pages. Inshort, I would never burn a book, for I believe that the printed wordis sacred, (not in the religious sense!) but if a madman were to pointa gun at my head and order me to burn a single book, _Captive of Gor_would be my choice.End note: While I do not mean to imply that theassault of this book is aimed with equal ferocity at men as at women,the close reader cannot help but to notice the assault targeted athumanity in general, and hence at men."},{"Title":"Alchemies of the Mind: Rationality and the Emotions","review":"This superlative work belongs on the shelf of any serious student of art, literature, philosophy and psychology - not to mention those readers who seek self-knowledge. Author Jon Elster explores the complex cognitive antecedents and consequences of emotional experience. Noting that much of what society needs to know about emotions is inaccessible in the psychology laboratory, he makes original, insightful use of literary and philosophical sources. He uses the work of such authors as Francois de La Rochefoucauld, Michel de Montaigne, Jean de La Bruy&egrave;re and Alexis de Tocqueville to examine how emotional mechanisms function. This approach sheds light on the emotions and on the way you might read literature or listen to music. We highly recommend this book and find it valuable not only for what it says, but for what it inspires. It is capable of changing how you think and feel in ways that are (just as emotions themselves) far from predictable."},{"Title":"Alchemies of the Mind: Rationality and the Emotions","review":"I gave this book to a friend who is currently taking a Neuroscience Course which uses this text. Well written and excellent text book."},{"Title":"Alchemies of the Mind: Rationality and the Emotions","review":"I cannot praise this book enough. The writing is clear, the thinking is meticulous and infinitely clever, and the usefullness of understanding the different theories of the emotive being in the social scinces cannot be over-emphasized.This book is Elster's best since &quot;Political Psychology&quot;.If you are not an Elster partisan, what is wrong with you?"},{"Title":"Caught Up","review":"Nevada York's book was pretty good. I have to admit I saw some of myself in her book. I think most women can honestly say they have been where Mahogany (the central character) has been.

Hurry!"},{"Title":"Caught Up","review":"I READ NEVADA YORK'S CAUGHT UP AND IT WAS A GOOD READ. IT KEPT ME WANTING TO TURN THE PAGE TO SEE WHAT THE CHARACTERS WERE GOING TO DO NEXT!

All I can say is Wow! I had to take the book to work with me to finish and I enjoyed every minute of it. Nevada has a unique style that I have never read before. If some readers are put off by her style, that unfortunate. They are missing out on a great book."},{"Title":"Caught Up","review":"Nevada York is off the hook!!! The only thing I usually read are magazines and newspapers, Caught Up is the first book I completely read in one night. All I got to say is that she is such a great author, I found myself having a deep emotional connection with all of the characters. Nevada York is real!! I know there are a lot of books out there right now, but everyone who has been in and out of love DEFINATELY needs to read Caught Up!!"},{"Title":"Caught Up","review":"Could this book be any more real? I am so loving this authors style. I heard this book was written buy a new author, and all I have to say is it's more down to earth mixed with the passions of everyones imagination!! I'm loving this author right now and can't wait to add some more of her books to my list of great books. PHENOMINAL!!! And I recommend everyone to read this book, there's something for everyone to get out of it because there's a little bit of everyone in it!"},{"Title":"Caught Up","review":"Let me first say this book was the worst edited novel I've ever read!!Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's get to the plot of Nevada York's Caught Up. The story revolves around best friends Mahogany and Shanice, childhood chums who have been thick and thin together. Now as college-aged adults, they're dealing with such issues as love, fidelity (or lack thereof), bisexualty, marriage, and parenthood. The novel then ties in a web of intrigue wherein Mahogany is being stalked.The plot could have been decent, but overall it was just cheesy. Read for yourself, though ... maybe you like cheese."},{"Title":"Solo: The story of an African wild dog puppy and her pack","review":"This book is a stunning first hand account of the harsh life in the african bush delivered by a great scientist capable of a great story"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"I highly recommend this book. I read it while stationed in Iraq and it encouraged me very much in that situation. It is thoroughly orthodox in its theology and praxis and has nothing to do with modern \\"psycho-babble\\" as one other reviewer mistakenly suggested. The book was written over 100 years ago. If it was written today the author most likely would use the term \\"joyful life\\" in the title rather than \\"happy life\\", but it's clear that her meaning is a happiness that comes from the Lord and is not based on circumstances (which nowadays we would probably call \\"joy\\"). Mrs. Smith's secrets to the happy/joyful Christian life are: surrendering all to the Lord, trusting implicitly in the Lord, and immediate obedience to Him. Hard to be more orthodox than that. She gives many anecdotal stories to help the reader understand how much God loves us and how surrender, trust, and obedience result in our abiding more deeply in Christ and consequently having joy in all circumstances."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"I read it 22 years ago in my first Sunday School class after becoming a Christian. Now, I am using it to teach an adult Sunday School Class. My son, a Bible student at Criswell in Dallas has also found it to be extremely accurate doctrinally. It is an inspiring book that SHOWS us that the &quot;deeper walk&quot; is simply the walk God intended for His children to have in the first place. The chapters on the WILL and avoiding LEGALISM are wonderful in guiding God's children into the wonderful truth in God's Word. Serving and knowing God as H.W.S. indicates is a liberting experience! Matt 11:28-30"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"I've read Hannah's book twice and the chapter &quot;Is God in Everything?&quot; several more times. This book is thoroughly biblical, very helpful, and highly recommended for new Christians. She wisely distinguishes between internal temptations and sin (something I remember struggling with as a new Christian - and I didn't have this book, unfortunately) and shares with the greatest of Christian mystics the truth revealed in the chapter &quot;Is God In Everything?&quot; I put this book right up there with &quot;Abandonment to Divine Providence&quot; by Jean-Pierre de Caussade, &quot;Centuries of Meditations&quot; by Thomas Traherne, and &quot;A Testament of Devotion&quot; by Thomas Kelly. The latter book is another Quaker classic. - Brad Clark"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"My review is in response to a very \\"sad\\" review written from an already established position. The reviewer [I initially named Challies, but someone corrected me, thus I have decided to refer to \\"reviewer\\"] gives us what he thinks is the thrust of the book, \\"What must the Christian DO in his quest for VICTORY?,\\" then offers his simplistic review of Hannah Smith's response, \\"NOTHING.\\" The reviewer then sums up Smith's work with his critique of \\"the man-centered and subjective age in which we live,\\" and puts Smith in this category. This is an amazingly simplistic (and ignorant) summation by an educated person - this is why I think it betrays \\"an already established position.\\"Hannah Smith lived in the latter half of the 19th century - the terms \\"happy\\" and \\"gay\\" had different meanings in common use than what we have today. A better title for this book would be \\"The Christian's Secret to a Joyful Life,\\" but we cannot retitle the work.Smith is writing to refute the basic practical theology of her strict Quaker background which apparently leaned heavily on the force of a person's determined will and discipline to gain freedom from sin. Many of us have seen how this emphasis, while possibly effective in the life of one generation, can lead to dead works and dry religion in the following generations that lack the intense affections of the initial leaders and have only been given the \\"right doctrine\\" to live by.Let's allow Hannah Smith to speak for herself;==========================The most difficult thing we have to manage is self....In laying off your burdens, therefore, the first one you must get rid of is yourself. You must hand yourself and all your inward experiences, your temptations, your temperament...all over into the care and keeping of your God, and leave them there. He made you, and therefore He understands you and knows how to manage you, and you must trust Him to do it. Say to Him, \\"Here, Lord, I abandon myself to thee. I have tried in every way I could think of to manage myself, and to make myself what I know I ought to be, but have always failed. Now I give it up to thee. Do thou take entire possession of me....And here you must rest, trusting yourself thus to Him continually and absolutely....Perfect obedience would be perfect happiness....Consecration is the first thing....In order for a lump of clay to be made into a beautiful vessel, it must be entirely abandoned to the potter, and must lie passive in his hands. And in order for a soul to be made into a vessel unto God's honor, \\"sanctified and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work,\\" it must be entirely abandoned to Him, and must lie passive in His hands....Oh, be generous in your self-surrender! Meet His measureless devotion for you, with a measureless devotion to Him. Be glad and eager to throw yourself headlong into His dear arms, and to hand over the reins of government to Him. Whatever there is of you, let Him have it all. Give up forever everything that is separate from Him. Consent to resign fromthis time forward all liberty of choice...(I cannot find my copy and have used the online version)==========================This is far from doing NOTHING. Smith's focus is on the most difficult aspect of living for God - the abandonment of YOUR will. She maintains that IF you can truly abandon yourself (I do not think this can be done 100% of the time anyway) God will do His work in you. In the past, some 20 years ago when I first read this book, I wondered if Watchman Nee had read Hannah Smith. In his little powerful book, \\"Sit, Walk, Stand\\" he says this,\\"If at the outset we try to do anything, we get nothing...For Christianity begins not with a big DO, but with a big DONE.\\" p.14 (Tyndale, 1977)Hannah Smith and Watchman Nee are both speaking about the concept in Christian spirituality that is called abstraction from the senses. This tradition speaks of a time when the Christian realizes that all the fasting, prayer and reading/memorizing of the biblical text is never enough. There is a point when the believer sees that all of his effort is still...his effort and is \\"self.\\" In abstraction the believer grasps that he must now continue his quest to draw nearer to God by resting in His presence and trusting in His grace.Watchman Nee addresses this same concept when he reminds the reader that God worked for six days creating, and concluded with the pinnacle: man. Then God rested on the seventh day. Thus Adam's first day of life was a day of rest. The believer must realize that anything he does must come from resting in God's grace:\\"...for whoever enters God's rest also ceases from his own labors as God did. Let us make every effort to enter that rest...\\" Heb 4:10,11Maybe this reviewer believes that Nee also distorted scripture here (I should confess that I am not a fan of everything Nee writes).Again, the previous reviewer: \\"God calls Christians, not to happiness, but to holiness.\\" Smith's comments on \\"perfect obedience would be perfect happiness\\" directly address this accusation. Did the reviewer really even read Smith's book? It is difficult for me to think so. \\"The Christian's Secret to a Happy Life\\" is far from the \\"self-help psychobabel\\" label the reviewer gives to it.It is true that Hannah Smith did not have a \\"happy\\" life. She had some marital issues and an unfaithful husband; she seems to have suffered some depression; and her theology was not always orthodox - she apparently struggled with the concept of eternal punishment (like Origen!). Nonetheless, this book by Hannah Smith has remained a Christian classic for a reason - it is challenging and good.And by the way, Hannah Smith did die in great misery - she suffered from arthritis during the final years of her life.R.A. BakerPh.D. Ecclesiastical History"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"This book has been blessing people for 130 years - there is a reason for that. The reason this book is so great is that it focuses upon the only 2 essential practices for Christian growth and strength: Surrender and Faith. Everything in the book teaches us how to maintain absolute surrender to and total trust in God, how to overcome difficulties so that faith and trust remain steadfast, all mingled with many words of encouragement telling of the peace and joy such a life produces.The one negative review in this list claims the book is terrible because we should seek holiness, not happiness. Clearly 100% surrender to God's will and 100% faith in God are holiness defined - and that expresses the entire thrust of the book. It is very unlikely that reviewer even read the book beyond the title - ignore them. Jesus wants our joy to be full, He tells us steps to take &quot;so that your joy may be full&quot;....but we better not tell this lone reviewer that Jesus recommends we seek joy - they might give HIM a bad review!Do what this book says to do and find God waiting there to bless you abundantly with Christ-likeness.....with the natural result being great happiness! I agree with what one review said, if I had to choose only 2 books, they would be the Bible and The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"Smith has written a classic that will continue to bless long after her passing. The book is divided into three main parts:1. The Life (how to enter into the Christ life).2. Difficulties concerning: faith, the will, guidance, doubts, temptation, failures).3. Results of the Christ-life (growth, service, joy of obedience, practical results in everyday life, etc.).Written by a Quaker, the book will encourage Christians of all denominations. Read, enjoy, and be encouraged in the Lord.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"I have an original copy of this book and it is amazing how over 100 yrs ago, Christians were having problems in the same area we as Christians are having today.

It is a must read for anyone who seeks peace - peace that is alive, lasting and supported by a body of believers today. Please give time for this masterpiece.

It saves- potentially- much time and confusion especially if one was to do it on their own."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"Being a middle aged man but a new Christian, this book focused my attention where it needed to be. Not on what I needed to do to achieve salvation and happiness, but what God has all ready done. He sent his Son into the world that I might have life and have it more abundantly. At every turn of the page, the author describes, simply and plainly, how each reader can surrender to the loving will of God, which is the Christian's secret to a happy life."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"Hannah Whitehall Smith was talking to a friend. The friend was telling her that most of the Christians she knew seemed sad and miserable, and if this is what Christianity is like, she can't imagine too many people ever becoming interested in having a relationship with Christ.This bothered Hannah, so she sought the Lord for the secret of a happy life. This book is the fruit of her discovery. The first part of the book gives the scriptural evidence that God wants us to live a happy Christian life. She refers to Romans 6:1-6, Ephesians 4:22-24, and Matthew 1:21 (It would have been helpful if the author would have put the scripture references next to the quotes as I am doing now, perhaps this probem was alleviated in more recent editions of the book. I am using the 1976 Revell edition). Part one also describes God's role in this life and our role.Part two is a discussion of the some of the difficulties that we experience as we strive to live the happy life that God wants for us. Whitall Smith deals with temptation, failures, doubts, and our own stubborn wills. She tells stories and gives examples of people who are sturggling, and others who found victory.The final section of the book describes the results of living the life that God blesses. We experience deliverance from bondage, spiritual growth, joy that comes from our obedience to God, and the blessing of having a special union with God.This is a Christian classic, and even after all these years, it still speaks. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"So many Christians struggle with every day life--just like the rest of the world.

It is fairer to say the book has been written by a religious rebel than by a Quaker.Again, like Christ, she looks to God the Father.Like Christ, she attracted followers and supporters.Like Christ, within the boundaries of loving God, she offers faith and hope. I come away from Christ with more of a sense of the importance of charity than I do after reading Ms. Smith.Again, assuming that biographical material perused after reading the book is true, the encouragement and success of the book is understandable. However, material is never confronted which might have been had the book title been 'The Joy of Being Crucified With Christ'"},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"This book blew me out the water!

It is profound and full of God's Word, but you would not guess that if you had not read the bible. I like that about it. She, Hannah, breathed in the word and exhaled life to others.

A MUST READ for every Christians of all ages."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"This book says too much for me to be able to express it here. I have been so excited in my spirit because of what this book teaches. Contrary to what a previous reviewer thought, this book does teach happiness through holiness, but not just holiness that comes from imitation of holy standards, but by having truth faith in the One who changes us. It teaches holiness by the power of holy grace, by trusting the Spirit of Christ in complete faith, without works. For one is not saved by works, and as Gal. 3 teaches, one is not perfected nor kept secure in the faith by works. All, and I mean ALL, spiritual growth in holiness comes through what 2 Peter 1 refers to as partaking of the divine nature through knowing God more, and this knowledge is not textbook knowledge. No, it's knowledge that comes from gazing at the glory of God in the face of Christ. HOliness comes from gazing at Christ Jesus and &quot;falling in love&quot; with His inexpressible beauty, not by listing the rules of Christian living and trying to build good habits. That's just psychological law and is contrary to grace.When you read this book, you will much better understand what power for holiness-based happiness is available for the believer even here on earth. This book teaches correctly that Christian mediocrity is an oxymoron. God intends for His people to live powerfully holy lives even before getting to heaven."},{"Title":"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life","review":"This is a must read for all Christians.

Many of the words are no longer used, so it was good that I had it in the Kindle which has a built in dictionary.Very entertaining.Special thanks to the folks who converted it to digital and to the folks at Amazon for letting us download it for free."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Acutally, this is a book review and no place to stir up controversy as to which ebook reader you should be currently using. I have been a \\"Kindler\\" since the good old days of the all plastic K1, and my K2 reader has seen so much use the plastic case is about to come apart from all the drops and dings. I love Amazon and all things Kindle. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is no exception.I began reading this particular tale with the free Amazon download of The Adventures of Robin Hood (Note they took the Merry out) which I believe like all their free ebooks are simply ones made available thanks to project Gutenberg. While I was reading and getting my first impressions of the book, I wondered about other peoples impressions, and began to look at some reviews. I noticed one poor chap's complaint about how this book would never be the same as the original paper book since it lacked all those wonderful illustrations.Not sure if I believed him, I picked up this copy, which includes the \\"Merry\\" and illustrations to boot.And then I bought an iPad.I really don't want to make this about the iPad, but I have to. I wanted to read this ebook on the iPad (at least some of it) because it was new, and so I did, using the Kindle app. The problem is that this book contains many many many archaic references which I feel most people don't understand, but just choose to skip over. I can't stand that. I need to know what all these weird words mean, and not just chock it up to obsolete colloquialisms. The problem is that the Kindle app has no dictionary yet, even though it has promised one \\"soon\\" since it has been available for the iPad. Even the latest version still has no dictionary, but it did improve it a lot.So, that left me unsatisfied.So, I tried iBooks, and I found something startling. On iBooks, they have all those free Gutenberg titles that Amazon has. Only they have chapter indexes, while pretty much all the Amazon titles don't, which is so frustrating. And, this version, the Merry Adventures of Robin Hood comes complete with illustrations. And it is free. It seems like even the formatting is almost perfect (not true for free Gutenberg Kindle books), like they took time and made all the free books really look like paid books. The iBooks dictionary is very complete concerning archaic terms, and is a million times easier to use when looking up a word due to the touchscreen.Needless to say, I finished this book on iBooks, since I could find no reason to go back to Kindle or even the Kindle app until they improve it.***Spoilers***Well, until I read this book I never realized how totally fabricated the Robin Hood movies have been. Maid Marian plays such a minor role (I believe she was mentioned once) and Robin Hood doesn't split an arrow right down the middle, but a lot of the stories are familiar. Robin and his merry band in Lincoln green have a good time drinking beer and eating venison and squatting in the king's forest.The basic MO was to find a guy who had too much money (an arbitrary case by case decision), and then bring them back to camp, offer them a feast (roasted vension and beer generally, maybe some Malmsey) and then have them pay for it, usually by dividing up all their wealth into three parts; one part for the owner, one part for Robin's band, and one part for some sort of charity. When the band comes across a newcomer with a problem, but not too much money, they usually offer their assistance and in return, the newcomer usually joins the band. Sometimes they go on random trips out of boredom just to see what they come across, and other times, Robin sends his men on missions. Most of their time, however, seems to be spent making merry, practicing archery, swordplay, and quarterstaff...oh, and don't forget feasting and drinking beer.The Sherrif of Nottingham is charged by the king to arrest Robin, but his band of men, his warrior's prowess and his cleverness allow him to evade capture, although the Sherrif, being none to competant and his men being cowards certainly helped Robin's cause. Robin, basically having the most talented fighting force of his day is a law unto himself, and his law is to offer help to the helpless, and to procure funds from those overburdened with coin and redistribute the wealth.The book concludes with Robin's service to king Richard, eventually granting him the title of Earl of Huntington, with his best men given special duties, and other granted the titles of the king's rangers. Eventually, under a new king, Robin finally gets to return to Sherwood forest, and feels so homesick he gives up his title and stays. His band is temporarily reunited with his band for a last stand in the forest which is won, but the loss of life causes Robin to fall ill. Robin runs to a nunnery to find healing, only to be betrayed by someone he helped in the past. Before he dies he summons Little John, whose great strength gets him to Robin's side before he dies, and Robin shoots an arrow into the forest and asks to be bured where it lands. A tearful ending.In general, in this telling of the tale, the bad guys are generally high ranking memebers of the church, and this theme is continued by Robin being killed by a nun. This theme is an interesting one, as Robin and his band seem to promote ideas which would have seemd vulgar to the church at this time (but really not vulgar today).I would detract one star for some of the language which slows down the reading, and also the general lack of any romantic interests for any of the main characters.Recommended."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Being a fan of adventure fiction, I could not ignore this truly vintage tale. This is the story of many of the adventures of Robin Hood and his merry men. I must say, as usual, the movies can't hold a candle to the book. Hollywood has also chosen to ignore Robin Hood's attitude toward the church and clergy, which were important issues in his day. Written in the 18th century, it takes a little getting used to the language, but it quickly becomes part of the ambience as Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck, and the scores of merry men began to charm me.Like all good storytellers, Pyle pulls us in with glamour first, making us fall for Robin Hood and his good, stout yeomen for their light spirits and good deeds, before showing us their darker side, taking us along while they rob the rich, after first seducing us with the laughter and free-flowing ale after the fact. The story reads like a fairy tale, with Robin Hood and the merry men doing a lot of lying around in the grass waxing merry when they aren't feasting and sucking down mass quantities of ale and good, stout March beer. Of course, given the times, everyone drank beer, ale, or wine nearly all the time. Why not? They walked everywhere.Naturally, Hollywood has also played up the romance angle between Robin Hood and Maid Marian, but in this book, Robin's lady love gets barely a mention. Females aren't totally left out, Queen Eleanor being an especially engaging character, but mostly these are stories of battles and games of skill played out by men, done with good humor that even had me laughing out loud.This book has stood the test of time and deserves respect for that, but it is also engaging even today. It was easy to transport myself to the English woods of the thirteenth century when life was simple and one could avoid the law simply by changing his clothes and adopting an alias. With some enigmatic actors and a script that stayed true to the book, this would make a wonderful movie to outshine all those other namby-pamby Robin Hoods. It would be fun to see these stories on the big screen with some quality talent. I guess, though, I will have to be content, as others have for centuries, with my imagination to see the vivid characters in this wonderful book in action."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I am a young writer but I still know that this book was a wonderful book and should be read by evertone who can get there hands on it.

It's a very long book, I had no idea how long, but I was disappointed when it ended, and that's a great thing."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"It pains me that people are reading this without the illustrations. (Referring to Kindle edition).Howard Pyle was the first person in the modern era to collect all the Robin Hood ballads that had come down from the midieval era and put them into a modern format, structured as stories and so forth. Essentially every version of Robin Hood in the past century has drawn on Howard Pyle's Robin Hood as its major source, and reading this book is the best way to understand why the minor characters in (for example) Kevin Costner's \\"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\\" are named things like \\"Will Scarlet\\" or \\"Much the Miller's Son.\\"I was given this book to read as a child, and it was and still is one of my all-time favorites (although I always avoided reading the final chapter, which Pyle even warns his readers they may want to do). The elevated, pseudo-elizabethan style even helped me later on -- when I got to Shakespeare in school, the language was easy for me, because I'd been reading Howard Pyle since I was eight.The problem with this ebook version is that it doesn't contain the illustrations, though. And that's simply unforgivable. Howard Pyle is today better known as an illustrator than as a writer. He was the art teacher who taught people like Arthur Rackham and N.C. Wyeth. His illustrations are immensely rich and detailed, and as full of period accuracy and background research as his writing was. It's an unforgivable shame to miss them.Versions of this book can be found online free with illustrations. Don't bother with this version, as it doesn't have them. Reading this book without the illustrations is like taking an oscar-winning film and just listening to the sound with the screen blacked out. You can do it, but why?EDIT: There are now many Kindle versions of this book, all cross-linked so they share reviews. Currently at least, none of the free versions have illustrations; the 99-cent version marked \\"illustrated\\" does appear to have most of them, but severely cropped, without many of Pyle's marginalia and scrollwork."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Who hasn't heard of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest? In this book you meet them all - including the powerful Little John, courageous Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly Friar Tuck. Howard Pyle offers what is probably the most complete and best collection of Robin Hood tales. All the old favorites are included - Little John and his quarter-staff toppling Robin into the water, Robin winning the golden arrow at Nottingham's archery contest, and the Sheriff being outsmarted in numerous attempts to capture Robin. But these are just the tip of the iceberg - this book is chock-full of entertaining merry adventures.The medieval setting is portrayed beautifully, including the vast gulf between the upper and lower classes of society, the corruption and greed of the nobility, and the hypocrisy of the medieval Roman Catholic church where religion has degenerated to mere outward rituals. Even the language is somewhat antiquated, which initially seems tedious, but persevere because you will soon find that this an enjoyable and essential addition that heightens the heroic atmosphere of the story. But the medieval setting is not presented without a social commentary - Pyle shows that the unbalanced social structure inevitably resulted in the oppression of the poor and weak. It is left to Robin Hood and his men to take justice into their own hands, and fight nobly for the cause of the downtrodden. Such justice is accomplished in a questionable manner, because the notion of robbing the rich to help the poor implicitly endorses civil disobedience. But the more important theme of seeking justice and maintaining truth and right is in itself a noble one. With Robin Hood, we find ourselves wanting justice, and being prepared to make unselfish sacrifices in order to achieve it. When justice is done, it is actually the greed and corruption of the nobility that has led to its own destruction and ruin.But the real attraction of this gem are the enthralling exploits of Robin Hood and his band of merry men. Howard Pyle presents Sherwood Forest as a rather glamorous utopian world where feasting and song abound, where it is never winter, and where the ale rarely runs dry. Robin Hood clearly represents a form of hedonism, and in his company there is never a lack of action, adventure, or for that matter - ale. But it's not the beer that attracts us to Robin Hood, it's rather his bravado. There is no end to the accomplishments of muscles and mind, as he and his merry band outwit all comers by sheer physical skill in archery, wrestling, swordmanship, and quarter-staff combat, or by outsmarting them with deceit and disguise. To our delight, Robin's brawn and brains always come out on top at the end.Howard Pyle's collection of Robin Hood's merry adventures is a classic that is constantly entertaining and exciting - one that you'll want to own and read over and over!"},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"It pains me to read the reviews here by people who bought this book looking for the Disney fox. This is a legend, folklore, not fairy tale. It's closer to Beowulf than Beauty and the Beast. The language is fantastic, poetry! I read it first when I was very young, fourth grade maybe, but I enjoyed it then as much as I enjoy it now. The language is an obstacle for the first two pages, maybe three, but, after you acclimatize yourself to it, it creates a unique mood and atmosphere. This book is one of my all time favorites. I laughed, I cried, I wrote a review."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Oh how I loved this book! I wasn't too sure about it at the onset, but after a couple of chapters, I fell in love with the language and the silliness of the characters. It was like reading an intellectual comic book... I didn't feel like I was slumming and my time was well spent. I'd love to reread it (and I never do that) just to savor every sentence.It's amazing how contemporary Robin Hood is. The merry men are just a bunch of slackers (Robin included) who just want to drink ale and give somebody a good beating. It's the best non-violent violent book that you can find LOL..."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"In the late 1800s, an American author and illustrator named Howard Pyle collected many old ballads and legends of Robin Hood and edited the text into one cohesive novel. His collection was targeted towards the children of the day, and he included many illustrations in order to set the mood of Robin Hood and his band of merry men. Unfortunately this Kindle edition doesn't contain any illustrations! This is a major bummer, and I truly feel it detracts greatly from the experience of this book.Putting the illustration issue aside, The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood tells the story of folk hero and philanthropist Robin Hood, who famously robs from the rich to give back to the poor. We follow his adventures through confrontations with Little John and Friar Tuck, and his ongoing feud with the bad guy: Sheriff of Nottingham.These stories are classics, and as a result the prose is obviously not contemporary - it can be tough to follow at times. If you give this book to your kids, expect to do some translating. Here's a sentence from the first few pages of the book:\\"Now,\\" quoth Robin, \\"will I go too, for fain would I draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October brewing.\\"In general the dialogue is more difficult to follow than the action. Now this writing isn't completely impenetrable, but I can see how it would be difficult for a youngster in 2010. It may even be tough for some adults! Just something to be aware of before you dive into this book.I still enjoy this book, but I have to admit that this lack of illustrations is a major blow. The price is right, and if you're into the classics - then you'll probably enjoy this book illustrations or not. Personally though, I'd pick up a version with the artwork."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"\\"This Townsend Library classic has been carefully edited to be more accessible to today's students.\\"...somehow I missed the description of this when I ordered this particular edition. It is entirely misleading for this book to claim to be written by \\"Howard Pyle\\" as it has been cut, slashed and dumbed down as to be almost unrecognizable. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is a beautifully written work, composed with beautiful language - that's how it should be read and enjoyed. It is not an easy read, but not every beautiful thing in life is supposed to be easy.If you're looking for a cliff notes version of the story, purchase this edition. If you're satified with the shell of a story, great, this is for you. If you're looking to purchase and enjoy \\"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\\" by Howard Pyle this is absolutely not it."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I only add to the many splendidly written reviews because I am surprised none of the reviews have mentioned the illustrations. I hope these editions still contain Pyle's original woodblock styled illustrations. Howard Pyle was first and foremost a great and renowned illustrator. He chose a woodblock print style for this book as well suited to the material, and the illustrations are detailed, well researched and evocative.The fake \\"medieval English\\" is extraordinarily well-done; it adds to the charm and period flavor while using the few archiac terms with such precision that anyone can infer their meanings, yet one would be at a loss how to replace them with modern terms. As to the thematic content of the book, much has been made of the heroic aspect, but I find just as appealing the comedic turn of the book. The epilogue is certainly heart-rending, the first writing ever to have drawn tears from my eyes (I believe I was nine), but there are many more other episodes that are truly and splendidly funny. Last, the key to Robin's success in Pyle's retelling of his exploits, as much as his skill with a bow and his wit, was that his initial reaction to any stranger or strange situation was friendliness and generousity."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"This is the best version of Robin Hood I have read. The dialogue is so authentic, and the stories may be read separately or simultaneously. Either way, the tales make one large story; the story of Robin Hood. The prologue doesn't ramble like some do, and it does well in explaining why Robin is outlawed. While the Sheriff is very serious and deadly, Robin tricks him so easily and merrily quick, but, like civil gentleman, makes sure not to over-annoy him.The illustrations are very detailed and authentic as well.From the back:The beloved adventures of Robin Hood come vividly to life in this wonderful illustrated version by Howard Pyle. Deep in Sherwood Forest, the legendary Robin Hood-the brave, good-humored outlaw- proves himself the best in England with his bow. Here are all the exciting tales of how Little John, Will Scarlet, Alan a Dale, and Friar Tuck joined his merry band of men...Robin Hood's breathtaking escapes from his arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham...and one hilarious escapade after another, filled with quick action, scheming villains, and great surprises. Days of old bursting with pageantry, knights, and beautiful maidens return in a superb classic story.I also recommend the Story of King Arthur and his Knights by Howard Pyle. It's just as well written and illustrated."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Seldom does one come across such a fresh, delightful storyteller as is Pyle. His use of language archaic even in his day brings a sense that perhaps Will Scathlock himself, &quot;as full of tales as an egg is of meat,&quot; sits at your shoulder reeling off his master's merry adventures. In these days of complicated plots and subplots, of heros beset as much by thier own angst as foes, this book shines as a gem of uncomplicated reading pleasure for all ages. Though some may feel the language too dense for younger readers, I would highly recommend Pyle to any parent. True, he/she may have to put up with a few &quot;I wot's&quot; and &quot;Marry, methinks,&quot; but this seems to me harmless enough, and though there is violence, there is also consequence and remorse. Finally, unlike some books for young reader, this book will probably find itself in the parent's hands as well"},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Robin Hood is an adventurous, quick-acting book which changes emotions really quickly. Robin Hood is an archer who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. The Sheriff of Nottingham, along with Prince John, is plotting to take Robin Hood to jail and steal all of his money. Then there's Robin Hood's girlfriend, Maid Maiden, who loves Robin Hood and wants to marry him.I think it was a great book. The moral it shows you is never brag about yourself - there may be someone better than you. I recommend this book for the Knights of the Round Table and everybody who wants a quick-witted adventure.By Connor"},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"This is a very long book that is a collection of many short stories about Robin Hood's adventures.

The voice actor captures your complete attention and makes this classic even better. He really creates the characters so one could better visualize.

Having said that though I found that, after a couple of chapters, my translation moved from conscious to sub-conscious thought and the more I read the more that I really started to appreciate the book.What made this book really appealing to me was that it spawned countless other stories, books and movies over many decades and it was great to read the Authors original words which, in many cases, cast Robin Hood in a slightly less flattering light than he is typically portrayed in later media.A little bit of research on Wikipedia is highly reccomended if you are at all interested in how the Story of Robin Hood evolved.I reccommend this book, it's one of those books that make you feel better educated for having read it."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"As this is a classic I thought I'd have a read of it.

It was exciting and made me want to come back for some more. The story was very easy to follow. I would read this book over and over again and still not get tired of it. I thought the plot was especially good. Though there were many different characters in the same spot at times, I thought that the large amount of characters gave this book a twist. This story in particular is very interesting and is sometimes comical. It is about Robin Hood and his group of Merry Men hiding in Sherwood Forest from the Sheriff of Nottingham.Whenever the sheriff sends someone into Sherwood Forest to catch Robin Hood, the man either ends up converted to the group of Merry Men or he ends up running out of the forest with arrows whizzing by his head. I thought this was one of the best written books that I have read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book and has a thirst for knowledge."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I read this book when I was 12, and enjoyed as I have never enjoyed any other book.

I have to confess that Robin's death made me cry."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Robin Hood is a wonderful story. The book is a story about a man named Robin. Robin was a woodsman with the best bow and arrow shot in the land. Robin was an outlaw to the sheriff, but a hero to the people of Sherwood Forest. Robin is a good man who steals money from the rich and means people and gives it all to the people who need it most. Throughout the story Robin faces many different conflicts. Walking through Sherwood Forest Robin bumped into very large who was known as Little John. Little John is a woodsman who is known for being very handy with a bow. Little John refused to let Robin pass, so they battled and sure enough Robin won. Little John and Robin become friends and battle the Sheriff and the nasty mean King together throughout the story. A ways into the story Robin gains more incentive to battle the king with Little John and his people. Robin wish's to win the heart of the most beautiful lady in the land, the princess. Overall I though this story taught good morals to the young. To not be greedy and give to those who need the most. This book has plenty of action in in so dont worry about trying to stay awake. It&#8217;s a real eye opener."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Robin Hood was walking in the woods when he came along some archers talking.He wanted to join their group but they thought he wasn't good enough.Robin had a contest with the leader and he wins.The lead archer shoots an arrow at Robin because he is mad.Robin ducks and shoots an arrow back at the archer and it kills him.Robin Hood is wanted by the King so he hids out in the woods.Robin makes his own group of merry men for when it comes time to battle.

The old style English is not difficult to read, although a dictionary may be handy (thank you built-in dictionary function)."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I have been a fan of Robin Hood since I was a small kid and this version stays true to the many adventures of Robin Hood. I say this version is for adult readers because it does use quite a bit of middle English words. I would think that youths would have a bit of a difficult time wading through the non-familiar terms. Personally I enjoy the older language (all the words ending in -eth and thees and thous etc.) it gives a wonderful time period character to the book. It flows very nicely and is divided up into short stories by adventure so you are not read entire chapters and wondering when the next break will be."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"My children enjoyed this book that went along with our Middle Ages curriculum.

Robin Hood became an outlaw when he killed a Forester. Even though he didn't mean to kill the Forester. So he started a band of outlaws. The outlaws would steal from the rich and give to the poor. The sheriff had always said that he would kill Robin Hood. Robin Hood and his band would be in disguise and trick the sheriff.Robin Hood is the main character he is very competitive. He is tall, blonde hair, and a blonde beard. He doesn't like to kill people, he is nice, friendly, and he can shoot an arrow really well.The first conflict is that the sheriff won't stop trying to kill him. The second conflict is that he is an outlaw. The third conflict is that he can't go anywhere without somebody wanting to kill him.The first conflict is solved because Robin Hood kills the sheriff. The second conflict is solved because he becomes a ranger. The third conflict is solved because he isn't an outlaw anymore.I would recommend this book to people that like fighting books. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who do not like fighting books."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Book was written in an 'old english' language and very difficult to read and understand.

In the begining of the book Robin shoots the evil kings deer(but not on purpose), and he also kills the sheriff's son because the man shot at him first. Then, the book goes on and they all try to catch him and it goes on and on and on the at the end Robin dies so it is not very good.

That is my review of The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"This book is listed in the Mystery and Thriller section of Kindle Books.

Pyle uses the langauge of the times in a most beautiful and authentic way that sends a thrill through any book-lover and sets the scene for the thoroughly merry and enjoyable adventures of Robin Hood and his companions.This is no sad or tragic tale (for the most part, the epilogue is enough to draw tears)this story tells of the more lightsome side of medieval life. Full of jesters, bakers, butchers and dishonest jewelers most of which will meet with Robin in some way, either to exchange clothes and be handsomely tipped or to be dealt some of Robin's ironic view of justice.You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Pyle's Robin Hood is a lovable soul, with a child's simplicity and a man's heart. The scenes are vivid, the characters lively, and the tales timeless. It's not Crime and Punishment, but it was never meant to be. Read Pyle's introductory warning, and decide for yourself if you will join him in his wandering through Sherwood Forest."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I just bought this and have only read 15-20 pages, but want to get this down in case others are bewildered by the many choices of version available and the difficulty I had linking reviews with versions.I'm reviewing the Mobi version.There are many wonderful illustrations that look like they must be the Pyle drawings.It says it is unabridged and it reads as if it were complete.The font is particularly clear.And, so far, the language has a rolling, captivating cadence that reminds me of the Lord of the Rings (although more archaic).So for $0.95 a great buy."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I had a fantastic time reading this book. The great gift of Kindle is the built in dictionary. I found the language much less difficult to get through because I looked up any word I didn't understand. The tales are exciting and humorous. The rich detail on the clothing and food was very interesting. I think reading the stories as an adult may be more fun than as a child. There is a lot of fighting and drinking and singing, which was all part of the joy of reading it. However, I could imagine it geting challenging or boring for children who are not able to get past the language. The writing is so rich, I didn't miss the illustrations that are not available on the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is an excellent book of small stories. One will discover this book provides an ocean of emotions and entertainment. Some of the adventures you will laugh at because of the hilarious sly side to Robin Hood and his band of merry men. If you want hilarity and laughter this is an excellent book. Adventurous excursions are also plentiful in this book. Some may want blood and guts adventure but this book provides more of innocent adventures that include wit, charm, strategy, and deception.When considering this book one will encounter older English language. This though does not stop one from enjoying the adventures in each part. If you struggle with older English read for a couple of chapters and you will easily get the hang of it. Also older English provides more of a sensual and realistic feel to the story because this is a medieval tale. The wording puts you in that time frame.It contains some pictures to help the reader formulate an imaginative image of that time. Although if you are expecting a picture book this is not it. When comparing this to other books it is an enjoyable laid back story. I laughed in many parts because of Little John, Robin Hood, and other members of his group's funny comebacks with extreme wit.I highly recommend this book for various purposes. This book can be for children to adults. Read it parts not just chapters. Each part is a riveting tale in itself. It may seem slow in some parts but will pick up quite fast. At the end of the book you would wish the story would continue but to all things comes an end. Enjoy it and I am sure you would even want to re read in the future."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"This is a fine retelling of the Robin Hood story, with all the familar characters (Robin, Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and the rest, minus Maid Marion). Pyle has done a great job of bringing together the many legends and writing a coherent tale with language that speaks to the old period, but is easily understandable by modern readers. Kids, and adults letting themselves be kids for a while, will enjoy Robin's bold adventures and narrow escapes, the triumph of good over evil (most of the time), and the happy flouting of authority. Adults may want to read these stories with younger kids, explaining what conditions were in those days. Without this, young readers may be puzzled why Robin was constantly stealing from, and harassing, the priests and authorities of the day. Discussion will prevent young readers from taking away the wrong message. Pyle gives some discussion, but perhaps not enough, to justify Robin's behavior."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"This is another book we like to make available whenever the grandkids come around. Mythical hero or not, Robin Hood embodies all that is good and puts it to action.

The assignment was 1 chapter for the week but I finished it over the weekend. The look on my tutor's face when I told him I finished it is something I'll always treasure.Howard Pyle's book is the first book that I got lost in. The story sucked me in and Robin's adventures were my adventures. Oh and the language.... parent's don't worry about the old english - it's poetry and if your child has half a brain, they'll get used to it quick enough. The writing is pure magic and every child will wish he could feast in the woods of Sherwood with Robin and his merry men. I wanted friends like that...I wanted adventures like that... The last chapter moved me to tears and I distinctly remember closing the book with that last illustration burned into my heart...\\"Here lies...\\" I felt apart of something special and then went on to discover other great Robin Hood authors like Parke Godwin... which led me to the Arthurian legends... good times. This book is pure magic and I've reread it over the years saving it for my child. The bindings falling apart but I treat like a family heirloom. Nathan's only 6 but in a few more years, he'll be ready.If you want your child to experience the power of story telling that will make his spirit soar...buy him this amazing book."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Pyle's Robin Hood is a lovable soul, with a child's simplicity and a man's heart.

I first read Pyle's Robin Hood at a pretty early age - about ten. It was challenging but absolutely magnetic, the appeal much enhanced by Pyle's own beautiful illustrations.

But as my brain adjusted to it, I was drawn in to the story deeper than if it had been re-written to sound like modern-day language.It was funny, exciting to read, and in general, a great before-bed read...one of those books you want to read to connect with your inner child and let go of the craziness of modern life!!"},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I loved this book growing up, and 12 years later, I still absolutely loved having it again to read.
