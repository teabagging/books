However, our family was never big on bedtime stories and after a few readings the book was set aside. No one else seemed to take anymore interest but I could not forget about the amazing story that my mom had introduced and later picked it up again on my own. Though, over the years I may in some ways outgrown Harry Potter these books will always have a solid place on my favorites list and in my heart. Before I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had no desire to read, this was the book that really got me interested in literature. I started reading the Sorcerer's Stone and never looked back from there. I am now a tremendous lover of books and I am currently majoring in English Literature. Though it has been far too long since I read this book for me to recall all of the details and what exactly I felt after I had finished but I still remember the excitement and the profound sense of wonder that a mere collection of words could have the power to draw me into another world. Most people don't need my review to tell them that J.K. Rowling is brilliant. Despite the fact that witches and wizards have been used in countless different stories Rowling manages to give the illusion that they were in fact her invention. Her world is totally unique and magical, captivating the reader in a way that no other possibly could. I will always think of this as the novel to which I owe one of my deepest passions and greatest pleasures. I recommend the entire Harry Potter series wholeheartedly, especially to young readers!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My brothers and I were begging my mother to read more after she put the book down.

Heroimine is relleay smart and helps ron and harry out alot. Ron is my favorite character he is always ready to jump in and clean malfoys clock but harry and haromine are always there to stop him. Malfoy is so mean he acts like he owns the place with his two gounes on each side of him at all times. Hagrid is always there for the three even if they don\`t need him but he is always getting raged on by malfoy. Dumbledore is so wise but he seems like he is one egg short of a dozen. Proffesor Lupin is always nice to harry and is always helping him but malfoy is always reging on him becuase he has such bad robes and dresses like a house elf.

It has a great plot and is exciting throughout. There are so many vivid details about the characters and places and everything that I can totally imagine what they all look like. It is popular throughout the United States... I live in California and my cousins in Connecticut LOVE it too.It's about this boy (Harry Potter) that grows up not knowing his &quot;incredible&quot; history. He finds out about it and goes to school for his special talents. (This may sound lame but I'm trying not to give anything away.) He is engulfed in a mystery involving people from his past and his future.This is a totally INCREDIBLE book.

Also the characters are believeable in their relationships. I read this book in about 3 days,and I brought it everywhere I went. Harry shows that just because you are an outcast you can still succeed. His brave way of taking chances keeps you glued to the book wondering what will happen next.

This disappointed me so much that I thought I'd find every scrap of information I could regarding Harry Potter. I've read the first 3 books and am starved for more material.

My daughter (9) who HATES to read saw how hooked I was and asked to read it. And she became hooked, begging for the next book! Then my son (7) started in on them. Some words he may not understand but still loves these books. The Harry Potter books have good lessons for the kids.

In the magical world of Harry Potter all this and more is possible. In the first book of the series, entitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone readers get their first opportunity to immerse themselves into the imaginary world of wizards and witches.The main character, Harry Potter, is treated, as a low class nobody at his house. His Aunt and Uncle force him to live underneath the stairs and wear old clothing. This changes when he enters the world of magic. There he his treated as a hero and most people look up to him. This concept of the low class making it big appeals highly to people in similar situations, that is being under appreciated and overlooked. Being able to see others make it plants seeds of possibilities into people who dream of some day getting out of the everyday rut of their lives.Throughout the book readers get to see Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione grow and gain confidence. In the beginning they are a little unsure of their possibilities but by the end they are confident in their abilities. This appeals to people who lack confidence or self-esteem. Seeing people who are also lacking in confidence accomplish things they never thought possible, gives people hope in their own future. Readers can come to realize that anything is possible through friendship and determination.By the time the reader is done with the book they will have experienced an engrossing and thrilling tale that will keep their imagination running wild for weeks. Though it may be more appealing to people who are in similar situations as Harry, the book offers sound advice to all readers. It offers a story were friends work together to help others. This is a concept that is greatly needed in our society, the idea of charity, helping out for the sake of kindness.But, if you are only a little kid, the only thing you will get from this book is how to cast spells on your parents when they make you go to bed early."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a story about a boy whose name were Harry Potter and his adventures.

I thought it looked interesting, so I bought it and took it home. When I was finally finished reading it, I thought it was a really good book and was proud of myself for reading such a long book (at least I considered it \\"long\\" back then). I still have that copy of the book today, too, even though it's really worn out and the title page fell out. I had no idea that this book was part of a series until my friend showed me \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\\" which I never got around to reading for a while.In 2001, when I saw an advertisement for the first Harry Potter film, based on the book, I suddenly remembered that I read the book a few years ago and I told my parents that I had to go see the movie. After I did, I was so mad at myself because I had read the book but had forgotten most of the things in it so that I didn't even remember the ending and was surprised when I saw it on screen. I told myself I should have read it again because it was really good, so after the movie I reread the first book.After I was finished, I spotted the second book while out with my mom and bought it right away. I got through it at a pretty steady pace, but on the third book I was even faster, taking it everywhere I went until it was finished. When I got the fourth book, I was amazed at how thick it was. I wasn't amazed like \\"How am I going to read that thing?!\\" but amazed like \\"Wow! Even more to enjoy!\\" I got through the fourth book even faster than before, and when I was done with it I reread the whole series. Since then, I have reread them countless times and I am so acquainted with books that I go to Borders almost once a week and constantly buy books or check them out at my library."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My sister was the first to start reading the Harry Potter books. I watched the two movies before starting any of the series. My sister repeatedly tried to read the books, but I continually told her that these were children books and wouldn't be interesting enough for me. But I did eventually decide to read them and now I am ahead of my sister in the Harry Potter books. Anyone and everyone of all ages should read the Harry Potter books. They teach great morals that even people of old age could still learn to this day! Hope you enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was in the 10th grade when I first read Harry Potter, \\"The Sorcerer\`s Stone.\\" Then, that's how I started reading the Sorcerer's stone. I LOOOOVED IT! It's a must read to everyone FOR ALL AGES. My cousin who is in college right now read every single book of Harry Potter ever since he started reading the Sorcerer's stone. It's so easy to read and understand. I find it very spectacular and outstanding. After I read the first book I couldn't stop reading. I am somewhat a big Harry Potter fan, but I just don't show it because on my free time that's when you see me reading a Harry Potter book. I think that all the Harry Potter books teaches a good lesson to young peers. This book has a good rating. There is no profanity, but just interesting details of the story and detailed characters. The story just keeps going and going and its what make people want to buy the next book. I think this book is a great series. After you're done reading with the first book, you just feel like going to the next book right away. It gets you so excited for the next book to come out. During the past few years since Harry Potter came out with it's first book, it has been so popular to people of all ages. I was really surprised when I found some college students reading it, TOO! I can never stop reading Harry Potter. My favorite book would have to be the Sorcerer's Stone. It is the FIRST BOOK that caught my attention to read more and MORE HARRY POTTER! The characters are very interesting and dynamic. It's interesting how they come up with these names in the book. Haha! I think a story about magic or wizards is fun. It's really COOL how they made Harry Potter the movie. There is never a time you will ever get bored reading any of the Harry Potter books because there is always exciting events happening. That is why I will never stop reading Harry Potter. I can't wait for the other books to come out!

However, it is most definitely worth reading.It introduces the reader to Harry Potter, an orphaned eleven-year-old boy. He is forced to live with his abominable relatives, the Dursleys--Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia (who was Harry's mother's sister), and their fat son Dudley, who is a rotten, spoiled brat. Harry can make strange things happen when he is angry or upset, and he finds that he can also communicate with snakes. However, he never attaches any importance to any of these events.One day, a letter arrives for Harry. He is on the verge of opening it when his Uncle Vernon snatches it away from him. Upon reading the letter, Uncle Vernon panicks and doesn't let Harry or Dudley see the contents of the letter. Over the next few days, floods of letters begin to arrive for Harry, but his aunt and uncle prevent him from reading any of them. A day or two before Harry's eleventh birthday, Uncle Vernon finally goes mad and takes the family away from their home on Privet Drive to live in a tiny shack perched on a rock in the middle of the sea, assuming that no letters can reach them there. However, just after midnight on Harry's birthday, a giant named Rubeus Hagrid shows up in the hut and hands Harry a copy of the letter. It is sent from a place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and informs Harry that he has been accepted to the school. Hagrid informs Harry that he is actually a wizard, and gives him certain startling facts about his past that the Dursleys failed to tell him.At Hogwarts, Harry finds that a horrible figure from his past is coming after him again for the first time in ten years. Worse still, someone in Hogwarts may be helping this evil shadow to come closer and closer to Harry..............Read on and discover the truth about Harry's past, and meet a host of different characters as Harry learns more about the wizarding world and goes to Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I like Harry Potter because they are Exciting and full of adventure.

And overall it is one of the best books I've ever read, and readers of all age will enjoy it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked harry potter and the Sorcere's because I like the plot And how every thing woked out in the end I think every one will like this book when they read it.The book was relly exceting this book was a real thriller."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My book review is about Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone by J.K Rowling. The year the book was published was in 1997. The main characters are Harry Potter, Hemine Geninger, and Ron Weasly. They are on an adventure to Hogwarts school. Theres a mystery at Hogwarts, Frist They ran into a three headed dog. Hermine spots a trap door under its paw and soon There having an adventure of a life time! I think at the end they changed.They have a bigger relationship. I say they learnd alot of things like never give up,never give up in what you belive in, and bewire of three headed dogs. I think the moal of the story is Belive in your slef."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first book in J.K. Rowling's popular series of books is still the best of the lot. Young orphan Harry Potter is whisked away from his evil aunt and uncle's home to Hogwarts School For Magic. While at Hogwarts Harry becomes a wizard in training and learns about his mysterious past. The idea of a put upon child finding out he suddenly has powers others do not is strong stuff for the imagination. Many children feel powerless, and I think this is one of the reasons why children enjoy Harry Potter so much. Children are able to instantly identify with poor put upon Harry who finds out he has a wonderful secret life some place far away from home. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, like all the books in the series, reminds me of a Hardy Boys novel in that each episode is a mystery which must be solved by a child protagonist with very little help from adults. Of course the mystery element is guaranteed to keep the reader turning the pages long after their bed time has expired. I would guess that in years to come Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will take it's rightful place on the shelf next to the likes of works by authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.Preston McClear, author The Boy Under the Bed"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you like fantasy and adventure, you should read this book. I couldn't put it down. Harry Potter faces a lot of obstacles. He learns that he has magical powers and how to use them. There are goblins, a wooly mountain troll, a dragon and a three headed dog named Fluffy. This book shows that when someone has no one to help them in a time of need they can still achieve their goals. This story grabs you and pulls you into it. This is a wonderful book, the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OMG! I have read this book 9 times(literally) and evrytime I jumped, laughed, and gasped in surprise evrytime!

Every word, paragraph and page is written with such care and security you wonder how that brilliant J.K. Rowling even imagined this! Quidditch is the best spot ever.

One more thing those boys in harry potter are so DAMN cute.(in the movie of course)TTYL"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As the Harry Potter hype mounted over the past few years, so too did my anti-Potter sentiments; I refused to partake in the latest trend of what was sure to be pointless drivel. Now I can safely say I was mistaken.I finally gave in when Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone came to HBO. The acting wasn't great, but the story seemed compelling enough to warrant reading the book. There were a few significant holes in the overall plot, but that didn't diminish the fact that it was a very entertaining read. Shortly after completing Sorceror's Stone, I moved on to the remaining books, which I think get better.Some say the second book (Chamber of Secrets) is the weakest of the series, but it builds on the story and is just as entertaining as the first one, if a little more contrived. The third book (Prisoner of Azkaban) is really good. I've just started the fourth book, but it already has a much better opening than the others. For those skeptics out there, read the first book, and if you're still not convinced, give the series a second chance and try the second book...by that point you'll figure out whether you like the series or not. Keep in mind that the series is directed at children, and is generally less air-tight than other Fantasy books like the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. (I'm still annoyed that the film version of The Sorceror's Stone grossed more money than The Fellowship of the Ring, but whatever...)Having said all of that, there are problems I have with the story. [Note: SPOILERS AHEAD - Don't read unless you've read the books]* If Dumbledore & others at Hogwarts or the Ministry of Magic keep an eye on Harry while he's with the Dursleys, why do they allow Harry to live under such deleterious conditions? There are serious human rights violations going on there.* The \\"points system\\" at Hogwarts encounters real conflict-of-interest issues. If a teacher doesn't like you, he/she can dock 5 points from your house for little more than a smirk.* If Slytherin has such a foul reputation of churning out bad wizards, why isn't there some kind of internal audit of that house by Dumbledore or others at Hogwarts? And if Salazar Slytherin was such a punk when the four wizards started the school, why did the other three keep his legacy in their school?I can rationalize the answers to these and other problems I have with the books (several more which I'll omit in this forum), but it would be nice if they were addressed in subsequent books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K.

He could not wait to hear more, even coming to the bedroom book in hand at 6am begging me to read the next chapter. IT is intrguing, suspenseful,attention grabbing.A book to be enjoyed by adults and their kids.Reading this stretches the imagination to the limit and beyond.We are now Avid H.P. fans and can't wait to see how Harry's third year at Hogwarts turns out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the best series I have ever read and reread.

However, it took a lot longer to get here than any purchase I've ever done through the Amazon Marketplace.

The narrator of this series is fantastic!! You can take an excellent book and totally changed or corrupt the characters with a bad narrator, but that is not at all the case in this series. So if you've got too much to do to sit and read, take the time to listen. You will truly enjoy it!! Kathy"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a wonderful story. Not just for young children, if you ask me. It kept me absorbed and itching for the next installment of adventures! Highly recommended for a fun, magical read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a really neat book about a boy who grew up in his mom's sister's family . He was unaware that he was a wizard until his eleventh birthday, when a stranger from a mysterious school of magic comes and alerts him that he is a wizard . He then learns that he is expected to go to Hogwarts. The stranger, Hagrid, tells Harry about the school of magic. While with Hagrid, Harry goes to the Gringots bank and discovers that he has a small fortune, all in wizard money. He then goes shopping for the various items he needs. With his new things he is off to Hogwarts school of magic, where he makes friends with two other kids that are starting their first year at Hogwarts. Then at his new school, Harry is greeted by the stranger that told him about the school.Harry Potter is a book for kids who really want a lot of excitement. It is scary, funny, and mysterious..One of the funny parts was when Hagrid cursed Dudley so he had a pig's tail. The scary part was when Harry saw He Who Must Not Be Named sharing a body with his teacher. And a mysterious part was when he learned of Nicholas Flamel and the sorcerers stone. The sorcerers stone is a stone that produced the elixir of life and Nicholas Flamel is a man who is six hundred years old. I thought it was one of the greatest books I ever read. It had some really funny parts that I liked. If you want a good kids book this one is for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"the beginning.

I really like how the plan between the teachers was so twisted. I thought that the ending of the book was going to be a big disaster, But it turned out O.K. It was fascinating how Ms.Rowling dicribed the game and field of &quot;Quidditch&quot;. My favorite on-going worry in the book was the one sbout the house points and how you had to be cautious about getting in trouble. I loved it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a great book.. At first I thought it was going to be boring.. I WAS VERY WRONG! Harry gives me delight everytime he scares the wits out of Dudley.. It is not a book you want to miss. J.K. Rowling is a great author.. I am going on to the third Harry Potter book.. I can't wait until the 5th Harry Potter book comes out.. I highly recommend this to anybody who is looking for a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book, the first in the series, is great for people youngand old. It is about a boy named Harry whose parents were killed in a&quot;car crash&quot; and he was left on his evil aunt and uncle's doorstep by a monster on a flying motorcycle later identified as Hagrid. Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Dudley are not nice to him because, since they knew his past, they didn't want to mess with him. His bedroom was a closet. Then the letters started coming.Uncle Vernon tried to get rid of them, but they keep multiplying, so they move to an island and Hagrid rows to them and tells Harry what is in the letter. He is destined to go to Hogwarts, the wizarding school. He goes many strange places, meets many strange people, learns about a new sport, and conquers the wizard that really killed his parents. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is worth missing your favorite TV shows to sit down and read. J. K. Rowling is a great author and remember, a book lasts longer than a Surviver."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up Harry Potter because I wanted to see what the big deal was about. I only wish I could know what I'd think of this without everybody screaming that it's fantastic. I think I would have liked it pretty well, but I wouldn't wait up all night for the next one in the series (well, maybe...). It can be compared to stuff like A Wrinkle in Time, only much more lighthearted and the characters do seem slightly more real. Harry and his friends could be any fourth/fifth grader (except maybe Hermione) and the way he deals with his problems isn't anything out of whack. What makes these stories so fun is Rowling's sense of humor and oddity. But is it all fun and games? Well, the first one is, generally, but don't get to hooked on this series if you're not willing to put up with the Dark Arts..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book for my grandson, but found myself a bit curious about Harry Potter. So, I thought I'd read a few pages, just to get an idea as to what all of the excitement was about. I have now ordered the second book in the series (for myself) because I want to see how much trouble this young wizard can get into and out of!I found that Harry was a little like Cinderella - with a much more exciting life. I loved the way he learned that he was a famous wizard, and I especially enjoyed reading about the way he found and rode the train to Hogewarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.J. K. Rowling certainly is able to create realisic and fascinating characters who live in an exciting new world of trolls, potions, owls who deliver the mail, brooms that fly, and a wild wizards' game called Quidditch. I enjoyed meeting Harry's new friends, the Hogwart professors, and, yes, even the evil characters. But, most of all, I became entranced with the plot, in which Harry, who never knew he was a famous wizard, learns how to become one. He does this by meeting one challenge after another, and, with the help of his new friends, overcomes each.I couldn't put the book down, and now I can't wait to read Book 2. As an old 2nd and 5th grade teacher, who also taught college students, I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old alike. A little bit of fantasy, mixed in with a little bit of adventure, mixed in with a bunch of delightful characters, makes this Senior Citizen a happy reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Though I am not the target age for this book, I still loved it. Harry Potter is definitely not your ordinary children's book. What Romwling writes astonishes me because it is so original. Never in my life have I ever read such beatifully strung together words! This is definitely worthy of all the hype surrounding the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 11 years old &amp; I'm trying to get my parents to read this book also! I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because it had a great mystery to it, I liked every character's personalities, and it was such a great adventure that it was hard to put it down. I really liked reading about the Quidditch matches. Harry is funny, nice, a daredevil, and usually friendly to everyone- except some of the Slytherins, and of course, the Muggles at Number 4 Privet Drive. Read Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone if you're in for a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this In 4 nights. (Which I realise Is particularly long compared to some people) First of all you really have to read this book at night, daytime just Isn't magical enough for a book like this. When I bought this I was pretty skeptical and was only seeing what all the fuss was about, and after the slow beginning I was still wondering what all the hype was about, but the moement Harry walks Into Hogwarts, Rowling has you. From then on something wills you to keep reading every chpater, page, line of text: &quot;Who's watching him In the Woods? Whats he hiding under that turbin? He's forgotten the Invisibility cloak!&quot; Everything that happens Is just so magical and compelling. And yes you are heavily reminded of Narnia, Roald Dahl and Tolkein, but never has immagination been typed up In such an enchanting way. The worlds In Narnia always seemed vague and patchy to me, Rowling's magical world Is whole and complete. To read this you really have to read the others, only then you realise that The Sorcerers Stone Is just an introduction to the story and nothing more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a twenty six year old who just started ready harry potter,and it was wonderful truly enjoyable.

The book is terrific. First chapter is a little hard to get going in. It's hard to understand what's going on, - but as soon as the 2nd chapter gets going - so does the book. I loved it!

People of all ages should be introduced into the world of Harry Potter, it's a book that you don't want to miss! J.K Rowling has a amazingly creative mind. The sequels are just as great.

When I saw something about it on Entertainment Tonight, I tought &quot;ok, that's it, I'm going to check this one out&quot;. Fantasious books are usually not interesting to me, they're extremely boring, but this one has logic, and a foot on the reality, and tough there are fantastic creatures and magic everywhere, it's written in such a real way, mixing real elements with fantastic ones, that it becomes not absurd, but extremely interesting. And there's the humour, the scary parts, the misteries that are revealed slowly along the way. I was a total muggle, but J.K. Rowling made me change my mind. P.S.: The book is first place in every brazilian store I know. The hype is spreading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All of this hype about Harry Potter...Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that...well, I wasn't about to sit still until I found out for myself. Wow! Go with the hype, everyone; you WILL NOT be disappointed. Harry Potter is incredible. J.K. Rowling is a genius, a triumph, an author who will be remembered always. What an imagination! You will be hooked once you start. I wasn't even halfway through #1 when I had to go out and buy #2. It's the perfect adventure for those who love to live vicariously. And it's not just for kids. It's for anyone who enjoys fun, lively, entertaining reads, for those who read for pure pleasure. Now, off I go, to read the second installment. And not a moment too soon!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 19 and havn't read a book for about 6 years exapt for school work and when i did read it took me about 2 months to finish the book.

These books will change your life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At the time of writing this review the overall reviews for this book stand at just under 3000. I don't think I've seen this many reviews for the one book ever. It's amazing. For a book that was sent to ten different publishers before it was finally published it's not a bad effort is it? I mean, I bet those other ten publishers out there are kicking themselves now. And so they should!Anyway, this is a wonderful book and worth reading no matter what your age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Our English class read, this book I first thought it was boring I was wrong it's not great book I am, reading the 2nd Year hope the 1st book makes a great movie...This is worth the $ and worth reading........"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a really great book. It's about an orphan boy who finds out he is a wizard. He starts going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, where he makes to best friends, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger, and together they see there is a secret something hidden in the school and together they discover what it is. I recomend this book to everybody, because even if the plot is very strange, the characters are very realistic. Read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not the biggest reader, and I definitely don't read too fast, but I got so into Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone that I read it in only two days. It totally brought me inside the book. When I finished it, I was so upset because I wanted to find out what happened next, but I didn't have any of the other books. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I sort of felt like I was Harry and that school the next day was going to be at Hogwarts. You can't put it down; it catches you with it's suspense, makes you laugh with its humor, and makes you wonder how it's going to end. I think my favorite part was the twisted ending, which is totally different than what you think. I recommend this book to anybody. no matter how old you are, or how much you like reading, I am sure you will like this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I adored this book! The best thing is that the characters are about as realistic as you can get in a fantasy book. The next best thing is that no one character is perfect. They all have their quirks and problems. The third best thing is that not everything is what it seems, with this, and the perfect amount of mystery, you get the Harry Potter books. Once I read it, I couldn't put it down. Except for when I went to get ice cream, but even while eating that, Harry Potter was the first thing on my mind. What would happen next? The best part is, you suspect someone who's right in front of your nose, and you say, &quot;Oh, it HAS to be him!&quot; Then all of a sudden, it's someone else and you go, &quot;Oh yeah! I should have seen it!&quot; EVERYbody is going to like this one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was literally one of the very best books I have ever read.

I highly recommend Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone to anyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"From the review this book got, you would think it was the first children's fantasy book ever written. Sure, the author of the Harry Potter books has some inventive additions to the typical fantasy story (Quidditch is one of my favorites, and has enjoyable, if somewhat stereotypical, characters and plots. Nothing, however, that justifies the reviews that this book has been getting. And as for appealing to adults, I can think of several children's fantasy books that would be equally, if not more, appreciated by more mature readers. In summary, read the book, call it excellent and original if you must, but please stop treating it like the best thing that ever happened to children's literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book.

Mostly, for the challenge. My reading level was often far, far abocve those of my peers, (Thanks Mom!) and the books they read wern't enough for me. Unfortuantly, books more to my reading level often delt with &quot;grown-up&quot; themes that, while intresting enough, don't captivate you like childrens books often do. I was pawing around the house to find something to read when I discovered &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone&quot;. I can't remember ever falling in love with a book so instantly. I tore through that book in no time flat- laughing, gasping and yelping loudly all over the livingroom couch. I did something I hadn't done for years- I talked to the book and the characters, telling them what to do. They never listened to me, much to my delight, and led me on exciting adventures. Since I put it down I have done nothing but reccomend the book to everyone who will listen. All ages, it dosn't matter. If you can read, or be read too, don't hesitate! I am a freshman in highschool and would willingly tell the entire world, &quot;I am in love with Harry Potter and no one is too old to love him either!&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry PotterAnd theSorserers StoneBy: J.K.

This book and the movie are very similar. The beginning of this book sets up a reader needing to read more of it. From the start I was a Harry Potter fan. As Harry is introduced to the wizarding world I found myself wishing I was in Diagon Alley buying my magical school supplies preparing to head off to a whole new world. Each character is drawn out to the readed nicely. No reader, any age, would have trouble imagining this world and all the adventures Harry has. This is defiantly a book I will read more than twice."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So far I have read all of the Harry Potter books and can not wait for the others to be published.

These are great books for adults and children to read together."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first encountered the book at a bookstore but I did not bothered about it. Not until some of my friends started reading it. So, I borrowed the book and began reading it. It was marvellous! If you had read Enid Blytons's Malory Towers Series, you will note some similarities but to me, I think that Harry Porter is much more interesting. It's nice to see how J.K. Rowling manage to put a little twist throughout the story. Certainly, one of the best book I had ever encountered. Marvellous piece of work...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever played a sport while flying on a broomstick? In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone&quot; J.K. Rowling gives you a front row seat of her idea of a mystical world of witches, wizards, and dragons. Harry Potter is just your average 11-year-old with a little hint of wizard blood in him. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone&quot; Harry goes off to Warthogs the school of witchcraft a wizardry. In Harry Potter's first year at Warthogs he runs into some consequences that add up to one of this years magnificent fiction thrillers. This is a great book that everyone should read and that is why I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series are the best books i've ever read.

It brought back so many memories of my childhood and made me want to re-read all those lovely stories that shaped my childhood. It was so nice to free my imagination again - something we often forget to do as adults. What a marvelous vacation from humdrum reality! I can't wait to read the other books in the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"LOVED IT! I put off reading this book because it was touted as a kid's book. Maybe so, but I was only two pages in to the book when I knew it would be a winner. The story is so imaginative and well written that it can touch that special place in each of us that retains some child-like wonderment. I read this book, then immediately ordered the next two in the series. Book four will be out soon and I can barely wait! The story flows smoothly, is well written and is occasionally laugh out loud funny. It's an easy, fast-paced read with interesting places and characters. Come on! The sorting hat awaits us, and classes will soon begin again! Escape from your Muggle life for a bit; after all, don't you crave a bit of magic?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be simply amazing. The magical life of Harry Potter kept me wondering what he would do next. After picking it up I could not put it down and felt compelled to read the rest of the books in the series. I know that there is much controversy over these books, but one must read them before critisizing. I feel that they are wonderful books for children. I have no children of my own but I would have absolutely no problem with them reading these books if I did. I was drawn into Harry Potter's world from the first page."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book! It was so full of imagination and creativity! I was drawn into this book, and I read it cover to cover in a day. The book was an amazing adventure that allowed you to feel exactly what Harry was going through. The book deserves 5 stars because it kept my attention, most books don't. Harry lived with the Dursley family and was treated like dirt. No, worse than dirt. He always knew he was different but he found out for sure when he was accepted into Hogwart's School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. His adventures started as soon as he got there. He found himself, a wizard, at a school beginning a new chapter in his life. I loved the book and I encourage anyone to read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this book was AMAZING! It was funny and a little bit scarey. I loved how the auther combined humor, fear and fantasy. While reading it, you feel like it is really happening. All that happened to Harry, Ron and Hermione shows that friends REALLY can manage through ANYTHING. You have GOT to read this book if you don't you will sooooooo hate yourself. This is DEFINENTLY my FAVORITE book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, have you read The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe? It's good, isn't it? Well... there is a better fantasy... Harry Potter! When the first time I saw that book, I thought it was just some stupid fantasies! A friend of mine told me that it was REALLY good, but I didn't beleive it. I still read that book. As I read, it seemed to have a magnetic thing that makes you can't put it down. Anyway, if you think that book is not good, like me in the first place... You're wrong! It's the BEST book I have ever read! By the way, I am a 11 year old. It's not only for children. It's for any ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I give Harry Potter 5 stars because it is an amazing book.It takes you into a different dimension as Harry takes the adventures from the start.I think it's a wonderful book and I recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is a magnificent must read. It is an exquisite, intriguing story of wizardry. Harry makes the story funny because of his dry, sarcastic humor. Any 21st century kid could relate to the daily life Harry goes through, including the bullies at Hogworts, trouble with his parents (aunt and uncle), and his maturation at the end of the novel. The book is realistic because the characters act as normal people would, under the circumstances. It's a &quot;can't-put-down-please-read-more&quot; adventure story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book with an imaginitive plot.

An excellent book that is sure to keep just about anyone absorbed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just finished reading the third of this series, Prisoner of Azbakan. I reviewed Harry Potter #1 on November 10th, you can scroll down to see why I gave this book 3 stars. The second book I only gave 2 stars, but I have to admit I truly enjoyed the third book. The Prisoner of Azbakan is worth reading the first two books for, so if you hated this... maybe you shouldn't bother, but if you liked it but weren't bowled over... just keep reading. The ride will be interesting and the third book rewards you for putting up with the average enjoyment of the first two. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really loved this book.

Like the books of E. Nesbit and also Charmed Life and Lives of Christopher Chant by Diana Wynne Jones, which are also about kids learning magic and dangerous magicians trying to stop them. Quidditch sounds like a great game."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Having read this book at least 3 times so far this time, I wanted to take the time to really read this book and get ready to read the next ones again.Harry Potter thinks that his life with the Dursley's is what he will have to live with for the rest of his life. However, when strange things start to happen Harry finds out that his life will never be the same again, for he is a wizard.Harry is taken away to learn more about his background, it is at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that Harry starts to learn the true stories of his life and how he is a wizard.When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he learns of many new and different things and meets new people, some good some bad. This is where he meets his best friends Ron and Hermione. While at Hogwarts Harry learns how he is a famous person.Harry's time at Hogwarts is mostly spent learning his lessons in Potions, Defense against the Dark, Hierology and of course Quiddich. Nerveless Harry and his friends manage to help Hagrid hatch a dragon's egg, look for a hidden treasure and get in more trouble then they know what to do with.After reading this series many times I always want to reread them again, this is a great series and cannot wait to read more and more about Harry Potter and his life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's really a wonderful story! That is what you can't imagine how wonderful it is, if you haven't read it before. So now let me introduce it to you all, maybe after this you will also get addicted to it. The elements of the book are all around the magic world or the adventure travel that a brave boy had experienced, that seems just the traditional miracle stories and you might be in doubt if it's really so attractive. But I will show you that it is different with traditional magic story.Harry Potter has some fresh ideas through the story and I am so impressed by these plots. Let me take some examples, the &iexcl;sorting hat&iexcl; for defining the students in different house, and also the hat can speak, it is really interesting. Moreover, the special sports at the school those Harry Potter studies in, Quidditch; it's a very exciting game. The attendance of Harry Potter to the Quidditch team can show his talent and also his brave against the blackness side.This book is very good on handling the plots to make the story to be very attractive. It really makes me extremely nervous when Harry Potter's uncle resist to let him receive the letter from the school, it makes me also feel angry as same as Potter and also very nervous to know about can Potter receive the letter finally? I really want to hit his uncle that moment!After reading the &iexcl;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&iexcl;s Stone&iexcl;, I nearly rushed to read the Book 2 &iexcl;Harry Potter Chamber of Secret&iexcl;, because I really addicted to the book. I know you won't believe my comment before reading the book, but I'm sure you won't disapprove after you have read. Do you want to proof my words? Please rush to read the &iexcl;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&iexcl;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I remember that when I first saw this book, I think it will be very interesting. And after I really finished read this book, it proved that my guess is right.Harry Potter is a pity boy that he lived in the cupboard under the stairs, 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey. He lived with Mr. and Mrs. Dursley who are his uncle and aunt. And one day he received a letter said that he was accepted to study in a magic school called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then his life is totally changed.The main character of this book is Harry Potter. He is a boy who has talent and courage. He has two best friend called Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron lived in a big family. And his brothers are very good at every thing so that he is lack of self-confident. And the character of Hermione is opposed to Ron. She is too self-confident even arrogant. And her hobby is reading. The boy who doesn't like Harry is called Darco Malfoy. And there is a funny boy called Neville Longbottom. Others character in the book it had Albus Dumbledore who is the principal of Hogwarts. A man who has a big body and very respect to Professor Dumbledore is called Hagrid. Professor McGonagall, Quirrell, Snape and Madam Hooch are the teacher of Hogwarts.The first part I like is the Quidditch match, Harry be the seeker of his house (Gryffindor). And there had a satisfied result on the first match. Second part is Ron and Hermione help Harry to go on stop the man who want to get the sorcerer's stone. Ron shows a brilliant chess and his bravery. Hermione shows her cool use of intellect while they are having grave peril.Finally, I really like this book and sincerely to recommend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, written by J.K.Rowling, is a great book.

His aunt and uncle hold a secret about Harry Potter's identity. The secret is that he is a wizard. Harry Potter later finds out he is a wizard. Harry has an extraordinary adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.This book is fantastic and exciting. I like the book very much and I stayed up at night reading it . I have forgotten to go to sleep. This book gives me a good imagination . I always imagine the picture what is happening in each scene when I was reading it. It took me places, the magical world, I never thought I could go. I thought I was never going to get tried of it. And I felt that Harry Potter is loyal and brave. He is a real nice person. He faced many challenges at Hogwarts School. Also this book is a perfect book for children and adults. I highly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling tells the story of an ordinary young boy who discovers that, he is not at all ordinary. Before his great self-discovery, Harry lived a very miserable life from the time he was left on the doorstep of his uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia's home when he was just a baby. Growing up, he was told that his parents had died in a car accident, which he survived, leaving a lightening shaped scar on his forehead. When Harry turned eleven, his life changed completely. He received a letter from Hogwart's, school of wizardry! When he attended the school, he discovered many other things about his life, such as, the fact that he was a wizard. He didn't take long to realize that he was famous from the time he was still a baby, for he was believed to be the baby who survived the attack of a very evil wizard, who had killed Harry's parents. Harry also realized that there are a few of those who disliked his popularity; one happened to be his potions teacher, Professor Snape. Also, he is about to have a very challenging adventure for the first time in his life, which involves stopping the man who tried to kill him from getting the Philosopher's Stone, a very valuable and powerful stone that gives its owner immortality.Overall, I find this novel to be truly unique. The author managed to balance out reality and fantasy all in one book, without making it boring or over exaggerated. The plot itself is already very different from other fantasy books that I've read. It's funny and full of mysteries that keeps you excited and wanting to know what will happen next. Also, there are many thoughtful morals that we could actually apply to our daily lives, which are expressed through the actions of the characters rather than being expressed through dialogue. I find it very impressive, because writing like this is not really an easy thing to do. The author's ideas keep flowing all the time, as we can see her vision of the \\"Magic World\\" forming little by little through her words, making you feel as if you're standing right there, witnessing the whole event.When speaking of fantasy books, you'd probably think it's something for small children to read and that adults are too grown up for that kind of stories. This novel, however, has proven that it's not just a novel for kids, but it's for everyone to read, even adults. As for people who don't normally read this type of story, I'm sure that once you've read it, you'll surely enjoy it. I would recommend this novel to those who love to read fantasy books, or anyone who doesn't like to read anything too serious and enjoys a bit of comedy. People who still don't like to read fantasy books no matter what, you may not enjoy this, because there's still a great deal of imaginary bits in it also."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K.

Her books are credited with getting children reading, and have changed the face of children's literature with a host of imitators. And while all this is occuring, it's not uncommon to see an adult reading a Harry Potter book-- indeed, I had a conversation on a subway just last night about Harry Potter with a stranger on the subway with her nose in the most recent book.So anyone who hasn't read Harry Potter yet is probably looking at this book and wondering what the big deal is. I'm going to use this as a chance to explain that.Quite simply, Rowling's writing is rather good. She is an engaging and natural storyteller, with a superb pacing and the ability to write in a form understandable to an 8 year old but without being patronizing, as I've found much children's literature to be. The books grow with Harry-- Harry at 12 is not the same as Harry at 16 because Harry at 12 is not a short adult, he's a kid, something else that's hard to capture. As the books progress, the tone, topics, and stories develop more depth and maturity. As such, one thing I think needs to be pointed out to parents is that while \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" may be appropriate for a 9 year old, I don't think \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\" is. Still, this development continues that feeling of a lack of patronizing from Rowling because the characters and the stories grow.Now this book itself is a coming of age story of sorts-- boy Harry has been raised by his mother's sister only to discover that he's part of a hidden group of wizards and is to attend the wizarding school (Hogwarts). When there, we follow Harry as he learns magic, gets into trouble, makes friends and enemies, and learns a bit about himself. More interesting is that the seeds of almost all the future books are planted in this one-- there are hints at even the sixth book in the series in this one.Is it a masterpiece? In some ways, yes, but I find in retrospect that while my enthusiasm for this book when I first read it was extraordinary, retrospectively it's not nearly as good as the later books in the series. Nonetheless, its a superb read and a great introduction to a great series. I really can't recommend these books enough."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd never like fantacy books before untill i read this book. The idea was brilliant. If you are Christian you should asked your pastor before read this book, because i had little trouble at church after i tell my Sundayschool teacher. I have been reading this book for more than 20 times in duration of 5 years. I highly recommend this book if you like The Children of Red King series. enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter has captured the imagination of children and adult alike using fresh ideas when stories were running dry. She injected the kind of originality missing for so long in children's fantasy novels..

It seemed to just pop-up with fireworks of action (which were engaging), but getting to that point was a bit tedious. As the first in a series, I understand that background needed to be established. However, it would have captured my interest before page 250 if there had been some more background on the stone, some more interaction with it, and some more engaging action before the final showdown.All in all, I found it to be an enjoyable story that children of all ages can relate to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All the hype got to me.

Every time I tried to put this book down I hade to pick it up and see what was going to happen next. To me Harry Potter books are the best books out and will always be the best books out.

I think Harry Potter Is the best F**king book ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Every so often, I stumble across a book that really leaves a lasting impression on me. Every so often, I read a book and exclaim 'Wow! I'd never be able to do that.' This is not one of those books. Rowling has succeeded in creating a vivid imaginary world filled with magic and suspence, but she's failed to deliver feeling to the world she made. What's more, I find myself sourly dissapointed with the lack of originality. The 'magic school' has been done before. And it has been done better. Unfortunatly, I couldn't relate to any of the characters, didn't find any ideas that really sparked my imagination.Read fantasy filled with imagery and meaning. Not a two-demensional story about a boy who finds out he's a wizard. Worth the money? This book isn't worth a penny. Borrow it from a friend, go to the library. You know what, while you're there, forget about Harry Potter - it's a waste of time. Pick up some truly fun, thought-provoking, and imaginative works. Explore the worlds of Narnia (C.S Lewis), Westermark (Llyod Alexander), and Earth two hundred years into the future (Ender's Game: Battle SCHOOL, anyone? Orson Scott Card)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is my all time favorite. In this book they talk about a boy named Harry Potter that is raised by his mean aunti and uncle (the Dursleys). But Harry Potter is actually a wizard. When he was a little boy Lord Voldemort killed his parents and also tried to kill Harry too but didn't succeed. He was gave to his only relatives the Dursleys to be raised (note his mother is a muggle, which is a human). When he grew older he finds out that he is actually a wizard and gets sent to hogwarts, which is a wizarding school. He goes to Diagon Ally to but school supplies and all that, with Hagrid (a big fellow that is very helpful from Hogwarts). During the school year he finds out that he is very good at quidditch, which is just a sport in the wizarding world. He meets two very nice and helpful friends there, also all three of them were sent to Gryffindor which is one of the 4 places to go for teaching. But evil strikes and Lord Voldemort is behind it. Harry find out that he's trying ti steat the Sorceror's Stone, which is believed to give you eternal life. So he sets out to find the Sorceror's Stone and try to defend it from Voldemort. It has drama, action, wierdness, plus it's hilarious. In this book you will descover exitement in every corner.

Harry Potter was brought to life by J.K Rowling. I would highly recommend this book not only for my peers but for all ages because of the way the author gets you interested in the book and keeps you involved with having to draw a vivid image in your head. She does this in many ways throughout the book.One of the ways she helps you draw a vivid picture is by describing to you the settings and the exact details of what the scenario is. Harry Potter and his friends were at the big Halloween dinner at the school hall when they were informed that there was a troll that had gotten into the school. Everyone was told to go their rooms except for Harry and his friend Ron who had to look for Hermoine who had gone to the ladies room. As they came in Hermoine was yelling at the top of her lungs trying to get away from the troll. So, Harry and Ron both distracted the troll so Hermoine could run out. Harry jumped on the troll and try to hit it with his wand. The troll was described as very large, green, disgustingly smelly feet and a nose so big that you could see into from a mile away. Harry finally stuck his wand up the trolls nose and had passed out on the floor. The description of this scene was written so well.This example is one of literally close to one hundred events in this book. J.K. Rowling is a great writer to me, and now am a fan of reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was skeptical. However, it didn't take long to appreciate its popularity--the plot moves quickly, the language is simple, and the descriptions of Harry's world are fascinating. J.K. Rowling is not the finest writer I have read, but she has a flair for creating and explaining every detail of her magical wizard world.This book is a MUST for ages 9 and up, and perhaps some 7 and 8 yr olds. I do NOT recommend this as a read-aloud for younger children. In addition to some obvious scary or upsetting material, it sets terrible behavioral models for young children, for whom the line between fantasy and reality is blurry. The story is based on an educational system that removes children from their parents at an early age and leaves them relatively unsupervised. Harry and his friends disregard rules, ignore the warnings and advice of adults, and assume it is better to take things into their own hands. The interactions between students are often disrespectful and violent. This is hardly a good example for 4- and 5-yr-olds who may be struggling to learn how to follow rules and get along with their peers.It seems to me that if a child is able to read this book by him/herself, then he/she is probably mature enough to read about and enjoy Harry's adventures without taking them as license to behave the same way."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a wonderfully, deceptively simply written book.

I'm sure the author of the Harry Potter series had this story in mind when she wrote it. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a twenty-something studying literature and philosopy and I adored this book! I don't find it at all &quot;childish.&quot; This book is like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in that readers of all ages can revel in it! I recommend for all readers to read each of the books in this series at least once each year. Each time you'll pick up on something new to think about. This book is great in that it does not insult the intelligence of its readers (no matter their age). I wish it was around when I was a kid. But now, being older, I delight in the many allusions to ancient mythology and mysticism--as well as the fine quality of the prose and the rich philosophical points that the book (intentionally or not)raises."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved how Harry beats The evil Lord Voldermort and how he and his friends get in to small fights with Draco Malfoy.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, and a few others. Undoubtdly, the Harry Potter series will soon be inducted into that list. The Sorcorer's Stone, is the first book in the 7 part series. It is a must if you would like to enter into Harry Potter's world. If you like fantasy books, then you will love this book. Children will love this. Unfortunatley if you are looking for a very complex book, then you probobly won't enjoy this book to much. However, if you want to have a lot of fun reading, then read this book. A word of advice, buy all three. Once you get done with the first then you'll want to read the 2nd and 3rd right after. I personally don't know how I am going to survive until July for the 4th book!

To have a book that is able to connect families of all sorts into the world of reading is a fantastic tribute to J.K. Rowling. Who can resist the adventures and magic behind Harry's journey into the world of Hogwarts? It's a non-stop rollercoaster from start to finish that no one, no matter what age they are, should miss.

Though they are a hybrid of previous generations of children's classics, they are more than wonderful. In particular they give a vivid picture of what a REAL boy would do in Harry's situation.What moved me to write this review is the reaction of my daughter. Reading has always been a chore for her, with her dyslexia variant. It is fair to say that until Harry Potter she never read for pleasure. After being forced to read the first few chapters she began to really get into it. What a pleasure to see your child devouring a book -- even staying up late to finish it. She is eagerly plowing through book 3 after having set herself the task of reading at least two chapters per night of the first 2 books until she finished. Maybe you too will be able to ignite a love of reading in your reluctant reader. I hope so.

Although I, myself, am not one to donate into the world of sorcery and witchcraft (being a God loving Christian) I cannot help but fall in love with the literature I found myself reading today. Expecting that I could honestly begin to tell people about the horror that is this magic-filled novel, I started into it. Now I find myself searching for book 2! Thank you J.K.

Yes, it is a fairy tale, (Cinderella, and Snow white both had magic and witches but there was no outcry about them) and I guarantee that your children will understand that there is no school where they teach you to fly on broomsticks.

RowlingA Review by JordanHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book of the Harry Potter series. The main character, Harry, is orphan as an infant and survives tough times. He is raised by uncaring relatives who make him sleep in a closet under the stairs. All that changes when a giant, bearded stranger named Hagrid appears on Harry's eleventh birthday, tells the boy that he possesses magical powers and then whisks him off to a special school for wizards.I really enjoyed this book, it was a book I just couldn't put down. I really liked the Quiddich matches. I recommend this book to all ages and anyone who just likes the thought of magical powers like, spells, potions, charms, transfiguration, and flying broomsticks. The characters were great they had the Hero, the Brains, the comic relief, and the good friend. To find out who's who read this book. There was nothing I didn't like about this book it was very well written, great characters, and overall just a great story. So, that's why I give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For the past few years I wondered what all this Harry Potter mania was about. Mild curiousity was not enough to encourage me to buy the paperback. &quot;After all it's only a children's book,&quot; I said to myself. But at the recommendation of a friend I bought the audio book.What a great surprise!! Each character had its own voice and manner of dialogue. It was unbelievable that they were all one reader.The story of an 11 year old wizard is an odd blend of modern, Victorian, and medieval mannerisms. They all seem to fit in Rowling's universe. One of the best things I find in her story is the uniformity of western mythos. She presents well-known legendary creatures which maintain their traditional characteristics. This is more pronounced in the second book, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. It has the affect of making the story more acceptable to an older reader who might expect a centaur or a unicorn to behave in familiar ways.While the Harry Potter series excels as fiction, this reading by veteran Broadway actor Jim Dale elevates Rowling's vivid narrative. The consistancy of character portrayals within the book (moreover the series) where many of the pages are pure dialogue is quite astounding.In many ways, the book seems like it could have been written for radio 60 years ago. For example, description of the quidditch match is put into the mouth of a student play-by-play announcer. This effect is more powerful in an audiobook.Grown-ups don't be shy. Buy this audiobook. And the rest of the series. Otherwise the kids will be right when they say you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the sourcers stone was a very good book. In the great media hype that is Harry Potter and the much anticipated movie I decdied to pick up a copy for my self. pHarry Potter is one of thoses great books that sucks you in right away. Even though it is written for a younger audience it does not lack any excitment that an less amture writer would emit in writting a childrens book. If you are a parent that strugles with geting your children to read like i know I often do i would suggest trying this book. The little brats wont be able to put it down. I was a little disapointed by the lack of sceenes in which quditch, the game played on brooms. I have yet to read any other books in the sereies but hopefully the will be packed with this exciting wizards sport."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Say that you've spent the first ten years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who hates you. Then, suddenly, a magical twist of fate, you find yourself surrounded by wizards, giants, and three-headed dogs. Not only that, but you discover that your are a wizard yourself. That is what happens to Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's, new exciting book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter is funny, exciting, and mysterious book.In the beginning is where the mystery part of the book begins. In the beginning all that we know is that Harry Potter is a orphan and that he has a lighting shaped scar on his forehead, we don't know how he became a orphan or how he got that scar on his forehead. That is what is so cool about this book, J.K. Rowling leaves you, after every chapter, with questions about the chapter. The book also has some very exciting points in it, like when Harry and Malfoy found the unicorn that was hurt; Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came darting out across the ground towards the unicorn like some stalking beast. Quote from book (pg.256)Harry Potter was one of the most exciting books that I have ever read in my life. I have never really been interested in fantasy books, but my aunt told me that it wasn't just fantasy, it was also a mystery type of book. So I bought the book and read it; I ended up really liking it so I bought the second, third, and fourth book to read also. Out of all the sequel books that I have read also I have enjoyed Harry Potter the most."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of those rare books that adults will enjoy just as much as children!

The things that really stick in my memory are &quot;Quidditch&quot;, &quot;The Golden Snitch&quot;, and &quot;Devil's Snare&quot;. Not to mention the revolting &quot;Bertie Bott's Every-Flavor Beans&quot;, sort of a Jelly Belly Spoof, only with flavors like *cough* earwax. And the names make me laugh, like Malfoy, Dumbledore, and Valdimort. LOL I know this may sound like a cliche, but Harry Potter is cool no matter what age you are. I remember I started reading my younger sisters' copy of the Sorcerer's Stone, until she caught me. The madness and craze drove me to see the movie, then I became totally obsessed, and I had to buy the copy of the book! I must say it was a very riveting book and has gotten me into the habit of reading again! Thank you J.K.

I enjoyed that the book kept moving and did not get bogged down in details."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, the beginning of the thrilling series by J.K. Rowling. This series tells the story of young Harry Potter.Harry Potter is not usual boy. His parents died when he was very little. He now lives with his uncle and aunt who treat him like dirt. Everything was going horrible for harry until he was met by a giant, Hagrid. He tells Harry he's a wizard and that he would be attending Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. So Harry goes to Hogwarts with his new best friends Ron and Hermione. The three do many things like knock out a cave troll, get past a three-headed dg, and survive a year with their evil potions teacher.Everyone who is a Harry Potter fan should read this book, as well as all seven books in this series. These books are action packed. You will never get bored. This book is for all ages. It teaches the differences in people, mostly good and evil.This book is a must read for anyone and will keep you wanting more.Review by Chris Ward"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was excellent. This book is great for all ages. I promise you will love it. My favorite part was when Harry found out that he was a wizard and had magical powers. I could just imagine his face -- a huge ear to ear smile. I love his friend Hermione Granger. Her characteristics seem very interesting. This book goes from fantastic scene to hilarious scene to suspenseful scene. All in all, this book is fantastic!It all started out with ten-year-old Harry Potter stuffed in his room, or should I say closet. When strange letters started flying through the house and Harry wasn't allowed to see them, the family went on a little trip.Everybody was sleeping when a huge man burst open the door. Later, Harry found out who the man was, why he was there, and where he came from. The whole family was astonished when they found out that Harry was a wizard.Not long after that, Harry was at Hogwarts, a school for witchcraft and wizardry. He made friends, he made enemies, and he even made the school Quidditch team! (A magical sport) Along the way he finds out a secret about someone who might want to kill him. Will he survive?Catherine H.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At the time I write this, there are some 5,512 Amazon reviews written about J.K. Rowling's HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, and while not all of them are to the point (there are grumblings about shipping, for instance), there's not much more I can say to persuade or dissuade someone to read this book. Indeed, although I am sure there are still many first-generation readers to come after me, I do feel like I'm the last person to get around to this book. Indeed, not having even seen a Harry Potter movie, I'm a complete neophyte.As with some other books I've reviewed on Amazon, I've read this first Harry Potter entirely because my daughter wanted it read to her. (Mind you, she's already read it many times over herself, could tell if I made a gaffe in my reading, and in fact was sure to point it out in every instance. Moreover, she took offense at my growling, slightly Scottish accent for Hagrid. I can't help it if his dialect as written sounds a wee bit Highlander to me.)So, for all those Muggles (i.e., regular dudes, squares, laobaixing, what Rugrats become) who haven't read HP/SS (to use the fandom lingo, or HP/PS, if you're reading the original British version, HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE), here's the upshot: Harry Potter, the son of a pair of heroic wizards is deposited on the doorstep of his wretchedly Muggle aunt, uncle and cousin, the Dursleys, where he's forced to live as a Muggle in a dirty cubby under the stairs and is regularly mistreated throughout his childhood. When it comes time for him to go off to middle school, Harry, who, as it turns out, is famous in the magic world, escapes from the Dursleys to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The rest of this volume recounts Harry's first year at Hogwarts, including his making friends, his success at the game of Quidditch, and his encounter with the evil being said to have killed his parents, Voldemort.It's a charming read. (You probably think I'm being sarcastic; I'm not.) I won't get into the argument as to whether or not it's truly literature. Children adore the book, and a lot of adults as well. I must admit that I found Harry taking a bit too much delight in the suffering of his enemies to make me feel comfortable about him being a role model of any sort to my daughter; then again, Harry went through a childhood guaranteed to keep a Muggle child in therapy for years to come. As far as my daughter is concerned the bad kids simply deserved it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What an absolutely spellbinding audio book. This is one of the audio books I have ever heard! When you combine Stephen Fry's amazing talent at making the printed word come alive with J.K. Rowling's masterful use of the English Language and a wonderful story filled with suspense and drama.My kids (ages 14, 11, 8 & 4) all sat spellbound and listened. We listened to the audio book in the car every day on our way to and from school and after school classes. They loved every minute of it.My 11 & 8 year old sons even got The Chamber Of Secrets to listen to at night as an extra bedtime story.Let me tell you, all the fighting and bickering that used to take place in the backseat is now a thing of the past. Even I look forward to \\"drive time\\" so that I can continue listening to this fabulous book.I didn't want it to end....so now we have started listening to The Chamber Of Secrets.If I could give it 10 stars I would. Truly magnificent!And by the way, Stephen Fry won a Talkie Award for the reading of the magnificent book, so I totally disagree with one of the reviewer's who said that his reading of this book was a bit dry. It's fabulous."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The OCR conversion of the text is disappointing. Many words incorrectly converted. Paragraphs run together. Punctuation omitted. Dialog from two characters run together. Is this an authorized edition? If J.K. Rowling was dead she'd be rolling in her grave. Since she's very much alive, I'm surprised the author and her publishers have allowed this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not going to rehash what this book is all about, because that's been done on all these reviews. But I will say that this is a very good book and very well-written.I read this book a while ago, and it really was a good book.I did not enjoy the book enough to continue on with the remainder of the series. I did read this first book, but will never read the subsequent books. I am not into fantasy, wizardry, etc. I prefer mysteries, westerns, horror, Christian, and general fiction to fantasy.Then you are probably wondering why I gave the book 5 stars if I did not enjoy it. Here's why: I do not rate a book by its genre. I rate it according to how good of a story line it had and how well-written it was. This book had a wonderfully good story line (that I did not enjoy because it was fantasy/wizardry), and it was very well and professionally written. If I were an English teacher grading this, I would have to give it the highest possible grade, because the story line is so wonderful and the writing is good. (Even though I prefer mysteries, I've been known to give 1, 2, 3, or 4 stars to certain mysteries. The genre doesn't warrant 5 stars - it is the story and the writing.)This was a fun and good and interesting story. (Just a little out of my preference boundaries.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's very enjoyable listening to Stephen Fry's reading of the first Harry Potter book. It's like listening to a radio show!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book I have read so far in the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling has written some other books, but the Harry Potter series is the most popular one. It is so well known and great that people wanted to make a movie out of it. Both are amazingly awesome! If you are one of those people that can't stand anything factual, or reads anything, then you will all love this book in the series, it is mostly fiction. Also, if you like stories with morals then this is also a good pick for you guys. The moral of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is \\"You can do anything if you set your mind and heart to it\\" that is the moral to look forward to.J.K. Rowling's style of writing is definitely a page turner, so if you like to be at the edge of your seat turning page after page then you should pick this book. The main character of this book is Harry Potter; the boy most people have heard of. Personally though, my favorite character is not Harry Potter but none other than...Fred and George Weasley, the twins of the Weasley family, and the funny troublemakers.Now back to Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a ten year old boy who lives with his very mean Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, and don't forget Harry's mean chubby cousin, Dudley. Harry lives with them, not because he wants to but because Harry's parents died when Harry was only a little baby (read the book to find out more). Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia are his legal guardians. As Harry grows up weird thing start happening, but only when Harry wishes that something would happen, like when Harry gets upset at Uncle Vernon things usually break.In my opinion, the best scene of the story was when Harry Potter is becoming suspicious of the weird things that happen to get him into serious trouble (EX: A snake exhibit glass at the zoo disappearing in front of Dudley's face). Harry's \\"family\\" is noticing the happening too. But that is the least of their problems. The day Harry receives a letter from a magical school Uncle Vernon opens it and tears it up. They think that was Harry's last chance but no. The Dursley's and Harry keep getting the letters day after day. One day Uncle Vernon can't take it anymore (he thinks someone is stalking them) and he tells everyone to pack up and get in the car. Uncle Vernon drove and drove until he reached a little shack they could all sleep in. That night while they were getting ready for bed someone very, very tall burst in through the door. He addressed himself as \\"Hagrid\\" the school's gamekeeper. He was so tall that when he went to give Harry the invitation to the school none of the Dursleys dared to go near him. But you have to read more if you want to find out...did Harry go to the school or did the Dursleys tear up the letter as soon as Hagrid left?I would definitely recommend this book to people who like books about magic, with a little comedy, and a lot of rivalry. I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because it was a book that kept me turning the pages until the end, and then giving me the urge to go out and read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read. Had I been 10 - 12 years old when I read it (it was instead Jules Vernes who captured my imagination at that age) I probably would have declared this to be the best book ever written and proceeded to become as hooked on the sequels and movies as the youth (and many not so young) of today. But when all is said and done, J.K. Rowling did not reinvent the literary wheel with this series in spite of the enormous amount of sales and acclaim that resulted from it. She simply wrote some pretty good YA fantasy books. This is the only one I read or felt inclined to read, but presumably the details grew richer and more addicting to fans as the series went on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"We all know and love this story. In this special anniversary addition, the publishers have included a beautiful painting of Hagrid and the First Years crossing the lake by Mary GrandPre as well as a hand drawn sketch of Snape by J.K. Rowling herself. The dust cover art is of Harry looking into the Mirror of Erised (my favorite chapter). The book itself is covered in Gryffindor house colors -- scarlet with gold stars all over it. I'm looking forward to collecting all seven anniversary editions for my home library."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought Harry Potter was a awesome book and I actually read and enjoyed it.The book was about a boy who is a wizard and does'nt even know it.His parents died and he had to live with his aunt and unle who hate him.Over time he figures out what he really is,and goes to wizard school.He learns many tricks and can talk to snakes.I would recommend this book to anyone not just people into fantasies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. This unfortunetly doesn't say much by the fact I don't read a lot, but this is the only book that kept me up until 12 at night to read. It is also the only book that got me in troble for reading it in the middle of class,and I am typing in a sort of daze because I was up all night reading the second one witch is just as good as the first. So if you are one of those people that think the world would be alot more fun riding on a broom stick (and who does't) than this is a book for you or if you have a kid that just won't read than through him or her this book and tell them to read the first few chapters thay will be asking for the second one in a week. This is a good book to read to your kids that can't read yet but I warn you some parts might make king cong afrad of the dark so the sugested ages are 1-101."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked the suspense and mystery in Harry Potter.

Harry Potter is a very exciting mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 35 years old, but felt like a kid again reading this incredible journey of Harry and his wizard freinds.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone over the age of 6, I guess. There is a Scholastic web site on Harry Potter stuff, which includes a neat crossword puzzle, based on all three books, if anyone is interested in exploring the site."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am thoroughly enjoying the Harry Potter books (reading Azkaban now). Once you start reading them, you can't put them down. They are imaginative, fast-paced, and keep you guessing about the outcome until the very end. This is pure escapist literature that enchants child and adult alike. However, I can't help but notice striking similarities to Star Wars. Our hero, Harry (Luke) is an orphan living with relatives (an Aunt &amp; Uncle) that don't understand him and are trying to keep knowledge about his parents from him. He finds two friends, Ron &amp; Hermione (Han &amp; Leia) who share his adventures as he fights the dark lord, Voldemort (Darth Vader). But he has an omnipotent mentor in Albus Dumbledore (Obi Wan or Yoda - take your pick). He also is surrounded by unusual animals, helpful ghosts &amp; elves, and other strange creatures: Hedwig, Scabbers, Crookshanks (R2D2, C3PO, Ewoks). He also has a large and sometimes bumbling ally, Hagrid (Chewbacca). Also, Harry's extraordinary ability with his broomstick mirrors Luke's agility with Landspeeders and X-wings. And inspite of their youth and some harrowing experiences, they both manage to save the day."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This happened about a months ago. I came to school and one of my close friends came to me and told me about the Harry Potter series and told me that they were really good. So I went to the library and I checked out the only book that was availible and that was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I started reading it and I thought it was boring because I didn't understand it very well. This was because I hadn't read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Anyway, soon it was starting to get good and then when I finished it, it turned out to be great. It ended out that I had read all the books in the series. I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone five times. I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets seven times. And I read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ten times. I wanted to write this review to show everyone that the beginning of a book isn't always good but the end is always fantastic. Hope you read the books!

My all-time favorite book remains Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth; and I've also been a fan of Tolkein, Roald Dahl, the Lloyd Alexander books, etc. But Rowling's books have captured my imagination such as none have done in years!

There are not too many characters which would confuse children (and adults who try to read real fast like I do), there are interesting twists in the story, and JK Rowlings Harry Potter world is just a nice escape from reality.

He also has to deal with Malfoy.My favorite part is when Harry saved the stone from Professor...Oh I can't tell you that.

This author really has some imagination. It's my first fantasy book and I loved it. It's all about Harry Potter and his adventures at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Who says these books are just for children? Anyone of any age I believe will love this book. It's so simple to read, yet so captivating. Well, I'm off on my broomstick to read the second book. Later............."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For some time now I have been avoiding reading this book. I have found that with rare exceptions, I simply do not care for the same kind of stuff the general reading population likes. However, in light of all the sound and fury in certain circles over these books...I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. So I have.To put it as directly as I can: &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is an excellent book. It is well written, extremely entertaining, and is told in a delightfully humorous fashion.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; tells one heck of a story. What is more--I found &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; contains a great message: appearances are not everything.Harry is a noble protagonist. He's had a rough life...yet, he is not bitter. Harry forms a several friendships (be it with the groundskeeper at Hogwarts or those with his classmates Ron and Hermione) that really demonstrate the value of sharing life with others.As in all great tales of fantasy, good and evil come are in sharp conflict with one another. At the very beginning of the book the story of how Harry's parents were killed by an evil wizard who they would not follow is graphically related by two of the other characters (by the way...the book's worth reading...but make sure your kids are mature enough). The bulk of the rest of the story tells of how Harry and his friends become embroiled in a struggle with evil years later while at wizard school.I recommend this book. It is very entertaining and teaches some wonderful lessons. I would hope everybody who has criticized the book without reading it would consider actually picking it up and giving it a try. However, I advise asking yourself one question: are you old enough yet? C.S. Lewis once said something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing here) people having to be old enough to love fairy tales again...Are you? If so, get a copy of this book...you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; by J.K.Rowling first takes place at 4 Privet Drive at the Dursley's house.

Even if you have a small imagination this book can take you far. Horrible. That's how it would feel to live in a closet under the stairs. But Harry Potter knows how it feels because that's his bedroom. That is not the worst part though, he lives with the meanest people in the world, his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and spoiled cousin Dudley. He lived with these people because his parents had died in a cer crash, or so he was told. One day was actually a good day for Harry, the day he found out he was a wizard and that his parents really got murdered by the darkest wizard of all, Lord Voldemort. Harry also found out that he was a famous wizard because he didn't die when Lord Voldemort tried to kill him with only a thunder shaped scare on his forehead. Harry soon drifted off to Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. Harry made many friends, very fast. There were somethings he had to get used to like people moving in pictues and jelly beans coming in every flavor including puke, everyone's least favorite flavor. Some odd things start happening. Is it Lord Voldemort or something else? Read &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; to find out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 20 years old and I fell in love with a childrens novel. I wouldn't have guessed that in my life. The book that targets young children, had my mom, dad, sister, and myself reading til the early dawn. Once you pick up &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; you will struggle to put the book down. A young child Harry Potter brings us to the magical world of spells and snakes. One reading the book becomes engulfed in the fancy new language and concepts brought on by J. K. Rowling. After reading the books, I felt a part of the young child and his magical friends lives. It was so easy to become engulfed with a child who is an outcast in a society we live in yet famous in a world that seems as real as anything else, but truely a figment of the readers imagination. It's a great gift for a young loved one, but don't be suprised when you pick up the book and read it all in a day or two. You will probably end up buying the rest of the books too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is amazing. I was a bit weary at first about reading it seeing as though it's a young adult book and I'm a bit older. But once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. This story takes your imagination into places you wouldn't dream of and the author describes everything in colorful detail. I couldn't wait to get to Book 2 which I just finished and now I'm looking forward to Book 3.If your looking for something good to read...this is it. Harry Potter is great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Amazon Critique I thought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an excellent, well written book. It is one of my favorites and one I want to read over and over. I always discover something new every time I read this book. I have read this book twice and in the process of reading it a third time. I am also doing a report on this book and this critique is part of it. I would like to say that this book has great description. I actually felt like I was with Harry at Hogwarts. I felt like I was getting in trouble along with him. I felt with him and I love that in a book. I give it two thumbs up and 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first when the Harry Potter books became popular, I didn't pay any attention to them, thinking that they were for little kids and that I wouldn't enjoy them. One of my friends read one this summer and loved it, however I still didn't think that I would be interested. When I read the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone, half out of curiosity, I absolutely loved it. This book is about the wild adventures of a young wizards first year at the school of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry Potter was a baby his parents died, and he was sent to live with his wicked aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and their nasty son, Dudley. Harry was an outcast with his relatives and was treated very badly. When Harry was eleven he finally learned the truth. Harry's parents had been a witch and wizard, and Harry was a wizard also. They hadn't really died in a car accident, as he had been led to believe, but had been killed by an evil wizard, Lord Voldermort. Lord Voldermort had tried to kill Harry too, but for some reason couldn't, and after being unsuccessful had vanished. For this reason Harry was very famous in the magic world. After learning the truth, Harry went to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy against his aunt and uncle's wishes. This is when the true adventure began. Hogwarts was a whole new world for Harry. There were ghosts in the halls, moving portraits, and a nasty poltergeist named Peeves that floated around. However, there was also delicious feasts in the Great Hall and the game of quidditch that Harry became the star of. Also, Harry made two best friends at Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione who helped him stand up to their enemies Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. Underneath all of these things, Harry would come to find that there was a much bigger conflict, of which the outcome was if Harry lives or dies. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to figure out who they can and cannot trust, and what the big secret is that is being hidden from the whole school. I highly recommend this book to everyone of all ages and I can't wait to read the other three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just a good book.

There was a horrible accident. Harry survived it, but had a lightning bolt scar. This is a vivid, detailed book that is well played. It's amount of characters is just enough to confuse you a bit. Bunches at a time. Some good. Some bad. Our fifth grade teacher read it to her class. So I got interested and I started to read it. I read it in a day. I'm reading the second one now.

I read the first Harry Potter in one day and refused to put it down. People kept wandering around the house saying, &quot;Where's Mom?&quot; and I'd keep quiet so they wouldn't find me and make me stop reading.

This book is not dark, or evil. Anyone who thinks that must have a dark and evil mind. Also, some of my other favorite books are The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife. I think that all three of these are wonderfully written and all follow a great story line. I am however glad to hear that some people do not like it, but I'd like them to consider this: If so many people (like myself) are rating this book 5 stars, maybe you should reread it and NOT be so critical about it. This really is a wonderful story. Yes, it contains magic, but so do classic stories that most people have grown up on, the Wizard of OZ, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella. The classic story of good vs. evil, except that Harry Potter has something special about it. I encourage EVERYONE to read this and to pass it along to their friends and families, as I have done. Harry Potter is awesome!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I adore Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dante, Steinbeck...(I really love to read and have rather eclectic tastes)nothing compares to a well-written, unique, children's book.

Although I had purchased all the Harry Potter books for my 10-year-old grandson, I hadn't had the chance to read them. Since my 80-year-old Mom wanted to read the books too, we decided to listen to the unabridged version during a recent trip to the Dakotas. We were both mesmerized! Jim Dale is a terrific narrator for the tapes, doing the different characters' voices so well you could hardly believe it was the same person doing all of them! From the Scottish accent of Mrs. McGonnigle to the Irish accent of the Centaurs to the Cockney accent of one major characters, all are so vivid! What a magical story! Mom and I both remarked several times on what an amazing imagination J.K. Rowling possesses to dream up such a tale. We also remarked on how we understood why Harry Potter has captured the attention and imagination of so many youngsters of every age. I can't recommend this one highly enough!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book shows the talents of an extremely good author, and a very imaginative plot. Actually, this would be a superb book, if it werent for the hero himself, Harry Potter. Harry is a mean, lucky, and rather snobbish character who never deserves the fame he gets. In all three books of the series, he defeats his enemy through luck or the help of some other character. He recieves presents anually, but NEVER GIVES ANYONE ANYTHING BACK! He is rich, yet won't spend a cent on his 'friends'. I say, keep up the good storytelling, great plots, and fantastic use of imagination, BUT GET A NEW CHARACTER! Sheesh!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm one of those few individuals that enjoy reading children's books. I'm old enough to worry about my own and yet I'm young enough to remember what it was like being a child. I learned about the Harry Potter books on the news when hundreds of the local kids stayed up past midnight to wait in the bookstore for the latest Harry Potter book. &quot;OK,&quot; I thought, &quot;I'm going to have to see what the big deal is.&quot; So I got off of my couch and headed down to the bookstore to check it out. (Actually I waited until all the kids left.) and picked up a couple of copies. Needless to say I was mildly surprised.From a technical standpoint the book is very &quot;time neutral&quot;. The reader is never going to find any references to any specific object. Instead of Chevy, the author simply writes &quot;car&quot;. Instead of Mickey D's (McDonalds to those out of the loop.) it's simply &quot;hamburger restaurant&quot;. Instead of Pentium III, it's simply a computer. This guarantees that children twenty, forty, or ... while we still have books, will continue to enjoy this book since children can relate to the characters and surroundings in the book. Add in that many words are carefully chosen to try and teach the children new things. Somehow the author manages to chose words that don't hinder the actual reading of the book. (Look up Prefect to see what I mean.)And relating to the book is the most important aspect. Some of the things that happen to Harry Potter certainly happened to me in my youth. Who hasn't been packed into a closet (actually a locker). Who hasn't been punched, chased, and kicked at some point? But the most appealing aspect of Harry Potter are his adventures. To be taken away to a school of magic to learn how to become a wizard. What child doesn't want to learn how to turn sniff boxes into mice? (This was one of the very few outdated references I was able to find.) To interact with ghosts, to fly through the air on a broom, and to dungeon crawl are a few of the adventures that Harry Potter goes through.This is a rare book that can let a child's imagination fly free (pun intended) from the confines of this world and to enter the world of magic. The Harry Potter books is platform nine and three-quarters to this world of imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The magical world of young Harry Potter is so full of surprises and action that I didn't want to put the book down! I would recommend this book to anyone with any age! Not just children can enjoy the experience of reading Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a good dozen years or so above the target audience, and my tastes run more to serious diplomatic and military history than fantasy, and I've been known to read Dostoyevsky for fun. Nevertheless, more out of curiosity than anything else, I bought HP and the Sorcerer's Stone and started reading it. To my surprise, I was absolutely entranced. I won't bother with a description of Hogwarts, the Dursleys, the Weasleys, Hermione, or even Quidditch. Once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down, and finished it in a matter of hours. Not since Orson Scott Card's &quot;Enders Game&quot; when I was about 10 had another book captivated me so much. I'm currently working my way through the other books, anticipating Harry's next adventure and hoping this magical series doesn't turn into a forum for the exposition of Rowling's religious beliefs the way the Ender books, Narnia, and the Dune series became the way Card, Lewis, and Herbert did it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I heard about the Harry Potter series, I didn't think I would enjoy it. After all, it's a child's book right? Wrong!Harry Potter is a book for any reader with an open mind and an active imagination! From wizards who turn into cats, and owls who search pockets for your payments, to &quot;muggles&quot; (that refers to you and I--the non wizard-like folk!)who don't understand what is going on right before there eyes, the reader is taken on a fun and thought provoking ride!Writing this story with juvenile readership in mind, this author showed that she knows the rule of a successful children's book: don't talk down! By following this rule, she has done two things: 1.) Captured the imagination of her younger readers, and 2.) Written a wonderfully fun story for readers of all ages!A psychologist that works in my office has actually recommended this book to some of her depressed patients, soley for the purpose of lifting their mood! While I can't personally vouch for any &quot;therapeutic&quot; effects, I can tell you that it's hard to stay down when you're learning about Platform Nine and Three Quarters, and about the bumbling giant who was expelled from wizard school and now performs magic on the sly!I believe you will enjoy this book. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this truely entertaining series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have never liked reading and dread when summer reading is hanging over me.

Since then I have read the rest of them on my own and loved them just as much or even more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was given a copy of Harry Potter from my mother in the dog days of July 99. I'm thrirteen now, but at the time I was more than hesitant to read a book with such a corny plot having read the sleeve. But I picked it up and about half a chapter in realized that I was in the midst of something really quite well-done. I had, of course, read books before, even at great length perhaps. No, never mind that. But this really made me realize what fun it was to shut yourself off away from society and just READ.The characters are well set-up and though they develop at a grueling pace, they still manage to keep both feet on the ground. The book has surprises, humor, seriousness and horror all nicely compiled into a single work.For new readers who've finished the series, check out C.S. Lewis, Roald Dahl, and the two Alice in Wonderland Books.I've noticed that most of the people who are outraged or disgusted at this book are people who haven't read the whole thing. I think that puts them in a rather naive position. Sure, this series is hyped beyond belief, but it's really quite a good thing. More people are reading books. More Young people. As for the accusations of witchcraft and satanism attached to the book, there's always some person with a high pitched voice who stands up and whines about something. I'm a devout Catholic, but I'm still convinced that fantasy is fantasy and real evil is different. Some people, however, just can't distinguish the two. I (and the rest of the world) am not seeing any people carving bolt-shaped scars into their foreheads or worshipping lord Voldemort in the garages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The sorcerer's Stone is the debuet of the fantasticaly imaginative 'Harry Potter' series. As I live in England, I read the 'Philosiphers Stone' but I'm sure it's pretty much the same. The sorcerer's Stone is about a 10yr old boy called Harry Potter (in case you didn't know), a usual, boring sounding name....... but Harry is not an ordinary boring boy....... and his strangeness goes deeper than a lightening shaped scar.... The real talent by J.K Rowling is that she manages to break the usual stream of 'Fairy Tales' involving witches and wizards etc. Instead of being bored by a mundane novel involving totaly unbelievable blue-eyed fairies and wicked witches, you find yourself being swept up in a fast-moveing, detailed world where the idea of sudenly finding out you have magical powers seems completely normal. In fact, after reading this book you have to blink and re-adjust to reality. J.K Rowling manages to create a character who is so lifelike you find yourself feeling sorry for Harry as he falls headfirst into a dangerous adventure on his first term at the strangely named 'Hogwarts' school for wizards........."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sarah and Me think this book was full of excitement and adventure.

The book was great because JK Rowling paint's the character's picture so well in your mind. Also the action was excellent. In the movie the Quidditch matches were more fierce than in the book. Also I pictured Fluffy way differently. I pictured him as a Doberman. Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter excellently. I even here JK Rowling picked him herself because that was how she pictured him. The character that played Severus Snape was just as I pictured him. The actor that played Albus Dumbledore was just like him. I reccomend this book for people no younger than fourth grade. Besides the slang this book had no spelling or grammar mistakes. Harry makes some great catches in the movie. The movie had alot of parts cut out though. The books content was great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was curious about these books for a long time.

This has been the absolute best book I have EVER read in its genre. J.K. Rowling has created an instant classic. I must say this has been the only book where I have been able to sit and read it twice and recieve the equivalent amount of enjoyment in both sittings. I highly recommend this book to children AND adults alike (being that I am an adult and thoroughly enjoyed this book). The story is written on many levels and it is simple enough for my 11 year old sister to enjoy it, but also reminiscent of youth and so well written that both myself and my 30 something roommate LOVED it (just to prove that adults do love Harry Potter too). We finished the first three books within a week. We are both anxiously waiting for the next installment (book 4). Congrats to Rowling for her outstanding work and HURRY with the next book please!

The story line is easy to follow and hard to confuse. It makes you hate Uncle Vernon and Snape but love Harry, his friends Ron and Hermione, and his parents. The thing about one of the Professors at school being Voldemort's servant was unbelievable!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My Mom told me about the Harry Potter books a month ago, saying that they were on the bestsellers lists. I love fantasy books, but I'm a freshman in High School, and seeing the reading level, I was kind of skeptical. But when I went to school, we had English in my teacher's Junior High room one day, and she had the Harry Potter books. Then my brother got &quot;The Sorcerers Stone&quot; On tape for Christmas. I listened to the first chapter with him, then I stayed up till 3 AM That night to continue. I stayed up all night the night after, finishing the recorded text. Jim Dale reads it excellently, I really enjoyed it. I ordered all 3 books, and I am awaiting their arrival. Some people are saying that these books inspire Pagan practices. I have a Pagan friend, and trust me, these books have NOTHING to do with real Paganism. Buy this book, even if you're an adult. You'll love it. Kudos to J.K. Rowling, I hope to meet her someday."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first looked at this book at the advice of my mother. Ithought it was kind of childish-looking and I knew it was aimed forpeople younger than me . But, as I read practically anything, I started anyway. I was hooked from the first page. I received a set of the three hardcover books at Christmas and had them finished in less than two days. I couldn't put them down. The adventure of Harry Potter, boy wizard, and his friends Ron, Hermione, and everyone at Hogwarts are truly intriguing and refreshingly creative! I applaud the author, I haven't read a book with this much imagination in a long time. The plot and details are well-thought out and superb. I can't wait until the next one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is phenominal! It has been a long time since I have picked up a book and been pulled into it as quickly as I have this one. I can't wait until my children are old enough to enjoy this book. And I can hardly wait for the paperback releases of the next two. Parents, if your children want to read this book, let them! It beats killing 3D characters in a video game. If you like this try the Wrinkle In Time series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is simply a masterpiece in children's literature. Rowling definitely knows how to capture the reader. You are certain to fall in love with Harry and his two best friends and once you pick this book up it will be hard to put back down. Although it is for an age bracket of 9-12 year olds, it would appeal to anyone who is able to read. It certainly did to me. I guarantee that this book is worth both your time and your money. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 13 years old. My mom picked this book up for me at the library. I thought it'd be too childish for me, but I tried it anyway. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I think it would appeal to anyone who can read, not just 9-12 year olds. It brings out the kid in you and always keeps you guessing. I'm really anxious to read the next ones and I hope you purchase this book. It's definitely worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 11 years old. I LOVED this amazing and great book. I have all three books in the series. I usually hate reading, but this is my exception. Read this book series and you will be in awe at some of the things Harry does. If you like this book try the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes, thats right. This is one of the best books ever. My mum and me read this when I was about seven,(*sob* it brings back such memories!) and it made me ADORE reading! I get REALLY angry when I see schools trying to ban the books because the premote paganism or somthing. NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is so not true in any way. It is fantasy! Its not premoting paganism. Its a kids book, (well, adults like it too.) plain and simple. So, if you are a kid, READ IT! If you are an adult, READ IT! And to those people who are trying to ban it, you are fighting a loosing battle. LONG LIVE HARRY POTTER!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My mom made me wait until I was 9 to read the Harry Potter series. I didnot think that this was a good idea because she thought they were \\"scary\\" but they were not. It is a very good book because it is exciting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"love this book, love the whole series, the books are a million times better than the movies are...if you liked these books read C.S. LEWIS'S CHRONICALS OF NARNIA."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As strange as it may seem, I haven't actually read a Harry Potter book until now. I've had it backwards: I've been watching (and greatly enjoying) the movies as they came out and now, finally, this summer I have some time to tuck into the books.And...I can say right away that the first book is very deserving of the praise that has been heaped on it. Stephen King has said that J.K. Rowling is the master of writing 'pure story', by which he means fiction that is situation and narrative-driven rather than driven by symbolism or plotting (not the same as narrative), and he is right. These are books to devour for the sheer thrill of that old standard reading pleasure, 'finding out what happens next.' Her writing is also clever, with an almost Lewisian wit (C.S. Lewis), very fitting to this fantasy series that owes more than a little to Narnia, Earthsea and many others.Of course you can't please everybody, and people (i.e. those one-star reviewers) will inevitably find the books dull, overwraught, derivative, etc. but in my opinion (having read many of the fantasy works which Rowling is said to have plagiarized) Harry Potter places his own distinctive stamp on fantasy literature. The elements come together just right. The characters are compelling and magnificently drawn (and become even more so as the series proceeds), which is really what is most important. If you want a truly derivative, cheap, hackneyed, 'never should have left the editor's desk (or shredding machine, for that matter)' fantasy work to pick on, choose Eragon.I read the first book in two days and can't wait to pick up the second. I doubt I'll be able to keep up this pace, though, the books get increasingly longer...but they're a perfect summer read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This, the first book in the series sets up the wizarding world, and establishes how Ron and Hermione will work with Harry throughout the series. If you've read the whole series, go back and reread it to see how J.K. Rowling set everything up throughout. If you haven't read this story at all, you should because it's great fun and a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is really difficult to speak to everyone's taste. I have now read reviews that are all over the map on approval. I read a review that said book seven is their favorite book but movie four was horrible, and vice versa. So I will tell you this much about the books without giving you my critic of the actually quality. You can see that in the fact I gave this book a five.If you are just now contemplating buying Sorcer Stone or Philospher Stone, I would guess you are beginning the series. May I suggest, as I did watch one of the movies first. It will open you to the world, while giving you an idea what may follow.I watched the first movie in theaters and needed to see some of the backstory. From then on I was hooked. You reading it today can go all the way up to movie five, and you will not have a sense of \\"they left so much out\\" the movies will serve as an introduction.Additionally, the books kind of change genres. Yeah it is still mostly fantasy but they get darker, and in some cases grittier. The heroes are not perfect human being and the characters are not as one would imagine for a children's book one dimensional.But the biggest comment I can make about the series--is it is a victim of its own success. Oncee you love the books you take ownership of the characters. I had someone tell me she hated the new movie because they left so much out of the book. I remarked she would still be in the theater if they were true to the book. And every screen adaptation is expected to take liberties. The complaint by time you get to book seven--is about not seeing enough of XYZ character.Also note the mood and the gravitas of subject matter change.The first two books can definitely be Disney Channel material, but by time you get to book seven--you have to go to HBO late night."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My husband works at a library, and I find that this book seems to draw pre-teens to read and join book clubs more than anything. I can see why. Rowling really draws in the attention of young people (and adults as well) with her attention to detail. This book allows readers to use their imagination to make Hogwarts into the dreamy place it is...with floating candles, moving pictures, and heroic adventures. If your child does not like to read, I strongly suggest giving them this book, or reading it to them. They will be drawn in! Wonderful writing! Do not listen to the rumors about witchcraft, etc. I feel that Harry Potter is magical, but that Harry is always trying to do good in this book POSITIVELY! Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I won't only review the book itself that everybody knows that it is incredible, but the quality of the service that Amazon gave me and has given me all these years, every time that I have purchased anything from them, I have received it in good shape, no scratches, nothing missing, nothing different, everything perfect and never ever been charged more than what it is shown. I give the five stars to the book and 50 to Amazon service...

UGH!I hope you read this and discover the same satisfactory as I found. :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There have been many great books written in our time---but Harry Potter is certainly not one of them.For one, Rowling has made the characters superficial and cheap, and there is no character development. Harry is always the same, Voldemort is always gonna be evil, you get the point.Good is not a pure good, and evil is usually a fallen good. Rowling doesn't make any blend in that; good is good, and bad is definitely bad. No one changes.Plus, the whole thing about his scar at birth is ridiculous. Harry doesn't deserve that; he didn't do anything. The plot is overused. Voldemort keeps on showing up every book...when is there going to be a new plot? I appreciate her creativity, but there are authors that can write much better than this.*ANIME ROCKS!*"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Too bad the lowest rating was 1!!

I would not recommend buying from this seller if you ever want to actually receive your book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Please pay close attention to my title. I am mainly writing this for two reasons. One I do not want Amazon to recommend these books or any like them to me. Two I genuinely dislike these books. The premise is tired and unoriginal. This writer has creatively blended all of the greatest mythology stories and essentially given it a 20th century make over. With the exception of Quiddich. By and large I think these books were written for people who don't want to be challenged anymore and simply want to mentally check out while reading instead of watching TV. So, once again go along with your blissfully ignorant lives of what a real author would create and ignore this review."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter is a good book...that's the problem...it's just too good...all the other books don't have a chance, so people think they are reading a good book but really the book is long and boring while other books are short and thrilling.

My 8 yr. oldhates to read, it's a constant fight. I bought Harry Potter with thehopes of stirring her even a little. Harry and his unique line of friends and foes did just that. Every night they passed up T.V. time, computer time, even ice cream to hear the next chapter in the exciting mystical world of Harry Potter. I can't wait for books 2, 3, and 4!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A lot of my friends were raving over these books, so I decided to try the first one. Now I can see why they loved it . I couldn't put it down! It was the best book I've ever read , hands down! I'm addicted. I can't wait for the next four books and the movie! It was action packed and full of mystery, fantasy, suspense, &amp; frightening details.......It's not very scary....I didn't think. As I read, I hated Dudley &amp; Draco's very names, felt the glory of capturing the snitch (and the Sorceror's Stone), the longing to see my family, the feeling of total suspence when I went out at night, and the happiness of winning the house cup,just as Harry did. To put it extremely short, this was the awesomest book I've read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Why? Because I believe in God, and I believe in the Good, but I have been ashamed to read the misanthropic and vindictive attacks upon this book by people who claim to share my beliefs and values.Harry Potter is a magnificent and fascinating book. There is nothing at all offensive about witchcraft or sorcery as portrayed in this book, because it is about the ultimate using of powers for the proper ends. Even the deceit is justified, following soul-searching and worries. That is human life, and sometimes it's better not to know certain things. It is imaginative and thrilling, with genuine originality used to spice up a well-trodden theme (The Worst Witch school stories, for example, predate the idea of a school for witchcraft), and references to the ancient myths. Thus, it is educational. It informs you about such things as mandrakes, unicorns, phoenix, cockatrices and the like, and about the myths and legends connected to those beasts. It encourages you to imagine and to think for yourself. It was truly frightening, but everything ended happily and satisfactorily. The plot was logical enough for a child, yet elaborate enough to please the mature mind. Of course, Harry's uncle and aunt are grotesque. They embody the narrow-mindedness of my so-called kinsmen, who lack magic and joy for life in their souls, and who lack the imagination to understand that magic is all in the mind. &quot;Children will start dabbling in sorcery&quot;, INDEED. And so what if they do? They are very likely to go on to become eminent scientists or great philosophers. They may write, paint or create works of art. They will use their brains to make life interesting, and will be open-minded. They are reading, and learning, and they know from the world around them that such things cannot happen to them. There are positive Muggles too, just as there are positive and negative wizards, creatures and monsters, and there are people who are neither totally good or evil, just like in the world. If your child cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality at 8 years old, what kind of parent can you have been? There is fantasy everywhere. Even the wholesome Sesame Street is a fantasy. Do children grow up thinking that birds talk, and that monsters live in garbage cans? No. So why pick upon this immensely popular (and deservedly so) book? It is a much, much better book than most books written for children. Long live Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...and they just keep getting better and better. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' tells the tale of an eleven year-old unwanted orphan who discovers that his late parents were wizards and he is too. He is invited to attend the highly prestigious Hogwarts School to prepare him for a career as a wizard, but his mean Aunt and Uncle don't want him to go. How he gets to school forms the first part of the story, what happens when he gets there forms the middle act and how he solves a mystery involving the Sorcerer's Stone completes the Hero Cycle for this first book in what is to be a seven part series.J.K. Rowling has a perfect hand at creating likeable archetypes - I daresay she's an equal to George Lucas himself in that regard. I had a little trouble getting into the book because her prose is straightforward in a way that is more appealing to children than to adults, but she has a very dry, grownup sense of humor that becomes a growing presence in this book and an integral part of future installments. I cannot recommend this series enough, and it is primarily for the characterisations that I praise it. If you loved series like Star Wars or FarScape for their characters that grow on you, you will definitely love Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Do you want to read a good book? Then you are right if you choose this one. I think you've already heard of Harry Potter. If not, you wouldn't visit this site. It's difficult to describe the book but I think one word could express it: &quot;It's brillant&quot;. It describes in a very funny way the life of Harry Potter. This fantasy story is easy to read. I enjoined it from the beginning till the end: I think you will as well. So don't mess around reading this text. Go to catch your train to Hogwarts!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I discovered Harry Potter when my teacher read the first book in school. When she was only half way through, my grandmother gave me a copy. I just couldn't help it. Before my teacher could finish another chapter, I read the rest of the book, it was so awesome! What is this Harry Potter craze? For one thing, all four books are fabulously written. I love the fascinating and sometimes gruesome details in them. The characters are so well developed that it's like I'm their best friend. How on earth does J.K. Rowling think up these names! Not to mention the wonderful plot. The books are funny, suspensful, interesting, and scary all at the same time. I really didn't know such a great book could exist until I read the Harry Potter series. Don't just stand by and watch the world fall in love with Harry Potter(the books are already in french, german, italian, and other languages). Do yourself a huge favor and read them for yourself! As many of you already know, Harry Potter is a thirteen year old wizard. He escapes the terrible and yet histarical Dursleys and their more-than-fat son Dudley with a half giant named Hagrid(he makes you laugh, too). Off Harry flies to a world of owls, goblins, and lots lots more. He meets Albus Dumbledore, Hermoine Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, the evil Lord Voldemort, and a talking hat. I won't tell you any more, except that BUY THIS BOOK! When you're done, read the rest. The only fault with this book is that the end makes you want the second, third, and fourth books even more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A gift to my son for Christmas, the cover of the book attracted my son's attention immediately. He is 7 and tried to read on his own, but found some of the names too hard to figure out. He asked me to read aloud to him, so, of course, I began the book over, and read to him from the beginning. Now, He will not go to bed at night without me reading this book to him. I am so pleased that he is enjoying the book, but what surprised me even more than his excitment over this book was the fact that I couldn't put it down! I finished the book and have begun to read it again, and I am still reading nightly to my son, continuing from where he can last remember before falling asleep. This is a book that simply awakes the imagination. I can't wait to read Year 2!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Why a 37 year old woman would love a series of books that were originally geared towards children? And the only reason I can admit this is because of all the similar reviews other adults have given, including senior citizens. As a ten year old child I fell in love with the 5 Prydain series books by Lloyd Alexander, so much that I cried when I read the last one and realized there were no more fortchoming. The Harry Potter books, which I bought out of curiosity after seeing them 1, 2, and 3 on the NY Times bestseller list, brought back that magical feeling of childhood I had back then reading Alexander. They took me out of myself and made me forget my surroundings for hours, and during a difficult time in my life. Very few books have managed to do that and to this extent, and I am an avid reader. I am impatiently awaiting the sequels and the upcoming film."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard about Harry Potter in my college education classes. All of my COLLEGE AGED classmates were raving about the spell Potter cast on them. I decided that I should read the book and see what all the hype was about. From page one, I was captivated by the book. Rowling mixes wonderful plot development with a timeless tale for a book that won't let you put it down. As far as concerns go about witchcraft, etc., I think that as long as the reader has a good grasp on reality, they will not try the spells that the kids use at Hogwarts or stray into the world of the occult. If parents are concerned about this, they should read the book first themselves before they give it to their children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After purchasing this book for a family member, I became aware that a number of people were condemning the Harry Potter series because of its alleged intentions to introduce children to the occult.Being religious myself, I was concerned and so I decided to read the book. The source of these occultic concerns was immediately evident. Harry Potter is a wizard, and is attending a school for Witchcraft and Wizardry. This could have been gleaned from the brief description on the inside of the book jacket.I believe this is where most of the people who hold these concerns get their information, because had they taken the time to read the story they would be talking about the magic of the story, not the 'occultic' magic of Harry Potter.What I found in reading the book was a very intricate and impressive metaphor for the world of good and evil, with strong religious overtones. It may not be conventional to use Witches and Wizards to portray the good, but there is nothing inherently wrong with this approach -- it simply forces the reader to analyze this nicely composed metaphor more closely.To those who so quickly condemn these books at the first mention of the word 'Witchcraft' -- take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and allow yourself to be stimulated by a rare gem of a book, in which good prevails."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There's no doubt that this first Harry Potter novel isdelightful reading, but have readers noted its worrying similarity toDiana Wynne Jones' novels? Harry Potter seems to be distilled from two Jones novels: Archer's Goon, in which a middle-class English boy learns he is the youngest of a family of squabbling gods, and Eight Days of Luke, in which a boy being raised by horrid relatives who dote on their own fat, cruel son and treat the hero like a male Cinderella wins his freedom with the help of the Norse god Loki.What's worrying is that if you mixed these two Jones novel together, you'd get...Harry Potter. Have other readers noticed this?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have first read about H.P in the internet. And I read, that it had been banished from schools in Amerika. Although I am from Austria I decided to read the book in english (just in case the translators didn't do a good job). All the bad things that are said about this book are absolutely wrong and out of the context. The book is as well suitable for kids and adults (I am 23) - the adventures are fantastic and bounding. I read the book within a few days. And everyone should read the book of the little wizard and his friends. Especially for kids the book is great, because it lets phantasy flow into a world of being glued to a TV all day or playing PC-games.

But as the hype grew to monstrous levels, Ifigured I should try them out. From the moment the book started, I was held captive in its extraordinary storyline and extremely involved characters. I have been interested in magic since I was little, and this book satisfied me completely. Harry Potter, a young orphaned boy, becoming a wizard and going off to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! It was like I was living my dreams through this captivating book. J.K.

I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My dad read it to me and I hated it. A few months later it was getting so popular I decided to give it another try.

Imagine living under the stairs in a cupboard! An imaginary tale, its the first book of a series. Its about a young wizard who joins Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry Potter gets choosen to be the Seeker in the Quiditch game. The story ends with a horrid shock for Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I'd heard how not-to-be-missed the Harry Potter series is, I bought the unabridged audio cassettes of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to take with me in the car. Well, I chose well! I now count myself among those who are recommending Harry Potter to everyone they meet. The author captured me from the very first chapter and kept me keenly interested until the end. I'm glad there are more books in the series waiting for me. The writing is creative and imaginative. The characters are varied and interesting and the descriptions of them and their shenanigans are simply brilliant. Not only was the content of the book terrific, but the rendering of it by Jim Dale was truly inspired. His animated reading kept my rapt attention throughout. I am amazed at his ability to provide a unique voice to each of the many characters. I could often tell which character was speaking even before the narrative revealed who it was. A listener's enjoyment depends both on keen writing *and* expert reading. We get both here!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book aloud to my family (with 2 children) over a period of two weeks. I have done this many times before with other books but never have they wanted me to keep going and going and not stop. As soon as we finished, my 11 year-old daughter had to read it for herself.Just why this book has become such a phenomenon is not hard to see. The story appeals to all of us, no matter what our age. The suspenseful parts have just the right amount to keep us on the edge of our seats; the humor is perfectly-timed; the emotional portions are exquisite. All of the technical aspects of a fiction novel for older children are here.But that is not why it is so wonderful. The character of Harry Potter, I believe, triumphs over a situation in which we can all see ourselves. His background is one we can relate to, even if it exaggerates our own predicaments (just as our own memories are). His progress through the story just makes us want to cheer. All of the characters are multi-dimensional and impossible to predict, constantly suprising us, and yet the whole ensemble merges together like a world class symphony.If you haven't read this book yet, don't wait any longer. It is not often that we get to witness the birth of a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My son read these books in school, and I heard about Harry Potter everytime I turned around; so I decided to see what the fuss was all about.

These are destined to become classics! I must have them all. I am 38 and I am now a BIG Harry fan!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is ideal for those wishing to subtly manipulate the subconscious of most unsuspecting children and apparently many equally unsuspecting adults. The extraordinary popularity of the book will allow it to slip by even the most observant parent. The series should intrigue and captivate young readers - as it has - and entice them into a more serious exploration of the mysterious through many other detailed, though less popular, publications. Once this happens, the young reader will be receptive to investigating &quot;other-world&quot; phenomena firsthand. The book glorifies witches and witchcraft and portrays &quot;normal&quot; humans as mean-spirited while letting children know that, if they are unhappy in their current family situation, there are groups that would be happy to bring them into their care.This Harry Potter book is perhaps the best of its genre ever released. Even though the book is a bestseller, it is heavily discounted (up to 50% off) insuring widespread distribution among all socio-economic classes. Witches, Wicans, Warlocks et al owe a debt of gratitude to the author. One day we will all look back at how this book vaulted to the Number One bestseller and view that event as one of the major indicators of what was to come in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter is an exelent book. Once i started i could not stop reading! I took it everywhere,even on 8 minute car rides. This is a book for all audiences. Once you start to read harry potter you will fall in love with the book. It is a story of a boy who has to live with his aunt and uncle and they treat him terible, because they know he is a wizzard. Harrys parrents were killed by dark lord voldmort when he was just a baby. harry survived the attak. harry recieves a letter,doesnt read it then Hagrid comes to pick up Harry from his aunt and uncle.To take him to hogwarts as school where he will train to be a wizzard, and that is the part that the book takes off. J.K.Rowling wrote this story amazingly.Harry potter is a MUST read, after the first book you will do anything to get your hands on the second book!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This review is likely to be buried within moments of my hitting the \\"save\\" button. So I will waste no ones time.This is a great book for young people, likely ages 10-14. The rage about the \\"tie-in\\" to the adult community was one I simply did not see or read anywhere in this book. Sure there were puns that most kids wouldn't get but adults reading this, tst tst tst on you. Spend your time reading something of substance. But rest assured your children are in good hands with Rowling's characters, plot and retro-zest. I wanted to see what the rage was about, and after reading it I can only say that in this over-hyped world we live in, some reviewers might be afraid to pan this book. I am not. THIS IS NOT FOR INTELLIGENT ADULTS. It is for children.After writing this, I am confident that if I get any \\"feedback\\" it will be negative as people only want to vote with those they agree, not with those who read the book with an open mind and came away with a different take. Move on. Read Norris, Russo, Roth, Steinbeck. Read real literature, not some rage that feeds on itself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to agree with a previous poster, while the book was good it certainly is not up to the hype that has accompanied it. There is nothing in this book that Piers Anthony did not do 25 years ago and did better. The characters are pretty standard for a fantasy book, the evil sorcerer, the young hero etc. but there is nothing particularly compelling about them. The fantasy elements are also pretty standard fare, the plot tends to be a series of almost unconnected episodes. For a better treatment check out Piers Anthony's Xanth series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"first off, it's great that this series is inspiring people to read. unfortunately, like every over-hyped product, it disappoints and will probably be forgotten before next tuesday. if only this much publicity could be directed towards books with more heart, story, and intelligence.Who is this?: children's parents die horrible death, child is raised by mean guardians until child is taken away by mystical characters who show him how great of a person he is, all the while getting into silly hijinks with his friends and learning valuable life lessons. No, not Harry Potter, but James, from Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach: a book with more humor, emotion, and story than Ms. Rowling could ever imagine.There are much better books than the Harry Potter series out there for kids. Try C.S. Lewis, Roald Dahl, or countless other authors. Don't get sucked into the hype machine. If you respect your children, look for a higher quality book than this.For those who have already read this book, take the excitement for reading you've gained and continue it-- go to the library or support your local book store--you'll realize that this is only the tip of the iceberg."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this well written, nicely constructed story from a first time author. This certainly beats Goosebumps and the Star Wars pulp books. Obviously the author has already received plenty of praise already. I think the book is a fun read for adults. I've marked it down to 3 stars because I do not believe the content is at all appropriate for the early reader, ages 9-12, for which it is targeted in the U.S. It is a challenge for parents who are concerned about the glorification not only of witchcraft and the occult, but also violence and meanspiritedness. There is a lot in this book that pleases the senses as you read, but like so many hedonistic pleasures, the soul of the work is empty at best, and evil perhaps. What will your 10-year old child take away from this book?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not a big fan. As you see, I bought the book a week ago b/c and only b/c it's on sale and I would like to get sth to read. The story is a little bit disapointed. Why there are always evil aunt and uncle??? Why the little victim is always the &quot;super special boy&quot;? It's a okay book for little kids to have fantasy about magic, spells, etc. But the depth ideas are not as heathly as the surface - a little special boy learnt magic. When you read the book to your kids, please pay attention to the negative ideas regarding the aunt and uncle issue."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found this book kinda boring and not that original. It's not that I don't like fantasies, but this book is just a cute children's book. It's storyline repeats itself and stuff doesn't really come as a shock. It can't stir emotions and the characters don't develop. They just keep getting in trouble. I know a lot of books that have better plots that make magic seem fun and amazing. This book muddles it and makes it confusing. If you want a good fantasy book I suggest the Lord of the Rings series and The Golden Compass.I am not a person who hates books I just find this one dull and unoriginal. Same line, Same verse, A little more popular, and a whole lot worse!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Writing Quality: 6/10.From the get-go, Rowling displays a quick wit and and a facility for fun, quirky description that sets up a wild romp with magic and lighthearted humor, as well as surprisingly distinct characters. For instance, she doesn't just explain that Dumbledore has long hair and beard, but says that \\"both were long enough to tuck into his belt,\\" giving us a fun and slightly absurd image that strikes a little at T. H. White's descriptions of Merlyn in The Once and Future King. The character dialogue is full of fun back-and-forth, spiced up by hilarious descriptions of and demonstrations of a magical world that we and Harry know little about at first. Having said that, Rowling rarely offers a line with the kind of poetry that we can find in The Once and Future King, or Gaiman's A Graveyard Book, or Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. And there are moments of dialogue that falter a bit in creative description, such as when a shocked Harry simply repeats, over and over again, the last word Hagrid says, without any trace of narrative irony. But if she sometimes falters, her writing and wit are mostly consistent.Depth of Concept: 4/10.This isn't where Harry Potter shines. It's a coming-of-age story, told lightheartedly and without any particularly special insight into what makes a young boy tick. In that respect, it feels inferior to the graceful, sometimes sophisticated touch that Gaiman uses with a much simpler story in the The Graveyard Book, or what White does with brilliantly fleshing out a legend about a young Arthur. Still, there are those who would argue that Rowling includes a lot of social commentary, alluding to stratified class systems and social prejudices, peer pressures and social anxieties. They'd be right. Rowling's treatment of those themes is nothing very surprising, but still pleasantly satirized. For kids that may be enough, but it didn't make this adult think overly much. There's nothing so ambiguous, harrowing, yet mind-expanding as what you might find in Lois Lowry's The Giver, for instance. Or as intellectually sophisticated as what you'd find in Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass. Or as emotionally honest about broken homes as what you'd find in Jerry Spinelli's Maniac Magee. Yet, inasmuch as Harry Potter became the bestselling series of all time, and the films based on it became the bestselling film franchise of all time, I think there's room to consider why the Potter story line struck such a chord with the public as a whole, and not merely children. I think it has more to do with the writing quality, the world-building, and the pacing, but I'm open to suggestions otherwise.Rounded Characters: 5/10.The characters are sometimes charicaturish, but inasmuch as they stand for a certain archetype, they typically do so with a flair that makes them a whole lot of fun. And while many characters are not particularly real, they are very rarely flat. Unfortunately, Harry Potter himself is one of the less-interesting characters in the novel, and can't be said to achieve particularly insightful growth over the course of the novel. I've not read the other books in the series, and I know there are those who will say that the growth is there if you'll just read them through to the end . . . but since Rowling released it as a stand-alone book, that's how I've read it. When I have more time, I'll probably finish the series. But not right now.Well-Developed World: 7/10.Although Rowling borrows liberally from the lore of many other great fantasy writers, and generally from a slew of different myths and legends, she combines together such a delicious and eclectic smattering of magical elements and creatures that the result is a really original expression of a magical world. And the transition between the regular world of Muggles and the magical world of wizards is done with impressive smoothness. In many books that create a whole other world and society, less capable authors have failed to create the sense that there is anything beyond the immediate settings that his or her characters are involved in. Rowling is not so limited, and it's always a fun anticipation to see what new aspect of the world we will see next. This, I think, combined with Rowling's consistently witty voice, really make the book shine.Page Turner: 9/10.Rowling hits the perfect pace in this novel. It's just right for any reader starting at about eight years old, and it makes for a fast-paced but still pleasurable experience for an adult. If Rowling didn't score high in a few other areas (writing quality, well-developed world), this wouldn't matter so much, but I think that her really spot-on pacing allows both kids and adults to launch into the story and barely come up for a breather until the end; it is just so packed full of fun little gems, new settings, and off-kilter descriptions.Kept Me Thinking: 4/10.Not particularly, I was having too much fun rushing through the story.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 6/10.I might consider scoring this higher, but I think that it doesn't quite make it past fun and into really meaningful, which I typically hope for even in novels for young people (I mentioned some that are quite meaningful: The Giver, Maniac Magee, The Golden Compass). Terry Pratchett, for instance, is sometimes able to get a little more meaningful despite his silliness, whether through some surprisingly poignant character interactions, or through really intelligent farce and satire. With Pratchett, there are moments when I am honestly moved, and I can't say the same for Rowling's first novel. In less humorous novels, I see people like Susan Cooper (The Dark Is Rising series) developing a greater sense of purpose and maturation in her characters. And Rowling just doesn't quite match Gaiman's poetic prose. But as a diversion for an afternoon, to fill the time on a boring car or plane ride, or while on the pot, it works just fine. And I have to say, that I'd much rather read these with my daughter, as she gets older, than the Babysitters' Club.As a final note, I want to be clear that I am judging Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on its own merits, and not in its relation to the series as a whole (which I have not yet completed). This review considers a single novel (that's the way it was first released, after all!), and I concede that as I read further books, my appreciation for the series as a whole may evolve from what I gathered from this gateway book to the series. Eventually I hope to read and rate each subsequent book individually, and perhaps the series as a whole.See my profile web page for an expanded review."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"the book was much too childish. I suppose it would be good for children, but it seems even too babyish for them. The main characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are good, and therefore, only do good things, and in the end triumph. Whereas bad guys such as Draco and his henchmen do bad things for the simple reason because we see them as bad. The lack of background history and description, along with the poor dialogue, is what destroyed this book. Not a single character in this book has sliding qualities, they're either good or bad...good because they help Harry, bad because they punish him or stop him from something.The book, for the most part, is without plot. While I was reading this I asked myself, is anything here going to happen or will it just be a series of events?As good as it is to have kids reading, there is much better literature out there for them. Books that don't teach children that if you sneak around and break rules, you shall be rewarded. I don't know about most people, but when Harry does get punished (which doesn't happen often), I'm all for it; he deserves what he gets more often than not.So why three stars? Simply put, there are some funny moments, and Diagon Alley was one of the only magical places in the entire book. And the sinister character at the end was quite unexpecting.I suppose you could choose this book to introduce your children into literature, and then work them up to better written and thought out tales: The Hobbit, Redwall, and The Chronicles of Narnia. Or just save your money and skip the series altogether. IF you have read literature by any other authors though, I wouldn't venture down the road to Hogwart's."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is part of a series of books which are all being made into movies because they are excellent fictional books.Harry Potter, the main character, lived with humans or \\"muggles\\" for the early part of his life. Until one day when an owl delivered him a letter telling him to go to \\"Hogwarts,\\" which is a school for wizards and witches. From then on Harry was an excellent, well known wizard.This book is for people with imagonation since there are many akward situations in it. For example a \\"three headed dog\\" or \\"invisibility cloak\\" which made Harry invisable whenever he put it on. That is why i believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great book.

He's the hero who stopped the dark lord.Harry then gets drop off at his Aunt's and Uncle's house by Albus Dumbledore. Harry is less than famous at Privet Drive. In fact, he's close to being invisible in the Dursley household. He never gets any mail, doesn't have any friends, and his life is pretty much miserable under the stairs where he lives. All that chages when Harry gets a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry finds out that he is a wizard, and his parents were wizards (duh!).And so, Harry goes to Hogwarts.

There's no kid on the planet who, at one time or another, didn't feel like he shouldn't belong to his family, or wish that there was something special about him and that someone someday would take him away and show him a whole new world. And that's exactly what happens to Harry Potter.In addition to kids being able to identify with Harry Potter, the book's full of great, believable characters and wonderful adventures. Some of them reminded me a lot of some older Ronald Dahl books I've read. Both Rowling and Dahl are masters of explaining strange new worlds, and making us believe that they really could exist. For those of us who love weirdness, this is great.I have to say, my favorite part of this book was the end. Without giving anything away, I will say that Rowling manages to slip in some great lessons and some touching, tear-jerking moments. Not sure I would have cried over the same parts when I was young, but now that I'm old, I understand why some of those touching moments are so poignant.Not just for kids, and a great read all around."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 5th grade student at Waldron Mercy Academy.I dialike Harry Pottere and the Socerer's Stone because there is no ACTION until the very end of the story.The setting is mostly in the UK and a school where Harry goes.

I really did not care for this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has fast taken over the world of children's literature, and does not show immediate signs of stopping. A question has popped into my head on many occassions, What's so different and wonderful about this series? I don't quite see how it has anything creative or original to offer. Sure the characters are likeable and friendly, but on a younger child's level, not at all for kids older than 12. J.K. Rowling's writing style is nondescriptive and I feel as if there are wide gaps between the words where descriptive adjectives should go. Unlike other fantasy novels, there is also no sense of history or background to Rowling's story. No rich tapestry of magical and mythological history that makes fantasy books seem so real and developed. After reading the books, I still fail to see how these novels have become such an international phenomenon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I know that this is an enormously popular series, and I've tried quite hard to like it (I have read all the books), but I can't get past the copious shortcomings of Harry Potter. For one thing, it's terribly overwraught; the supreme clumsiness and obviousness with which the writer tries to manipulate our emotions is totally laughable. In fact, I can't believe that even children fall for it. Not to mention the fact that there is no room for humanity is any of the \\"villains\\". None of them are shown to have any redeeming features at all; they are so one dimensional that they might as well be called \\"bad guy one\\", \\"bad guy two\\" and so on. Nor is there ever any opportunity for them to be forgiven or to be allowed to make amends. The story very much promotes an \\"us and them\\" attitude among the heroes. Even when one of the bad guys offers to make up he is rejected by Harry. Also, it promotes kids lying and stealing to get what they want (the end oh-so justifies the means); it encourages cliquiness and a ruthlessness towards opponents (win at all costs!). This is certainly nothing new, and neither is the advocation of disrespect and disobedience towards authority, but it grates just the same.The writing and plot themselves are terribly derivative. There are many far more intelligent and original books out there for children.All in all, I'd not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"that book is the most boring i have ever read in my life.i regret that i read it and i suggest everybody not reading it.reading that book is absolutely waste of time !!!(...)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This supposed \\"original\\", \\"amazing\\" books are nothing more than piles of junk.First off, the characters are paper thin, extremely predictable and disgustingly stereotypical. Take, Dudley for example - how many books have you read with a fat kid as the evil person, some greedy jerk! Maybe have an ORIGINAL story and have the overweight kid be the main character of a story some time! And Hermione, she's a geek the exact stereotype of a girl! Supposed to be smart and preppy and always attentive in class, it sickens me! Also the characters had no demension, I felt no feelings when Sirius died and simply thought 'wow thats nice', not how I was 'supposed' to like some authors manage to make me.Also the plot was completely ripped off as well. Pathetic, Rowling couldnt even come up with her own ideas. She stole bunches of ideas from other, MUCH more quality pieces of literature, twisted and warped them to make you think its good writing. Take Aragog for example, how about Tolkien's Shelob? Or the dementors, what ever happened to Tolkien's Black Riders? In the prototypes for the Lord of the Rings, Gandalf was named 'Dumbledore'. More then just a coincidence, and I dont think it was Tolkien, considering his books were written about 50 years before Rowling's trash. Or how about the bodyless evil? Wasnt Sauron from Tolkien's story a bodyless evil that couldnt take a human form? So where'd Voldemort come from? More then half of the plot ideas came from Tolkien's amazing work, not her own head.This book along with the rest of the series, is a weak, pathetic imitation of literature that doesnt even deserve to be called a book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Call me crazy,but I just didn't like this book.I thought it moved rather slowly.

It's not the best, and the best character, i believe, is actually HEDWIG!!!! I really do love hedwig, and i'm glad that JK Rowling made her up because the book would be NOTHING. They use the word \\"muggle\\" in a lot of books, and i'm not sure if it's her stealing OTHER people's ideas, or if it's other people stealing HER ideas. Anyway, i resent this book except for the parts with hedwig because a mail-carrying owl is so much more magical than the beginning of the book, even though the beginning IS magical. (I was even hedwig for halloween)!Well, I just saved you. I despise this book, and i only recommend it if you enjoy leafing through the book and finding lovely parts about hedwig. I still think HEDWIG is the best character, and all the humans are just...mostly fake.

It's among the worst I've ever read.Though poorly written, the main problem is the poor morality. Harry \\"hates\\" all of his enemies, for one thing. What kind of a message is that sending out?Then there's the lying thing. Harry saves the world by telling a lie, and gets lots of points for his house, therefore winning the school cup. Although it may not be such a bad thing to tell a lie to save the world, HELLO! This is fiction. J.K. Rowling could have found a better way for Harry to save the world.(Let's not even go into the gross aspects of the book, like vomit-flavored candy, which, I suppose, is supposed to be considered humerous.)The overall message of the book is that if you're smart and brave enough you can break the rules, lie, cheat, cast spells on the people you dislike, and all the rest, without any danger of being thought of as bad.One last note to all those people who say it's no different than \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or the Narnia books--THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. Only the bad characters in those books do bad things. In Harry Potter, the good characters also do bad things."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I cut and pasted the title from the Web Page at Amazon presenting this title because it's the best review .While my rating would be 4 or 5 stars if I was 9 to 12 , it is 1 star as an adult fantasy reader .I didn't need to read this book to know that it would be inadequate at all levels .After having read it , I found it worse than what I imagined .This review is mainly meant to be a warning for adult readers , knowledgeable in fanatasy who like their plot complex , their characters believable , the style rich and the world consistent .Aka J.R.R.Martin , T.Williams , S.Donaldson , S.Erikson ...If you spent the last 2 years on another planet and ignore H.Potter , continue to do happily so .If you have money to waste to see how bad it is , buy randomly any of the 5 or 6 and you'll not come back .And especially if you read a review saying that a fantasy book is ALMOST as good as H.Potter , stay away from it at any price !The style of H.Potter is , let's say simple .The dialogues are at best ridiculous .The plot ... well there is no plot to speak of .The characters are a mix of Donald Duck , Big Bad Wolf and Peter Pan .There is no consistent background to the story .There is one thing that saves it from utter mediocrity though - a feeble attempt at humour (T.Pratchett does it of course infinitely better) .Now to avoid misunderstandings .While these books are comics level style and inadequate for an adult fantasy reader , they are very adequate for children wishing an introduction to fantasy litterature that goes beyond Snow White and the Seven Dwarves .It has all the advantages - it's easily understood , has likable children heroes , fairy tale style , big characters on small pages and a happy end .Most importantly as children have little patience , it can be read very fast - in general it's over in 3 to 5 hours depending on how quick the child can read .Of course Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is also a good introduction to fantasy litterature for children ."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, you can't please everyone. I decided to try this book because of its phenomenal success and popularity. I can now say that I have read it and I found it a dull affair. Rowling is not a good writer. The book is episodic and the narrative doesn't really move along. While everyone else praises the book for its display of imagination, I didn't find one novel idea or incident in it. The wit was weak, the characters one dimensional, the plot uninteresting. Rowling has taken fictional bits and pieces from dozens of other children's books and whipped up a stew out of them which lacks originality and force. More grievously, there is an emptiness behind it all. A book for very, very easily entertained (and not very literate) children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As usual, wonderful bit of work.

The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews, so I will not address them.I purchased all four books over two years ago, but they sat on my shelf unread. Then, I was away from home without a book, and a friend loaned me her copy of The Sorcerer's Stone. Within two weeks, I read all four books. Why?J. K. Rowlings captures the imagination with prose that draws her readers in. Details that are not in the movie, such as Harry's hair that stayed one length no matter how often it was cut, which showed that he was a wizard, but did not know it.* He was different from his peer group; isolated in a world of Muggles. Children often feel isolated and mistreated, as do adults, therefore most people can relate to this situation.* He is an orphan who believes his parents died in a car crash, and he has no pictures of them. He longs to belong, an emotion that is common in all ages.* His room was a closet under the stairs, he never received gifts or a kind word, and was viewed as something to get through by his guardians. In reality, anyone treated like this is abused. Yet Harry kept a positive attitude, and enjoyed the privacy the room gave him. He made the best of bad circumstances.* His cousin was a pampered slob, but he was created by his parents' overindulgent behavior. He received 36 presents for his birthday, but it was not enough. Things do not replace guardianship.* Harry, small for his age, was the object of ridicule. Magic delivered him. Who does not dream of a magical solution to their problems? This is a writer's tool known as \\"deus ex machina\\" or \\"God out of a machine.\\"* Commonly, in editing, this is the \\"hand of God\\" tool. It is generally used in an unconvincing plot, character, or event, however, Rowlings success is because she foreshadowed the magic as part of Harry's character through the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.* Using this plot device \\"whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object\\" is a writer's tool.Other aspects of the writing itself are:* Rowlings does not talk down to her audience of young adults.* The same story elements that appeal to a child, appeal to an adult; and the book is unique and readable.* Her characters grow, change, and make decisions based on their own motives.* Life is not simple; people do die.* Good and evil exist, as they do in reality, in many guises.* She takes time to set up the characters, plot, and scenes. I wondered why she dedicated so many pages to Privet Drive. This introduced Harry, and because we know how he is treated, we know why Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry immediately becomes his home. He was wanted.* It is easy to read. The text flows naturally, even with strange words and unusual names.* Her creativity and descriptions bring life to the story, and you want to know what happens next.Rowlings did not expect her marvelous story to capture readers from all age groups. She was surprised to be compared to L.Frank Baum who wrote the Wizard of Oz.Now I, like million of J. K. Rowlings fans from all over the world, anxiously await the next book. Thus, Harry Potter, became a household word.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first bought this book due to the asking of my 8 year old cousin. I hadnt heard much about the series and was truly interested. Of course, I read the book, in a day and was truly fascinated with the tale. Luckily enough for me, I had bought this first book when the other books were already out so I didnt have to wait long to read the sequels. So far I have loved them all and have bought them as gifts for all my younger cousins and godchildren. I see no evilness in these books as some people say. They are simply about a boy who is looking for something better in his life, and he is given it. I think the agony he goes through living with his Aunt and Uncle are more troublesome, more devestating to youngsters than his trials at the wizardly school. People who demean this book and the rest of the series, stating it is Satanic or whatnot, are simply looking for something to complain about. I teach high school, and I am making my 9th grade class read the series...it may seem a little young for their tastes but they are enjoying it, just as I did. It is simply a series for the entire family, with no evilness intended. I will continue to share the world of Harry Potter with my family, friends and students, for as long as possible. Everyone has a fantasy - a dream, and Harry Potters was fullfilled. He is living the life he so dreamed of living, and I see nothing wrong with that. The fact that he has to battle *demons* is something we do everyday, only they are portrayed so realistically, although they do much more damage. This is...as I said earlier...just a wonderful family book - series. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a fantasy of the order of such great authors as Roald Dahl (MATILDA), C.S. Lewis (THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE), and Madeleine L'Engle (A WRINKLE IN TIME). Simply put, this book is a classic and a masterpiece of children's fantasy.This book introduces us to Harry Potter, who lives with his nasty relatives the Dursleys. His life changes one day when he receives a letter from Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- he's not normal, he's a Wizard! From there we are introduced to myriad kooky and endearing characters: friends Ron and Hermione, big buddy Hagrid, professors Dumbledore and McGonagall, enemies Snape, Draco, and Vol...

This book includes everything one could wish in a fantasy: interesting characters, a strong tension between good and evil, plenty of mystery, dramatic twists-and-turns, and a bit of magic.This book is a must-read for kids and adults alike. It's imaginative, clever, and a good read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes, This is a wonderful book for your children. The hero has character.

It has characters that readers love, and can believe. The story about a kid who finds out he is a wizard intriges younger readers, while older(and younger) readers can also enjoy the story and its jokes, but will want to read back to find the little clues Joanne Rowling drops about the story's major secret, and read up on some of the history of names etc. These things make the story interesting at mutliple levels."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Most decidedly curmudgeonly! Yes, that's it. One of the few remaining people on the planet who hadn't read any of the Harry Potter novels and, like Vernon Dursley, my initial reaction to all this wizard and magic rubbish was a very mugglish \\"stuff and nonsense\\". I admit it. As I read the first few pages, my initial thoughts were that this was all quite silly. Where had this Harry Potter phenomenon come from and what did everybody see in it?But then, very quickly actually, JK Rowling, undoubtedly a graduate of Hogwarts herself, began to weave a most hypnotic magical spell and I was hooked. Transported to that child-like garden of delights at Hogwarts - a land of fantasy, witches, warlocks, trolls, spells, potions, charms and, for the readers, total enjoyment and smiles - I fell in love with Harry, Hermione, all of their Gryffindor classmates, and with Dumbledore's paternal wisdom and I cheered wildly as Harry, the team seeker, dove and swooped in quest of the Snitch during their quidditch matches.There is a benefit, of course, to having waited so long to read my first Harry Potter novel, you know. I've got six to go and now I can pick them up, one after another, just as quickly as I want to with no waiting for years at a time for the next book to be published. Eat your hearts out everyone! I claim membership in the legion of Rowling's happy fans.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After the constant media bombardment - Harry Potter here, Harry Potter there, I couldn't stand it any longer, decided to find out what this is all about and ordered all four books. This was a risk, if I didn't like the first book, I would have bought three books in vain and wasted a lot of money (I ordered the hardcover editions). But the risk paid off, I loved this book. After the first two chapters, which were interesting but not particulary outstanding, I had my first encounter with Mrs. Rowling's brillant and never-ending imagination. I'm talking about the &quot;letters which have a very, very precise address&quot; (readers of this book will know what I mean, I don't want to spoil it for the others), a simply wonderful idea, and from there, I was completely hooked. As many readers here only pointed out that they liked the book but not why, I'm trying to get a little bit more into detail. First, I'm an adult reader (yes, one of those who are not supposed to read childrens' books - give me a break) and was astonished that a surprisingly high number of adult readers posting reviews here are 28 years old. As I was astonished, you can easily guess my age.. Back to the book. What makes it such a great read? Well, the plot is cleverly constructed, extremely fast-paced and features a surprising amout of clever twists and turns. You're one of those who always knows what will happen next? Try this one, you will be surprised! The reader encounters a huge array of wonderful and loveable characters (too many to mention here), so wonderful in fact that you even start to like some of the &quot;villains&quot; (it would be a shame to loose, f. ex. Professor Snape) and is deeply immersed in a universe (well, a school) that is so detailed and so well conceived that it is simply impossible not to love it. The prose and style are ok and always appropriate (making it far better than those of other people who also sell millions of copies; no, no names here, I don't want to be dragged into a court). So, adult reader, what are you waiting for? You get everything you expect from a great book - and more, including a slam-bang, very imaginative and satisfying grand finale. Yes, sure, Mrs. Rowling did not re-invent the wheel, but she makes all the elements that she borrowed from countless other fables look fresh - and that is no small accomplishment, making her clearly stand out. This is not a success-story conceived by some marketing people or based on pure luck and I dare to say, even though it might make some people flinch, quality prevails! Well, I don't know if she is a &quot;story-telling genius&quot; like some of the book-covers say, but she is a natural storyteller with an abundance of talent, so again, her success was not based on pure luck, it had to happen. As an adult, I was enthusiastic about this book, I can't even imagine what it would be like if I would have read this book as an eleven-year-old, I think I would have gone completely nuts. What qualifies this book as a children's novel? Only four things: The absence of sex (come on, the main protagonist is eleven years old!) and overt violence (which would be out-of-place in this novel anyway), that the main characters are children (who cares?) and that the book-covers are aimed at children (if you're ashamed to be seen with one of those, just buy the adult editions). All the other elemnts can and will be enjoyed by adults, too. The only people to whom I cannot recommend this book are those who prefer &quot;ultra-realistic&quot; dramas, they will have problems with wands, spells and owls delivering the mail. To anyone else whose imagination is still intact, try this, you will not be disappointed. After closing this book, I immediately picked up book two, so if you're interested if it is as good as this one, check my review there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First off, I may not be exactly the demographic that you would think would read this book, or even give it a glance. After all, I am 20 years old, I listen to hip hop and alternative, and my favorite movie of all time happens to be none other than Scary Movie. So why should I care about a book that features a little boy who runs around with his friends casting charms and flying around on his broomstick? Hardly seems worth wasting my precious time.I have heard the name Harry Potter for a couple of years now, watching the evening news and the top story focusing on the mobs of people in line to buy the new novels whenever they are released. I used to laugh at those stories, while feeling sorry for all the grown adults wasting their time reading children's fairy tales. About one month ago, while I was sitting in a chair at my local movie house, I saw a movie trailer that featured the brought-to-life Harry Potter and his adventures. I thought to myself it looked interesting, and maybe I should give the book a try. Two weeks after that, my sister came to visit me and my parents on her way to Chicago. She showed me her collection of all four Harry Potter novels, and told me that I should give them a try. I then proceeded to tell her about seeing the trailer, and my burgeoning interest in Harry Potter. She wasn't finished with the latest novel, but she left me the first three for me to read. It took me a couple of days to get around to start reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but once I did I was hooked.Raised for the first ten years of his life by ordinary people without any magical abilities, otherwise known as Muggles, Harry Potter lives in a world where technology and science rules. Everyone drives automobiles to get from one location to the next, use telephones to communicate to each other, and where everyone is unaware that living among them is a whole society of beings who use magic in place of technology to improve their quality of life. Harry knows nothing of this hidden world, nor does he know anything about how his forgotten past links him to it. He lives a life of misery, mistreated by his aunt and uncle, and tormented by his sadistic cousin. They despise anything that has to do with magic, and do not want Harry corrupted like his wizard parents were. So when it is discovered that Harry has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his aunt and uncle are not pleased. What follows for several more chapters is an interesting first look at the world Harry has been denied his whole life, full of wizards, witches and spells, dragons and gold fortunes. His first year at Hogwarts will be rewarding for him in so many ways, yet scary and full of mystery. He makes new friends, but develops enemies. Yet overcoming all that is the human spirit, good against evil, which is what really this book is about.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is so much more than a magical fantasy or children's fable, it contains within it's pages the very fabric of imagination and wonder that we adults thought we lost. This novel is a very easy read, yet complex enough to keep adults interested to the last page and beyond. J. K. Rowling does a fantastic job of bridging the gaps between childhood and adulthood, childlike imagination and grown up realities. One is never to keen when first reading this, for we are entering a fantastic new world, unexplored and unknown by us, the same as Harry Potter is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a school teacher who has been hearing all about the Harry Potter craze.

Now, she is a household name along with millions of dollars, or pounds since she's English. She never guessed that one little book would bring her this much success, but Harry Potter has become one of modern literature's newest classics. The story goes that Harry is an orphan who has been growing up with his aunt and uncle, who both despise him, but he can't understand why. One day, a man shows up and tells Harry that he's a wizard, and what's more, one of the most famous wizards in the world. When Harry was young, he stopped the worst dark wizard of them all, Lord Voldemort, and almost killed him. Now Harry has been invited to attend Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to hone his skills. When he arrives, many adventures await him, including the hatching of a dragon, a chance to play on his dorm's Quidditch (wizard sport) team, and a game of chess where he is one of the pieces. This book isn't just for kids, my entire family loves these stories, and I guarantee you will too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't blame this book for being popular.

Since there are already many reviews outlining the plot, I will just say how much I enjoyed it. Definitely a Childrens classic that adult's will enjoy as well. I do have a couple of quibbles though. Harry's treatment at the hands of the Dursley's seems very far-fetched. I know that this is a common theme in children's fantasy, but it's a little overdone. Secondly, Quidditch makes no sense at all, neither the concept(why just have one seeker, when you could have six?) or the fact that an assembly line broomstick (the nimbus 2000) should give one an advantage(shouldn't it be magical and athletic skill?)But, all on all an excellent book (and the movie was good too!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I gave Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J.K.Rolling five stars because it was exciting and interesting. Harry sometimes gets himself into trouble but then he gets himself right back out. My favorite part was when Hagrid met the family that was hiding on the island. I thought that that was very funny. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was the best book that I have ever read I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 51 year old man, and I would never have believed that I would love what are classified as Children's Books. To say I was delightfully surprised would be an understatement. I had actually purchased the audio tapes, which by the way, the narrator was also the \\"evil villian\\" in Pete's Dragon, and his abilities gave the story a depth that you miss by simply reading the book. Well, my family and I were on a long vacation trip by car, and as soon as we could, we purchased the remaining books on tape and listened to them (Book 4 after we returned home). We were \\"convoying\\" with another couple, and as soon as we would stop somewhere, we would give them the tapes we finished and they would listen to them. Later we purchased the books and read them, and being able to recall the voices the narrator used on tape was enjoyable. If you saw the movie, it was great if you read the book (though not even close to the depth of the book). Bottom line is, get this book and see what I mean. Obviously, you could read the books in any order (the author attempts to fill you in about things that happened in the other books as needed), and I believe Book 4 to be the best of the group (and also the longest), but I recommend reading them as they were intended. I truly can't see you going wrong purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling hit on a winner with the Harry Potter series of books. If one thinks this is a kid's book then you are much mistaken. Rowling has tapped into the child within us all and produced a wonderful work of fiction that leads us into a world of witches, spells, dragons, broomsticks, airborne sports and the subduing of the evil force of Voldemort.Harry Potter thought he was just an ordinary little orphan boy living in a slightly dysfunctional family, the Dursleys, in middle class Britain. Then a letter arrives by owl. Then lots of letters arrive and keep coming until the Dursleys have to answer the summons of Harry to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is spirited away by the kindly Hagrid to what seems to be a parallel world unseen by average humans. After being kitted with the prerequisites of wand, pet owl, and broomstick etc Harry boards the Hogwart's Express on platform 9 at King's Cross station. Along the way he befriends Ron and unwillingly they follow the deliciously precocious Hermione, witch in training, extraordinaire.This book is easy and delightful to read. The characters are rich and lovable, containing an innocence only found in childhood. The story revolves around Harry who soon comes to realise that he is after all a very special boy with hidden talents that elevate him to a high status within the world of witches and wizards. The setting of Hogwarts is reminiscent of the British boarding school with a light twist and kindly teachers and just a hint of suspicious happenings in the figure of one teacher. Rowling has tapped into all that delights children of all ages in food, magic, role models, sports, and fantasy. The plot rolls with a charming tale of dragons, trolls, a magic mirror, a cloak that makes one invisible, and a boy who triumphs over adversity.Rowling has left the book open to sequels and leaves the reader wanting more. This reader could not put the book down. It is enjoyable to children and pure escapism for adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone by J.K. Rowling is a thrilling and a very adventurous book. If you haven?t read it already, then read it. It is about a boy named Harry Potter, who encountered very dangerous things throughout his childhood. He was the only one who didn?t get killed by the most evil wizard, Voldemort, when he was a baby. His mother and father got killed by Voldemort. So he had to stay with his non-magical aunt and uncle. They hid the secret of Harry being a wizard.One day something happened that would change his life. The secret was revealed. He now knew the story of his childhood and was off to a school that would make his a real wizard. Read this very great book that puts pictures in your mind. You will want to read this book over and over again. Now, what will happen at his school? What dangers will he again encounter? Find out by reading this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is wonderful for children. It provides a wonderful and beautiful and descripitve story that is fit for CHILDREN.At my [local store]there were 16 year old kids reading this book. Teachers say that this book has been instrumental in getting kids to read but I ask you is this the best they could do? I mean its wonderful that this books have been such a big success and that J.K Rowling brought her own castle. I read this book to see what the entire fuse was about, this is not the greatest kids novel of all time. That honor still lies with either the Hardy Boys or The Boxcar Children.Harry Potter is NOT a conspiracy used by Satan to attract younger members to his cause. Let me say again that these are Children's books for anyone on either side to get keyed up about them is laughable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The story of Harry Potter is fast becoming one of the best-known stories in children's or young adult literature. The stories have caught on like wildfire and Harry's now famous face-- complete with lightning bolt scar and thick, black rimmed glasses with tape-adorn everything from figurines to bookmarks, coffee mugs to tee shirts. It has become a marketing phenomenon unlike anything else seen before.The REASON for the popularity for Harry and his friends is because the book is excellent. Lousy book characters may make an appearance on the side of the Taco Bell large soda cups, but their time in the limelight is short lived, indeed. Harry Potter is different. In a way that few other books have done, Potter is able to cross the boundaries of age, class, race and gender and be immediately likable to almost everyone who picks the book up. As a school librarian and reading teacher, I have drawn in even the most reluctant readers into reading through the Potter books. I have even had students as young as third grade attacking \\"Goblet of Fire\\" with absolute gusto--a book that is roughly the thickness of a telephone directory, weighing in at 734 pages in hardback.The reason, of course, is because the books are GOOD, each one getting progressively better and a bit more complicated than the last. Ms. Rowling is able to weave minor and major plot twists around and through the main plot of the story with the skill of a master storyteller. This is not easy to do without loosing the reader when the target age for Potter books is usually less than 15 years of age. Perhaps it is BECAUSE of some of these subplots that readers are especially drawn in-- they always somehow merge into one another in wonderful and unexpected ways. If there ever were books that you kept reading just to find out what would happen next, these would be the ones.With over 3,000 reviews as of this writing, there's little else I can add that hasn't been said before. Harry Potter is a young boy living with his aunt and uncle, the Dersley's, who are perhaps the WORST characters in modern children's literature since Roald Dahl's \\"The Twits\\". Harry's aunt and uncle shower affection on their own son, Dudley (who is best described in later works as \\"a great blithering git\\"), while ignoring Harry as much as humanly possible. We find out why the no-nonsense aunt &amp; uncle despise Harry so much when a mysterious letter from Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft arrives informing Harry that he is to begin his secondary education there.It turns out that Harry's parents, powerful wizards, were killed by the most evil wizard in history, Lord Voldemort (often referred to as \\"you-know-who\\", so feared is even his name). Voldermort attempted to kill Harry too when Harry was still a baby, but somehow-- though no one yet understands how-- it backfired and all but destroyed Voldermort himself. Meanwhile, years later as Harry joins other students at Hogwarts, there are rumors afoot that Voldermort himself is regaining power and plans to come back to finish what he started and ring in a new age of unparalleled evil.Filled with fantastic creatures and odd characters, including the lovable giant of a man, Hagrid (who has a penchant for dangerous creatures, such as dragons), \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the excellent beginning to a deeply engrossing series. Most people I talk to about this book, child, teen or adult, devour these books and immediately take up the next one. Those who have read all four books in the series are often seen gloomily slouching about, waiting for the next installment (I include myself into this swarthy horde as well).Riveting, complex and wonderfully entertaining, \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" is sure to delight all ages and tastes. If you've not yet begun on this series, then by all means DO!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In actuality, the thing is that my Aunt Laura practically forced me to read the Harry Potter series and she said that she *knew* I would like 'em. But, for about four months I refused to even pick up a Harry Potter book based on the fact that I thought they looked childish.Yet, when I finished &quot;Blindsided&quot; by Clyde Phillips I had to pick from three different books - The first in the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, or Make Believe by Joanna Scott.So, what I did was I read the first few pages of each book and, before I even got to another book, I was head over heels in the Harry Potter book! I couldn't put it down! &quot;Childish&quot; - Hah! The books are *so* adorable and are amazing! I love them!The characters are extremely realistic, the fantasy parts of the book are so detailed and wonderfully written that you wouldn't be surprised if they were real!So, I finished book 1 yesterday and all I can say is.. buy it! If you're contemplating on buying it, get it. No matter what age you are, you'll love this/these book(s). They may be under the &quot;Children's Books&quot; category but, they're anything but children's books. My aunt, who's 53 and my mom who's 49 *love* these books and are eagerly awaiting the 5th book! Get this/these book(s), you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit, I was very reluctant to read the Harry Potter books because of the hype surrounding them. However, where there is a lot of hype, sometimes there is a reason.Harry Potter's world will bring out the child in any reader. I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in a few reading hours. I must say, it captured my imagination, and made me feel like a kid again!Because Harry thinks he is just like everyone else, he is a lovable character, that has integrity and grace. Not like most heros, Harry doesn't always win. That doesn't mean that Harry won't come out ahead.Harry's world at Hogwart's School of Magic is every kid's dream. I had always been fascinated with magic as a child, and this book delves into that fascinating world filled.I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will remain my favorite Harry Potter book if only because it is the book that brings such vivid description to things I had thought I had long ago locked away in my imagination. Walking down Diagon lane was so much fun! Discovering all things magical for the first time was a treat I won't soon forget.Learning all about Harry, his past, and present, provides for an enjoyable ride.Kids, enjoy these books, you will remember them for a long time. Parents, this is the perfect summer read! Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"my son of 32 said, mom thats a childrens book. oops! but he could not pry my ear phones away from me. (love audio books) i'm hoping the next in the series takes up where this one left off. it was very well written for any age and i think the cover should state 6 to 106 years of age. i am a mystery reader and listened to this out of desperation on a long trip by myself, cant wait to get the rest of the series. if you read it, you wont be dissapointed. best book i've read in years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an absolutely wonderful character! I started reading the book with my 7 year old son and quickly found that both he and I were addicted! We managed to finish the Sorcerer's Stone in 1 week reading it after dinner up until bedtime. We actually found that time flew and it was almost impossible to put the book down. We found ourselves feeling sorry for Harry, feeling excited when he met Hagrid and quite anxious when he was faced with the two faced man.J.K. Rowling is an astonishing writer and my hat goes off to her for writing books that can once again bring a family back together. She makes me feel like I am missing something by being a Muggle!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first, I thought Harry Potter was just one of those lame childrens book that people write to make money.... It all started when my sister, Anne(9) left her copy of Harry Potter, on the table, I said,&quot;What the heck, I'm bored.&quot; So I read the back of it and it did sound pretty good so I went ahead and read the first chapter. Boy, did that got me hooked. When I started, I could NOT stop. I mean, literally. My eyes were like glued to the book. I didn't want to leave it incase I missed anything, and ****, I was even on the floor of my kitchen. After that book, I panicked and started going to the store looking for the sequel. I just kept on reading, in the way back home, between classes, and even in the bathtub. Obsessed was what my sisters called me, and they were right. The reason why I was obsessed because I hated reality. I mean, I know you can't escape it, but when I started it, I know that no one can take that away from me. When I was 9, every little detail(whats troubling me, how I feel, and etc..) of what you're surpose to ask your parents, they were never there for me because of work. So I poored it all in books. Whenever I got in a fit, I would say to myself, what would _______ do? And I'd do it. Good and evil was how I used to judge people. Now, I'm more open to how I feel. Sometimes, if I feel like laughing when I'm on a thin rope I would go back to, 'what would Harry/Hermoine/(Ron) do if they were in this kind of mess?'What I'm saying is that if you read this book, its would totally change your way of seeing things. Don't go for my word, there are plenty of people who would say it. I'd this book a million stars if we're aloud. One more thing, &quot;This book has got to be the damn best book I've ever read!&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are amazing. The first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, is about a young boy named Harry who for most of his life, had been living with his aunt and uncle who did not treat him nicely. Then, Harry finds out that he is a wizard and his life changes. This book has a very good story line, and the characters are developed so brilliantly that it is easy to imagine that they are real. I would recommend this book to anyone, even adults, because it is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All I can say is wow. This book transcends age limits.

This wizard, who killed his family, could not kill Harry. The forces of good rejoiced, but fearing to spoil him, left him to be raised by his mean aunt and uncle.It is not hard to imagine that Harry is, or will become, himself a wizard.

Buy this book for your children and for yourself and for your grandchildren.... Senior********************************************************"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; has proved me that the magical powers of its wizards are active outside the fictional realm as well as inside it.My older son Rodrigo, aged eleven, had always disappointed me due to his absolute disinterest for reading. I am a compulsive reader on anything concerning my preferred themes, that is, Science, History and Spirituality. Therefore, I have a large amount of books on those three subjects and I had always dreamed that one of my children would inherit my love for reading.One day, about five months ago, Rodrigo went back from school asking me to buy a book for him. The book was called &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; but his schoolmates just called it &quot;The Harry Potter Book&quot;. I went to a bookstore to see what that book had of so special for my son having asked me to buy it for him.Well, that is the beginning of the story. Rodrigo has already read the three first books of the series and is only waiting for the fourth one to be translated to Portuguese so that he can read it as well.I was so astonished by what had happened that I decided to read the first book myself. So, quite reluctantly, I set aside the book I was reading (&quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, by Stephen Hawking, a superb book) and decided to just take a look at the book that had produced the miracle. I not only took a good look at it, but also have read it to the end. I have already read number two and three as well.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a lovely book. It has the perfect dose of fun, action and mystery so to keep, at the same time, the interest of children, teens and adults. The author succeeds in teaching very well balanced lessons on social behavior, virtue and on the meaning of goodness and wickedness. As someone who has been studying spiritual issues for a long time, as understood by plenty of different traditions, I can also assure that the author has a good idea of the subject. If one views the book as an allegory, some delicate spiritual issues are approached there with wisdom and competence.My most sincere respects and congratulations to J. K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book and I think it's the best ever . If you want a good book to read then buy this book.

Hogwart's is a real place. You're actually with Harry Potter and really feel for him and his friends. This isn't just a book for kids 9-12, it's a book for all ages. Well, maybe really small kids wouldn't understand it, but adults and high school kids will also devour it. I know I did and I'm a Freshman in High School. I'm not very good at describing what it's about, so I'll just tell you it's great. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book had me caught by the second page.

I had to read on!Petunia, Vernon and Dudley are the most Muggle-ish of all Muggles. They treat him like dirt. It's a welcome shock when Hagrid tells him that he's a wizard! I loved it.

Saying that anyone above fourth grade is too old to enjoy this book,that just makes me mad! I am an 8th grader.

Being a college student I was slightly disgruntled to read a child's book. Oh, I was WRONG! I am a very advid fantasy reader and this was a great book! I feel that Harry Potter is a character for all ages. My little sister loves the book while I see all the under tones and meanings. It's really been neat to fine a way to relate to someone 10 years my junior. Also a fine point was that it is such a quick read, it's nice to have a book that you can just fly through and have such a high sense of fullfillment in the end. Great book! I'm getting ready to order the sequel for my sister's birthday (but she won't get it until I've finished)! Thank goodness for crazy parents that can think up some really ridiculous stuff up so their children can't read a book. Condoning witchcraft indeed!

I was warry of the book because it was the hardcover version and was fairly expensive but my Aunt bought it for me. As soon as I started reading I couldn't stop. This book was perfectly written. It says the ages are for 9-12 but I think that everyone who reads this book will enjoy it. This book was perfectly written. It's sure to become the next classic book.

For the most part, it is a pretty typical &quot;school of magicians&quot; book. The characters are engaging, and three-dimensional.However, I feel that Rowling &quot;cheats&quot; too many times. For instance, a number of times she has major characters act in rather uncharacteristic ways in order to move the plot. This is rather disturbing -- especially on the second reading where the reader knows that the reason for the sudden personality change is that the author is being lazy.Also, there is a logic puzzle given in the text, which one of the characters, Hermione, solves. Unfortunately, only PART of the puzzle is shown to the reader -- Hermione knows more than the reader. This is quite unpleasant, since it keeps the readers from solving it themselves. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fine book, which will introduce readers to the world of wizards. But it's written so simply! If you're looking for the same blend of mystery and humor, but at the same time for books that absolutely respect the reader's intelligence, look for The Three Investigators! My kids prefer them--and there are ten of them in paperback now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The debut novel, and what a debut!!

It truly takes a brilliant mind to create an entire new world, with its own history and set of rules, and races and creatures. Granted, not all of it is original, but a great deal is, whatever isn't recreated or enhanced to her own liking.

She said the book is excellent and it is worth for me to read, so she strongly recommends me to read it.I suppose that this book is about a boy who wants to find a sorcerer's stone when I look to the cover of the book. After I read it, I know that I was wrong. Actually, this book is about a boy who is called Harry Potter. He has to sleep under the cupboard which is small, dark for eleven years. How cruel are his uncle and aunt? Also, his fat cousin and his friend always insult Harry. Harry Potter isn&iexcl;t happy for lived with the Dursleys until he knows that he is a wizard.

Every page keeps you totally immersed, I found it hard to put down and got through it in a matter of days. It takes you into a world of complete fantasy and surprises. Every chapter is its own story. What a terrific book, I would recommend it to readers of all ages......you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, I think it's well past time the world's seen a children's book like this one. Captivating, magical, exciting, suspenseful, amusing and interesting are just a small handful of the astonishingly large number of positive adjectives that can be used to describe Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.Unknown before the release of this now universally acknowledged modern-day literary masterpiece, author J.K. Rowling engraved the name of her title character in stone after the book hit stores. After even a few pages it will seem impossible to forget poor Harry Potter, the neglected nephew of tubby Vernon Dursley and his shrill wife Petunia. Rowling wittily plunges readers into a thrilling fantasyland where simple Harry, who is mistreated and made fun of in the \\"muggle\\" world, learns he is not only a talented and promising wizard but a celebrity.But Stardom is not all fun and games. Not only does wizarding work prove hard, but Harry soon learns, like any icon, there are those who adore him and those who don't. Sinister Draco Malfoy, a spoiled boy in Harry's class delights in making Harry feel stupid and tormenting his new found friend, Ron. And suspicious Professor Snape openly hates Harry with apparent passion.But this turns out to be the least of Harry's problems. It soon becomes shatteringly evident that someone else dislikes Harry. Someone far more powerful and dangerous who has been holding a malicious grudge for ten years, and is finally ready to settle the score.As humble Harry Potter becomes every reader's vision of a true hero Rowling's audience realizes that the 'Sorcerer's Stone' is not just an interesting children's book, but a stroke of genius. J.K. Rowling is probably the best author in decades and (in my opinion) one of the best children's writer of all time.Readers will fall in love with this quirky, young wizard and his courageous friends. I have yet to meet anyone who has read this whole book and didn't love it. It's amazing, it's just amazing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sample body"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It never arrived in time for the holiday even though it was ordered in mid November.

Don't waste your energy; you will be deceived and sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's taken me 7 or 8 years to even get around to reading these Harry Potter books. Why? Because the hype totally got on my nerves. Now, just after the sixth book has been released, I've decided to start reading them, just to see what all the fuss is about. Plus I'm sick of people asking me why I haven't read them. It's like I've committed a really godawful crime not to have read these books. What is the big deal? OK, I'm reading them now, but no one's forcing me into it.First of all, I seriously don't know how these people can read these books in one sitting. It took me a few hours over a couple of days to finish this book, and even then, I don't think I could have read it in one sitting. Simply because the entire time I was reading, the book did not have my full concentration. Normally, I can lose myself in a book, forget the world around me, until I finish it, and I also consider myself a fast reader. With this, I was constantly finding distractions. There was something on TV, the phone was ringing, oh I've got to do this, I've got to do that. But I always came back to the book.And I don't know how young kids can read this. I found some of the language really hard, particularly the Hogwarts words used throughout. Some of the names I couldn't even begin to get my tongue round, and some of the concepts JK uses I didn't get myself. Although I do like the idea of having my post delivered by owl. It came across as being a very complicated book to me. I don't think kids would fully understand it, or at least won't understand it properly for a good few years. And as the books have gone on, I've been told they've been more & more aimed at adult readers, than kids.A couple of people have mentioned Harry Potter being similar to other books etc. Most of the time it reminded me very much of the Narnia stories by C.S. Lewis. It was just certain things in the book, particularly going into a different world, and having centaurs - who just seemed to appear out of nowhere. I also know who dies in the latest book (I asked someone), and when they said that, the way that person has been portrayed, who reminds me very, very much, of the last book in the Narnia series 'The Last Battle'. If you haven't read the Last Battle, or the Narnia stories, you're so not going to get what I mean, but if you have, sorry if I've just spoiled it. Or you may not get what I mean.I am going to persevere with the books, even though I didn't really enjoy the first one that much. It got a lot better towards the end, and I actually stayed up later than normal to finish it, and I started the next one the next morning. There has to be something that makes these books so popular, but after the first one, it wouldn't have made me go & read the rest. I'm just waiting to see if it gets better. I definitely don't think I'll be attempting the films anytime soon. I just don't think, from the reviews I've read, and word of mouth, that they transfer well onto film. Particularly since the books have got longer & longer. With the finale in this book, I can't see how it would work on film, although they can do wonders with CGI these days."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone is a good book written by J.K Rowling.

Then on his 11th birthday Harry finds out that he is a wizard and he has been invited to go to Hogwarts a school for witches and wizards.

My wife is an elementary school teacher, and she introduced me to the work of Ms. Rowling. After reading the book, I am prepared to compare the Harry Potter series with Lloyd Alexander's tremendous Prydain series. (For those who enjoy Harry Potter, give &quot;The Book of Three&quot; by Alexander a try.) These two series are truly the upper echelon of children's fantasy writing.Also, as one who has spent time in England, it was a thrill for me to hear of places so dear to my heart. Hagrid's Scottish accent was truly a delight to run through my mind.A good read for all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a brilliantly written and imaginative book that will inspire people of all ages to start reading. It will open a world of creativity for the reader. It may even bring about future writers and their works. As they say, in order to be a writer, you must be a reader. This book is just the piece of writing that will spark future award winning authors' incentives to write. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone also gives you a chance to think, it makes you a detective trying to find the bad guy, while helping the good guys - Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I hope every child will one day be given the opportunity to read this book. I, as well as many others, am looking forward to the fourth book coming summer 2000, and the movie also.

J.K. Rowling's genius is not that she brought these elements together (that we could see every day in the movie theatre or on TV), but that they are dressed in an entirely new way - self-consistent, absorbing, and highly entertaining.This book is the first of the Harry Potter series, where we meet the characters and some of the classic locations for the first time. Harry, the classic Dickensian adopted son, must sleep under the stairs in his aunt and uncle's house, while his cousin has 2 bedrooms: one for himself, one for his toys. Naturally, Harry is the diamond in the rough - his parents were famous witches, and he is a natural with a wand and a broomstick.When he is summoned off to Hogwarts, the best school in England for studying magic, he makes friends and enemies among his classmates and the faculty alike. The book is a re-telling of the standard English Public School tale, simply substituting \\"Hogwarts\\" for \\"Eton,\\" \\"Quidditch\\" for \\"Rugby,\\" and \\"Potions\\" for \\"Chemistry.\\" However, such a simple analysis doesn't do justice to the fun and magic (no pun intended) of the story.This strikes me as an ideal book to read to young children (say, over 5 years old). It's much like a good Disney cartoon - it's enjoyable for the child hearing it, and equally enjoyable for the parent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since I have the privilege of having read the next 3 books before writing this, I can say that this is not the best of the 4. It is, however, a wonderful beginning to an enchanting story of such a magical world. Rowling does an excellent job of defining her characters and giving tantalizing insights into the world of HP. These elements alone make it an enjoyable story; a classic rainy afternoon read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book that people of all ages all over the world can enjoy. Even if you are a person who isn't a big one on reading. When I first started the book I wasn't sure if I would enjoy reading it because it was meant for a younger audience, but as I got farther and farther into the book I found myself having troubles putting it down.It starts off with every child's nightmare about growing up not know your parents and living with your horrible relatives. But unlike most children Harry Potter knows something is missing in his life besides his real family, he knows that there is more to him then a scar on his forehead. The only thing is he doesn't know what is missing. The older he gets the more he wonders until around the time of his 13th birthday he starts to get letters in the mail about a school that his uncle will not let him go to because it is a school called Hogwrats school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The reason Harry's uncle Vernon doesn't want him to go is because Harry's parents were wizards and they died by the hands of another wizard that's how Harry got the scar on his forehead. On Harry's 13th birthday he meets a very strange man named Hadgrid. Hadgrid is the grounds keeper at Hogwarts and an old friend of Harry's parents. Hadgrid ends up taking Harry on a little shopping spree to get all of the supplies he will need to attend Hogwarts. When Harry gets to school he makes many new friends and finds out all about himself and his parents. He goes on many adventures and overcomes lots of obstacles. I would definitely recommend any and every one read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"Harry Potter\\" is an imaginative masterpiece in itself. J.K. Rowling has to be one of the most original and creative authors that I have ever come across. I do not read often, but I decided to choose this book because I had heard positive remarks and endless discussion about this book. Almost every aspect of this book is interesting, it is easy to read and the plot is rather simple. In the beginning of the story, we find out that Harry Potter's parents are killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort. However, Harry survives Voldemort's rampage and his survival brings many questions to society. We later find out that Harry is famous, not because of the notorious lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, but because he is a wizard and holds extensive magical powers. Harry's uniqueness was noticed early, when he held a formal conversation with a snake at the Zoo. My imagination expanded as I read further into the book. A rude giant by the name of Hagrid delivers a personal letter to Harry that invites him to a magical school of wizardry. On the way to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry encounters goblin-owned banks called Gringotts, delivery owls, gold coins called Galleons and many other goblins and ghouls that are unique in their own ways. Harry's curiosity becomes stronger as he witnesses a wizard sport called Quidditch, where students ride on brooms and try to score points with four balls. The school is full of adventure and magical features, including one hundred and forty two staircases with vanishing steps, doors that only open if tickled, and classes taught by ghosts that change desks into pigs. Everything in this book is original and abstract, making every chapter interesting and attracting. Harry continues his adventures throughout the school year and into Christmas. I will not ruin the end of the book because I recommend that you visit a local library or bookstore and get yourself a copy. This book is for all ages and can appeal to anyone. I can't wait to see the movie or read any sequels that J.R. Rowley has written. I am going to look at the author's other works of literature as well because she is an exceptional writer that can write for all ages. If you are looking for excitement, fantasy and adventurous thrills, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a great place to start!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My grandmother doesnt normally like to read, but she read the book on her own. --She loved it! And grandma doesnt like any books. That's proof alone how great this series is. To encourage her, I took her to the see themovie. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE FILM!The movie was so good that i read the book, and the rest of the series. This book is good for all ages alike. If you like to read books with themes of magic, mystery, spells and witchcraft this series is perfect for you. As a historian, i particularly loved the references to historical ad literary figures and things. This made the book interesting on an adult level, the way she included all these allusions.I can't wait until the next book and film are out! If i could give this book more than 5 stars I would."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have tried to avoid the Harry Potter novels for a very long time. Well, my friend finally offered to read one of my favorite series if I would read the Harry Potter series. So, I reluctantly agreed to begin reading. As I was thrown into the world of muggles and wizards, I realized this was like nothing I had been reading. The book was simple, not like others that engross the reader with symbolism and figurative language. But in its simplicity, I found the classic tale of a person struggling to know who he is.Harry Potter is a young boy who lives with his mother's sister's family. They treat him cruelly and lie to him about his parents' death, who were actually killed by a dark wizard named Voldemort. He then learns of his miraculous salvation from Voldemort and his popularity among the witches and wizards. This event begins his search for the truth about himself and his family.Rowling uses this boy's story to convey a larger message to everyone, even adults and teenagers. On boarding the train for Hogwarts, we find that Harry is beginning a new life. Many times we begin new lives by something being revealedd to us just like Harry. Growth seems to be her main message that clearly is shown through how Harry, a timid, lowly boy is transformed into a brave, cunning person who is seen with much integrity.Though slow and boring in some parts of the novel, Rowling's use of imagery creates a suspenseful tale that had me reading chapter after chapter. Its simplicity allows for an easy read, but it also lets the reader, young or old, relate Harry's life with their own."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Recommended by several adult friends, I finally read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", the first of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series. I can see why this, and the succeeding three books in the series have remained on the bestseller lists. J.K. Rowling was indeed gifted with a stellar and creative charm and imagination. Harry, Ron and Hermione share a bond likened to that of Oz's beloved Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tinman and Cowardly Lion. And words like \\"Hogworts\\", \\"muggles\\", and \\"quidditch\\" are considered a part of the English language (not to mention the many languages in which the book has been translated and read all over the world).Perhaps, when originally conceived, Ms. Rowling had children in mind when she wrote \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", followed by the subsequent books in the Harry Potter series. But adults will be equally intrigued and absorbed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You know, I can tell why so many Christians and religious groups hate these books... No really... it's very evil, what with the children having fun, and learning the value of friendship. The main character is especially demonic. Harry has some audacity to willingly leave a home and situation where he is regularly starved, confined, and beaten for a place where he finds friends, love, family, and a past he never knew he had. Seriously, it just reeks of Satan.Honestly, the Harry Potter books are wonderful entertainment for children and adults. I found myself shutting off my inner-cynic while reading, and being carried into a world that is as well-realized as it is fun. Rowling's style is funny, witty, and emotionally moving. I can't wait for book 5, guess I just have to read the first four again. And mark Novemember 15 on your calendars... the Second Movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved it! My brother finally convinced me to let him read this book to me. I wasn't interested at first but Miss Rowling has a way of getting your attention. I couldn't stop listening!

Once you are into one of Ms. Rowling's books, there is absolutely no way to put it down. Harry Potter thinks he is just a normal kid living with his horrid relations, until he gets letters from Hogwarts, the best school around for witchcraft, and wizardry. Whoosh and you're off! To a world of flying broomsticks and evil spirits, you'll find yourself cheering for the house team at the Quidditch match!

If you said yes to any of this... The Harry Potter series will bring home your bacon! These books deal with an abused child who is unaware of his magic ancestry whose parents have been murdered by an evil wizard. Join Harry on a magnificent journey of how he discovers his past and begins school in a magical castle unseen by Muggles (people who don't believe in or can't do magic). This story is unbileavably fun and exciting... not to mention humerous."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" written by J.K. Rowling was one of the best books that I have ever read. The author did a very good job of not having any really slow parts in the book. The book always had the reader wondering what was going to be next and exciting. The symbolism in this book played a huge part. Most everything in the book had more then one meaning. One of the best things about the book is how it's not just for children although that is what it was suppose to be when these books first came out. This book can be read by anyone of all ages. Another reason why this book was a success is that it wasn't all stuffed into one book, and it is spread out into five books.. That just made the reader want to read the books more because the reader wanted to know what was going to happen next. This is another thing that really helped the books be successful. Another thing about this book is how it's fiction. Fiction books are more popular because you can expand your mind to believe anything and also the writer has no restrictions on how to write or what to write. This book will be one that I will remember for the rest of my life because it was a fantastic book. I don't think that I have ever read a book like this, it just grabbed the reader and they didn't want to put it down. It makes the reader want to read the rest of the books right away. This book also expanded your imagination more than anything else has. There were not any flaws in the book at all while reading it. It kept us on the edge of our seat the whole time reading it. I would have to say that this was one of the best books ever written and the next four will probably be just as exciting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"the true name of the book, Harry Potter and the philosophers stone, offers a much better opening then the us. made up sorcerer's stone. I never got why they had to change it. are people in the us. really that afraid of new philosiphies that they cant read the word in a childres book? lol, thats about all i have to say, lol!... this book is excellent. i dont need 1000 words to say that. its as easy as this; this book is excellent! but please do get the british version!! it is so tremendiously much better!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first read this book I read it because many people had told me that it was amazing. So I decided to check it out and when I did I was actually quite surprised. I thought this would be a lame boring story but it actually turned out to be exciting and enchanting!Its a great beginning for a great series. The characters personality's are shown and when you finish the book you can't wait for the second!!Overall: I would definetly reccomend this book. Its fun, enchanting and exciting!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first saw this book at Borders,when I was in forth grade, before Harry Potter became very popular. I was going to buy it, but then opted not to because it was in hardback and I didn't want to spend that much of my allowance on a book. Then two weeks later my 4th grade teacher read it to our class and the entire class was hooked. Can you imagine a class that usually groans when the teacher is going to read aloud, hanging on her every word and begging her not to stop? Well after that I and the rest of my class were hooked. I think it's a spectacular book and series and I reread if frequently. One of the great things about it is every time you read it you find out somthing new. JK Rowling is an awesome writer and deserves all the awards she gets. I also like the fact that she has hidden clues in her writing and if you read between the lines, you can figure out some things.After Harry Potter became popular, my school librarian wanted to ban the book from our school. She said it promoted witchcraft and evil doings. She also convinced some parents that they shouldn't let their children read it. During one library session she told us that she wasn't allowing anyone to check it out. Naturally, our class asked why. She told us her views and I asked her: \\"Have you ever read it?\\" Do you want to know what her answer was? No, she had never read it. I completley dissagree with the views that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft and other awful things. It's a classic good vs evil story. It just so happens that the evil and the good have magical powers. Harry and Dumbledore are the good (Harry being a pretty normal kid, and Dumbledore being a wise wizard), and the evil is a horrible wizard. I think it's one of the best series in the world and a work of genius."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I remember when Goblet of Fire came out and I found out some friends of mine had bought it. Adults reading a children's book, I thought? What on earth?! That Christmas my mum bought me book one (she actually bought me the Philosopher's Stone - I'm originally from the UK). I put it to one side thinking, cute gift - what am I going to do with that? Stuck without anything to take on a cross-country plane journey, I threw it into my bag.My trip was from DC to San Francisco via Denver. At the layover in Denver I was so enthused by Harry Potter I rushed to the store to buy Chamber of Secrets. In San Francisco I rushed out to get Prisoner of Azkaban. On my return to Virginia I bought Goblet of Fire and anxiously waited, with the rest of the world, for The Order of The Phoenix. These books are not just for kids!Anyway, back to the Sorceror's Stone. Obviously we are introduced to Harry and his world. This first novel in the series has a charm all to itself - an innocence, almost - we're not yet flung into the horrors that are to follow. Hogwarts, discussed at much length, is a wonderful mixture of old-time British public boarding schools and wizardry. For someone like me, brought up on Billy Bunter, Jennings and other boarding school books it transplanted me back to a magical time from my childhood.But the book is so much more than that. We start to get a feeling that not all is right in the magical world. The evil Lord Voldemort has killed Harry's parents in a very mysterious way and left Harry with a very puzzling scar. And not all is as it should be at school. Rumors and whispers follow Harry whereever he goes; some new classmates are anything but friendly - some new teachers are very much enemies already! As with the first four books, there are some big plot twists - characters we suspect turning out good, those we don't suspect being the villain. The final confrontation turns out to be, just the beginning for Harry.Some people find this story difficult to get into. The first few chapters build the characters and atmosphere more than the plot. Persevere - you might just get into it. And then look for the hidden meanings. JK Rowling showers her world with puns, anagrams, latin terms and other wordplays. Read things out loud - sudennly Diagon Alley might not be all that it seems!Then go and read the rest. The Harry Potter books really are best read in the order they were written: Sorceror's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. Go on, become a Potterhead!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So...we've missed the boat for the Potter cultural revolution, but it's never to late to swim out to the middle of the Atlantic to get on board. Yes, that's right our family is just now getting around to reading the Potter series and what a better place to begin than the beginning with \\"The Sorcerer's Stone.\\"You'd have to be living under an enchanted rock to not be familiar with the plot, so I won't touch on that too much. Let's give credit to J.K. Rowling for writing a fine tale. This book is a rarity of rarities, a in-betweener...in-between the world of adults and kids, enchanting to all on the edges and in-between years. For that, the plot drives you to listen and read on. The writing, in and of itself, is nothing elevated. It is not for the turn of phrase or the magical metaphor we read Potter. No, it's the suspense, the drama, the otherworld-ness of wizards and witches and ogres and goblins and ghosts.Though this book of the series stopped short of the five star rating for me, I highly suspect the following ones will get me there. I look forward to being enchanted with number two and then three and four...five now...will there be more? In comparison with J.R.R. Tolkien, this Potter book doesn't quite hold up, but the fact that it compares says a lot. Not to be missed. Family reading aloud by the fire."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Many people have said things about Harry Potter that would make adults discourage their children from reading them. I disagree with this. The Harry Potter books are books of magic, friendship and loyalty. They made me want to sit down and read them over and over again. I would highly recommend reading the Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone doesn't really need yet another glowing review, I'm not going to let that fact stop me from reviewing a book I happen to love. I was a tad late catching Harry Potter fever, coming in about the time the first movie was released on DVD, but I'm now a quite devoted fan of J. K. Rowling and the magical stories she has given to us all, dazzling young and old alike in a manner quite unheard of before. Actually, I don't think I would have recognized Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as a children's book had I picked it up with no previous knowledge whatsoever about the phenomenon. It's a rip-roaring good story filled with amazingly lifelike characters set in a truly captivating setting. Harry Potter is, in a way, the ultimate underdog despite the fame he suddenly finds himself enjoying on the day of his eleventh birthday. Ron Weasley is the perfect sidekick, self-conscious of his family's modest means and forever moving along underneath the large shadows of his more successful older brothers. Then there is Hermione Granger, my favorite character in the Potter universe, a smart yet captivating know-it-all who eventually becomes the unlikely yet essential third member of Rowling's intrepid trio of heroic friends. All of the characters are rich and alive: Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall, the unforgettable Hagrid, the fearsome Snapes, the incorrigible Draco Malfoy, etc. This book is so compelling that I can't imagine ever forgetting even the most seemingly unimportant of characters.If you enjoyed the movie but haven't actually read the original novel, you really owe it to yourself to pick up the book. The movie is amazingly faithful to Rowling's novel, with only a few rather minor changes, yet the book offers so much more to the Harry Potter story. For one thing, his life on Privet Drive with the Dursleys is actually much worse that it appears in the movie. The story behind Snapes' immediate dislike of Harry is told in these pages, as is Harry's first and highly significant meeting with Malfoy early on in Diagon Alley. It's really quite amazing to see how many little tidbits of future significance are scattered throughout this original story, giving one the impression that Rowling had a pretty clear vision of Potter's future in mind quite early on. Perhaps most importantly, the ending works so much better in the novel; the movie ending just seemed to lack a little something, but the book not only fills in some gaps, it describes a much more trying set of warding charms and traps Harry, with the help of Ron and Hermione, must pass through in order to save the day. Not only is this story enjoyable from start to finish, it is also both inspirational and educational. Children can learn a great deal from Harry Potter and the way he fights for good against evil no matter what the risks, remains forever loyal to his friends, and never gives up under the most trying of circumstances. Brave, noble, and true even at the worst of times, yet humble and shy in his moments of success and achievement, Harry Potter is truly a hero for the ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the book that started it all. In the first chapter, \\"The Boy Who Lived\\", you know that this book is going to be epic. And while many may not regard the book itself as an epic, the series certainly is, because \\"Harry Potter\\" is not a series, it's a saga-- and a magical mystery.The book is very imaginative. Only J.K. Rowling could create something as funny as Qudditch, which I, even though I'm not a sports fan, enjoy reading about. The world of wizards in Harry Potter does not seem to be created at all. It seems to have always been there. It's as if the world of wizards was already in place and all J.K. Rowling had to do was introduce Harry into it.The mystery in this book is superb. I won't give out any spoilers to those who haven't read it, but I was completely surprised.Harry Potter also presents a very strong set of morals, even though J.K. Rowling says that she didn't set out to preach anything. The words of Voldermort's cronie (I won't reveal who it is) clearly shows evil and how evildoers think:\\"There is not good, there is no evil. There is only power and those too weak to seek it.\\" However, that is proven as a lie later on.Overall \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a very imaginative, not to metion enormously popular, book. It is the start of a saga of secrets and mysteriousness, which is continued in \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just 2 words...pure genius. J.K. Rowling is an amazing woman that writes amazing books! I had always thought that the book was dumb so i never bothered to read it. One day sitting around doing nothing my sister handed it to me and said \\"Read it, even if you don't like it.\\" So i decided since i had nothing else better to do to read it and it blew me away! If i ever meet Ms. Rowling i'll kiss her and buy her a car (even though she probably wouldn't need it). Although there is only 5 stars i give it 6!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a horrible book it's so horrible they shouldn't even sell it. No I'm just kidding this is one of the greatest books I've ever read ( the other HP books are my favorites along with book # 1). I am currently reading this book for the third time and every time I read it I learn something new about Harry.This book has a lot of mysteries and you will never expect the answers. The story goes a little bit slowly so I have taken 1 bazzilionth of a point off for that. Okay back to the book Harry lives with his aunt and uncle ( of whom he hates) along with his fat spoiled cousin Dudley. After a while Harry goes to Hogwarts (wizard and witch craft school) and finds out that somebody's going to steal the Sorceres Stone (elixir of life) and he has to stop them. This is a great book so read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So this book was okay. I didn't actually find it that spectacular. It's getting way more hype than it should be. I mean, it has such a basic plot that I have seen so many times before: Some magic kid goes to a magic school to learn magic. And then there are the bad guys, who are always thwarting with the main character. The main character, while having no personality whatsoever, has a some friends who have extreme, though stereotyped personalities. And then they have all their little school troubles in their school... Worst Witch has the same basic plot, though I find it to be better than Harry Potter somehow. Harry Potter seems to just be Worst Witch, with, maybe, some influence from Diana Wynne Jones.I find the Harry Potter books, and this applies to all of them, to be just like all the other \\"magic\\" books out there, but with worse endings. I don't see why they're so special. I mean, they're pretty entertaining, but I know some books which are more so. What sets Harry Potter apart and makes it so much better eludes me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"all I have to say is \\"Great!!\\"I know you may not think this review is halpful but you read the book and see!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, everyone was talking about Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that, so I(26yr.old mother of three who doesnt have time to read books)said &quot;okay, I'll bite.&quot; The very next day I went out and bought the first book(thinking that if were too childish I could at least read it to my kids). It was amazing, simply amazing! I couldn't put it down. The story was so unpredictable that I just had to keep reading it. I finished the book the very same day I bought it. The characters are so spectacularly described that I could almost SEE the story taking place.We now have the four book collection. My son(8yrs old)is just finishing the second book. We now MAKE time to read the books over and over and over. We cant wait for the next ones to come out! Our favorite are the Weasley twins Fred and George. They are so funny! :0)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was trying to limit myself to reading only a chapter a week, as a personal reward. However, I ended up ditching that after the second chapter, and finished the rest in a day. Now I eagerly search for the sequels and can't wait for the movie.Harry Potter is a normal boy--if you ignore the fact that he has magical powers. He keeps the reader interested with his mischievious shinanigans and expectation of future greatness. But Harry is a regular boy in that he gets into occassional scrapes and his hair never looks combed. Also, a great point is that he gets into believable scrapes--no annoyingly forced or concocted humilation scenes.This is an enjoyable light read. It reminds the older audience of their awkward mishaps of youth and the young of their awkward mishaps and the perplexing unfairness of adults.The plotline is actually amazingly grim--the boy is orphaned and lives with a completely abusive family (he also sleeps in a pantry). He has no friends, is scrawny and thin for his age (maybe from the cupboard), and destined to be kicked around forever. Of course, this changes with his unexpected acceptance to Hogwarts school for young wizards. Even then he is blasted with high expectations from surviving a deadly encounter he doesn't even remember as a baby and must try to be his own person in a strange new world. Luckily, he manages to hold his own. more than that, even.This a believable book in an unbelievable setting. It's tale of magic, dragons, wizards, and another world transport the reader to a state of wonderful fantasy. It's easily understood by beginning readers and enjoyable for matured ones. The British flavor is refreshing and interesting, too, to us Americans.This does very well as a stand-alone book, but it is obvious that more is promised in the coming years at Hogwarts and the development of Harry's power.Did I fail to mention the interesting, yet flat supporting characters? Perhaps they will develop, too.Anyway, read this book. It's definitely worth your while."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must say, when everyone else first picked up this book a few years ago, I gawked at it.

This is definitely a book written for children that adults will also enjoy as opposed to Tolkien's the Hobbit which is a book written for adults that children will also enjoy.Rowling has taken two very different styles or writing and blended them seamlessly in to a sparkling adventure story. When I read her novels I can definitely detect traces of Enid Blytons 'St Clare's' or the 'Mallory Towers' series. On the other hand there is such a Tolkien-esq feel to the books that I almost expect Gollum to appear as one of the characters. If you are looking for depth read I Claudius, but if you are after entertaining escapist fantasy read Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a story about an eleven year old boy who discovers that he is a wizard.

He is popular because of a lightning shaped scar on his forehead that symbolizes that he survived theevil spell. He meets some friends and some enemies.

Look forward to reading it to my grandchildren some day - why does this review have to be 16 words or more?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The real problem with trying to assess such a series objectively for its merits and weaknesses is simply the fact that the hype and furore, not to mention the backlash against the conservatives' hatred of it as &quot;satanic&quot;, has obfuscated the truth of what it really is. In many ways, this is a case of the reputation preceding the &quot;person&quot;, which I use to refer to the protagonist Harry Potter.The conflict between good and evil is set in an imaginary context of kids trying to learn magic in the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The magic, however, has virtually little related to the magic amidst occult circles that Christians are wary of, and most of the time, they are in fact caricatures of the &quot;magic&quot; that has been mediatised on television and print media such as children's books. The character of Voldemort, while standing as a figuration of evil, with Harry Potter as his adversary, does not make the equation of &quot;good versus evil&quot; out to be that simple. Harry Potter, as we recall in many parts of the novel, does have the realization that his powers can be twisted to evil like Voldemort's, since Voldemort was in fact a former student of Hogwarts. Also, the revolting children in the series, such as Draco malfoy, who are bullies, but still do not really count as &quot;evil&quot;, make the series appear more like a preamble to the revolting children of Roald Dahl stories.Comparisons of the series, and I particularly use the first book to reinforce my case, to the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are also somewhat mistaken. C.S Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien wrote their novels such that characters were located either in a speculative leap into another world with a cosmic battle between good and evil, or another world with its own constitutive battles for the triumph and ascendancy of good over evil. J.K Rowling's series would be more pedagogically oriented, in that I perceive the audience to be a younger one, mainly kids and pre-high schoolers rather than the adolescent crowd of Lewis' or the adult audience drawn to epic in Tolkien's case.To match that, the children do take a leap into another world, but the world does not necessarily have such cosmic principles of good versus evil governing them. The battle between Voldemort and Harry(and company) is not developed until late into the last few chapters, and the earlier and middle parts of &quot;The Philosopher's Stone&quot; focuses more on Harry's experiences as a young boy brought out of his immediate experiences (as an ordinary boy bullied by others as a loser into a stimulating environment which compels him to change, through education and the discovery of his parentage mainly).To be more critical of the series, I would comment that it does foster a greater sense of literacy and excitement in children indirectly but it is not commensurate with the amount of overt publicity it receives."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sitting comfortably in an oversized chair with my seven year old son reading Harry Potter will forever be one of my most treasured experiences. Recent concerns that this book may cause an uprise in the practice of witchcraft amongst children are ridiculous in my opinion. I seriously doubt that one book could undermine or alter a child's chosen beliefs and values formed by years of proper parenting and mentoring. This happens to be an exceptionally written fantasy which contains captivating characters that entertain both young and old alike. After a slow and somewhat still beginning describing Harry's circumstances and character inrtoductions the reader is magically transported to the enchanting world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. From there the excitement begins. Anyone seeking a fantasy story should read this superb book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"(...) J. K.

I loved it, its a book i would recommend to all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book opens me up to a new world of imagination and way of looking at the world, not to mention a variety of fictional places, things, and characters with interesting names. The things that really stick in my memory are &quot;Quidditch&quot;, &quot;The Golden Snitch&quot;, and &quot;Devil's Snare&quot;. Not to mention the revolting &quot;Bertie Bott's Every-Flavor Beans&quot;, sort of a Jelly Belly Spoof, only with flavors like *cough* earwax. And the names make me laugh, like Malfoy, Dumbledore, and Valdemort. (you-know-who!) LOL I know this may sound like a cliche, but Harry Potter is cool no matter what age you are. I remember I started reading my younger sisters' copy of the Sorcerer's Stone, until she caught me. The madness and craze drove me to see the movie, then I became totally obsessed, and I had to buy the copy of the book! I must say it was a very riveting book and has gotten me into the habit of reading again! Thank you J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great fantasy for children. it combines many wonderful elements associated with fantasy including taking place in a magical world filled with magical objects and creatures. Aslo the characters themselves posses magical poweres. Additionally, the author has made the book very believable. How? By given the scenes and character development a lot of time and detail. Through vivid descriptions the Hogwarts school and students become all too real. Like all good stories there is a universal truth and theme. That theme is of sacrifical love. Harry's mother gave the greatest gift of all to her son and the magic from that protects him.In close this is a very original book with a great plot. I find it ridiculus to believe that this book is banned anywhere. The only real harm it brings is having children improve their imagination. And as you should be aware there is nothing harmful about that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wasn't plan to pick up this book of my own since the church has been doing so much of preaching about it, they call it evil and satanic or etc. Out of my curiosity about this book, I bought one for myself. The fact was I enjoyed the book. It was will written with a very gifted writer in our time. I think she has something to offer to the young mind how to be more creative especially in our violent society. Her message is universal no wonder every parents and children that has an open mind enjoyed the book. I am a child grew up in a christian home, but my parents never sheltered me about the real world. I have enough understanding that this is a fictional story, and I don't have anything to worry about the churches are saying. (...) Mainly this book was written for those people that has an open mind and want to expand their imagination. (...) For me, this book deserved more than five stars. I loved the book and I always will!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I confess that I was put off by the tremendous craze surrounding the Harry Potter books. People can go wild over the silliest things - pet rocks, for instance. I imagined that Potter-mania would be something similar. But after being called a muggle once too often, I decided I had better take a look and see what all the fuss was about. And now I must admit, I am impressed.Rowling has a real talent for storytelling. She does a terrific job of managing the plot, and uses almost every scene to develop the story. The tale will definitely hold the attention of young readers. Older readers will also enjoy it. In fact, more than a few authors of adult novels could take a lesson or two from Rowling.Let me also say that I had one other bias against Harry Potter before I read it. One of my favorite authors when I was growing up was John Bellairs, whose trilogy \\"The House with a Clock in its Walls\\" also dealt with a young boy who lost his parents, and is introduced to the world of magic. It seemed like an affront that Rowling should receive so much more attention than Bellairs. After reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" I can say that it is as enjoyable as Bellairs' books, though different in tone and execution. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you owe it to yourself to take a look at \\"The House with a Clock in its Walls.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ok. I read this book with a purpose - wanted to make sure that this would be suitable for my children. They are still small (now only 5 and 2 respectively) but we all know HP is going to be a big hit in the coming years and it is never too early to start some &quot;research&quot; and &quot;screening&quot;. But in the end... I was the one who cannot stop reading and went to the nearest book store almost immediately to grab books 2 to 4."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was skeptical at first. Tried to resist the pressure I was feeling from people around me who had read the book. I didn't want to read it, I thought, like many times, people are just exaggerating it because it's a best seller. And plus, it IS a children's book why would I read it?Well, I am sorry that I waited so long now. I finished the book in one day! From the first chapter, the book got to me so much I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It is a children's fantasy book, but it's also definitely more. I think it's a great way to teach children and (even the big children like us) not to judge a book by its cover.I will not spoil it more for those of you who have still not read it. If you are one of those people, PLEASE read it! It's a story I would definitely read as a bad time story to children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine yourself in a school in a far away land where ghosts and goblins are a common sight. In this mysterious school you will encounter new students, none which you already know, and you will be taught how to perform incredible magic by some of the best wizards and witches on earth. While learning the basics (mathematics, literature, etc.), you will also be expected to learn make potions out of items that you had only dreamed of, as well as learning a few dozen spells.In a wonderful book ,Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling creates a young boy named Harry Potter, who experiences all of that and more. After being mistreated by his aunt and uncle, for ten long years, Harry recieves a letter to come to Hogwarts. While at Hogwarts Harry Potter is involved in school, a sport called Quidditch, and the search for an evil sorcerer.This book is incredible. At first I thought that this book was childish, but after I read it I realized not only that it would entertain a child, but that I was very impressed with how well the book was written. Even though I had never read a fantasy book before this, I now can say that fantasy is one of my most favorite genre of novels to read.This book was wonderful, and I honestly believe that it is for every person of any age. While reading this book you will also learn about how values can be mixed in with a great book. &quot;Your mother died to save you.

During the middle I was more interested but I still didn't feel that this book was as interesting as I had achieved that it would be. From the beginning of the book I tried to discover the characteristics emotionally of Harry Potter, but it was hard to really tell. I don't think the author knew who exactly she was thinking of. But as time went on, toward the end of the book, I got a feel for Harry Potter. I felt as if I could compare him to someone in my life. In the end of Harry Potter and the Socrers stone, I got a feel for every character in the book. I know them. They aren't what I would've thought of as witches and wizards, they seem to be ordinary people from what I can tell from the descreptions of the author. This is not just a great kids book, but an excellent one. Your kids will learn from Harry Potter, and the writing styles of the author, and while they're learning, they will have fun, as my kids did reading the award winning book 'Harry Potter'.

I think this book is the story for all people from little kids to old people. This story is about a boy who is a son of a really famous wizard and his wife, and his adventure in the magic world. Although it is Fantasy, it gives you very realistic feelings of the characters. In my opinion, Harry is really strong and patient and has a pure heart and always tells people the truth for everything. I guess everyone who read Harry Potterfs story respects him, and may also be interested in him with envy because everyone wants to be like Harry Potter. As you may know, the theme of this story is that you can do anything if you really want to do it or have to do it, so donft give up and try your best until your dream becomes true.I chose this story to read this semester because the story of Harry Potter is really famous, and also translated in a lot of different languages. If you cannot understand in English, you would be able to read in your native language, and I suppose that this is a really big reason why Harry Potter is so well known. I want everyone to read this story, have a good time with a very incredible dream of being a wizard or a witch!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This story is magnificient. The author, J.K. Rowling, is such a good writer that she (with the Harry Potter books) makes you feel as if you\`re in another world. She makes you feel like if you\`re in the magic world or that that world exists. When there is a scary part you feel scared, but when there is a happy part you feel happy. it is filled with fantasy and adventure. If you like all that then you should read the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even if you're not familiar with Harry Potter, you've probably at least heard of it. You've either seen the books in the stores or seen an ad for the movie, and maybe the reason you haven't delved into JK Rowling's magical world is because you think it's \\"stupid kid stuff\\" or you don't want to have anything to do with the latest fad.I can tell you that I felt the same way. I utterly and absolutely despised Harry Potter until the day I finally conceded and picked up the first book. How wrong I had been.Harry Potter is much more than a fad. These books, decades from now, will be considered timeless classics. JK Rowling's tales of a young wizard who is gradually coming of age perfectly capture the essence of childhood and adolescence. What a pleasure it is, for someone who has just \\"been there\\" and \\"done that,\\" to see such a charming character grow just as all children do. The brilliant JK Rowling frequently reminds us that Harry, for all his bravery and heroism, is nothing more than a young man trying to come to grips with the same things all kids must go through: fights with friends, crushes, difficult teachers -- the list goes on.The Harry Potter books are full of real characters with real quirks and problems, despite the imaginary magical world in which they exist. This is the true charm of the stories, and this is what causes dedicated fans, young and old alike, to become ensorcelled by these books and return to them again and again.I wish to thank Ms. Rowling, for sharing her private world with us. We who have come to love Harry and his friends appreciate you more than we can ever say or you will ever truly understand.To those who are avoiding these remarkable books (\\"Muggles\\" that you are), I ask you to bite down your pride, take a moment, and open your heart and mind to a new world full of unending possibilities."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry felt something in his pocket, but what was it?

You should read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer?s Stone if you never have!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a magical story about a young boy named Harry. In the beginning of the story we learn of a family, the Dursley's. They have agreed to take care of Harry and let him live with them because he parents have been killed. Harry is told that his parents were killed in a car crash, but the truth is that a deranged wizard killed Harry's parents. The Dursleys and there fat, spoiled son, Dudley, are angered that Harry must live with them. They put him in a closetbelow the stairs for his living quarters. They keep him here because they do not like him and they also do not want Harry to become aware of his special magical powers.Around the age of ten, Harry begins to receive mysterious letters. He receives more and more letter, of which he has not seen any of them because they were taken from him, until Mr. Dursley has had enough. He forces the family to move to a cabin by the sea. On Harry's 11th birthday, at the strike of midnight, a huge man has come to find Harry. The man's nameis Hagrid. He is the keeper of Hogwarts, the college of witchcraft and wizardry. He becomes very upset that Mr. and Mrs. Dursley have kept the secret of his parent's fame from him and have not told him the true reason why Harry's parents had died. Harry then decides that he will leave with Hagrid and go away to Hogwarts to further study his wizardy powers. When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, all the students are extremely empressed that they are able to study wizardy with Harry. All the students then gather in a meeting where they are told which cabin they will be placed in. Harry is placed in Gryffindor. Ron and Hermoine, who will becom his best friends, are also placed in Gryffindor. The three of them often do many daring things. They sneak out there cabin many a times using the invisible cap that was given to them by Dumbledoore. Ron, Hermoine, and Harry must then face Sirius who is working for Voldemore to get the Sorcerer's stone. If Voldermore get the stone, he will have eturnal life. Next, the three must go through a series of obsticles. Ron sacrifics himself and gets knocked unconcious so the others can move on. Hermoine solves the final riddle where he must decide with potion Harry must drink in order to walk through the flames. After Harry walks through the flame he faces Voldemore once again. Harry once again defets him. Harry then finds the Sorcerer's stone in his pocket after which explodes.This was a wonderful book. J. K. Rowlings does an excellent job using imagry that is easy to understand. I look forward to reading the next book in his series to find out what Harry Potter does next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is exactly what I expected it to be. As an upcoming teacher I like to compare books and stories that children sometimes read in school. I expected Harry Potter to be somewhat magical but also explicate a real life situation. Harry is abused/neglected and feels as if he is in a world of abandonment because he doesn't have a real family. However, he is led to a world that he can understand and that understands him giving him somewhat of a family relationship. This book can be compared to those such as \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" or \\"Witches\\" both by Ronald Dahl. These books also contain magic and alot of imagination, however they deal with real life situations also. I recommend Harry Potter to be read casually as a way of letting children use their imaginations through reading. However, I don't recommend it for children who don't seem to use alot of imagination because they will try what they think is real in the book. A teacher must make sure that the students know the difference between what could be real and what is definitely fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter And The Sorcerers\` Stone Book ReviewThe book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers\` Stone is my favorite book.

Harry\`s real parents were killed by a mean wizard named Voldemort. Harry was just a baby when Voldemort tried to kill him too!

The fact that it had become such a popular fad was a big turn off for me, and as a student about to finish college through the University of Wisconsin, I wasn't planning on reading these \\"children's books\\" any time soon. After continuous nagging from my younger sister, (and recommendations from my parents and a friend who happened to be an English teacher), though, I finally agreed to read them.Well, I was instantly hooked. Rowling's characters are interesting and believable (contrary to what some other reviewers have said), her story interesting, her writing captivating and her attention to detail spectacular. The reader gets pulled in - immersed in a fantasy that is close enough to reality to hold some kind of truth. Before long, one can't help but to get to know the characters, and respect them, cheer them on at the edge of one's seat, and feel for them, too. The book is filled with a wondrous magic, plenty of suspense, and a fair bit of humor as well.Sometimes I found Rowlings writing to become somewhat predictable (after I'd gotten to know her style, by the middle of the second book - but I do have a knack for guessing endings), but no less exciting. Despite my predictions, there were still plenty of surprises, and I still was unable to put the books down. The books are not perfect, (as nothing ever is) but they are every bit worth the read.I highly, highly recommend this book, and the following three (all that was written at the time of this review). Don't let the hype and popularity of the series cause you to miss this these books. They are instant classics, and all the hype is because they are just that good! (Today, anything really good can make a lot of money, and therefore will get its own movie and toys, after all.)

The book follows Harry, Ron, and Hermione's adventures through their first of seven years at the school of witchcraft and wizardry.I found the book very enjoyable. It's hard to find a series these days that can be enjoyed equally by all ages. It's a big book too which is good because the publishing dates are very widely spread. My hunger for more led me through 3 more installments of the series and I am now reading the 5th year of Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. I hope that others can find the same enjoyment that I have out of this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K RowlingHarry Potter thinks he is a normal boy with rotten luck. His parents died when he was a baby. He went to live with his aunt and uncle. At 11 he thinks his aunt and an uncle are too strict. On the night of his birthday he made a wish. If you want to find out more about it, read. I think 8 and over would like this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a series for anyone who likes magical things or not.It's funny ,it has great plot ,great characters.If your over the age of fifteen I think that this book might be too imature for you.Other than that I give this series 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter Series are excellant books that I would recommend to anyone, any age. The story is not only entertaining, but you can learn a lot too! You see true friendships. People change friends all the time, but Harry Potter shows us how important it is to have people close to you. You always need someone to trust, back you up, and confide in. Harry Potter also teaches us bravery. Harry risks his life for the lives of others. He is dependable and honest without being fake. Today, on television, the \\"hero\\" is always portrayed as someone who doesn't make mistakes and gets everything they want. Harry Potter shows us a real hero in a young boy who learns from his mistakes and has suffered personal loses. Everytime I read this book, I learn a new lesson that I can use for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book will hook you from the very start. It is a breath taking novel. It takes you along for the ride as you follow Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as they go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.You will be trying to figure out what is behind the trap door, and who is trying to get there hands on it. You will feel as if you are right there trying to get defeat the Troll. You can almost feel the wind in your hair as Harry takes his first broom ride.J.K. Rowling lets you get into the characters so that when they think they have found out who is trying to get the stone you believe that is the right answer but when they find out they were wrong you are as shocked as they are.This book will hook you until the very end. Once you pick up the book and get into it you will not want to put it down. I would suggest this book for anyone that like a good adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was so fun to read and engaging that I finished it in one day. I just could not put it down. This book was written for children but it will also appeal to older readers as well. I should know, I'm 50 years old. The descriptions of the magic world were so fun and imaginitive. This book I now want to see the movie but it will be hard to put all the enchanting descriptions into words. I loved it so much that I had to order the sequel Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets from Amazon. I can't wait to read it and I hope the author continues Harry's adventures for years and years. A fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is perhaps one of the best I've ever read. It's not to long not to short and a definite promise of a sequel. The plot, which I'm sure many people know all to well is that, an underdog (in this case an abused child raised by his wretched aunt and uncle) becomes a wizard whom his aunt and uncle fear. Now when I first read this book it wasn't because the movie was coming out I just did because my Dad made me. Now I hated the movie but this book I praise and recommend as a good read. The many characters are so petty and human and somehow in hundreds of countries no matter what language it's in Harry Potter has cast a spell that has made him one of the most well known characters in the world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling's opening installment of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series is an immensely delightful journey into the fantasy of one boy. Her writing is absolutely compelling and joyful, and this book should not be missed by anyone who enjoys to read.I don't know what all the fuss was about with the \\"illicit material\\" that the book's magic character has. This is a great work, fueled and further developed by the movie, that all children should love to read.Let go of your inhibitions, curl up with your favorite blanket and beverage, and light into it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 14 years old, and I love the book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It was very well written. Three cheers for J.K. Rowling! She is a very talented writer. I have finished this book, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.&quot; I have already ordered &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.&quot; I can't stop reading them! I just have to say: Thank you J.K. Rowling for such a very excellent book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is probably THE best book I have ever read. And its sequels I am not even going to go into they are so good. i can't judge which is better out of the 3. I love the imagination and creativity that JK Rowling puts into this book. It is absoloutly incredible!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book captures a world inside a childs imagination. Which can not be shared unless an adult has the imagination still left in them from there childhood. I would recommend this book to anyone adults and kids. It has suspense, mystery, fantasy, and a whole lot more. I don't want to ruin the story for you but you must've already guested that Harry Potter is the main character. It's his struggle to find more about his parents(which you will find out what happened to) and his struggle to save the magical world from the dark wizard. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was great because it gave kids a good perspective of magic. I think it went a little over board though on how much magic it used. But I mean if you are really into this stuff this book is for you"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recommend that you should buy this book. This book is very exciting and suspenseful. The story is for all ages and will thrill you. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is funny, amazing, and serious. Don't miss the following highlights of Harry's mysterious adventures. There were hundreds of spooky letters sent to Harry, but Mr. Dursley didn't let him open them. What could be in the letters? Harry has to walk through walls in public. How will he do that? Quidditch makes Harry the most popular kid in school. Is he lucky? Ron and Harry get in trouble and get sent to the Forbidden Forest. Forbidden Forest! Voldermort faces Harry for the battle of a lifetime. Will he survive? I feel this is a great book. I felt like I couldn't put it down. It was very exciting and captivating. The monsters and surprises that he ran into during his year at Hogwarts were funny and scary. Like the talking painting and the snoopy professors. They were all unpredictable. Sometimes the unlikely one can be dangerous. Buy the book for your own good. Warning, beware of spells, magic, and curses."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I have read better books, this was a really good book. The author really knows what she is doing and there is so much continuity, everything in the book just comes together at the end. I thought the style that this author uses is very similar to that of Roald Dal, another great contemporary author for children of our time. I am 14 years old myself, but I believe that no one is too old to enjoy this book for all it is worth. I have read the sequels too and they are just as good. Im already dreading the end of the series when I will not have another book to look forward to!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is an enthralling story of a boy who learns he is a wizard on his tenth birthday. Harry has lived his entire life with his cruel aunt and uncle and their son, Dudley. The whole family hates Harry and forces him to live in a cupboard while Dudley is spoiled rotten. On his tenth birthday Harry Potter is invited to attend the wizarding school, Hogwarts. There he discovers a magical world that is hidden from ordinary people, whom the magical world calls &quot;muggles.&quot; Harry learns that he is a hero in the magical world, and for the first time in his life, he is popular. He becomes the young star of his dorm's quidditch team, a sport of the magical world. The book follows Harry Potter through the rest of his first year at Hogwarts and his many adventures. It's a quick and memorable read that will leave readers wanting more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After a grueling session bent over a final analysis of T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland, I picked up Harry Potter for a coffee break. I had to be taken away from the novel by force. A wonderful, positive book. The writing is, of course, simplistic. It's a kid's book. Yet the style is suprisingly elegant and brings to mind other great children's novels (Ann of Green Gables or Little Women, for example). Like these classics, the book is refreshing and rewarding for parents and kids both.Children's minds are formed by what they absorb at a very early age. Harry's positive lessons of self-reliance, kindness, and a general goodness will stay with your child. After they go to bed, sneak it off the bookshelf and into the den. It's a wonderfully wholesome read for the whole family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 14 and I think this is a great book. It has a great story that gets you hooked right away. It makes you use your imagination (which I think everyone needs to do more of). It is fun and you want to keep reading even after you've finished. I wouldn't recommend it to little kids (who might try to jump out of a window on a broom) or people who are prone to giving away the ending of things the watch or read. Well I hope you get his book and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I honestly think this is the best series ever! I own all three books and it's absolutely fantastic. I can read it over and over and still not get tired of it. J.K. Rowling have a real talent for writing books! The Harry Potter books are the best series ever! If you like true fantasy with a twist in everything you can imagine, such as adventure, drama, and even a touch of romance, the Harry Potter series is SERIOUSLY for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. It held my attention the whole time I read it, never wanting to put the book down. I was on edge a lot too, wanting to know what was going to happen next. I think one of the negative things which is very minor but caught my attention before I even opened the book, was the cover. Yes, it is very detailed, but my prediction on the book was nothing like it turned out. J.K Rowling used great detail in the conversations and narrations, because I almost felt as if I was there in the story. The one part that I was glad she mentioned, was when she explained the school and all the strict rules. It really opened my mind to what kind of place he was going to go to. The descriptions of the characters is definitely a strength. I had clear images of who they were in my head, even the one's who weren't the main characters. The way the were talked about gave me a view of how they would be acting through out the book. For instance when she introduces the Dursley's explaining how they everything that they need and are very wealthy. It explained to me that while the Potters knew them they were snobs to them. This book I thought was going to be a little kid book, but turned out to be so interesting and caught my eye the whole time I read the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book I have read in a long time. It has many strengths that make it a great book. For example, the plot of the story is never slow or uninteresting. The story line was exciting from begining to end. The adventures and challenges Harry and his friends take on throughout the book are very suspenseful. It is almost as if you are there watching it all take place right before your eyes. The readability of this book is very good. It is a very easy and enjoyable read. This book appeals to readers of all ages. Children as well as adults would enjoy the magic of Harry Potter. I picked this book up and in a few hours I was at least 100 pages into it. It is a great story.There are few weaknesses in the book. While this is a great story for both the young and the old, there are some aspects of the book that would probably not be understood or appreciated by a younger child. Also, the book is fairly long. This is fine for an older reader but a younger reader might have some difficulty.Overall Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very enjoyable book. I highly reccomend it anyone who enjoys a fun, lighthearted and original story. I look forward to reading the rest of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really liked this book. I liked how the author came up with the creative names for the characters and the places. I also liked how everything tied in together at the end of the book. Suddenly everything made sense then. The main characters happen to be my favorite. They were Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Hagrid. The author did such a good job of making you want to read more. The Quidditch game that she made up was brilliant.In the book Harry, a real wizard, lived with a 'Muggle' , or human, family. He lived with them for ten years not knowing the real truth. Well, when the truth starts to unfold and Harry finds out that he's a wizard and his parents were killed by an evil sorcrer, well, everything gets turned around. One odd day Hary meets a stranger Hagrid that takes him to the Hogwarts school for witches and wizards. The author tells of his adventures while at the school and how he conquers the evil villian in the end. The ending is also a surprise whenyou find out who the villian really is. This book has inspired me to read the sequals so read it and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked this book very much. Especially the characters. It's amazing how the author can come up with such creative names and places. Plus, the Quidditch game she made up in the story blew my mind. The events and evil plots in the story make you want to keep reading.Hagrid, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are my favorite, and main characters. I like how the author tied everything in. Like how everything fit together at the end of the book. And also how throughout the whole book you thought the bad guy was someone else. I reccomend this book.It starts off with Harry growin up in a 'Muggle', or human family. Then he finds out that his real parents were killed and he is a wizard. He is then sent to Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. It tells about his adventures with the Quidditch game, how he overcomes two school bullies, and conquers the evil Voldemort. Read the book and find out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Absolutely brilliant! The characters are so well thought out that I really got into it. I was able to relate to Harry Potter and his friends, Hermione and Ron. The use of magical terms were astounding. I found that many of the legends and magical herbs coincided with actual legends and ingredients in magical spells. The history of Harry Potter is revealed in bits and pieces which made me want to read on. Hearing about Lord Voldemort (or should I say He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?) sent shivers up my spine. All in all, this is a wonderful book to read with your children or without!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finished reading this book a while ago.

If you have read it, then you know what I mean. If you haven't, then you might want to know what I think. It's got a very good plot and is very imaginable. It's one of those books were you can sit there, read it, and wish you could be there with the characters. And at some times, it's almost like your taken away from reality and put in a world full of magic and wonderful creatures. So, if you EVER get a chance to read this book - DON'T IGNORE IT!!!...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being almost 25 years old I had heard about these books and didn't know what to think of them. But when friends of mine were raving about how good they were I couldn't help but pick one up to read it. I LOVED it! I found I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days. To the people that think these books promote wizardry and the like, I say let children have a little fun...and let the parents do their jobs of teaching them the difference between real and make believe...do we stop reading fairy tales to our children because they are not real? No, just be aware of what the kids are reading and help them to understand it. I think this series is wonderful for children of all ages and encourages them to use their imaginations!

It's got everything a kid would want..Action,adventure,humor.. sympathetic characters.. and a splendid pacing.. I finished the book in one sitting while waiting in the airport for my flight to LA.. My husband finished it on the flight back. It made us both laugh &amp; we enjoyed it pretty much. It still reads like a kid's book..but that's what the intended American audience was for..

Never disappointed with Harry potter to turn to in times of need."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, this is the book that first kicked it all off. It was a pretty easy read and no one can deny Rowling's creativity. Harry Potter, who is an abused child has nothing good in his life and suddenly he is confronted with the choice to go off to a magical school for those with magical gifts. The school has it's own bank, sport, unique, classes and much more. It is very easy to be drawn into the 3 main characters in this books which will motivate the reader to work their way through the rest of the series. This book is not as dark as some of the ones that come after it. It does introduce us to Voldemort but he is weak in power at this time but Harry is marked as his ultimate enemy. Rowling's style of writing is rather bouncy and fun. She adds a good taste of humor to a complex story...such as Harry's aunt and uncle's house getting bombarded with owls trying to deliver a message. I would say this book is enjoyable for people of all ages. It is fantasy meets modern day."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is Awesome, Radical,to the max!

Don't watch the movies. Read the books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It all started with Stephen King's Christine - I read the book then saw the movie and was sorely disappointed. Then I read Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park and saw the movie. I wasn't disappointed with the movie but with the subtle changes from print to screen. Worst of all these book-to-screen blunders: L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth. I liked John Travolta in Pulp Fiction - hated him in Battlefield Earth. In my opinion, that book was meant to be a miniseries when transformed from print to screen.To avoid that same \\"let down\\" (courtesy of John Travolta), I'm making a concerted effort to see each one of these Potter movies before I read the books.I just finished Sorcerer's Stone. What a great decision to read the book after the screen project. I saved myself any critical feedback of the screen project by not knowing what the novel displayed.There were many times throughout the book that certain scenes where different that what we see on screen. Reading the book is like scanning a DVD for those \\"deleted scenes\\" that usually end up on the editing floor. From Harry's pre-Hogwarts days with the Dursley's to the second Quidditch match absent from the movie - there are parts of the book you must read to get the full Harry Potter experience.In the book we also learn that Harry has a run in with two Centaurs before meeting the one that saves his life during Harry's detention in the Dark Forest. Then there's the missing potion test for Hermoine and Harry after the \\"Wizard's Chess\\" bit down the trap door. J.K. Rowling also seems to gives more importance to the characters of Seamus and Neville in the book than what translates to screen. The movie focuses more on the relationship between Hermoine, Ron and Harry leaving the subtly of the Neville and Seamus connection to the circle of friends floundering.Ms. Rowling crams a few more little things in to her novel that remain absent in the movie. If you haven't seen the movie or read this book, see the movie first then read the book. It is much more pleasant that way because you won't be tossing that expensive bag of popcorn at the screen wishing the producers to get it right."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was just out of this world, literally. It's like once you start reading you cant stop unless you fall asleep. The author, J.K. Rowling really captures the scenery. This book is so discriptive that it's almost like your there. I've never read any of her books before but i decided hey why dibnt i take a chance with this book, and it was worth it.The main character, Harry Potter, lives with his aunt and uncle because his parents died. He never knew that his parents were wizards. Until one day when he finds that he needs to attend Hogwarts school. He meets so many new people and learms about magic and true friendship. Then Ron, Hermione, and harry all find a secret door way that leads to the sorcerers stone, where he finds voldemort. Spunds pretty good so far huh?! Well then i suggest you go and read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I saw this book in the library and thought, hey I'll give it a shot. I did, and i didn't put it down for a second! I only put it down to take a shower and eat! Sleep? Who needs sleep when you are reading something as great as Harry Potter! I didn't even put it down at school! Really, I ran into poles and stuff. Oh, and I knocked over the boy I like...(laugh here)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that this book was a good book I did not want to let it out of my site. I was so interested in it. I like how it tell's you about Harry Potter's life when he was little and when he lived with his uncles the owl's would get there and send him alot of letters so that he could go to Hagwarts to make some magic but since his uncle would take them away they started to send alot of owls with cards so that he can at least get to read one, until finally his going to be friend takes him from were they were at the middle of the sea and takes him to the bank to get all his money so that he can buy all the supplies that he needs. Well thats all I can tell you. You'll just have to read the book if you like it so much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just finished reading this one. It's really a good read. For all you skeptics wondering why it's so good; it's becuase J.K. Rowling uses a lot of detail in her work. The movie left out 20% of the book. Give it a try. I'm a 21 year old and even I found it entertaining. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought the first Harry Potter Book a few weeks ago.

It is rich, deep, and delightfully light and funny. The world of fairy tales has a new milestone, it is Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had watched the movies but never read any of the books,so i decided to read the first one. It was an amazing book i don't know how the author came up with all of the things that went on in the book. It started out with a young boy who's parents were killed in an accident or so he was told. He had no idea that his parents were actually warlock's and witches. He had been living with his aunt and uncle until one day a man from the witch school named Hagrid finally came to Harry's house and told him everything. Told him about his parents, and the fact that he was a wizard. From there Harry went on to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry where he was soon to meet some of his best friends. Ron and Hermione were some of Harry's best friends in the book they looked after harry. Harry didn't ralize how important he was until the very end where he defeated Voltimort and saved the Sorcerer's stone. Overall this was a great book the way the author set everything up i would've never been able to imagine all the things that he came up with. But i'm not much of a fantasy kind of person and that's why i only gave this book a 4 star instead of a 5."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is cleverly written and enloyable to read. I especially enjoyed how creative this make-believe world is that Rowling has created."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter books are very well-written books. Rowling lets her imagination flow upon the pages. Her books have much adventure in them, which kids love reading about. Kids who hated reading before picked up Harry Potter books and enjoyed them. The book has friends who help, care, trust, and support one another. It shows kids that friends are there for each other, from the very start to the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the Harry Potter Series and it was a blast! It gives a lot of imagination to young kids and expires your children to write stories. Harry Potter is easily the children's best book character. Way to go, J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. After reading Tailchaser's Song by Tad Williams, I searched for another fantasy/adventure book.

I am planning on reading the rest in the series, too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one, if not the best book that I have ever read. This book can be read by all ages. And it keeps you guessing until the very end. I just read it for the second time and it was just as good as if it was the first time I had opened the book. I suggest to you all to go out and buy/borrow this book. And if you have read this book and you really enjoyed it, I recomend that you go out and read Holes by Louis Sachar. It is also along the lines of a Harry Potter book, and is very well written."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love Harry Potter, when I got the book I read the first chapter and it blew me away,so I read five chapters.It is a very good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got this book beacuse I and heard it was good.

Then, something happened quite by accident. A friend had a copy and I picked it up, opened to the 1st chapter, read the first 2 or 3 paragraphs, and next thing I knew... I was running out to buy it. There are a few things I found objectionable, but those things were done by the &quot;evil&quot; characters which shows how evil can be evil. As a good guideline: if you allow your children to watch Bewitched/I Dream of Jeannie OR the Star Wars movies, then this book will not be objectionable to you. I found a lot of parallels between Star Wars and this book. &quot;The Force&quot; vs. &quot;The Dark Side&quot;. The covers look dark and ghostly which IMHO makes Christians feel as though that just validates that it is sinful reading. Yet, &quot;you can't judge a book by it's cover&quot;. All in all, it's just a great book and I, though a Christian, feel it's fine as long as you talk to your children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must be the only person in the world to not love this book. But I didn't. I thought it began well - with the horrible adoptive parents and their child - but then I felt the book was sooo predictable. And when it wasn't predictable, it was because a new deus ex machine was introduced into the story. The writing is pedestrian for the most part. I did like the quiddich matches, but I really don't understand the big fuss about this book. To me, it reads like a Walt Disney animated cartoon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a fan of children literature, know a lot about children books illustrators and even draw comics for my 7-year old son. Reading about Harry Potter phenomenon - millions copies are sold, Spielberg wants to direct, etc - I was preparing myself for something really exceptional. I open the book with an anticipating smile and...Mrs.Rowling is a good mother. She had to provide for her child by every means. And she succeded brilliantly - the transformation of a struggling single mom from Edinburgh into the third best paid woman in Britain is very spectacular.The problem is the product she sells is not very nourishing. It's a fast food in disguise.Mrs. Rowling took the most appealing to the common public ingredients to make the chewable version of the Great Late Children Literature.1) The Cinderella story - Someone who is treated unfairly is finally made aware if his\\\\her powers and gets the ticket to the new wonderful life. That's the very appealing notion - a lot of us think we get much less than we deserve.2) There is a different, much more exciting world above, below or parallel to ours. Yes, life seems dull sometimes, no pain-no gain principle is buggering and we all ready for a quick dramatic crossover.3)The author invites you to the club. You'll get a lot of &quot;in&quot; things to enjoy and recognize the other initiated by. You are a part of the brotherhood now. The rest are Muggles.There are more components but these 3 are the most important.You can argue that these are the chief ingredients of vast majority of children literature. That's right. Now imagine a master chef cooking the delightful meal with the expertly selected products. And an overworked housewife having a try at that fancy recipe from a glossy exotic cuisine cookbook. You'll get the picture.J.K.Rowling's prose is utterly amateurish. Characterisation is very inferior. Harry's evil adoptive father is fat and has no neck. Harry's abusive step-brother is fat and has no neck. There are no changes, no nuances in baddies and gooddies behavior - everything is in the same vein. Children love integrity in character but Mrs. Rowling's creations are so one-dimensional! I do not think that well-invented and memorable people are for adult books only and kids have to contend with cardboard cutouts.Many readers think that Mrs.Rowling is blessed with the incredibly powerful imagination - a lot of &quot;magical things&quot; is happening. But mostly these tricks are emloyed when the author suspects that the readers attention span is nearing the end. Then a chair begins to dance, the pack of earwax-tasting candy (how funny!)is produced and Quidditch game is scheduled.The prose is very repetitive. As a good housekeeper Mrs.Rowling does not want to use things only once - the situations repeat themselves ad nauseam, many objects and happenings are recycled.Trolls, dragons, centaurs, wizards - everything is borrowed. There is a lot more blood and death - that's J.K.Rowlings respectful nod in the direction of our childrens obsession with the gory computer games.I've read youngsters reviews of T.H.Whites books in Amazon. -&quot; Boring, way too many details, boring, too long, boring...&quot; - These delightful books are only the tip of the Arthurian iceberg, there are centuries-old tradition behind them. Alice In Wonderland is a work of genius but it's becoming less and less accessible to our children.I do not want my son to think that Harry Potter is the only face of todays children literature. Despite all the hype these books will find their real place in the hierarchy.Everyone likes Coke and BigMac but not because these are the culinary masterpieces.NOTICE: I ask Harry Potter's young fans to wait for a couple years with their reaction to that review."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When this book first came out a brand new craze came out with it. Thousands of kids were cramming into every store across the world trying to get the book like it was the second coming! So many people were hypnotized by this less than perfect book that they would go out at even midnight to get a book from the first shipment....The first night I had read a few pages my eyelids slowly started to fall... It continued to drag on and on. I've got to admit even though it was pretty boring it was very detailed. You could almost picture yourself there, but then again who would want to!I would not reccomend this book to anyone...Basically, my point is to tell you that this book is a snoozer. Don't be tricked by popularity of them. It's only a fad."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, the good points first. Harry Potter is an above average fantasy for young readers. The wonderful details are probably the best point about the story. (Take the game of Quidditch for example, the owls, the centaurs, the wands and broomsticks, the giant motorcycle that appears only once, and try reading the inscription around the Mirror of Erised backwards.) It is also funny at times in Roald Dahl's style (though inferior to his books). It is even a bit exciting, especially towards the end. I can understand the way all the eight-year-olds, even 13-year-olds are all crazy for it, but adults? What did they see in it? I was a bit disgusted to see all the reviews by adults saying this was their favorite book ever. (They must not have read The Golden Compass.) It really is no more than a slightly above average, rather amusing fantasy. It started out well, but as stereotype after stereotype and cliche after cliche of character and plot were introduced, I began to be turned off. Take Malfoy for example, the 100% evil and cruel bully who has henchmen to stick up from him and teases the other kids about being poor (and of course you can tell he's bad just by looking at him). How ridiculous and boring. Hermione. Another genius/nerd that studies all the time and can solve all the technical problems for the heroes and be groaned at for being so stuffy. She is also nearly the only female character. Hagrid, the big strong giant who turns out to be nice, though a bit stupid, and has a soft spot. I really agree with the reader called Magda from Neptune who said, &quot;I didn't like the idea of Slytherin. It seems like the author just wasn't thinking when she decided there would be a whole house for the &quot;bad guys&quot;. I think that's a shallow idea and also kind of cruel. Could you picture standing there and finding out from the Sorting Hat (which NEVER lies) that you're evil? I think Slytherin was probably the biggest mistake in Harry Potter.&quot; Go ahead and read Harry Potter, because if all these other people liked it there must be something there, and you might get it too. But read critically. Don't just blindly adore it (or any book, for that matter.) And I'm warning you, if you haven't read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife yet, you're wasting your time with anything else."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is really good it has stuff that some reall people go through.

All my friends think these books are great. WHY?????? I have no religious problems with these books, but I find it pretty sad how much of the world is caught up in the notion that these are great books. They are boring and run of the mill. Rowling should try to be a little more original and exciting. The books are no better than the &quot;Babysitter's club&quot; or &quot;Nancy Drew Files&quot;. If you want GOOD books, go to the library and look around, they're not hard to find."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"but I thought this book (and the whole series) was just Ok. From the Fantasy perspective, there are many books with better adventure, plot, and characterization (anything by Tolkien, Donaldson, or Feist, for example). I think one of the biggest reasons for the popularity of the series is that these books are the first experience many people have had with the fantasy genre. Welcome aboard, but don't stop here!My biggest complaint about the series is that they are passed off as children's books (I don't know if Rowling shares this view). Here is the message they present so you can decide if it's appropriate for your children:1. Children should never share their problems with an adult - keep them secret - especially if the problem entails another adult. 2. Sneaking off in the middle of the night to forbidden areas is a good idea and always works out in the end. 3. Adult supervision is unnecessary. 4. It is ok to disobey. 5. Children know better than adults. 6. Adults can't be trusted.I don't know about you, but I want my children to trust me and come to me with their problems. They will also be in considerable danger if they disobey some of our rules.My final beef with these books is that they are all the same (which is why this has turned into a series review instead of a single book review). i.e. Kid is threatened by evil adult. Kid doesn't ask for help. Kid disobeys. Kid does stupid things. Kid puts himself in more danger. Kid triumphs and everything works out great in the end.Bottom line - they're a quick read without much depth and have possible negative connotations if read by young children. Enjoy them for what they are, but don't be mislead by the hype - there's nothing new here and there are much better fantasy books that have been sitting in your library for over 60 years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Bad hate it not worth buying.

A dueling Kid? I've always hated the idea of nature, whether it be in the form of cows or minerals. Absurb. The themes, while possibly repetitive, offer possibilites that Drive. In philosophical terms it's an all-encompasing classic tale of upheaval and revolution. This I don't know? What a bloody murder this is. But it's not dramatic, class, powerful upheaval.

The main idea that stood out to me, is that people who are different are often persecuted. His relatives didn't understand him, were afraid of what he could do, and so treated him badly, trying literally to keep him in the dark about his heritage. It is wonderful to experience Harry's relief that there are other people like him, and watch him develop and blossom as he discovers himself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I always thought it was fair to ask a reader to suspend disbelief no more than once. So while I can easily believe that Harry Potter is a gifted young wizard and that railway Platform 9-3/4s (or whatever) exists for the trained footstep, how likely is it that young Harry could turn out to be so well-adjusted, forgiving, and curious after 11 years of child abuse, of being treated literally worse than a family pet? I mean, no one's upper lip is THAT stiff, no matter how proud the British nationalism it serves.But the book is a delight and worth a read for anyone with a child's eye and imagination, including children, although there's a bit too much deus ex machina for my taste.

I think this book is exciting! I think the author was saying that you could make up your own dream. Would you like to fly on a broomstick? Do you want to know if Harry Potter finds the Sorcerer's Stone?...well...you should read the book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone establishes what might become the most beloved fantasy series since Lord of the Rings. I won't bother recapping the plot at this point since so many others have. Rather, I think it is important to look at how the novel interacts with the reader. Ostensibly aimed at younger readers, it never talks down to the reader nor does it coddle them. It deals with issues timely for its audience such as abandonment, fitting in, and school pressures. Ms. Rowling creates a world that is easy to get lost in yet remains grounded in the real world.All in all, and excellent beginning."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a very, very good book. The author adds alot of imagination into the book. You can picture what is going on so clearly in your head!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The plot of the book is,Harry is a wizard and his mother and father die when he is a baby. So he has to go live with \\"muggles\\" or people that aren't witches or wizards. When he turns eleven he gets a lot of letters from the best school of witchcarft and wizardy, which his mother and father also went to. So he goes to the school, the name is Hogwarts, and a bunch strange things happen to him and his friends(Ron and Hermione). So they decide to try and find out what's going on around the school. And they do. It has to do with the Sorcerer's Stone(hints the name)and the person who killed Harry's parents(Lord Voldermort) That's all I'm going to tell you becuase i don't want to ruin it for you.My opinion of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is I thought is was wonderful, but I saw the movie before i I read the book. It was hard getting into the first few chapters. WhenI did I could not put the book down. My parents had to take the book away to get me to go to sleep.The main antagonist main are Draco Malfoy, Profesor Snape, Lord Voldermort, Profesor Quirrell, and the DRusleys. The main protagonist are of course Harry Potter, Hermoine Ganger, Ron Weasley, Profesor Dumbledore,and Hargrid."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At first, I really didn't know what to expect from a book this hyped up. I saw all the reviews saying what a great book this is, yet I still doubted it, I think I felt this way due to the hype that it recieved from all the people on the news...etc. Finally, one day I just decided to read it. Oh boy am I glad I read this. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is just a success. At the beginning of the story, I doubted the story thinking about all the magic and how fairy-tails always made me sick, but I'll tell you now, by the middle of the book, the books overall story and conecept had sucked me in, leaving me wanting more. I gave this book 5 stars because of the whole development of the story. The characters in the beginning first are not good friends, but as you read it, you can start to see a development in friendships with Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter himself. The three begin getting into some trouble together, and end up becoming best friends. The danger that they get into is essential for the character development because the three end up learning more about eachother. The different events just made me more interested. I was really excited about the Cloak Of Invisibility, and the fact that the book had an unexpected surprise at the end. J.K. Rowling really did a great job using her raw talent to write such a magical masterpiece. Her choice in words was very surprising, since I expected more of a book for the younger age group. I really like this book because it really kept me wondering what would happen next. It also never got boring. The only real flaw that I see in the book is that the main \\"bad guy\\" is more of a in-human kind of thing. I was really kind of hoping for something a little bit more human since I'm not really into the whole monster bad guy kind of thing. Other then that, the story was very interesting and I think this book is a great example of J.K. Rowlings awesome talent, and to tell you the truth, if I could give this story a ten, I would, my suggestion to all the people that haven't read this book, go to your local book store and buy this book, I promise you will be surprised as much as I was."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerers's stone is about a young boy named Harry Potter. Harry grew up with his dead mother's sister Petunia and her husband Vernon. They have a son named Dudley who is out to make Harry's life torture. When Harry turns of age Professor Dumbledore, a the head master at Hogwarts Shool for Wzards, sends his closest and most reliable freind Hagrid after Harry. Harry begins school at Hogwarts and is off to a rough start. Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione start to catch on to the suspicious actions of Professor Snape and Professor Quirrell. Come to find out Hogwarts is hiding the sorcerer's stone. It is a stone with lots of powers that can be used for evil if put in the wrong hands. Harry has many reasons to believe that Snape is after the stone. While following Snape Harry, Ron, and Hermione find out Professor Quirrell is to blame and not Snape. They successfully keep the sorcerer's stone out of Professor Quirrell's hands.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a good book to me because of all the excitement. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on many adventures of their own wich sometimes leads them into trouble. Harry is easy to relate to because he struggles just like the rest of us to make good grades and try to fit in with all the other wizards. I would deffinately reccamend this book to anybody that wants adventure and a great story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is one of the best books I've ever read. The author ( J.K. Rowling) is very imaginative in the way she was able to connect things that were in the beggining of the first book with things in the fourth, The way she was able to create an entire new sport, which I think was a great idea for a game, and complete names and great characteristics for all the characters. Overall it was a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter is awesome you would have to be out of your right mind to not love this book i know i do"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ordered by mistake, done reading, not the book i wanted....... would like a different book just learning my kindle thanks"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wholeheartedly recommend this book. A strange comment for me to say considering that the subject matter would not be one that I would typically select. I was moved to purchase \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" because the Harry Potter series has been such a huge hit with people of all ages around the world. There must be a reason for that and I was curious to discover what that reason might be. It is, in fact, the writer, who has an amazing gift for keeping the story moving and surprising the audience in unexpected ways throughout the book. I am about to purchase book two in the series and can't wait to begin experiencing more of \\"Harry Potter.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not writing this review because I love the books, although I do. I am writing this review because many people reviewing it seem to be forgetting something when rating the book: it's a children's book. If you're an adult reading the book for the first time, then of course it's going to seem less complex than it would have if you'd first read it at the age of eight. On it's own, the first book is not incredibly complex. This is because JK Rowling planned all seven books at the same time. If you want this series to have any complexity at all, you have to read all seven books. Why? Because there is information within the first book that is linked to the other books in clever and complex ways that you cannot possibly know without reading the other books. Harry Potter and the Sorceress Stone is the baseline for a fantastic children's series. Complexity increases with additional books and repetitive reading. I should know, I've read them all twice, some of the books three or four times.When I was little I loved these books. I'm in college now, and I just reread the first book. Would I consider it amazing literature for an individual that reads college level material on a regular basis? No. Do I consider it fantastic and clever for an individual who is in grade school? Yes. Can I still enjoy them? Yes, but only if I think about what it was like to read them as a child and let that inner child come out. Otherwise, I understand why you aren't hooked after the first book. But in my opinion, all of the adults who gave this book a one or two star rating are just that: adults. You have to review from the perspective of a child, or even a parent or teacher, but otherwise, you're totally missing the point. Some adults enjoy these books, but like me, most of them started reading them when they were less than 10 years old. Keep that in mind when you pick them up!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Have you ever had a half-giant knock on your door and tell you that you were a famous wizard? Well, Harry Potter has! During his time at his wizarding school, he encounters trolls, three-headed dogs, and evil professors out to get him. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone deserves all of its five stars. It includes diverse and memorable characters, action scenes, and major plot twists.There are a ton of memorable characters in the Harry Potter. One of the special characters is Hagrid. You can see why Hagrid was interesting because at one point, Hagrid \\"hit the door with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed on the floor.\\" Another memorable character is Uncle Vernon, Harry's uncle. You can tell Uncle Vernon is amusing because when he yells out \\"Silence!\\" and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. One last memorable character I'd like to take note of is Aunt Petunia. One quote that's stuck in my mind is, \\"I was the only one who saw her for what she was, a freak!\\"Besides having memorable characters, there are lots of action scenes in the story that you won't forget. You can definitely tell how this action quote was interesting because, \\"There was a pause. Then SMASH!\\" Another memorable action scene quote is, \\"There was a sudden rummaging for quills for parchment.\\" The last memorable action scene quote by Harry is, \\"He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble.\\"There are also plot twists in Harry Potter that are sure to leave an impression in your mind. One major plot twist is when Hagrid tells Harry, \\"Y'er a wizard.\\" Another major plot twist occurs when Draco says, \\"You don't understand, Professor! Harry Potter's coming - he's got a dragon.\\" The last major plot twist is revealed by Harry when he says, \\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort....and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...\\"To conclude, this epic story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, has lots of action, memorable characters, and major plot twists that will leave you awestruck. With its fast-paced Quidditch matches, heinous professors out to get certain orphans, and mind-bending plot twists, this adventurous family novel will last through the ages. And let's not forget the memorable quotes, as Harry Potter just wouldn't be complete without lines such as: \\"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad. I mean, they're famous. You're famous.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I wroteFiona Thorn and the Carapacem SpellI only hoped I'd be able to conjure a vivid magical landscape bursting with full, well realized characters like Harry, Hermione and Ron. Not to mention the rest of the countless memorable characters like the Weasleys, Dumbledore, Snape or even Dobby, everyone's favorite House Elf.Rowling has set the bar so high with the Harry Potter franchise she is literally on another planet. Harry Potter, and everything that those two magical words summon, has become not only a world wide sensation, but an undeniable part of our culture. Say \\"Harry Potter\\" to anyone and I bet they smile.I even remember where I was, all those years ago, when I started reading the kids' book everyone was talking about. I was sitting in a diner, waiting for some friends. They were late, and when they finally arrived I secretly wished they'd stood me up and left me to my book. By October I was fashioning a Nimus 2000 out of an old broom and sporting a round pair of plastic glasses for Halloween.Rowling is the undisputed queen of her genre, and an inspiration on how it's done, proving that good fiction doesn't have to be snooty and pretentious to be classic. I can't wait to introduce it to my grandchildren someday."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was not a fan of the movies, but the books are wonderful! JK Rowling is an incredible writing. My favorite character is Ron Weasley! He has some funny one-liners. This book made me want to go to Hogwarts (if it had been a real place). Awesome!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this is one of my favourite books of all time. everyone should read it! and the whole series too. great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"\\"To the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure.\\" - Albus DumbledoreThere are no words to describe how phenomenal this book series is. J.K. Rowling has, without a doubt, written the best series in history. Her characters have touched my heart in a way no other characters have, and I love them all dearly. She created a magical dream world for me, one that I always longed to be a part of. One that I still long to be a part of. Harry Potter is a series that I can go back and read again and again and again. And each time, the plot twists will shock me just as much as they did the last time. Each time, I will feel my heart wrenched out over and over when my favorite characters are taken away from me, far too soon. Each time, I will fall in love with Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, Lupin, Sirius, all of them.Harry Potter is the best protagonist to ever live in our personal book world. He is brave and strong, humble and generous, loyal and determined. He is everything good a person can possibly be; his heart is full to the brim. He is not a perfect character, but it is the imperfections that make him realistic, that bring him to life. It is the imperfections that make everyone love him so dearly. That make me love him so dearly. Harry can always count on the support of his best friends; Ron and Hermione. I adore both Ron and Hermione, for just being themselves. The three of them are so diverse, so insanely unalike that they are perfect for each other. The bond between the three of them is not abrupt, it does not happen overnight, but rather grows and strengthens over time. The way they meet, the way they develop their friendship, and the way they bond and defend each other throughout the year; it's all perfect.In the beginning of the book, Harry seems to be all alone. He is stuck with the horrid Dursley's who all hate him, and he is forced to live in poor conditions. He has no friends, no parents, no love. He feels invisible. Who couldn't pity him? But Harry soon finds out that he is nowhere near invisible. He is the most famous wizard in the world! And so Harry's new life begins. The telling of Harry's story is phenomenal. From Hagrid breaking down the door, to shopping on Diagon Alley, to arriving at Hogwarts, it is all written with just the right amount of excitement and fear. The emotions are right on the dot. Watching the beginnings of the wizarding world begin to take shape was the best part of the book for me. There's the singing hats, the talking chess pieces, the moving staircases, the giant three-headed-dogs (named Fluffy, ironically enough), a lunatic for a headmaster, a hilarious giant with a pet dragon, mail carrier owls, unicorns, trolls, centaurs, man-eating plants, goblins running a bank and much, much more. What's not to love? Being introduced to all these new characters, and creatures, and ideas that seemed unthinkable to me! I felt just as excited and nervous as Harry did! I could feel my stomach churning and my cheeks heating up as I devoured the book.And then Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts. He begins to get into the swing of things. He learns that he really is not all alone. He is surrounded by a network of friends who all love him and treat him like family. There's wise Dumbledore, sweet Hagrid, motherly Mrs. Weasly, tough love Ms. Mcgonagall and so many more! And I feel such joy for Harry, that he has finally found a place where he belongs. It is a testament to J.K. Rowlings writing that she can make me feel emotions so raw and so real that I almost think they are happening in real life. Like the fierce hatred I feel for Snape and Malfoy. At times I want to teleport to Hogwarts and give Harry a hug. Tell him everything is going to be all right. And maybe reward Snape a slap across the face, while I'm at it.The introduction is done perfectly. I feel like I have known the characters for ages. Each and every one of them has a unique personality which is integrated in the plot so smoothly- it all comes off as well polished and fast-paced. Then the action comes in. Lord Voldemort- the ultimate villain- is brought into the story. Harry- at the young age of 11 years old- is faced with death and danger. But he remains strong. He delves deep inside to find what he needs to battle Voldemort. He knows it is his destiny. Others might have shrugged it off, saying it is for the adults to worry about. \\"Not my problem\\". But not Harry. Harry, with the help of Ron and Hermione, spends every hour of every day researching the Philosophers stone. What might Voldemort want with it? Where could it be hidden? How can he stop Voldemort from retrieving it? He constructs a plan, and then puts his plan into action. With valiance, bravery and determination he fights his way through fierce traps and dangerous concoctions until he is faced with the final test. Lord Voldemort himself. And he comes out on top.This book is the one that started the world-wide phenomenon. I love it. It will forever be my favorite book series. I bow down to J.K. Rowling for creating such a magical, amazing series. I remember being a kid of 11, waiting for my letter from Hogwarts. It never came, and I was so disappointed. Even now, years later, I am still waiting. Because a part of me doesn't want to believe that Harry's world is not real. And it is not every book series that makes you feel that way."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the books with my kids who love them (I love them too!).

She had, in fact, and said they were her favorite books. So, I went right out and bought them both. Well, I just finished Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and I can't begin to say enough good things about it! I can't believe anyone of any age wouldn't enjoy this story. Harry is one of the most endearing underdogs that have come down the pike in a long time. Every page reads like a new adventure! J.K.

I can't wait to start on Harry's next adverture. My husband and I are avid readers, and I have started a box of our favorite children's books for our son when he's ready to begin reading.

Wizards and witches? Stone castles with three headed dogs that fall asleep to music? What kind of school is this? The one that the famous Harry Potter and his two fellow musketeers attend and dominate. Well, not dominate. Just go around breaking rules under a cloak of invisiblity, riding a broomstick that costs more than his old house, losing tons of Gryffindor House points. That sorta thing.All this applies to the first Harry Potter book by the famous author, J.K. Rowling. Allow me to re-cap the series for those of you who haven't read the books (Gasp!) or who have forgotten. Harry is a baby that survived the Killing curse, Avada Kedavra, of the world's most infamous wizard: Lord Voldemort. He survived and for his pains, received a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt on his forehead. That scar is what makes everyone recognize him when he goes out in public, among fellow wizards. Muggles (humans with no magical power) have no clue about magic or about Harry.The plot officially starts off with a kick when Hagrid, a keeper of the grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, comes to collect Harry from his cursed Muggle relatives and to take him to buy all his school supplies. He goes to Diagon Alley and begins to explore the world of magic in which he is now part of. No more Muggle contraptions, no sir. He also meets his arch-nemesis (or enemy, nemesis just sounds more dramatic don't you agree?) Draco Malfoy who he does not hit it off with.A month later finds him at Hogwarts School, headmaster and excellent wizard Albus Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. but people just call him Albus. He starts off with a new (and first) best friend in Ronald Weasly, also referred to as Ron. He befriends another wizard, technically a witch, Hermione Granger (Yes, a girl). The trio establish a firm friendship that doesn't waver even despite the adventures that almost get them killed. That involves traversing the third floor, which happens to be forbidden, and coming face-to-face to a three headed dog that goes by the name of Fluffy. Ah, the irony. He was named by Hagrid, just FYI. Throughout the year, they continue to discuss the contents of what Fluffy might be guarding, seeing as how he stands atop a trapdoor. Turns out, Dumbledore was doing a favor for his old (and I mean VERY old) buddy, Nicholas Flamel. Yes, he is still alive, hence my comment about being VERY old. Anyways, turns out that Dumbledore was hiding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone so that Voldemort wouldn't get his greedy, bony, hands on it.You see, Voldemort was a rogue wizard that wanted to be granted immortality and as we all know, that gift also comes with a consequence. He didn't have a true body. He was more of a form of vapor. A soul without a body, I suppose you could say. So, he wanted the Stone to be able to make his own body. In the meantime, he hides out in his follower's body. That being the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinius Quirrel. Hence, the reason that Dumbledore hid the stone at the school: No one would even attempt to steal it with Fluffy there.At the end, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all end up putting Fluffers to sleep and entering the trapdoor. They face plants, keys that fly and other mysteries that they manage to pass. At the end, Harry and Voldemort have showdown that leaves Harry mortally wounded but alive. He recovers, thanks to Dumbledore. Good man, Dumbledore.This is where the adventure begins.....GabbyFor the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book struck me as amazing because of the fantastic grammar and characterization.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone kept me riveted with joy on my couch most of the day. So fascinated was I that I immediately searched the net looking for more Harry Potter books by J. K. Rowling and promptly handed the book over to my 12 year old daughter, the real reader in the family.I first heard about this book on National Public Radio - Ms. Rowling was on doing an interview. I was making the commute home from work. She read the passage about the trip to the zoo and the snake and the disappearing glass and she chortled on about muggles and such. I stopped by our local bookstore only to find the last few copies of the book had been snatched up by other listeners just minutes before I arrived.

There&#8217;s so much hype and hyperbole surrounding these books that it may be difficult for parents and Christians to sort through it all. Are they filled with the occult, as some claim? Are they leading our children into witchcraft/occultism? Do they teach disrespect, irreverence, disobedience? What follows is merely my opinion, which I have constructed after much contemplation, prayer, and consultation.What are the books about? Most people know the basics--orphaned boy whose parents were killed by a dark wizard (Lord Voldemort, He-who-must-not-be-named) is raised by his horrible aunt and uncle, discovers at age 11 that he is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, he begins his magical training and makes many friends. The first book deals mostly with Harry becoming acclimated to his surroundings and his classes. There&#8217;s also the mystery surrounding a package that Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore has had moved to the school--none other than the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone (based on the legend of the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, also the title of the book in Britain). And who keeps trying to cause bodily harm to Harry--nasty Potions teacher Severus Snape, who seems to hate Harry? Or someone else? Could this have anything to do with Lord Voldemort, barely alive since his attack on the infant Harry rebounded on him, leaving the dark wizard near death? Part of the fun of the story is the myriad twists and turns with which Rowling imbues the plot, leaving readers guessing. The book has some plot inconsistencies and the characters aren&#8217;t well-defined, but as the series progresses, (and Rowling becomes more comfortable), things get better.Rowling&#8217;s fantasy world swarms with clever, quirky ideas: &#8220;living&#8220; chess sets, Every Flavor Beans (yes, EVERY flavor), Quidditch (a combination of soccer and basketball played on brooms), pictures that literally move, and much more. Humor abounds; even adults will finding themselves snickering. Devotees of classical literature and mythology will enjoy some of the references and character names.There are even a few Christian elements in the story (Harry&#8217;s mother was named Lily--a symbol of Easter ; Harry&#8217;s wand is made of holly and a feather from a phoenix, both sometimes used as Christian symbols; Harry is in Gryffindor House, whose symbol is the Lion, sometimes used to represent Christ (&#8220;The Lion of Judah;&#8221; see Aslan in &#8220;The Chronicles of Narnia.&#8221;);Lord Voldemort is associated with serpents, the symbol of the Devil).There are many lists online.So what is all the fuss about? Should parents and Christians be concerned? Well, yes and no.The positive: Harry is a good protagonist--courageous, clever, fiercely loyal, and self-sacrificing. He often risks life and limb without hesitation. Despite years of abuse growing up, he&#8217;s generally good natured and sympathetic. Kids can easily relate to his underdog status--he&#8217;s short and skinny for his age, has to wear glasses, and comes to school feeling lost because he grew up outside the wizarding world. Trust me folks; there are far worse role models for your kids.The negative: He doesn&#8217;t always tell the truth, and does have a tendency to break the rules (we see less of that as he matures). Usually, Harry is forced to pay the consequences (such as losing a large number of points for his House in the school&#8217;s yearly competition) but not always. This is a good place for parents to discuss right and wrong and obedience with their kids.So, what about the magical elements in the book? Do they make Harry and his world evil? That&#8217;s open for debate; though I offer a few insights that might help:Harry&#8217;s magic is inborn, performed with a few words (usually clever variations on Latin words); there are no pentagrams or chants, no sacrifices, no dealings with spirits. There IS a ditzy Divination teacher at Hogwarts, who appears in the 3rd book, but she--and her class--are played for laughs. The magic involved is utilitarian, not supernatural; but to some, magic is still magic, and forbidden. Again, this may be a good point for discussion with your kids. There&#8217;s also been some flap about one of the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone&#8217;s creators, Nicholas Flamel (fictional here, but he DID exist, and tried to create a Philosopher&#8216;s Stone). Nicholas is 665 years old, and will die in the next year...making him 666. Hmmm....a Satanic reference? More like coincidence. Rowling based the books in the early 1990s, and the real Nicholas Flamel would have been about 665 years old then.Also, Harry DOES NOT summon the dead. Through a magical object--The Mirror of Erised--Harry sees his heart&#8217;s desire--the parents and family he barely knew. He does not interact with them.There is a scene in the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone that may disturb younger kids: While in the Forbidden Forest, Harry spies a slain unicorn...and someone drinking its blood in order to stay alive. But as a centaur points out to Harry, this is considered a monstrous crime...only the most evil individuals would resort to such measures. Still, parents might want to be wary of this scene.If you have concerns about these books, read them with your kids and discuss what you agree and disagree with. Will these books bring kids into the occult or teach kids disobedience? Only if parents allow it! Make it clear to kids that this is pure FANTASY. Kids are going to want to read these books; what they take from them is up to their parents and guardians. This could be an opportunity to bond with your children. For further reading, there are articles in Christian and parent-oriented magazines and online. There&#8217;s also Connie Neal&#8217;s book \\"What&#8217;s A Christian to do with Harry Potter?\\"I hope this review helps. I am sorry it&#8217;s so long."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling has hit the jackpot with her Harry Potter series. I put off reading them as long as I could. I tend to turn my nose up at anything that causes a mass furor, simply because I tend to be disappointed. Well, I finally read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone shortly before the movie came out because my mom wanted to take my kids to see it.I could NOT put this book down!!! I read it in ONE day, I was so enthralled by the story and characters. I have since read it as a bedtime story (one chapter at a time, obviously) to my two children, and they've both grown to love it.The characters are charming and enjoyable, the descriptions are very vivid, and the fantastic world that Rowling creates is a wonderful place to visit... if only we could stay!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was handed this book on tape by my sister I didn't know anything about them. I thought Harry Potter was the name of the author. I really didn't look at them. I'm a Christian and if I had known what they were about I probably would have been against them. My sister insisted that I listen to them in my free time since I didn't have anytime to read. I was mentaly struggling, with finances and a new baby as well as a home business. I wasn't interested in anything and had no desire in my life and no real gratification in anything except my baby. I stuck a tape in while I was on the computer and my son was sleeping. I didn't hear a word. I rewound it and started again. Again I never heard a word. The third time I vowed that I would listen. I listened to the first chapter a bit but mostly caught the part about a cat reading a map and then a sign. I was interested because I thought that it was a story about smart cats and that was different. Then I really got sucked in to the story. This story and all the other stories that followed have been a joy in my life. I love leaving my mundane worries and going to Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. I see nothing evil about this story as it is the telling of good vs. evil like many of the stories I enjoy such as Star Wars, and Lord of the Ring. I started being happy again in my personal life and my spirit continues to soar to happiness when I read this book and others. I agree as some negative reviewers have said that this is a Cinderella story. I happen to love Cinderella stories and this one is totally different because Harry makes his own choices. Cinderella was lucky to be chosen by the prince so she could live happily ever after. Harry on the other hand being lucky to be a wizard and leave his rude aunt and uncle's home to go to another place which is more of a happy home and yet very unlucky with many other things such as losing his parents is not like Cinderella in that he has to work more for his happy ending.I wish these books were not so popular because these books feel like they are my books. That they were meant for me. I have no way to express the gratitude I have for these books that have helped me out of my long depression. Thank you JK Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is about a boy called Harry Potter that survived a murder attempt by the same man that killed her parents.As he was a baby then, Albus Dumbledore(Richard Harris), the headmaster of Howarts, carries him to his uncle's house.Harry lives there, but one day a letter for Harry from Howarts (the magic school) was delivered. His uncle stole him the letter, and he doesn't know what the letter said until Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane)goes to the house where he was and gives him other letter (her uncle damaged the letters that were delivered before). The letter said that they invited him to study in Howarts.Like that, the new life of Harry Potter (the most famous boy in his world), starts.His uncle Bernon was afraid, because he doesn't like the idea of having a boy that can do strange things in his house.But in the shcool he meets a lot of people, and he is very popular. And his best friends were Ron Wesley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Not all the people were so friendly, for example: Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Ghoul (Verne Troyer).The book was awesome, and the film was very exciting too... Warner knows how to do interesting, new and strange things.The only thing that is better than the film, is the book.Because when you are reading the boook, you can imagine how Harry Potter or the magic monsters are.In the school Harry Potter starts to play quidditch, the oficial sport in the magic world. He is very good, and her coach is Oliver Wood (Sean Biggerstaff).The book has an excellent end. And the magic animals that appear are fantastic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There has been a lot of fuss about &quot;satanic&quot; elements in the Harry Potter novels, so I was careful to read this book before passing it along to my nephew as a Christmas gift. Frankly, I didn't find any reason for concern: the book is very much in the tradition of such children's classics as Baum's Oz novels, which have featured witches, sorcerers, goblins and the like without ever once being accused of satanic overtones.The major difference between such as the Oz books and Harry Potter is that Oz--and others like it--are set in a completely imaginary world, while Harry Potter is not. While this is probably the very thing that its detractors find most upsetting, it is actually the very thing that makes the book so much fun to read, for its fantasy elements take on a literal quality that allow for the willing suspension of disbelief in a way not previously seen in books written for children. It is a very sophisticated bit of writing, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series myself.These are not, by the way, books written for young children. Most six and seven year olds will be completely out of their depth. They are more appropriate to the ten-year-old and over crowd, who will have less difficulty reading them on their own."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After years of hearing about the Harry Potter craze, I recently decided to surrender my stubborness and read this first book. Actually I read it after recommendations, not only from those younger than me, but even my mother was urging me to give Book One a chance. I am a college student, and in finding a space of free time in my schedule to read about something other than my usual texts, I decided to take a break and see what all of the fuss was about.At first this story seemed to remind me of Roald Dahl's \\"James and the Giant Peach,\\" which I read back in the Dark Ages (elementary school). In no time at all I was absorbed into the book, flipping pages as quickly as I normally do with my favorite novels. Rowling's characters are may appear cliche at first (the hero, the villain, the bully, the best friends, the trusted advisors etc), but as the story progresses you can not see them NOT playing roles in the plot development. Each one has interesting attributes, and are entertaining to watch as the story smoothly moves along.It's a story involving many themes: it's a mystery, a coming of age story, at some points suspense, and at some points comical! For being listed as a children's book, it has plot twists that could even surprise an avid reader. I wish I could describe how wonderfully creative this book is, but honestly I can not find the correct words. After years of reading more \\"sophisticated\\" books, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" was able to unlock my imagination and bring me back to a time when reading truly created worlds unfathomable to those accustomed to analyzing literature.(... If) you are thinking about buying this book or are just curious to see what the \\"Harry Potter Craze\\" is all about, I urge you to buy this book. If (like me) you remember a time when you enjoyed setting your imagination free and reading books as children, buy this book. It's rather inexpensive, maybe not compared to other children's books but definitely in comparison to others on bestseller lists (...). This may be a book initially written for children, but with its exciting plot and beautifully descriptive characters and images, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is definitely a story adults can cherish."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Definitely a book with more than one level, like the Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, or anything by Dhall.

I found the same similarities in Harry Potter, and yes, I truly enjoyed it. Yes, Potter is a commercial hype machine. Yes, with more films to come, more toys, more and more franchised products (kitchen brooms anyone?) there is sure to be backlash. But if any book gets a child to read, and become a lifelong reader, more power to it. Cheers, Harry! I look forward to our next adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I want to start by saying first of all anyone comparing this book to other fantasy titles such as the Fellow ship of the Ring, needs to wakeup. Harry Potter is a chlidrens and young adult liturature book . Yet i believe that this is a great book for people of all ages because it is both funny and serious at times. I would say that anyone under the age of eight this book might be a bit hard to comprehend. Yet for anyone over that age this should be an enjoyful book for all.This is a tale of a young child who has grown up with his aunt and uncle which hate him. Of course he feels that he is a nothing and nobody cares about him. Till one day a feathered friend drops him a letter. Which of course as always his uncle gets to look at first. When he sees that is says Hogwarts(school of wizzards) he flips. He burns it but the owl does not quit and drops hundreds of letters into the house at a time.Till finally another friend never knew he had shows up. His name is Hagrid the giant and the keeper of keys at Hogwarts. And he has come to take Harry with him. I hope i have helped you in your discission to read this book it is a great story and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Unlike most people I (who am old enough to have children of my own!)was at first rather sceptical about the whole Harry Potter craze. Then, I went to the cinema with my friend and she wanted to watch the Harry Potter movie; I reluctantly agreed, expecting a typical children's movie full of wooden and empty characters. Thus I was surprised and delighted to be confronted with one of the most sheerly entertaining cinematic experiences I have had for a long time! This convinced me to go and read the book and I went and bought it the next day. The book was even better! This is not great literature but for great storytelling, wonderful characters (I especially am fond of Hermione--she reminds me of myself when I was at her age!!), wit, comedy, vivid imagination and a fantastic plot twist--all ingredients sure to keep children (and adults) hooked--this book is a treat and one of the best children's novels I have read--well, since I was a child myself about the same age as Harry Potter! I read Book 1 in a single day and have now swiftly moved on to Book 2. These books are almost as good as the Chronicles of Narnia series by CS Lewis or the Malory Towers &amp; Famous Five series' of Enid Blyton. In short, magical."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"All you people talking about how &lt;in a sarcastic high pitched voice&gt; This book encourages kids to practice witch craft. IT DOESN'T. I had put something else up there in the title but it wasn't very christian so I took it down. Video games and movies do not promote violence and this book does not promote witchcraft.Having said that i'd like to say to all you people who are wanting to find out something about the book, that this book is great. At first I didn't want to read it because it was just a fad. But God had a different plan. One night at my friends house his Power went out and we were bored. He immediatley whipped out a flashlight and starting reading the chamber of secrets. Thats the 2nd book. He told me to read the 1st book so I sat there telling myself how much I was gonna hate this book. I couldn't take my eyes off it. His power came back on and he told me to come and play on the computer. And I (gulp)...said...NO!!!!!!!If you only knew how seriouse this was. he was dumbstruck. Anyway thats not the point. The point is this is a great book and you shouldn't listen to all the people who say it's not. They were obviously hurt as a child and are now trying to ruin your lives. This book is really good, It of course can't be better than Tolkein. Saying that would be blasphemouse.(Just Joking) This seriously is a great book read it. But if your deciding which movie to go see I would have to sayFELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 17 year old high school student and have just finished reading this book to my 7 year old brother. We both thoroughly enjoyed the book and it was difficult for me to wait until my brother was present to continue reading (Okay, I cheated; I just read the last three chapters without him.).

I not only plan to read all seven books, but buy all of them on Amazon.com in hardcover.

So if you are not sure about buying the Harry Potter series don't hesitate order it now. Everyone in your family will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were the best books I ever read and I can't wait to get the third. I'd recommend this book to anyone that enjoys action, fantasy and magic. I read the first chapter and said to myself &quot;why is everyone so crazy about this book?&quot; but when I read the second chapter I knew why (don't skip the first chapter though, because you wont under stand anything.) I loved the way Rowling made it like she planned the second book before the first. Rowling wrote it so you could hear the different voices in your head while your reading! The characters were so alive and they make you feel like your there. My favorite parts were the Quidditch matches and the holidays. I had only one problem with the books,I WAS TORTURED WHEN I READ THE FIRST TWO AND THEN THE THIRD ONE WASN'T OUT YET!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I await with anticipation the next book coming in September.

The characters are incredible( I'm convinced that Ron or Harry will marry Hermione)!!!!!! The plot is suspensefull and you have got to read it. also if you like the Harry Potter books you have to read the Redwall books. I've got the third book on order and I have to say is......

Having never read the other books did not deter me from understanding the plot at all, and actually the movies helped me to GREATLY visualize characters i would have otherwise been at a loss to understand.So...i am finally reading The Sorcerers Stone, and then i'll read through them all eventually.Yes, the series is great.

Then, in anticipation of the movie, decided to read a little of The Socerer's Stone to get an idea of what all the hoopla was about. At the risk of sound trite, I couldn't put it down. Once I did (which was when I finished it), I immediately worked through book two and then book three. (I've just ordered book four and eagerly await it.)With more than 3000 other reviews already posted, there is very little I can add except to say to anyone who, like me, thought that they were a little too mature, too old, too well-read, or too emotionally advanced to enjoy Ms. Rowling's creation, &quot;Get on with it! Do it now! Stop depriving yourself!&quot;These books are a pure unmitigated delight. The allusions to mythology, fairytales, and popular culture are both many and extremely clever. Even someone like me who did not attend a private school, can enjoy the school rivalries and tricks.Buy this book. Read it. Now!

For those who like fantasy, magic and strange occurrences, this book delivers. It has dragons, witches, potions, spells, wizards, tricks, and suspense.

However, if you want something more realistic, insightful, and more connected to world issues, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In reaction to all of the hype, I had to check out this book.I was pleastantly surprised! Rowling writing keeps the interest of her readers, no matter what their age.

Rowling, whose own story is a remarkable one. A single mom on welfare, ex-school teacher, and unpublished writer penning this adventure on a table in a London caf&eacute;, makes this all the more, a magical tale. Today, we have &quot;Pottermania&quot;, thanks to the release of the film version of the book. It is enough to make every &quot;Muggle&quot; snuggle next to a cozy fire and immerse themselves in the adventures of Hogwarts. By the way, a Muggle is a non-magical person, and Hogwarts is a school for training in wizardry.The novel begins with Harry delivered by owl to the home of the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, after the unfortunate death of his parents. The first several chapters describe his rocky relationship with them, until a new friend, Hagrid, enlightens him to his identity, and sweeps him away to Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, he finds some new friends who help him fight against dark forces led by... oops... I cannot mention his name.Yes, Pottermania is alive and well in our Muggle world, even a kid in my PE class wanted to play &quot;Quidditch&quot; the other day. This becomes Harry's favorite pastime at Hogwarts, and he develops into an excellent &quot;seeker&quot;; nevertheless, it would be difficult to play the game in PE due to the lack of necessary equipment. Quidditch requires flying broomsticks and three important balls, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the Golden Snitch. These items are unavailable at local sporting good stores, and most likely, would not meet budget demands.Rowling is a creative genius and Harry Potter will become a classic series for both children and adults alike. It is magical fantasy along the lines of JRR Tolkien (LORD OF THE RINGS) and CS Lewis (CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) ultimately dealing with the battle of good versus evil. It is amazing there are those in our society who would strike fear in the hearts of parents about their children reading certain books. Potter has his critics as well, but remember, this is fictional entertainment, and by no means, will lead your kids into witchcraft and sorcery. If there are concerns, read them with your young ones and explain the differences; nevertheless, jump on the Hogwarts Express, and simply rejoice in the fact that our children are reading again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was extemely well writen, and although most believe that this book was child orientated it is a book that can be enjoyed by mostly everyone.

Harry not only was unwanted, but also forced to live under the stairs in a cupboard.Harry's aunt and uncle knew of his majical powers to be, and wished to hide them from him.

J.K. Rowling has really done an excellent job with this book. 'like Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling has wizardry inside' (the New York Times Book Review).

I remember marking the calendar and standing in lines for later books. Later, the movies took over and kind of made me start to hate the Harry Potter books due to changing my perceptions of events and characters.I recently watch The Deathly Hallows Part II and decided to start reading the series over again, that I've not picked up for years. I decided to do this through the Kindle and is was an amazing experience. The pictures at the start of each chapter look amazing and the formatting of the books match the hard copies perfect. I can honesty say that of all the eboooks I've read, this one looked amazing.It was amazing to see the themes of the first book over again and seeing how they foreshadow things to come. I believe it was better reading this book the second time, knowing how things end up. For instance knowing reasons why Snape hated and treated Harry so bad, was mainly due to his love for his mother and personal conflicts.If you own a Kindle, I would highly commend reading this spellbound story over again and enjoying the tale from the beginning!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have always wanted to read the HP books, hearing only good things about them but they were so large and I hate carrying around a really big book or even just trying to cope with one while reading it so I waited for the e-booK.

I which case we would have been paying full price for the e-book as the dtb....Then she distributed it through her own site so that it could be read by ANY e-reader, What a smart move that was.....and then, the downloading process was so easy.Kudos to the Lady!

Thank you Amazon!! Book one wasn't my favorite, but it will still capture your imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"These are not only some of my favorite books, it's one of my favorite stories--up there with Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The world of Harry Potter is so enchanting that when people ask you if you could live in any fictional reality, it'll probably rank near the top, if not #1.The book opens by introducing Harry, who lives with his aunt and uncle, who clearly want nothing to do with him. He's hostile, bitter, and frustrated. Everything changes when he learns that he's in fact a wizard whose destiny is intertwined with the supreme villain of magic, Voldemort. Shortly thereafter, he's whisked away to wizard school (called Hogwarts), where he meets the supporting cast of characters for the story.It isn't long before he learns that Voldemort is after an ancient, powerful artifact, and that he has spies and allies within the walls of Hogwarts, and that he alone must stop Voldemort.What I loved most about these books is the sheer creativity that Rowling poured into it. She really crafted a unique view of a reality wherein the magic and mundane co-exist, the latter unaware of the former. She gave many details of this world attention and the result is a world of fantastic-yet-believable possibilities that makes one part of you want to go looking for London's secret entrance to the magical bazaar.Although these books have a YA flair, the characters are very well-developed . You don't have the feeling that it's all just about Harry and everyone else are basically cardboard cutouts that serve the purpose of forwarding the plot centered around him. The other characters, such as Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, Snape, etc., all have their own desires and struggles and you wind up caring about many more people than just Harry.The characters are also very well orchestrated and intertwined. They play off each other very convincingly and move the plot forward while always staying true to their established personalities.The antagonist and his cast are formidable foes for Harry and Co., and as the story unfolds through the entire series, the forces of good and evil grow stronger and stronger, leading to a clash of epic proportions. Rowling also handles continuity very well throughout the series. Details revealed early on are not forgotten in the later books--to the contrary, they are used to build the plot and keep everything tied together.All in all, this book stands out as the beginning of one of the most captivating series I've ever read. Although book one wasn't my overall favorite, it will grab your mind and imagination in a way that you rarely get to experience. If you buy this book, get ready to buy all the rest because you won't be able to stop."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to give the first Harry Potter five stars, not just because I am myself a great fan of J K Rowling, but because after years and years of trying to get my son to read this was the book that finally won him over! He read it and re-read it,then read all the rest of the Harry Potter series, moved on to Tolkien, and hasn't looked back since. Ten years on, he still has all of the Harry Potter series and I trip over ragged and well-thumbed copies all over the house. So if any of you are worrying about a child who refuses to read anything - try this!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit I came late to the HP party. I saw the first movie before I read the first book. Then I noticed all the news about the series and I had to read the books. I bought the first two books at the same time and the third one not long after. Needless to say I was hooked and so was my daughter. I soon discovered many of my friends and their children were equally as enthrawled by this series, and we spent hours discussing what would come in the next book, and the next. Now that all seven books are out and I have read each one several times, my favorites are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. I did enjoy 2 and 4, but not as much as the others. All in all this is one of the best series of books I have read in a long time. I hope the next generation of readers gets as much enjoyment out of it as I, my daughter, and my friends did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book I bought was the first for me written in english, I'm an italian guy and it was a present for my sister.She the book is really good and it is more funny to read it in the original language instead of in italian..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What I absolutely love about this book is that it makes you think (well, with a little imagination), that maybe the people next store could be wizards. Or muggles raising a wizard. Or that when you hear or read in the media that an animal escaped from a zoo, maybe it had a little \\"magical\\" help.While \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series is wonderful, and it has wizards and such, Middle Earth reminds you of the Middle Ages, which seems understandably distant. Both Gandalf and Dumbledore are mighty wizards, but you can see Dumbledore being your school principal more than Gandalf.While the \\"Rings\\" crowd visits many strange lands to have their adventures, no travelling is necessary in the Harry Potter world. Just about all the action takes place on the grounds of Hogwarts, which in itself has unlimited space for imagination.The exception, of course, is the Dursley's home. At first I could find criticism with these muggles as being too one-dimensional to be fair, especially since most of those reading this will be muggles. The thing that makes it terrific is that the characters are written in a very, very funny manner. Rowling has numerous throw-away funny lines, such as Vernon Dursley using his wife's fruitcake to nail the fire-place shut that make it hilarious.But what makes me like the Potter book more than the \\"Rings\\" books is the very believable fallability of the wizarding community. The \\"Rings\\" crowd tends to sometimes get too high and noble about everything. With the wizarding community, we find that most of the characters each has a bucketful of faults. This includes our hero himself, who has a temper he can't control, and a disdain for rules that both benefits and penalizes him.The most glorious introduction to a world that both kids and adults can share."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I remember when I was younger I was eager to get a copy of this book. With new words no one used or heard of before its time such as muggle or hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.Great book for the imagination as we follow harry on twists and turns and during confrentations with certain characters.Definetly recommended for the youth of us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have repeatedly read this book. It's an excellent book, with believable characters and a very fresh, imaginative plot. However, there is a lot of old ideas simply rewritten and compiled together. In fact, the whole series is like that. Sorcerer's Stone? Basilisk? Veela? A lot of these have been used and reused but not presented to a child audience. How clever. Also, the books seem to fall apart very easily. Not very well-made.In conclusion, a good read but not worthy of the Newberry Award, not only because of the unimaginative writing but also because the book was written and published in Britain."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the charecter in a book ever"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is such an insripartion to young readers everywhere, it really helps children widden their imagniations, and brodden their vocabulary.

They stated that the Bible forbids witchcraft and that this book about a young wizard is dangerous. You can rest assured that when I heard this, I was definitely going to read this book. I'm glad I did so.No, the preacher is wrong. This is not a manual to recruit our youth into witchcraft and the occult. Rather, this is a charming fantasy in which a loser stands up to bullies and becomes a winner. It is about character in which youngsters choose the right friends and make the right choices. In fact, Harry and his friend Ron discover that they misjudged Hermione, a fellow student at the witchcraft school. They got to know her and the three became inseparable, their strong characters being their bond. The book is filled with dry humor, adventure, mystery and most importantly, clean fun and good values.So, I thank the preacher and his wife for making ne curious about this book. I hope the preacher inspired many others to read it too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a great book!It's about an 11 year old boy who lives with his horible aunt, uncle and cosin.But when a letter inviting him to the wonderful world of magic comes to his front door, his life turns for the best.When at Hogwarts(his school)he meets friends and foes.

Rowling has a wonderful way with words. She put the book together so well, I read it over and over, even though the surprise ending wasn't so surprising any more. It was very cleverly written, with all the names, spells, and ways of the Wizarding World. And you didn't feel like a boring person being known as a &quot;muggle&quot; instead of a wizard. I loved the descriptions, and the feeling you get every time you read it. It also had some funny parts, which came unexpectedly, but made the book all the more fun.

I couldn't put it down. The paperback version was passed along and I bought the hardback for my daughter for Christmas. We began reading it together at bedtime. She couldn't get enough.. begging me to read 'just one more chapter' each night, often I would agree just because I wanted to keep reading it as well. We have already finished the book and are awaiting the next two that we just ordered. I am sure we will be done with the entire series in record time. The characters and the suspense are both interesting and intriguing for children and yet keep an adult extremely interested and just as eager for more as the child."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I grew up on fantasy and science fiction, particularly the works of Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, and Jules Verne. So, when I picked up the copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was transported back to the enjoyment I felt then. Never have I been so captivated by a novel, save perhaps for the Wheel of Time series.Harry Potter, a ten-year old child in England, has begun to receive letters in massive amounts that seem to follow him wherever he goes. Once he is finally able to open one, he discovers that he is a wizard and has been admitted to one of the most prestigious of all wizarding schools: Hogwarts. After purchasing his equipment (such as the requisite wand), Harry gets on the train, where he meets a new friend...and a new enemy. Little does he know that Voldemort, the dark wizard who killed his parents so long ago and whose powers were destroyed by Harry Potter, controls one of the teachers at Hogwarts and seeks to gain his revenge...Very incredible, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 52 year old who has a passion for reading, a passion for children and now an inescapable passion for Harry Potter. Rowling's successful series is proof that character and imagination coupled with wit and inspirational wisdom can capture the child in all of us. Yes,Yes, I too, am &quot;Wild about Harry!&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I don't know why I wanted to read this book; between my eleven year old brother and the mass media, I had been surrounded by Harry Potter hype to the point of nausea. I expected it to be simplistic and juvenile, not to mention overrated. However, I picked up the book and finished it in a single sitting. I was so amazed! As a fantasy authour myself, I am extremely critical about the books I read. Harry Potter was not the best book I have ever read, nor the best fantasy book, nor even the best book for children. However, it blew me away and kept me hooked. Hilariously funny, yet a thrilling page-turner, Harry Potter has something for everyone who has ever been a kid.J.K. Rowling has an enormous talent for creating charcters the reader can connect to - who hasn't known a bossy, know-it-all, yet good-hearted girl like Hermione? Everyone has had a teacher that they were sure detested them, like Professor Snape. Many of the characters in Harry's world are archetypal, which sometimes makes a story seem cliched, but in this case gives it a sense of familiarity. Albus Dumbledore is similar to Tolkein's Gandalf or Obi-Wan Kenobi. Dudley, Harry's repulsive cousin (who is the most LOATHABLE character in the book), is a fat, spoiled meany straight out of a Roald Dahl novel. Voldemort, a.k.a. \\"You-Know-Who,\\" becomes mysterious and dreaded enough to invoke real chills in readers, unlike many villains these days. My personal favourite is Draco Malfoy, the nasty creep who dabbles in dark magic. I can just picture this kid and his cronies (the Slytherins) looking just like those Goth kids in high school (of which I was one...maybe that's why I can identify with him.)This book is definitely good for young children, but it is pretty dark at times. All the better! Personally, I am fascinated with witchcraft, the occult, and the so called \\"Dark Arts,\\" and the scene of one character (no spoilers!) drinking the silvery blood of a unicorn like a vampire sent chills of delight up my spine. However, the MESSAGE of Harry Potter is POSITIVE! It teaches friendship, bravery, the importance of learning, cooperation, and many other good moral values. I am so thankful that, in a Pok&eacute;mon-infested society, millions of kids and adults are being enthralled by (oh my gosh!)fantasy books. Moreover, I am glad that this incredible new trend has not only entertainment value, but literary and moral value as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great!

I have meet and talked to very, very few people who did not actually enjoy the book, i.e. those who actually read it. Highly recommend this one. Am looking forward to more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone effectively portrays supernatural elements and their ability to create the adventurous plot in her mystical story of a heroic young boy. The entire novel encompasses supernatural items that enhance Harry Potter's unexpected ventures. Supernatural is introduced in the opening of the book with Harry's unusual lightning bolt scar in his forehead. This shows the audience that, though Harry seems like a neglected, poor child, he is different than other children. It reveals everything unique and astonishing about him and also foreshadows the revelation of his wizardry. Harry's scar shows his sensitivity and his connection to his lost past. The scar is also an allusion to Odysseus's scar in Homer's poem the Odyssey. When Harry first arrives at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he grabs the attention of Professor McGonagall by his performance at flying lessons. Because of this incident, Harry joins the Quidditch team, on which he breaks many records and wins heroism. Rowling incorporates a supernatural element that appeals to childlike instincts in her readers. This form of fun and games upholds the story's lighter side. It stresses the importance of teamwork and use of magical powers unselfishly, unlike the evil Voldemort. When Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he is forced to examine himself and his desires for the first time. This supernatural element exposes Harry's genuine character. He wishes to see his parents alive and to capture the stone for the common good. The mirror teaches Harry that people are shaped by their desires. Throughout the exciting novel, Harry's life is drastically changed as he leaves his average home and enters a new world of supernatural. He is taught much about life and relationships with the aid of supernatural elements. Rowling's vast incorporation of the supernatural into Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone perfects the book's course and hits the target."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book because so many people recommand it. And the movie is also one of the reason I started to read the book. When I start reading the book, I was attracted by the theme and the magical things they have in the book. And then I find myself reading it in any of my free time. This book provide advantures and magical things a lot of books lacks of. And it makes people wondering in the world of imagination. And the arthor of this book described many details of the life of a boy who just discover he is a wizard.

The Harry Potter series is one of the top one hundred non-accepted books in schools. One reason why it's banned is because there are graphic situations in the series, like death. Another reason might be that some religions consider magic evil, which is in the book repeatedly. Some reasons people feel it shouldn't be banned is it gives an imaginative journey to another place which lets it's readers get away from daily stresses. It also lets the reader experience why people fear things they don't understand. I think the book's series should not be banned because it gives a passport to another realm. If Harry Potter's series is banned, it takes away the author's freedom of speech and takes away freedom from the reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I realize that there's undoubtedly nothing that I can say about this book that hasn't been said somewhere in the 4814 previous reviews, but allow me to join the chorus of extremely pleased readers celebrating the addition of another truly great read in the world; there are few enough books of this caliber that any addition to the list is sufficient cause for joy.What makes this book so good? It is readable by children, and interesting enough to encourage children who would generally prefer to watch TV or movies to actually pick up a book and READ. Beyond that, it's one of those delightful books that is actually as interesting to adults (at least, adults who haven't had their imaginations atrophied yet) as it is to its alleged target audience; like Tolkein's \\"The Hobbit\\", or Barrie's \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", adults can read this without feeling the least patronized. It has a writing style that is at once easy enough for the young reader without seeming simplistic to the adult reader; the same is true of the vocabulary it uses. The characters are well-developed and fascinating, both the central characters (who are children) and the adult characters with whom they interact. The villain is unambiguous, and right and wrong are likewise clear-cut, as befits a book targeted at children, but the characters do not seem in the least stereotyped.Hard as it is to imagine, this book completely lives up to the hype. It is a classic and will be as popular fifty years from now as it is currently."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"How much fun can you have with a book? A whole cauldron full!! I am 40+ (no kids) and have thoroughly enjoyed this series of books. Some of my fellow MBA classmates were reading the Harry Potter books while we were finishing our final semester in grad school and I see now why they sometimes let the required reading go by the wayside. Fortunately, I finished school before Christmas and gave myself the wonderful gift of all five books in the series. I am actually half-way through the final book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and I am both terribly excited and horribly sad about coming to the end. I most assuredly endorse this tome along with the four that follow.

It opened up a new world for me and nobody has really figured out how to get me out of it yet. My mom read the whole thing aloud and I could sometimes read a couple sentances ahead. Then she read the second book to me and I could actually read a few pages ahead of her. By the third book I could read chapters ahead and that summer, when The Goblet of Fire was released I read the whole thing without assistance in three days. I've read the books so many times now that my numerous copies are literally in pieces. The books offer many levels of reading. When I was younger, they were simply stories that I would fall asleep to, but now I do research on the backgrounds of names and other possible symbolism. When book 5 came out I had analyzed practically the whole book before I read it.

This book starts at that age when we all know (knew) we are obviously in the wrong family. Harry's doesn't have Cinderella's wicked stepmother, but he does have a terrible aunt, uncle, and cousin, and a bed in the closet under the stairs.Harry's rescuer, the giant Hagrid (rather than a pixie Tinkerbelle) lets Harry know what we all want to hear. Not only is this not his family, but Harry is special. In fact it seems that everyone except Harry knows how special he is, and the circumstances that brought him to the Dursley's house in the first place.Like all good fairy tales, Harry must leave home, overcome his own lack of knowledge, learn who to trust, who not to trust, learn about himself, and earn the right to come home again. Who but J. K. Rowling has ever had this happen in the setting of a school, and have it be so much fun.It's a beautiful tale, along the lines of the best fairy tales. It has to encourage children to look forward to some new kind of education. And it has a story line that keeps you reading once you start. Read it to your younger children, let your older children read it for themselves. And all of you -- enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i liked the book because it was fantasy.it was very enjoyable,not like some books that are a drag to read.i hope the other book in the series are this good!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first installment of Harry Potter has lived up to all the hype.

I know that some people think Harry Potter is only so popular because of all the prizes it has won and all the good reviews that have been written, but I only read it because a friend recommended it to me, and at the time I had absaloutely no idea whatsoever about how famous the book was and I don't think it had won the Smarties Prize yet.

Something about Rowling's story just brought out my inner child, and made me experience life as an eleven year old with all the things I could have wanted and didn't have at that age, for a too-short 300 pages.

It's not just for kids or adults....it's for everyone! I found myself holding my breath before Harry got in trouble or cheering when he and his freinds prevailed! It was a great escape book.

What could I possibly add?Just the testimony of a snooty 40-year-old who knows next to nothing about the fantasy genre and rarely reads bestselling fiction. I have fond memories of the Oz books, and loved _The Hobbit_ once upon a time, but I have never read Lewis's Narnia series or heard of Alexander's Prydains and Susan Cooper's books. The only fantasy I keep with me is Ray Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, which I adore (and I suppose Timothy Findley's incredible _Not Wanted On the Voyage_ and Bulgakov's _The Master and Margarita_ qualify, although they are clearly for grownups). Of late I have been reading nonfiction books about consciousness and memory, _Gotham_, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and _The Intuitionist_.The first time I heard of Harry Potter was at a party in August 1999 when a fellow Harvard alum told me he and his wife were reading the books to each other. It sounded mildly interesting. A month or two later, the name was everywhere, and I turned up my nose at it. If EVERYBODY was reading it, there couldn't be that much to it. (I made the same minor error in years past with _Helter Skelter_ and _The World According To Garp_, which turned out to be better than I expected when I finally got to them, but not THAT great.) When I heard Christian fundamentalists were attacking the books for &quot;encouraging witchcraft and sorcery,&quot; however, I decided it was my civic duty to read them. (Why isn't anyone protesting &quot;the torture of animals&quot; -- blowing up a salamander with fireworks, petrifying a cat -- in book two, by the way? Just kidding.)I found this book delightful. I read it aloud to my wife, and she read some to me when my voice got tired. The characters are imaginative, the plot suitably gripping, and there is plenty of humor -- broad and subtle -- to reach you wherever your sensibility resides. Give it three stars for grownups and four or five for kids. If the Potter books get lots of children to read, more power to 'em. I don't remember taking Tolkien or Oz or Grimm fairy tales seriously as a child (or even Santa, for very long); why are some adults unable to believe most kids can separate fantasy from reality?We're on the downhill side of book two, and I think my wife likes the stories even better than I do (not just because I do the voices with great expression). I see that book four, not due out until July, is the number one bestseller on Amazon.

I have fond memories of the Oz books, and loved _The Hobbit_ once upon a time, but I have never read Lewis's Narnia series or heard of Alexander's Prydains and Susan Cooper's books. The only fantasy I keep with me is Ray Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, which I adore (and I suppose Timothy Findley's incredible _Not Wanted On the Voyage_ and Bulgakov's _The Master and Margarita_ qualify, although they are clearly for grownups). Of late I have been reading nonfiction books about consciousness and memory, _Gotham_, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and _The Intuitionist_.The first time I heard of Harry Potter was at a party in August 1999 when a fellow alumnus of Harvard told me he and his wife were reading the books to each other. It sounded mildly interesting. A month or two later, the name was everywhere, and I turned up my nose at it. If EVERYBODY was reading it, there couldn't be that much to it. (I made the same minor error in years past with _Helter Skelter_ and _The World According To Garp_, which turned out to be better than I expected when I finally got to them, but not THAT great.) When I heard Christian fundamentalists were attacking the books for &quot;encouraging witchcraft and sorcery,&quot; however, I decided it was my civic duty to read them. (Why isn't anyone protesting &quot;the torture of animals&quot; -- blowing up a salamander with fireworks, petrifying a cat -- in book two, by the way? Just kidding.)I found this book delightful. I read it aloud to my wife, and she read some to me when my voice got tired. The characters are imaginative, the plot suitably gripping, and there is plenty of humor -- broad and subtle -- to reach you wherever your sensibility resides. Give it three stars for grownups and four or five for kids. If the Potter books get lots of children to read, more power to 'em. I don't remember taking Tolkien or Oz or Grimm fairy tales seriously as a child (or even Santa, for very long); why are some adults unable to believe most kids can separate fantasy from reality?We're on the downhill side of book two, and I think my wife likes the stories even better than I do (not just because I do the voices with great expression). I see that book four, not due out until the summer, is already the sixth best selling item on Amazon. Nice work!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is not what I would call a masterpiece in my view. Why is this book better than &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; or &quot;The Hobbit&quot;? Why don't I see 900-something 5 star reviews on real books? Could somebody answer this for me? Is it just because this book is popular? Why aren't the other good books?I gave this book 1 star for effort and another for a, well, amusing story.About the sequels, take books like &quot;Goosebumps.&quot; Way too many sequels, BAD BOOKS. Rushed authors, BAD BOOKS. I predict #3 will be yet another BAD BOOK. Though I can't see how this was a STUPENDOUSLY WONDERFUL FABULOUS book either."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"if these books can get so overrated, there must be NO one out there who has read real fantasy. i mean, other fantasy books could use a bit of credit...especially Garth Nix's. besides, some of the events are too vulgar for the intended audience. just a little review, if you liked the series, try reading some REAL fantasy someday."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I may be the only person in the world who didn't love this book. I don't think it's a bad book, but I don't understand the big excitement about it. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are not that well developed, and frequently things happen that we as readers had no idea were possible. For me, it reads like an interesting children's movie screenplay. My fourth grade son read it before I did, and he agrees. We both liked the beginning and we both liked the quiddich matches, but felt the rest of the book fell flat."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am an avid reader of adult and children's books and am always looking for something to inspire my sons to read. It wasn't until Harry Potter that my 11 year old (now 12) discovered the joy of reading. He reluctantly took the book when I brought it home with his typical &quot;oh great mom, another book&quot; gratitude...Well, my heart soared when he started reading it and he couldn't put it down! He raved about how good it was, wouldn't sleep or EVEN watch TV. He has read all three in the series and is greatly anticipating the next one.While we have been waiting he has read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; by Philip Pullman, &quot;Dark Is Rising&quot; by Susan Cooper and &quot;Holes&quot; by Louis Sachar...all of which he says are even better than Harry, which he rates 11 on a scale 1-10.I have read the Sorcerer's Stone &amp; Chamber of Secrets (at my sons insistence) and find the books charming. The fast pace, high adventure, fun story and good writing make these books easy for kids to love. J.K.Rowling has my undying gratitude for turning my son onto the joy of reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just in case anyone was wondering about the longevity of this particular edition, it's not only leather-bound, but it's also printed on acid-free paper, so it should last for generations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to start out my review by saying that my children loved HARRY POTTER. Our nine year old son was ravenous for more reading after I read the first three chapters aloud to his sisters and him. I am always happy when a book inspires this! I have been reading aloud to our children on a regular basis for many years, and I have read a lot of good books. Therefore, HARRY POTTER would have received a higher rating from me if I had not previously read a wonderfully written trilogy by Madeline L'Engle from the same genre of fiction, called the TIME TRILOGY. These include A WRINKLE IN TIME, A WIND IN THE DOOR and A SWIFTLY TILTING PLANET. Our two older children were on the edge of their seats begging for &quot;just one more chapter&quot; every time we completed one. In my opinion, L'Engle is simply a better writer than Rowlings. She gives the reader the gift of being able to enter into the world of a loving family and becoming, for a time, a part of it. We grow close to each character and feel as though we are saying good-bye to close friends as we end the trilogy. I did not find myself identifying with anyone in Rowlings book in this way. In short, as I read through the first book with our three younger children, I found myself daydreaming about completing the book so we could start A WRINKLE IN TIME. I am interested to note the effect of L'Engle's books on these three. HARRY POTTER versus A WRINKLE IN TIME is akin to dime store chocolate versus Godiva. I like one, but I LOVE the other!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone The book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" by J.K. Rowling was fantastic. It captures the imagination right from the beginning, as Harry goes through one adventure after another. It is very fun and easy to read. I found it very difficult to put this book down. Rowling pulls you right into the fascinating magical world of Harry Potter. This book is a must read for all ages. Any chance of leading a normal childhood goes up in flames when Harry's parents are murdered by the evil wizard Lord Volemort. Harry is forced into living with his cruel relatives, the Dursleys. He is always being picked on by his cousin Dudley. Also he is constantly being scolded by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Hopes of happiness for Harry arise when he receives a letter accepting him to the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry meets Hagrid, a huge man at least 10 ft tall, and is taken away from the miserable life with the Dursleys. At Hogwarts, Harry befriends a boy named Ron and a know-it-all girl named Hermione. This starts the amazing adventures of Harry Potter. This book as you might have guessed is a fantasy.

Definitley no walk in the park, but what a fairytale story as possibly the most succesfull children's book ever. I LOVED this book, and that is no understatement, and I literally couldn't put it down. If it weren't for my obligations, I would have happily read it in one sitting. If you haven't bought it yet, I don't know what planet you're living on - buy it, and all those to come - take your phone off the hook, cancel all your appointments, and be ready for the most excellent adventure. Soon you too will be scratching the days off your calendar for the next release.

To be able to write a book that people enjoy, love, and read over and over again is accomplished by very few authors. I first read this book last year when I was 16, a friend of mine (13) had told me that it was the best book she had ever read. Of course, being the 'all mature 16 year old' I didnt think that I would really enjoy a book that a 13 year old girl had liked. However, she leant me the book and I was unable to put it down. I eventually finished it at around midnight of that first day, and then read it again soon after. If you are reading this reveiw and you havent read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, READ IT NOW. It is a book that will satisfy all agegroups. The other day I was on the London Underground for about ten minutes and saw no less than five people all reading a Harry Potter. How often have you seen this?There are only two other books that render the reader unable to put the book down willingly, and they are the sequals. If you get through the first chapter and have no desire to read further, then you are one in a billion."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great!

And refreshing it is to see a series of \\"children's literature\\" become so succesful--owing to its page after page of exciting delights!In Book 1 of this incredibly successful series (financially and otherwise), we find probably the most famous 11-year old in the world--Harry Potter!We meet young Harry as the ward of some very repulsive relatives (aunt, uncle, cousin), who clearly detest Harry (they make him sleep in a broom closet!). It does not take the reader long to sympathize with Harry. And then--something magical happens. He is visited by a representative of \\"the other world\\" and is invited to attend Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witchcraft. Suffice it to say, Harry is permitted to attend Hogwarts and there the fun--and adventure--begins! Of course, Hogwarts is not without its villains, secrets, and \\"good fellas\\"! Harry proceeds to \\"learn the ways\\" of wizardry! Harry's destiny seems clear--that he is to follow in the footsteps of his parents, who, unbeknownst to Harry for the past 11 years, were wizards themselves. Exciting adventure after exciting adventure follow--and we are introduced to the sport of the century Quidditch, a soccer-like game where players compete on broomsticks. Under all the hoopla, of course, is the \\"secret of the sorcerer's stone\\"--the principle plot concern here!Harry's--and the readers'--adventures have just begun!

I was so intrigued chapter after chapter that I had to keep reading until I finished the book, and I did finish it, that same day! It was by far the best book I had read in my thirteen years. It says that it's for ages 9-12, but I think it is for anyone who enjoys reading about fantasy fiction, that is mixed with a bit of humor and mystery.

Maybe I've just read too much of the much superior source stuff (like Roald Dahl and Terry Pratchett).

I finally broke down and read the first book when I witnessed the effect it had on a rambunctious cousin of mine. This eight year-old kid, who couldn't sit still if his life were at stake and positively vibrates in place most of the time, sat for four hours in a row (!!!) listening to an audio version of a Harry Potter book. I decided I had to know how this savage beast had been calmed, and picked up the first Harry Potter book. I had to kick myself for not being more open-minded and going with the flow. This is one fabulous book! More than once I found myself comparing Rowling to Roald Dahl, in both writing style, humor, and edginess. I got sucked in fast to the storyline, but what really kept me engaged was the storytelling. Sure, I wanted to know what was going to happen to little Harry next, but I loved just reading the sentences, absorbing the flavor of the writing. Frankly, I also love a children's book that doesn't flinch at nastiness - the Dursleys are absolutely awful, and Harry starts life tragically as an orphan. The darker elements, a la Dahl, really offer a punch that many \\"lighter\\" children's books lack. Utterly absorbing reading for any age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, what can I say about this book that hasn't already been said thousands of times before? Mrs. Rowling has skillfully woven elements from classic literature and her own imagination to create a fantastic literary world. The rich, detailed depictions of Hogwarts castle and it's inhabitants completely captured my imagination. Reading this book as a young adult, I felt as though I, a lone Muggle had been a passport to a realm completely hidden from the rest of the world. As I read Rowling's description of the sensation of flying on a broom, I found myself thinking \\"Man, I wish I could do that!\\" While the plot is more simplistic than those of the proceeding books in the series, the basic \\"rules\\" are presented and character personalities introduced to be built on as the books progress. (Those Christians who are worried about the potential \\"occultic\\" content of these books should read \\"The Key to Harry Potter\\" or \\"Finding God in Harry Potter\\" by John Granger before passing judgement. I am a Christian myself, and would not recommend these books if I did not think that they were harmless fun.)With its lavish details, plot twists and liberal doses of humor, this book makes for a fast read. Perfect summer reading material--or any time of the year, for that matter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"How was the book?At first when I started reading this book... I was wondering what any of it had to do with a young wizard (This only happens in the first chapter). Once I got to the second chapter things got much better. Once he got to Diagon Alley, I couldn't put the book down. This is a very good book.What is the book about?The book is about a young, 11 year old, wizard who finds out he is a wizard only a few days before he starts at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There is something there that Lord Vold... I mean You-know-who wants. Someone is not who you think. Read the book to fill in the blanks.Is this book child friendly?Yes. Mild language, I think once.Is this book religion friendly?Personally, I think it's obvious that it is to the Christian religion. They have Christmas in the book... sooo I don't see what the big deal is with the Christians buring books... they probably haven't read them. They see it has ainething to do with magic and put it down. Don't get me wrong, not all Christians burn Harry Potter books... plenty read them. The book burners are the people who must not have read them. Anyway, I really see no problem with this book religion-wise. There is nothing bad in here.So should I buy it?Definitely... and don't forget to read the whole series... questions will be answered ;-)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Let me start this out by saying I don't like Fantasy books. I also don't read children's literature much at all. However I got interested in this series because of the phenomenon of the author going from welfare (in Britain they call it the dole) to richer than the Queen in five years. Really, she did. Also, I'm an advocate of teaching children to read, and was a childhood bookworm and congenital nerd myself. When I saw a boy about 10 sitting in his mom's grocery cart reading a Harry Potter book, I knew I had to find out what all the fuss was about, and so I read the first book in the series. I suspect I'll be reading more.OK, for those who've been on the dark side of the moon for the last half-decade, Harry Potter is the orphaned nephew who lives with the Dursleys, residing under their stairs in a cupboard, constantly pursued by their stupid bully son Dudley. One day he recieves an invitation to go to school, and the school is no ordinary one, it's one for wizards. Harry of course is completely dumfounded (there are wizards?!?) but it's an escape from Dudley, so he goes. When he leaves on his journey, everything changes, and he turns out to have magical powers. The school is set up like a normal one, except the courses are in things like potions and flying. There is of course an adventure, part mystery, to darken the plot and give it suspense.It's amazing how good this book is, given that there's nothing that original here. The Dursleys are stereotypically mean to Harry and spoil Dudley shamelessly, no surprises here. They're fun to read about, however, and the rest of the book is the same. The mystery isn't that complex or involved, and there's nothing that surprising about it, but it's well-done and wonderfully contrived, and you enjoy it in spite of yourself. I think this book pretty much draws you to the sequel, and frankly I think J.K. Rowling deserves every penny, even if she is richer than the Queen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The setting of the book was at Hogwarts and all around the school and outside the school. The main characters were Harry,Hagrid,Ron,Harmani. What happens is Harry finds out he's a wizard and he goes to Hogwarts. He then finds out about the Sorcerers stone is at Hogwarts and all the teachers are trying to protect it from Voldamort who wants to steal it.I thought the book was pretty good but long. It had lots of action you really don't want to stop reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was WONDERFUL. I'm 23, and I loved it. My 7-yr-old niece loved it. And my 50-something-yr-old (MALE) coworker loved it. To be enjoyed by a wide variety of readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It took me awhile to catch on to what I like to call \\"The Harry Potter Obsession\\" but once I did, about 3/3.5 years ago...let's just say, I'd rather be face to face with Lord Voldemort himself then never read another word of J.K. Rowling's extraordinary work. Since I caught on to \\"the obesession\\" I've read all four books multiple- actually dozens of times, have watched the 1st movie like 50 and am anxiously waiting the arrival of the 2nd out on video April 11 2003. But I am not here to publicize for J.K Rowling. I am here for the review of her 1st book. In this book, which lays out the plot for all 7 of the Harry Potter books.(the 5th due to come out in June.)The series FYI will follow young wizard Harry Potter through 7 years of wizard school. Ok, so here's my review. Harry Potter, an average (or not so average) 11 year old boy being raised by his unkindly Aunt and Uncle who had taken him in unwillingly when his parents \\"died in a car crash\\" when he was a baby. Then he finds out that he is a wizard and is going to Hogwarts, a concealed (from the non-magic world \\"muggles\\")school for witchcraft and wizardry. And that his scar which his Aunt had always told him was a result of the car crash, was actually the result of an evil dark wizard who killed his parents with a single curse but failed to kill him. Well, before I get into a detailed summary of the entire novel I will stop, and if I've got you in anyway interested ...for god sakes...buy the book and Enjoy!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneBy: J.K. RowlingReviewed by A.Y...Period P.6A boy named Harry Potter is living with his cousin, Dudley's house. He is living there because his parents died. He finds out he is a wizard and goes to the wizarding school. He makes a couple of friend and meets other wizards. Near the end of the year, he goes to a dungeon in the school and fights Proffesor Quirrel. Professor Quirrel was Voldemort's henchman.I liked the book because Harry Potter defeats Professor Quirrel by burning his face with his bare skin. \\"Quirrel rolled off him, his face blistering.\\" The part is very strange, but Quirrel's face just burns by a touch of a student.I disliked the book because of Proffesor Snape. \\"\\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\\"\\" Sape always hated Harry. Snape and Harry's father were at Hogwarts and hated each other, too. So Snape hates Haryry, but doesn't want him dead. Snape is head of Slytherin's house and Harry is in Gryffindor's house.The part I liked about the story was when Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley, where witches and wozards buy their scool supplies. Hagrid goes to the island where the Dursleys were staying andtook Harry to Diagon Alley. Harry had wizard money beyond every wizard's dream."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okk, i am a big Harry Potter and Pokemon fan, i know some people think both are evil ::starts crying::Yeah, the Harry Potter series contains magic, but it's kinda like a normal person's life + a little twist. I think it wasn't good that Harry was treated so poorly. things do get a lot more exciting though! read, it's a must!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a fifth grader, I picked a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I picked this book because I wanted to compare the book to the movie. This book is mostly about Harry, Ron, and Hermionie trying to stop Snape, a Hogwarts teacher, from stealing the sorcerer's stone (which gives you never-ending life). One night Harry, Ron, and Hermionie went up to the third floor and saw a three-headed dog guarding the sorcerer's stone. They believed Snape was trying to get past the dog with Quirrell's help (a Hogwarts teacher, too) but is Snape really trying to steal the stone? Or is somebody else trying to steal it? Find out in the book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I enjoyed reading this book about Harry Potter. I enjoyed reading this book because I like adventure and excitement and this whole book is full of adventure and excitement!! My favorite part was when Harry defeated Voldemort. It was my favorite part because Voldemort was evil and tried to trick Harry into giving the stone to him. But Harry knew that when Voldemort got the stone, he would get his own body and have never-ending life. Harry refused to give the stone to him. Then Harry got knocked down and choked by Quirrel (who was really Voldemort). Harry touched Quirrel on the hand and his hand magically turned to stone and fell into tiny pieces. Harry did the same all the way util Quirrel's whole body turned into stone because he wanted Voldemort to die with Quirrel's body. But Voldemort didn't die! If you want to find out why he didn't die, read the book by J.K. Rowling.This book is better for sixth, seventh, and eighth graders because sometimes I got stuck on two or three difficult words in the book (so then I had to look them up in the dictionary to find the meaning). I think it is better for them (than fifth graders) because maybe they will understand the story better than I did. I think it is a good choice for middle school and high school students becuase if middleschoolers can't understand the book than, maybe, highschoolers could figure out the words, what the book is all about, and the most important parts in the story (and not just the little details)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone has been one of the best books i have ever read. it is suspenseful and i couldn't put it down. i read the book in 3 days-it was that interesting. a lot is happening, and with this book, you can keep it all straight and figured out. at first i thought i wouldn't like the book, but then i started to read the 1st chapter and i couldn't take my eyes off it. this book is not only a good book for kids, but it is also a good book for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OK, I admit. I wondered what all the fuss was about. Did these people think this was the first chilren's book about wizards and magic and such? I mean, come on!But finally I ordered the book thinking that at the least I'd add it to my daughter's growing library (she's only 3, but I keep adding books for when she's older). I started Harry's adventure at work when I opened the shipping box. I drove through KFC on the way home because I didn't want to stop reading to cook supper for my family. The Harry Potter books have something for anyone willing to let a little fantasy into their heart.Adults and children will identify with a character who is bullied and mistreated for being different. We are cheering for Harry when he finds out there are others like him. It's the Ugly Duckling of the Magical Realm.Chilren will benefit from the good v. evil morals of these stories. And as a plus, they get these valuable lessons without preachy overtones.I am anxious for the next book in the series to come out for my own reading pleasure. I also can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to enjoy these stories. Like The Chronicles of Narnia, Charlotte's Web, and Alice in Wonderland--this is a series that I plan to read aloud to my kid's and hope they want to read again when they are old enough."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"the book was imaginative, whimsical, suprising, and all around a 5-star book.

I loved this book so much. The detail is great. Harry Potter attends Hogwarts...a school for magic.

I don't have a chance to read much about the children books. However, I found this book is highly imaginative. Eventhough, some parts are violence concerning this is a book for 9-12 years old kids. But look to the bright side, this book contained every children dream. Imagine this! the lonely boy who never seen his parent, never know who he is, live with the relative who hate him for the reason that he never know for 10 suffering years. Then one day, he found out that he is a wizard and a famous one too. Lot of fantasy, I must said. But who would not love fantasy story. If you are an adult, please...please read it with a child heart because this book is for everyone who still young at heart."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was fit for people of all ages. When my little brother received it from his third grade teacher I thought for sure that it was a children's book but after reading I know that its not. This book is about Harry Potter who is an eleven-year-old boy who lives at 4 Privet drive. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Cousin Dudley, a great big swollen spoiled bully. As a tiny baby, Harry was left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle's house because a horrible monster killed his parents. His room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years. When he turns eleven he found out that he is a wizard. But everything changes for Harry when an owl delivers a mysterious letter inviting him to attend a school for wizards. He now attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He finds out that he is famous in the world of wizards. At this special school, Harry finds friends, sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, as well as a great destiny that's been waiting for him. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry, will find unforgettable. However, evil is lurking at the very heart of Hogwarts, and Harry and his friends must finally face the malevolent and powerful Voldemort, who is intent on taking over the world. Harry himself is the perfect confused and unassuming hero, whom trouble follows. I think the main theme of this book is based on fun, fantasy, and imagination, the adventure of an unfortunate boy who has lived the first ten years of his life unaccepted by his own relatives. This book delivers the message to enjoy the simple things in life and make the best of them. This story follows the saying of good verses evil. Overall I would rate this book a five. I think it was very well written. I can't wait to read the books that follow this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading Harry Potter.

Not so. The book is loads of fun, yes, but there's a depth to it that's extremely rare in children's books. I especially liked that Harry wasn't perfect. He had normal insecurities and got in his fair share of trouble in school.In quality, I would put this book on the same level as Winnie the Pooh or Madeline. In style, I would put it in the same category as the Hobbit. Very entertaining was the fact that the whole world wasn't magical. The magic world was hidden inside of the regular world.

I'm happy to admit, it was the best delayed flight I've ever been on. Rowling takes the reader on a magical trip through a magical land of witches and magic, good and evil, narrated in a lovely style that is ideal for kids but doesn't insult adults' intelligence, either. The plot is engrossing, but not complicated: few, well-fleshed-out characters; crisp, humorous dialogue and a gentle, non-preachy style keep the reader entertained throughout. Harry comes across as a perfectly normal, believeable character that every child will identify with easily. The concepts of good and evil are gently drummed in without being sanctimonius about it, though the evil foster family is fairly stereotyped. Never mind, at least it's not a wicked stepmother and cruel stepsisters. A good read, whatever your age. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fun and enchanting story that is great for readers of all ages! The characters are interesting and memorable.

How many books can claim THAT?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and read it for the first time, it was unbelievable. I like how it started off in a dark neighborhood of privet drive, and then it talked about Professor Dumbledore coming in from the back. All of a sudden, Professor Mcgonnical appeared out of nowhere which really confounded me. When it talked about Harry in the Cupboard under the stairs, it made me imagine how it would feel like for me to be living underneath the stairs in a tiny space like that. I know that my room is a little bigger than his, but I feel like I am living underneath the cupboard already. When it got to the part that talks about Diagon alley, that part made me feel like me being in Westfield Mall of San Francisco because in Diagon alley, there is a lot of stuff to buy which relates to a really big mall. There are no secret underground banks in San Francisco, but they are founded in the wizardry world, which is really amusing. Upon arrival to Hogwarts, it was the best part because Harry Potter has to get onto platform 9 through a solid wall from King's Cross Station. On the train, Harry met Ron and Hermione and that is how they became such good friends. When it got to the part that talked about the sorting into the houses, I was wondering which house will Harry get placed in, and it turned out to be Griffinydor. Afterwards, it started to show Hogwarts a little more for the first time. Time went by very fast when Harry learns how to play qudditch for the first time. When Harry got caught in the air at the wrong time, he was name qudditch seeker, and he won his first qudditch match, so forth and so on. There are a lot more surprises to this book, and overall they are well put together in the right places. Excellent book, and I recommend the book to anyone that like magical moments, fantasies, history, and surprises.

If you read this book prepared to spend the next couple weeks finishing the next 6. J.K. Rowling, I love you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first read this book back in elementary school, a couple years after it was first published in 1997. I went into it skeptically thinking that a book about wizards and witches and all things magical would be in short, lame. However I was happily mistaken, I instantly fell in love with the magic and wonder that is Harry Potter's world. Especially the detailing that Rowling generously spoils her readers with throughout the book. This book started off my fascination with Harry Potter and I have read the whole series.In this book we learn about the characters and their backgrounds, the magical world, common terms that are used in it, the sport that is Quidditch, among many other things.What is probably my favorite thing about the way that J.K. Rowling writes is the way she drops small details into the story that are easily dismissed by the reader when they are initially read, but then are referred to again in later volumes of the series, causing you to actually look back and realize that Rowling is always one step ahead.When I was younger, these books allowed me to realize that it's okay when things do not work out as you plan them. In the books things don't always work out as the character's plan them to, there are some upsets and there are triumphs. It shows young readers that hard times do come, but you can always face what lies ahead.I think much of the success of these books comes from J.K. Rowling's ability to, simply stated, write. She does a magnificent job in the description throughout the book and the plot layout. And it is amazing to see how relevant something that appeared in this first book is to the seventh, and final, book of the series.I believe Rowling is one of the best writers of our time, especially when there is so much pressure from competing media, she shows everyone that books are still very much relevant in this day and age. These books are timeless and I'm sure years from now will still be read just as fervently as they were when first released, if not more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book when I was 14 years old. I have never read any of the other sequels, but I absolutely love this book. It is great for all ages including young kids. Some might say that it goes too far with wizardry and witchcraft, but I think it's good for kids to have an imagination. Early imaginative kids make good entrepreneurs in the future. I am always curious how J.K. Rowling came up with all these wild, fantastical stories. But I am glad she did.

While he is doing that, he finds out who killed his parents and Harry has to find a way to stop that person from coming back at all costs. This book is exciting because the author uses a lot of creativity telling about each of the characters. She used a lot of dragons and mythical creatures. Dudley, Harry's cousin, was one of the most well-developed characters in the book. He is shown to be a spoiled, evil-hearted bully. He gets almost everything he wants and gets away with everything. This book has a lot of imagination also. You could almost picture Harry there with you and you being a part of the whole thing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My parents sent me this book since fantasy is not my younger sister's style. I am thirty years old and I am about to get my degree in physics. I love this book!J.K. Rowling has an ear for words. She writes delicious puns and fascinating descriptions of events. I particularly enjoy her sense of comic timing and the way she paces a story. In the first and third books of this series, she truly shines! It is no wonder that so many people have caught &quot;Potter-Fever&quot;. I have yet to read the fourth book, but there is no doubt that I will get it.Buy this book for someone who enjoys a little surreality to their day. Buy it for someone who likes a good laugh or a mystery. Buy it for people who remember what it's like to be eleven years old with all the fears, wonder, and awkwardness which came with it. Harry Potter's magic is not simply spells and incantations but the human characteristics which we all share. The occult is not the focus of this book. Yes, odd things happen but it is more about imagination, hard work, and education than witchcraft. Let those who are fear that their children are being warped read this book. Discuss the book with their children. There are no guns, no massacres, no drugs. But there is a lot of good to be found if a person looks."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"i am 13 and i hating reading for fun before this book.

Anyway, my mom bought the first one for my brother, so I decided why not give it a try. Now, I can't put the book down. It's a great read and worth all the hype people make of it.

Rowling. which introduced me into the magical world of wizards. This book took me away from busy life and school studies to just bring me for a moment into the 'Hogwarts' world. I think that Mrs. Rowling did a very good job with all of the books because although I am not very interested in fantasy books or science-fiction she got my attention. She has create a hero who doesn't think that he is better then anyone else.Hermoine, Ron and Harry (the 3 friends in the book) give a very good example of friendship and corporation.I read the 309 pages in about 1 week when Harry Potter wasn't popular in Germany so I didn't read it because of the 'Harry Potter Popularity Boom'.At first Harry Potter thought he is a normal boy living in between the unfiriendly Dursley's not knowing that he is one of the most famous wizards of the world and has to go Hogwarts Scool of Witchcraft and Wizard... .Because of the detailed description of all the magical charactersitics and the adventures of the dark wizard you-know-who (Voldemort) it is very exciting to read the story.Harry Potter the main character is very special and brave but J.K. Rowling letseem him like a normal nice boy who just tries to protect his friends and helps others.She doesn't let him seem like the typical hero character like in some movies and Ithinkthat is one of the main points I like this book.Without his friends Ron and Hermoine it would be a lot more difficult for him to get through his adventures.About the author:J.K Rowling was a struggling single mother when she wrote thebeginnings of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on scaps of paper at a local cafe. But her efforts soon paid off, as she received an unprecendetend award from Scottish Arts Council enabling her to finish the book. Since then, the debut novel has become an international phenomenon, garnering rave reviews and major awards, including the British Book Awards Children's Book of Year, and the Smarties Price. Ms. Rowling lives in Edinburgh with her daughter.I read all of the books a couple times and it is just fascinating how it always keepsme being exciting every single moment... .All in all this book is a perfect gift for everybody in every age!If you compare the first book with the other next ones it seems to be the most boring one, because it gets more exciting every other book.

Having read Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone several times now, I can honestly say that I love it more and more every time I read it. Its a book that both children and adults can appreciate, because even though the subject is intended for young people, there's a certain eloquence about it that adults can identify with, too.Since many, many people have read this book, and been just as entranced by it as I have, I'm not going to bore you with plot details. Harry is a perfect, unassuming gem of a character who is completely unfazed by his sudden celebrity in the world of witches and wizards. His first-year adventures are rendered here in the way that all can appreciate. The Dursleys are ridiculous, Hermione is a know-it-all who becomes more likeable the more we get to know her, Hagrid is the kind of character who reminds me of a large teddy bear that you can't help but love. All these characters and more have enchanted me ever since this book first came out.This is a book that I would highly reccomend for all who are young or simply young at heart. There is simply nothing that matches it or can begin to compare to it. If you are a long-time Harry Potter fan or are just starting out, this is the book for you. Don't forget to get the other four books in the series as well; and, I hear, there will be a sixth one coming soon!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When Harry Potter first came on the scene, I didn't buy into the hype. I had no interest in purchasing the book mainly because my oldest child was too young to read it. Then my sister-in-law suggested I read the book and she gave it rave reviews. I figured it was a children's book, I have no need to read it. Then one summer my mother-in-law brought the second book with her when she came to visit and left it at our home when she left. She had put a blank book cover on her copy and I took it for something to read. I did not even read the title page but I was hooked. I actually stayed up until 1:00 a.m. just to finish the book. I have read all 5 books to my son who is now 10. We are both big fans and cannot wait until the 6th book arrives.Although the book's hero is a child, and it is written in the style of a children's book, it is so engrossing that you actually forget that it is a children's book.

This is a story that I have loved and now love sharing with my children as they are just becoming old enough to read it for themselves. Not only is is well written and engaging, but it is also refreshing to see witches (wizards) protrayed as good, moral and loving people instead of just evil devil-worshipers. Yes, some of the wizards in this book are most decidedly evil, but only a scant few - the rest are good honest people, and they band together to fight to eliminate the evil that threatens their world. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard the name \\"Harry Potter\\" when I was about 16. It was 2000, and I was a junior in high school. A friend of mine had gotten ahold of an early copy of one of the HP books, and I just wasn't really interested.Flash forward to 2002. I worked in a movie theatre. One of the perks was getting a chance to see free screenings of movies the night before they were released. I decided to go with my co-workers and see \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\" Although I enjoyed the movie, I kind of put it out of my mind for awhile.Flash forward, once again, to 2004. My neice is almost 2, and Harry Potter is the only thing she will actually sit down and watch. It's the only thing that can make her calm down. And I wonder if perhaps she's on to something.I sat with her and watched the first and second movies one night while babysitting, and I was enlightened to the magic that is Harry Potter. Harry Potter, even in movie form is not unlike what Ramona Quimby was to me when I was a child. I have just finished the second book, and realized Harry Potter is what children today will have to hold on to. It's magical, uplifting, and you can't deny the life lessons kids will gain from it. Take for example, the ongoing struggle between \\"Muggle-born\\" and \\"pure-blood\\" witches and wizards, it teaches kids to be accepting and that everyone deserves a fair chance. There are many more that I could describe in great detail, however, it would probably go far beyond the 1,000 word limit. In short, any Harry Potter book is well worth the time spent reading it. No doubt this series will go down as a children's literary classic of our time, and I'm glad children have something more than TV or video games."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Adrielle DeSchuytner Thursday, October 21,1999Harry Potter: and the Sorcerer's Stoneby: J.K.

Little does Harry know, but he is a famous wizard-to-be, that couldn't be killed by Vol-, I mean you-know-who. He has never had any friends or participated in group activities. Then one day, without warning, a giant named Hagrid comes to invite him to one of the best school of witchcraft and wizardry around, Hogwarts. Of course Harry accepts, anything to get away from his rotten family.I really liked the way Ms. Rowling had a front row seat in the book waiting for me. I felt if I were in the book with Harry. The desriptions were unbelievable, they helped paint a really live picture picture. I really think it is really cool how she can write the exact way people with lisps talk, I thought it was amazing to have that ability. I really liked the book a lot, so I gav it *****'s.

The characterization is precise, and the flow of the narrative is simply enthralling. The stroy mixes elements of fantasy into common everyday life making the reader again feel that there might be a small touch of magic left in the world afterall. This book provides the reader the opportunity to enter a truely original and well concieved world where owls deliver mail and ghosts prowl the corridors of Hogwarts School for Wizards. The crisp characterization of Harry Potter as an outcast child of destiny lends to the feeling of entering a world of Mythology. Adding refreshing bits of everyday life into this fantasy world engrosses and involves the reader in the lives of the principal characters. In the classroom this book can be used as a guide to teach students how to write creatively as well as expose them to literary devices such as forshadowing and alliteration. Overall, I feel that this could possibly be the greatest children's series of the last one hundred years. The author's sharp and stinging wit allow even the dullest characters in the book to shine brightly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have only read Sorcerer's Stone so far, but I do NOT plan on stopping there, I plan to go out and buy the other two ASAP.

I would read all of the Potter books. I would. I would make myself, just to understand the series and constant references...Okay, okay, okay, and I have to admit -- I liked it. No huge surprise -- any international is pretty much likely to be at least entertaining.I, for the sake of throwing this out there, HATE reviewing smash hits. Be it film or novel, it's very hard for me, because I know all of the fans of such work (and so often there are so many) will scorn any criticisms I have. (I'm dreading the next time I watch Titanic. Seriously.)Anyway, Potter's got all the elements of a good, especially introductory, novel. It's got the engaging plot, great characters, catchy opener, and enough humor, especially for young audiences.I also have to admit that I am a huge fan of Rowling's world-building. You go, woman. From the perspective of the last time I read Potter, all that really mattered was whether or not the story and characters were entertaining, and the \\"bigger picture\\" of the novel was lass important. Now, I have to give J.K.R. credit for far more than just that. It's truly an ideal setup novel for a series like this. Everything's set up so amazingly well.Now, and I have to admit a lot of styles kept jumping into my mind as I read this book. Rowling has a style and tone that, at times, reads frighteningly much like Roald Dahl, and I kept getting occasional flashbacks to the \\"Great Brain\\" books of John D. Fitzgerald. Not that these similarities are a form of criticism by any means. Mere observation.And really, having finished, I can't find anything... concrete... to criticize. It's a good book. No doubt there. But is it worthy of the entire microcosm universe it spawned in today's pop-culture world? Of that I'm not one-hundred percent certain."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Call me a Muggle, but I'm finally getting around to reading the Harry Potter books.

The characters are smartly written, even if they're either a little too obviously good guys or bad guys. Except Snape, of course, who I find the most interesting character so far.

No epic battles, no losing favorite characters to a nefarious Death Eater, no Death Eaters period. Just a middle school nerd trying to fit in and find himself... in a wizarding school. It's fun and frivolous, and you can actually sit back and chuckle, or hem and haw, or whatever it is you do when something lightly amuses you. No crying, no worrying, no nothing. Every once in a while, a book like that is refreshing.The Sorcerer's Stone is my favorite, because it captures the true magic. Toward the end of the series, Rowling turns Harry Potter Land into another epic fantasy battle, and that kind of story is really turning into a dime a dozen. But this is classic. You get into it. You picture how cool it would've been for your sixth grade science class to have potions, to be able to levitate and all that jazz. You might pretend to be Hermione for a day and wow the teachers.

Most already know the basic story: an 11 year old boy finds out he has magical powers (and is therefore a 'wizard') and is accepted into the Hogwart's School of Magic and Witchcraft. But what I want to comment on are the rumours that the book is 'evil'.I was told not to give this book to a relative's child because it was evil and taught kids real black magic witchcraft and real curses. I definitely didn't want to do that, so I asked specifically where the \\"bad parts\\" were in the book so I could see for myself. Of course, no one could tell me since they themselves had never actually read it but were told it was evil by somebody else. (I came across a lot of that.) Luckily, I had the brains to read it for myself --mostly so I could find the \\"bad parts\\" and warn my friends. I found the rumours to be completely FALSE! The \\"spells\\" used in the books are like \\"hocus pocus\\" or \\"abracadabra\\". There are NO real Wiccan or pagan spells in this book! Not only that, but the idea of a 'school of magic' isn't that original (see \\"The Worst Witch\\" or the Earthsea Trilogy) and the idea of a magical world existing secretly within the normal world has also \\"been done\\" (see \\"Bewitched\\", \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\", \\"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\\", etc). This book is about as evil as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (which, by the way, has wizards and witches in it... some of them good ...and is regarded as a classic book AND movie by many religious conservatives).**My Advice to Parents: You definitely have the right (or obligation) to censor your children's tv and literature. If you are religiously devout and would never let your kids watch \\"Bewitched\\" or read \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", then by all means stick with it and don't let them read Harry Potter. But if you're on the fence, then read it yourself (it's not that long) and find out for YOURSELF if the rumours are true or if it's something you'd want your kids reading. But those people (even well-meaning people) who go about spreading bad rumours about this book (or trying to get it banned or burned) when they don't have the first hand information as to whether those rumours are true, is nothing short of evil itself. (Remember \\"The Waltons\\" episode when the town was burning all books in German during the War and JohnBoy picked one up that was about to get tossed into the fire and it was a German Bible?)I'm not saying that the Harry Potter books are Biblical, but they do teach that there is definitely a line between good and evil, and that sometimes you have to stand for what is right.... even when people abandon you or hate you or make fun of you, or even if your life is in danger. It also teaches not to judge people by what they look like or whether they're poor or outcasts, or what their background is. There are characters in these books that have had to fight prejudices from the wizarding society all their lives, yet still choose to defend that society from evil. It teaches self-sacrifice, loyalty to friends, and that it's love and respect that make a family... not just DNA. It also teaches that an abused and neglected boy can choose the path he takes in life and can change the world for the better.If you'd like a Bible verse to sum up Harry Potter, try John 15:13. It's why he survived an attack from evil in the first place and has huge ramifications for his future.No matter which book it is, if someone tells you it's \\"evil\\", find out for yourself. Don't let someone else decide what you should or shouldn't read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Because I do a lot of research for my work, I never considered reading as something to fill my leisure time with.

The detail is phenomenal, and even when she borrows from the established fantasy world, she adds inspired touches and makes old ideas her very own. Rowling obviously understands instinctively how a 12-year-old child thinks and what his worries are, and she addresses this beautifully in her creation of Harry, his friends, and his enemies. I found myself wishing I had had Harry Potter when I was 12.I think what I liked best, though, was that I didn't get the feeling that Rowling set out to write a book for 12-year-olds. She doesn't talk down to her audience at all, and that gives the book universal appeal. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate the conflicts Harry encounters. In fact, Rowling seems to be pointing out that kids and adults aren't really all that different, even in the problems we face on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was skeptical about these books at first, thinking they were for young children (I'm 16), but once I started reading this book I was hooked. Harry Potter, the main character, lives a Cinderala like life. When just a year old his parents were killed by an evil worlock and he was sent to live with his Muggle (non magical) Aunt, Uncle, and cousin. The Muggles treat him horably (he lives in the cubord, gets old socks for birthday presents, and does not know about how his parents died, or that he has magical powers). Life is terrible. This all changes however when he recieves a letter telling him that he has been excepted into Hogwarts Accadamy (a school for wizards). This is the best thing that has ever happend to Harry, and with the help of the school's gamekeep he gets his school supplies and goes to Hogwarts. School life for Harry is full of adventure, with rivalry between houses, teachers who seem to hate him, friends to make, and a mystery to solve. I thought this was a wonderful book, and it's not just for kids. I'd suggest this book to anyone who likes magic and mysteries."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's easy to see why young readers would be caught up in this story. The characters are well developed and the story line moves along at a good pace. It's also easy to see why readers are empowered by Harry's tale - he is rescued from his mean and uncaring aunt, uncle and cousin in a triumph of good overcoming bad. Harry is wisked away to a wonderful life (though not without its problems) that leaves his dreadful relatives in the dust, and his supporters cheering."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter...that magic powerful the world will win. There are few days, I have just read the first book of Harry, and I wait for the next ones. For many time I didn't feel so well reading a book for children (ops! ). Harry is the fantasy that doesn't die inside from us, Harry is the magician that all we wanted to be when children. You feel like part of the history, with the characters and is delighted with every moment, each passage of the book. As I said, a book for the children of all ages (besides like me - that will never leave of being one). J.K. Rowling, wrote a wonderful book, that in spite of not being a work of art, it wakes up the reading will again in a lot of people, because it was what happened with me. Harry Potter has a little of each person of the world, because everybody feels like a Harry. Everybody wants a scar in ray form in the forehead, everybody wants to play with Harry, they want to participate in his adventures, they want to help in his searches... There are few days I read one criticizes, where someone said that J.K. Rowling, was not really a writer and hers books were empty and without content....pure sensibility lack....there is not larger content than the children's world, even if you don't see anything, he is full of mysteries, of monsters, fears and anxieties...exactly as Harry. No matter how much the peoples talk about that book, read and have a good time, therefore you will want Harry Potter and its world more and more....a fantastic and wonderful world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 14 year old high school freshman. I thought Harry Potter was for kids. But when i read this book, I changed my mind. Its a very good book, that has adventure and humor in it. I advise everyone to read it, even if you are in high school"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Since so many have already read the collection of Harry Potter books, my review is not of the stories but of the age appropriateness of the readers. People often confuse stories about children and childlike adventures with stories made for children. Such is the case with these stories. The tales of J.K. Rowling are quite creative and entertaining. As a newly assigned sixth grade reading teacher, I have only recently begun the journey into the world of Harry Potter and his adventures at Hogsworth. I was wondering what all the hoop-la was about concerning the books. They are wonderfully filled with Harry's acceptance of his being a wizard, the truth surrounding the death of his parents and his many battles with You-Know-Who. Additionally, Harry finds a sense of himself and where he belongs through his matriculation at Hogsworth. But as I have continued my journey with reading the remaining wonderfully imaginative books, it is not the subject matter that parents should be concerned about but the appropriate age level. I do not believe that the average nine - twelve year old has the mind set to understand the nature of the stories. As a mother of twin ten year old daughters and an eight year old daughter, I know that certain subject matters are more than their pysche can comprehend. The understanding of how the Dursley(s) treat Harry, the bewitching of Ginny Weasley, Tom Riddle being able to preserve himself in a diary, or the reasoning of why Moony and Padfoot wanted to set things straight by killing Wormtail for betraying Prongs is all too abstract for a young child. Yet interestingly enough, the majority of the student population at my school has already read all four of the books, which I find wonderful. (I'm glad that they are reading.) However, they do not have real clarity of what they are reading. I think a changing to a fourteen and above age level would do these books great justice. They would be able to analyze and reason with the issues presented and not be afraid of the subject matter. This would also eliminate so much of the criticism around them. Personally, I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in the series of books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My brother started reading this book and recommended it to me. Of course, I thought this is just going to be another one of those fairy tales books. To my surprise, I felt endulged in this book and read it everywhere, under the covers when I'm supposed to be asleep or during class when I 'm supposed to be studying. I turned page after page. By the time I was done with the first one I had started on the second one. Soon most of my friends were reading it. It appeared at book fairs and carnivals and bookstores all over the world. I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book that will spark the imagination of the child and adult alike! This book and many of the others all have a hidden lesson. Many times you will find as you go through the series that there is a lesson of things not always being what they seem to be. Rowling has fooled me by giving events that are suspicious enough for you to think you know who the &quot;bad&quot; person is in the story, when it is someone else! At the end all the peices are wrapped up, so it is almost a &quot;MYSTERY&quot; book as well!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Who would have thought that #2 would be better than #1. I have read , many books before and so far the first three Harry Potter books have been my favorites. When you start to read them it takes you into another world. I know many of you have heard that before I know I have but I really mean it. These books are so good that I counldn't put them down. I stayed up until atleast 2 in the morning and finished each the day I started them. And if that doesn't entice you to read these books nothing will. And another thing I don't know why these parents in N. Carolina are so scared many of my friends have read these books and nonw of us have tried to turn our teachers purple or have had any idea to start doing witchcraft."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's not that this wasn't a good book... but I just don't understand all the hype! Is it just me, or has the whole prospect been done already? The unsuspecting hero is dragged off on a quest, and he ends up saving the day. Sounds a little familiar... so WHY is this book getting so much hype? The plot line isn't too original... I can honestly say I forgot who half the characters were a week after reading... and the whole idea of wizards and spells has been done many, many times, in a much better way. I have a sneaking suspicion that the people who are going nuts over this book have never read anything else.Do you want some ORIGINAL fantasy novels? Check out E. Nesbit, Edward Eager, Joan Aiken, or John Bellairs."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Report on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneOur report is about the book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. It was written by Joanne K. Rowling and was first published in 1997. But the real Harry Potter- boom came later when it got known all over the world.Joanne K. Rowling was born in 1965 in Yate in the South of England. On the journey from King's Cross Station to Manchester \\"Harry Potter just popped into my head, already fully formed.\\"Joanne won several prices like the Smarties Book Prize and the British Book Award.She is married with three children and famous all over the world because more than 300 million copies were sold world-wide. J. K. Rowling is the first British writer who became a US-billionaire by writing books.The book is so special because it is easy to understand and is really humorous but also exciting. What also makes it special is that it has a kind of open end and makes you dream of magic and fairy-tales...Harry Potter is a young wizard who grows up with his aunt, his uncle and his spoiled cousin because his parents were killed by Lord Voldemort, or You-Know-Who, as most wizards call him.Shortly before his eleventh birthday Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard. Against the will of his aunt and uncle he leaves for his new school called Hogwarts.At Hogwarts he meets a lot of other wizards and witches. He saves a classmate from a troll and fights against the evil making a lot of new friends.To give you an idea of the book and the style of writing in English, I'd like to read two short sequences from it. (p. 1 and p. 208)Opinions:This book is fascinating! Once you start you can never put it down again; you're taken by it right from the very first moment. I'd absolutely recommend it to everybody here, because the language isn't very difficult, so quite easy to understand, it's as thrilling as a crime novel and leads to the main topic of the series and introduces the main characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling has simply become an icon for our literary age. Not only has she written these fabulous books for us to enjoy - I think something far more superior has come of this endeavor. The lieracy of our children has now become enhanced. I can't think of a better thing for kids than to enjoy reading as it is so fundamental to their education.I have a degree in Creative Writing so many people have asked my opinion of these books. I always say - any book that gets kids reading early is a great book. I simply have never seen kids so engaged in a storyline like Harry Potter. Children have been known to read these books over and over again. What you have here is the self-improvement of grammar, vocabulary, and conceptual thinking. It expands the natural curiosity and enriches the young mind. Whats' more - parents love these books too! So, parents and children alike can enjoy the books together and now you have bridged a generation gap. We will look back on these books as timeless treasures not unlike The Wizard of Oz or The Hobbit.I just recently saw the movie and I was amazed! Not so much the movie but that children were feverishly discussing the movie as it compared to the book! What was similar - what was missing! It reminded me of how adults can debate over Shakespeare and an adaptation they just saw of Hamlet. So, I wish I could give Harry potter 10 stars. 5 for being an excellent book. 5 for being an educational supplement.If you haven't read this series yet - pick one up and I think you'll be surprised. It is not simply a children's book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series have been the biggest literary phenomenon in a very long time, if not ever. What makes these \\"childrens\\" books so popular? The really cool plot? Is it the neat covers? The kind and sympathetic protagonist or school which he attends? Everyone has asked this question to themselves...until of course, they read them. This book, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" (Philosophers in Britain) is the book that started it all. I remember distinctly strolling through a bookstore, and seeing a surprisingly colorful book on the New York Times Bestseller list shelf. I picked it up (realizing that it was a childrens book) and read the front cover. I decided that it looked interesting enough and I (was indeed) judging a book by its cover. That night, I turned off the television and sat on my couch wondering what I should do for the next hour. I looked at the mess of books laying in front of me and decided to pick up the one with the lovely cover called \\"Harry Potter\\". I read the first page slowly and then faster, loving every word. It was so carefully written, I could almost feel the energy that Rowling had put into it coming out through each word. As I completed the first chapter, I knew that putting this book down was not an option. The beautiful scenery described was so perfect, that I still wonder is it possible that everyone sees the same thing? Yes. With a few variations, Rowling so masterfully describes the castle, the grounds and Platform 9 3/4 that even those of us with the wildest imagination can't change what it looks like. They feel like real places. The three dimensional characters were overwhelming. Every character has a name, and an obvious past that will slowly be told. Whether it is filled with dark secrets, and mysterious happenings, or just an ordinary life of an average brittish seemingly-muggle child. Each person has emotions, which the reader has to pick up just as they would in real life. You know what Harry feels, but no one else. The situation is described, and it is left to your imagination to say what vibes the person is putting out, or what is going on behind their words. By the time I finished this amazing book, I did not want to say good bye to my friends. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Hagrid...all of those people who had made Harry Potter book 1 so real to me. So I waited until the second book came out, and read that as well. But Harry Potter and the Sorcerers (philosophers) Stone will always have a special place in my heart. The wonderful thing about these books is that they become a part of you. Once you read the first one it stays with you forever, and something will always draw your fingers across the cover just to feel lthe lovely pattern. Ms. Rowling must have attended Hogwarts, her pen is her wand, and her paper is the hat which she pulls this magical world out of."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In a previous review, a reader from Austin, TX responded to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone saying, \\"If you respect your children, look for a higher quality book than this.\\" I strongly disagree with this comment because I believe J.K. Rowling combines important life lessons with a whirlwind of mythical creatures and exciting characters to create an unforgettable book for all ages to enjoy. Harry Potter is orphaned at a very young age and is sent to live with his \\"muggle\\" relatives. Then mysterious letters informing Harry of his acceptance to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry begin his magical adventure. He travels through an enchanted train station, survives the Forbidden Forest, and encounters everything from ghosts and trolls, to unicorns and dragons. Throughout his adventures, Harry must learn to maintain his grades by studying, and he must face many rivals, such as Draco Malfoy, a school enemy, Snape, his Potions master, and even Voldemort, the Dark Lord. He is taught basic rules of discipline through a point system, he learns the importance of teamwork from the \\"broomstick soccer\\" game called Quidditch, and he must challenge evil and confront his fears. You find yourself asking \\"What is being guarded by the ferocious three-headed dog on the third floor, Who is the Man with Two Faces, and is Voldemort gone for good?\\" J.K. Rowling takes you soaring through a fantasy world of magic and witchcraft and you become a student in this magical school of witchcraft as you follow Harry through each trial and adventure. She uses simple language to appeal to all ages and adds words from the magical world adding humor and mirth. Rowling is described as a new Roald Dahl, the author of James and the Giant Peach, as she captures the reader with magical phantasms and carries them through lessons in life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A great book for everyone!

Happy Reading or maybe from the wizarding world EXPELLILARMIUS!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm just like you -- I read and heard the hype that came along with the publication of book #4. I knew it was hype. But I thought, &quot;why not?&quot; Being the melancholy personality I am, though, I couldn't just pick up the series with book four, so I purchased all 4 books. And being the purist that I sometimes am, I even used the UK version of Amazon.com to buy the British titles (very little difference with the exception of a few words that appeal more to the British taste in language). Fearing some criticism from my other over-educated friends, I pulled the dust jackets and sat around the pool reading. Then, from the pool into the sitting room. And finally, staying up late just to finish the stories. The books don't offer the depth that a C.S. Lewis lover might desire -- but they are just plain fun reads. Everything we read doesn't have to test our intellect -- sometimes it pays just to read to relax and enjoy. Suspend a little reality. Read the book simply because it IS a fun read! You'll be glad you did. And before long, you'll find yourself cheering for the same people and games that your kids are pulling for. Besides, won't you be able to surprise your preteens when you can tell them that you TOO know where Hogwarts is?

I read this, the first, and I have to &quot;admit&quot; there is! I found the central character Harry Potter and his friends entirely believable, despite their rather unusual milleu. The story was well written and carefully plotted and was not as treacley as I'd expected it to be. In fact it was quite charming, included some rather intense real-life topics--such as the unfairness of life in general and the death of parents in particular--and kept my attention well enough for me to read it in under a day's time.

What it is, is a well written marvelously told tale of Harry and his adventures. the plots are written nice and clean, the story wraps up properly, and the characters are brought to life and seemed REAL.i was so entranced with this book, i was furious when my fiance told me to put the lights out when I was halfway through the last chapter. Needless to say, i finished the book first thing this morning and gave it to his 14 yo brother (who isn't a reader) to read. He's so engrossed into it, i've ordered books two and three so that we can get through them just as quickly.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who isn't into fantasy or scifi and judging by my fiance's brother reaction, to anyone who isn't a reader.

I love a good mystery, and this was not only a magnificent fantasy story, but a great mystery. I loved it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter (and the Sorcerer's Stone) is a really fun book. The way J.K. Rowling discribes the events, places, and actions that Harry, his friends, and eniemes visit and do make the book even more hulariuos. The detail of the three-headed monster, Hagard, and all the characters gives it more depth. What also makes the book more fun and interesting is the way each character, no matter how small has strenghs and weaknesses. This book is pure fun for kids (and adults) of all ages. If you liked this book then you might consider these. The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien; books by John Bellairs; The Golden Compass and other books by Philip Pullman. I would strongly suggest the four books by Madeleine L'engle."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is an amazing one. I'm only 11 and it's the best book in the whole world. It's an adventuous but not scary book. Harry, Hermione, and Ron have a lot of courage. It is a great book and a start of (hopefully) a series. I read it in four days. My best now is reading it and is loving it. I borrowed it from my library but now even though I'm done I need toget at Amazon.com because I know I'll read it again and again.

It was so good I couldn't put it down. At first, when I received it for my 15th birthday, I was skeptical at reading a book I thought on first glance to be childish, but from the first page to the last I was enthralled with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and all of the other magical characters. With excitement, new adventures, or quirky characters on every page it was definetly a page-turner. I highly recommend this book to all ages....not just kids.*"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a great book, I mean really my favorite book ever. One of my close friends told me about this book and I couldn't stop reading it. It takes you into a magical world thats full of danger and excitement and it is for all ages.

It is a classic and it will be remembered for all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You all know the story of the boy with the lightning scar on his forehead, so no need to post a review about that. However, I must post something about the wondrous job Jim Dale does in sharing with the tale of Harry Potter. After listening to this first installment our entire family was hooked on these audiobooks. Jim Dale is a master storyteller --complete with a different voice for each character. Dale acts out this book rather than simply re-tells it.After having listened to many dull readings of books on CD, we find ourselves now comparing everything to the standard Jim Dale has set.This particular audiobook inspired two of my very early readers to actually pick up a copy of this book and read it for themselves. I can give it no higher praise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Spoilers!There is a reason I think that J.K. Rowling managed to get so famous for her writing. I think it is because she has a very different style of writing from many other authors. It seems to flow differently than many other books.Anyway, I'm writing a review about Harry Potter, not J.K. Rowling. I thought that the book was very funny, and the characters were well developed for a first book in a longer series. I loved some of her ideas, and she used actual historical facts in this book. Nicolas Flamel was a real person, and I think that it was a good idea to include real facts in a fantasy book. I also loved the idea of the Mirror of Erised, where you could only see the deepest desire of your heart. I thought that it was really sweet that Harry saw his parents.It had everything I look for in a good book: good characters, the right amount of suspense- yet not horror, humor, and just a really good storyline. I will say this though, the first time I read it when I was eight, I did have nightmares and did not enjoy it. I read it again when I was twelve and loved it, so I would say that the age group would be 10 and up. I have read it over and over and it is still just as good as reading it the first time. I would suggest it to anyone who loves to read, and even a few who don't!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I absolutely love and adore Harry Potter! Sorry. It had to be said. No, but seriously I do. I first bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at my school's Scholastic book fair when I was in 5th grade. I remember that they were having a buy one, get one free sale and I went there with the sole intention of finding another Party of Five book told from Claudia's perspective (I had bought one of those at a previous book fair and loved it. Oddly enough, I had never watched the show at that point, just read a few of the books...) and I thought since it was free, might as well pick up The Sorcerer's Stone. My older sister by a year had been raving about this book because her teacher was reading it to the class and she loved it. So, I picked it up.I devoured that Party of Five book in a day, loved it, and re-read it again the day after. The day after that, I picked up The Sorcerer's Stone, read one chapter, deemed the book \\"boring\\", set it down, and that was that. At least until the movie was released during my freshmen year of high school. I watched the movie in theatres and absolutely loved it. I then picked up my 5th grade copy of The Sorcerer's Stone, dusted it off, read it, and loved it so much more than the movie. That started my anything but brief obsession with everything Harry Potter.I just fell in love with the whole world that J.K. Rowling created in the books. And I'll admit that even though I was a freshmen in high school when I first read it (all types of grown-up or so I thought), I still dreamed of waking up and finding my own Hogwarts letter delivered to me by owl post. I think that's the magic of the Harry Potter books. The children fall in love with a brand new world that's so different from their own and the adults are taken back to a more innocent time, where you still believe that good always triumphs over evil and when we all still believed in fairy tales.Since that first initial read, I have re-read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (and the other novels in the series) more than a dozen times. Every time I re-read it, I get something new out of it. Some subtlety that shows up in the later works that I didn't really grasp until I had read it again. It also never fails to make me feel better if I'm having a crappy day because let's face it. Harry, Hermione, and Ron were going through something so much worse.I just loved every single one of these characters. Harry was everything a hero should be: brave, loyal, clever, etc. And Hermione and Ron are the types of friends that everyone hopes for. The ones who are with you through thick and thin and don't judge you the whole way through. My favorite characters in this series would have to be Hermione, because I'm just a big a nerd as she is, and Fred and George, because their humor always made the books for me (of course, Luna is also one of my favorite characters, since she doesn't show up until Book 5, she doesn't get more than a brief mention here). Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces all of us to an amazing world with tremendous characters (both good and evil and everything in between).However, as much as I love The Sorcerer's Stone, I do have to say that re-reading it both last year and this year, I'm not surprised that I put it down in the 5th grade. Since it is the first book, we have to wade through the exposition of how Harry gets to go to Hogwarts. The result is that the beginning chapters aren't as exciting as the ones that follow. I do have to say that as much as I love this book because it introduced me to the spectacular world of Hogwarts, it is my least favorite of the seven. It's just that the books get so much better as the series goes on. And now I feel bad for even thinking the words \\"least favorite\\"...Anyway, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always hold a place near and dear in my heart because not only is it a fabulous novel, it was the book that got me back into reading. While I read a lot in elementary school, my interest in reading waned during middle school. Since I've read The Sorcerer's Stone, my interest in reading hasn't waned one bit. And I think that's the magic of the whole Harry Potter series, it a lot of people back into reading and it definitely got kids excited about reading again. I think it's influence is something that will still be significant in years to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Funny story I have about this book. Every night, I would get home and play video games like a regular teenager. One random day I just picked up the book, dropped me pants, went to the loo, and sat and read.

After the HP series (which was about 4 deep at the time), I reread both the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" series and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series (including \\"The Hobbit\\") and then just kept reading (and not just fantasy stuff, either!).

This book is easy to read and is for all ages. I would also recommend seeing the movie to this book if you have not already. The casting in the movie is perfect and I could not think of any other people better suited for the roles of the Harry Potter characters. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter #1: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J. K. RowlingI've been a fan of Harry since I read this first book, back in 1999 or 2000. The story of Harry, an eleven-year-old miserable orphan living with horrible relatives, captured my attention instantly. Rowling quickly moves Harry from his nasty aunt, uncle, and cousin by means of a magic letter, inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And that's where the real magic starts, at a school where ghosts roam, the subjects include charms and potions, sports on broomsticks, and quirky professors.I reread the Harry Potter series at least once a year, and have read the first book many more times than that. For me, reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is like spending time with an old friend, and I discover something new every time I read. Rowling gives readers plenty of detail about Hogwarts and the students and teachers; the cast of characters is quite large, but almost every character is given time, and it's easy to find someone to identify with or to pick as a favorite. The worldbuilding is also done nicely, with many of the wizarding customs revealed to Harry and the reader at the same time; Rowling is able to explain because Harry knew nothing of his magical background. The book is also a quick, engaging read - I like to read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" when I need some escapism, because I'm always sure to be drawn into Rowling's magical world.And if that wasn't enough, the author also pens a story line that arches over all 7 books of the series, that of Voldemort, a Dark wizard who tried to take over the world, but was mysteriously thwarted by a baby Harry.The Harry series is great for parents to read to their children, for young readers, or adults as well.5/5."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary book that sets the foundation for a spectacular seven book fantasy series.The vocabulary and content of this narrative are focused more towards a younger audience than the books later in the series, but the plot is just as intriguing and complicated as a full fledged literary masterpiece. The technical reading level of this book should be around the ten years old range, but people of any age can expect a novel of wonder as Harry Potter begins his magical journey.The story begins when we find Harry living a miserable life with his Uncle's family, the Dursleys. Harry, an orphan, has known little happiness in his life and believes that his parents had died in a car crash when he was but a youth.Harry's life turns upside-down when he receives a letter (or actually, hundreds) from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is thrust into a world filled with dangers, mythology, and magic. When Harry enters the magical world, he learns about the truth of his parents' deaths, murdered by the dark wizard, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemort.)The concepts in this book make an interesting read for readers of all ages, and Rowling, the conductor of this magical journey, deserves to be in a tier of writers including J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will never have even considered reading this book if its not for the hype. I have just finished the book and really, what's all the hype about?True, the story is entertaining, and very easy read. I finished the book in one reading, something I don't do often. As noted on countless reviews here, the story just keeps you going. In very simple language, the story describes love and hate, rich and poor, friends and foes, pulls afew puzzles, and one twist at the end.However, there really isn't anything particularly great about this story that would leave great impressions on me. If you're talking about Fantasy books, there are dozens of great titles, M Weis and T Hickman's Dragonlance series are my favourite. If you're looking for an apprentice mage story, RE Feist's earlier Magician series are better.However, strange enough, I will be reading the next book in the HP series, and most probably the entire series for as long as Rowling will be writing them, and I don't even understand why! I am wondering what is the secret of this title's success. Perhaps its the simplicity that appeals to everyone. Probably, in the Information Age, people wants fast, cheap, and simple entertainment. I admit reading Sorcerer's Stone probably yields the highest level of entertainment value per unit time, AND effort spent for me. Cool.If you want good entertainment from an easy read, get this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Simply enchanting.

Finally, one day I was bored with my Stephen King novel and pulled it out for a change of pace. Well, I have now read all 4 novels twice, bought the books on cassette and am addicted. This book, I would agree, is a children's book, but the subsequent ones are definitely more adult (especially Goblet of Fire). This first in the series introduces you to the wizarding world and is the beginning of a wonderful journey. Now I see why all my adult (and childless friends) have recommended these books.

She has the big ending... but its always something you'll NEVER in your wildest imagination think of. Its just a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Everybody knows these books inside and out, so I'll just talk about my first time reading it. I was probably around 16 or 17 years old, and I had heard about Harry Potter and how the book was fast becoming a huge phenomenon, but I had no idea why: I'd never any of the stories. This was around the time \\"Goblet of Fire\\" was about to be released and there was huge anticipation for it. I decided that perhaps I will read the book to see what the huge deal was about it. I found it at the library and I took it home with me. At around 10 pm, I started reading it. I kept reading and was stunned to see that it was 3 am when I finished: uh-oh, I have school in a few hours!Nevertheless, that first read had a great impression on me and I read the book again over the following few days a little slower to absorb the new magical world that J.K. Rowling had created: Diagon Alley, Gringotts Bank and of course Hogwarts. I found Harry to be an inherently and genuinely good hero: willing to risk his life for his friends, never letting his fame get to his head. It's also a treat seeing how much foreshadowing is in the first book for the next six to follow (the Mirror of Erised showing Ron with the Quidditch Cup -- might he be Head Boy in book 7??). Great comic relief at spots and smart dialogue, with a hero standing for all that is good make this an entertaining and moral read. Recommended for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, so I'm one of those people who didn't want to read the book. For a long time. And then I had little better to do on a vacation, and I got sucked in. As someone who's spent the larger part of the last five years with her nose deep in non-fiction (by choice, no less!), the reprieve granted by this book was altogether a new experience.Simply put, Rowling crafted a story that would excite young readers and remind older readers of what reading used to be about. She has a wonderful imagination and actually, I think, a talent for dealing with lots of subplots and mini-adventures without making the book seem rushed or un-organized. As a writer, though, the things that have interested me most are how she deals with characters (namely Harry) and characterization through dialogue.It only took a couple of minutes to figure out why I loved little Harry after finishing the book. He's a different sort of boy character--not shaped through silly mishaps or rough-and-tumble play, but by the way that he seems so swept along by everything, letting it happen to him and then reacting thoughtfully. I believe women authors have a unique capability for constructing fresh male characters, and Harry Potter is an excellent example. Rowling also creates a subconscious desire to read and know more about the boy through a simple technique: he speaks much less often than all the other characters. Though it is largely in his point of view, his dialogue is again reactionary most times. Therefore, when he does speak, one automatically takes interest.I think Rowling also did an excellent job creating personality through dialogue, as mentioned above: the owner of the wand shop, for example, had a wonderfully distinct voice, as do Professsor Snape and young Ron Weasley. The only time I object is when she writes Hagrid's dialogue--sometimes, writing the words as they sound gets the eyes of the reader a bit tangled, and it doesn't flow as well. (I couldn't figure out if he was supposed to be Scottish until I saw the film--he's not--while particular characters who are Scottish, like Oliver Wood, exhibit no distinct vernacular whatsoever.)Overall, if you think it's just a series for kids, that's simply not true (unless you're determined to be a stick in the mud). This book, and the subsequent ones, are great reads to escape the normal stressors of the day.And as to objecting to the witchcraft and magic element of it--well, I believe there are worse things out there than Harry Potter. The books aren't out there to convert, but merely to release the imaginaton for a while. Make of it what you will."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is only the first book out of five in the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling.

This book is long (over 200 pages) but it is also very fast moving and entertaining to read. You will find yourself finished with the book quickly but you will have enjoyed it. I have read the book over a half-dozen times and I still find it entertaining. If you like reading this is a must."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is a great book. For those who are new to the Harry Potter series, I definetly reccomend it. People who have started the Harry Potter series but skipped the first one, this book might bore you. Just be prepared for a lot of reading, as this book is over 200 pages long!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone effectively portrays supernatural elements and their ability to create the adventurous plot in her mystical story of a heroic young boy. The entire novel encompasses supernatural items that enhance Harry Potter's unexpected ventures. Supernatural is introduced in the opening of the book with Harry's unusual lightning bolt scar in his forehead. This shows the audience that, though Harry seems like a neglected, poor child, he is different than other children. It reveals everything unique and astonishing about him and also foreshadows the revelation of his wizardry. Harry's scar shows his sensitivity and his connection to his lost past. The scar is also an allusion to Odysseus's scar in Homer's poem the Odyssey. When Harry first arrives at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he grabs the attention of Professor McGonagall by his performance at flying lessons. Because of this incident, Harry joins the Quidditch team, on which he breaks many records and wins heroism. Rowling incorporates a supernatural element that appeals to childlike instincts in her readers. This form of fun and games upholds the story's lighter side. It stresses the importance of teamwork and use of magical powers unselfishly, unlike the evil Voldemort. When Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he is forced to examine himself and his desires for the first time. This supernatural element exposes Harry's genuine character. He wishes to see his parents alive and to capture the stone for the common good. The mirror teaches Harry that people are shaped by their desires. Throughout the exciting novel, Harry's life is drastically changed as he leaves his average home and enters a new world of supernatural. He is taught much about life and relationships with the aid of supernatural elements. Rowling's vast incorporation of the supernatural into Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone perfects the book's course and hits the target."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm sure most of you have at least heard of the Harry Potter series;(you should have).Let me say right now that I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I already read all of the HP books so far at least two times.As many of you are probaly waiting for the famed Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince(the 6 out of 7),I am to.Each and every book draws you to read the next,and when you are finished,you read again,and again,and again.Harry Potter just learns he is a wizard and already has to deal with another crazy life.I highly reccomend this to any fantasy lover.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In my opinion, I think that this book should recieve the Newberry Book Award. I found it very exciting and can run your imagination wild. I absolutly love the book. There might be 1 or 2 dull moments, but it's extremly excellent. You may think it's very uneducational, but I think it's an extremly extreme book for the first book of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a good story. I read this book in my summer holiday 3 years ago. And until now, I still remember the story. The story really impressed me much!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the book that began it all, the first book of the Harry Potter series, which have captivated readers of all ages around the world, with its magic. In the book, eleven year old Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard and is accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he begins to unlock the secrets of his past-learning of his parents death and that the dark lord, Voldemort, had tried to kill him as a baby-while learning all about magic through friendship, new enemies, the sport of Quidditch, a caring headmaster, and a malicious potions master with a grudge against Harry's father. The plot of the story is well-developed yet easy to follow and makes for a great read. Trust me, once you pick the book up, you don't want to stop reading because it is so good, yet you want to stop reading so that you don't finish the whole book in two hours."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Towards the end of the Wizarding War the instigator, one Lord Voldemort, tries to kill an infant using the dread Adava Kadavra spell. A green flash obscures everythingin the room. When the light clears the infant, Young Harry Potter, becomes The Boy Who Lived, and Lord Voldemort is dead.Or is he?Young Harry is left in the care of his relatives the Dursleys, a drear muggle family living at Four Privet Drive. He has no idea that his parents did not die in an automobile accident. Strange things happen when he is upset or angered, which earns him punishment from the Dursleys. Tormented by his cousin Dudley, set to live in a dingy closet under the stair, he has no idea of the wizrding world until, one fateful day, the owls arrive with his acceptance to the wizarding school known as Hogwarts.There is more waiting for Harry Potter at Hogwarts than he ever dreamed possible.This story engages and enthralls from the get-go, and if you know anyone who likes fantasy, any young reader who needs encouragement to read, anyone with the inner child who never quite gave up believing in magic, in the power of friendship and the bravery you can find only if you look deep inside and believe in yourself, your frinds and the strength of your convictions, then I recommend this book and the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book; I gave it a 4 out of 5 because it was very well put together and creative. The only thing that made me give it a 4 star review was the fact that it was kind of a kid's book - but that's not bad that's great, for them. Otherwise I thought it was an awesome book and I want to read the other four.This book is about a small boy named Harry Potter. His parents died at a young age and he was sent to live with his uncle (Vernon), aunt (Petunia), and cousin (Dudley). They don't treat him very well and make him sleep in the closet under the stairs. On Dudley's birthday the whole family goes to the zoo and look at the animals. Dudley was acting obscene by hitting the snake tank to make the snake move. When it doesn't, Dudley moves on. Harry on the other hand stays and talks to it, and strangely, it talks back. When Dudley sees the motion of the snake he goes and starts acting rude and hitting on the snake's tank again. This angers Harry and soon enough Dudley is in captivity and the snake is slithering free. Dudley's automatically blame Harry. Why would they blame Harry? Do they know something he doesn't? I will have you read and find out. (you won't be disappointed)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just finished rereading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must have first read it when I was the same age as Harry in this book, and while I didn't love it then, I find it charming now. I've read the books as they have grown increasingly darker, and it is refreshing to return to when Harry was an eager young wizard, not an angry teenager.The world of Hogwarts comes to life vividly, with all the fantastic creatures and people Harry meets. The story is simple, but original. I don't think the Harry Potter books are classics, but they are entertaining. And really, what more are we looking for in a book like this?These books are popular, I know, but don't expect to be bowled over by glorious, poetic prose. The writing in this book is solid, but not brilliant, and sometimes even clunky.Read, and be entertained."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Our Unity minister mentioned this book in a Sunday lesson several weeks ago to support his &quot;find your tribe&quot; message, and he used Harry Potter as one who had.

The first night I started it, I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. reading it. This book is very intense, and even more creative. I'm 13, and I've read a lot of books, but nothing like this. It's wierd how all the little details in the book are all tied together in the end. I didn't even know about this book until my grandpa that lives in Los Angeles gave both current Harry Potter books to me for my birthday, and I can't thank him enough.

There, he mets two great5 friends. They were Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley. He also met his arch rival, Draco Malfoy. Most of all, he met Voldemort, the guy who killed Harry's parents and gave him the lightning scar. He wanted to take the Sorcerer's Stone but fortunatly, Ron, Harry, and Hermoine stopped Voldemort from taking the Elixer of Life.I read this book because it is really exciting. When I read the back of the book I got interested in it. I also read this book because it is a best selling book. I read this book on account of that J. K. Rowling is my favorite author. It was also fantasy and adventure, which I like to read. That is why I read this book.My favorite part of the book is when Harry, Ron, and Hermoine play giant Wizard's Chess. It was when they were trying to get to Voldemort and the Sorcerer's Stone. They had to play when to get through. Ron was good at wizard's chess, so he was in command. Then, Ron made a bold and daring move. He let himself get eaten to get a checkmate."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a remarkable book that I could not put down. I loved the detail J.K. Rowling put in. Not only that but the way she described life with the Dursleys gave me a good idea of how they treated Harry. The story has a lot of action and adventure. There's also magic and humor. My favorite part in the whole book is when the Dursleys went to the zoo and the snake gets loose. I liked how I could relate to Harry and how his life wasn't going so well at first but he always tried. I also recommend any other books by J.K. Rowling and anything by Robert Stanek."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a good story. Period. The characters are colorful, and the author has a great imagination. The only problem I have with this book is that there is SO much hype that comes with it. It IS an excellent story, but it's not worth all attention it's getting. It's meant to be read by children and young adults, (young being the key word here) not adults. Many adults have read it and enjoyed it, but there are a lot of kids books that adults would like. I just don't see why everyone thinks this is a work of a genius. If you're looking for a TRUE fantasy read that would actually deserve the attention that Harry Potter gets, try HIS DARK MATERIALS by Philip Pullman and anything by JRR Tolkein. The younger set will enjoy Gail Carson Levine and the Dinotopia novels."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful and creative way to transport your mind back into the imaginative world of fantasy that most people have left in childhood. Running from wizard teachers, evading the Squib hall-monitor, and dodging the school poltergeist are only some of the adventures that this book takes you on. Some people are afraid of the wizardry in Harry Potter, but these people do not see the actual messages that Harry Potter gives children. Harry Potter demonstrates, amongst other qualities, important virtues of friendship, trust, and honor. These endearing qualities help Harry show how human he really is, which makes him relatable to his audience. I have read this book so many times that the pages are all dog-eared and wrinkled and the cover is practically falling off. Every time I read this book I find something else to like about it. Each page has something to hold it's reader's attention by using the whole spectrum of emotional experience. Every child wishes he could be Harry Potter and fly around on a broomstick while saving the world. I guess my inner-child wants this, and I believe that is why I love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone so very much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A Review By KoryA young boy, Harry Potter lives on Privet Drive with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. His mother and father died from a black magic wizard named Voldemort, even though he was told they died in a car crash. Harry is sent many letters by a school called Hogwarts School of Wizardry, which he is not allowed to read because his uncle treats him very unfairly. The family goes to a secluded house out by the beach thinking no one would find Harry there, but Hagrid comes to Harry's rescue, and later takes him to Hogwarts where Harry meets many new friends on the way.This story was very fun to read. I really liked the way the author laid everything out in the story, and made the story very suspenseful yet adventurous at the same time. I also enjoyed how Harry and Hagrid became good friends and they were always there for each other. During the beginning of the story Harry had a very rough childhood having no parents and having to leave with his horrible aunt and uncle. Harry finds out around the middle of the story that he is one of the most well known wizards alive, because he was the only person strong enough to live through Voldemorts powers. Harry notices that someone is trying to take the \\"whatever\\" Fluffy the three-legged dog is guarding, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on an adventure of there own.I would strongly recommend this book to almost anyone. It is a very fun and adventurous book with all kinds of curves. The reading isn't the easiest, but definitely not horribly hard. I am definitely going to read the second Harry Potter and hopefully read the rest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In her first book of a series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K Rowling creates awonderful fantasy world where both young and old can escape. This world is based onmagic and witchcraft that are actually taught at a school, a magical soccer game,Quidditch, played on flying brooms, and a whole new class of people, wizards. It is hardto say what is more interesting, Harry's adventures or Harry's world.Being an orphan, Harry has been in the care of his abusive Aunt and UncleDursley, after his parents were killed by Voldemort, a dark wizard. Voldemort also triedto kill Harry, but the spell back fired and the dark lord barely made out with his life.Harry's aunt and uncle, non-magical people referred to as \\"Muggles\\", are not only hisphysical guardians, but they also try to \\"guard\\" him from his true calling.Living with his Aunt and Uncle he is locked up and never allowed to participatein family activities. Harry is dying to escape. As most eleven year olds, he is confused,their are no more Barbies or GI JO's, but what is there? With this question in mind Harryfinds his answer. On his eleventh birthday Harry is accepted into The Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and Wizardry.Throughout this unimaginable experience he meets three friends, Hermonia,Ron, and Hagrid the giant. Hermonia symbolizes Harry's conscience, she always does theright thing, always doing good. Ron on the other hand , symbolizes the other side ofHarry, the cautious do not take any risks kind of guy. Now Hagrid seems to think andhave the knowledge of a muggle but yet, does not act like a muggle. Once being a wizardhimself at Hogwarts, Hagrid was kicked out for improper use of magic. From theseexperiences he guides Harry through his years at Hogwarts.In Harry's first year at Hogwarts, he is the most well know kid in school, numberone on the Quidditch team, and is well known because of his name...It is not surprising how the book ends. Of course good wins over evil, like it doesin every children's book. It is also predictable that Harry grows and matures into aresponsible wizard. Still J.K.

It's not that it's not a good book - it is - it's just not as enthralling or exhilarating as I expected it to be. The writing is excellent, starting out by depicting the painfully conventional family that Harry gets stuck with, then goes to Hogwart's, the wizard's school. But the plot is fairly predictable. Even the one twist I knew would be a twist, though I didn't suspect exactly how it would turn.

Also, for all the parents that are worried about whether it's suitable for children, dealing with witchcraft and so on, don't worry anymore. It's fine. In fact, they are against the &quot;Dark Arts.&quot; Some other parents are worried that it's too violent- personally, I didn't think it was too violent at all, especially considering how many parents allow their children to watch X-Men or Batman or Spiderman, and how many parents don't mind that they have some... apalling romance novels or science fiction books and magazines in their house, and have no problem with their children reading, or in some cases, seeing that.

I recently had the pleasure of reading the first three Harry Potter books, and was unable to put them down. The writing in them is excellent (in particular the descriptions), and the plots have enough twists to make them interesting even for adults.I think these books will become classics in their own right, alongside Tolkein, Wrinkle in Time, Dahl, etc. The writing in the Potter series is certainly on par with many of the classics. The only quibble I might have is that the world isn't quite as original as some of the other classic series.I do agree that there is more violence in these books than in *some* other books aimed at the same age range. It is not a lot more, and unless a parent is keeping their child from TV and movies, and other books with violence like the Tolkein series, there shouldn't be a reason to keep children from reading these."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"....you'll greatly benefit if you read the three series which represent the summit of sci fi/fantasy: Earthsea books, Lord of the Rings and the Narnia books. These are three series of books which, if you liked Potter, you will love. They are filled with adult themes so they arent only for kids. I hate it when age ratings are put on books which are perfectly suitable for adults. They should simply put an all ages rating for all these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"About a year ago I was at when they had a spotlight on a book about a young boy who goes to a Wizard school. It sounded interesting but for some reason or another I put it out of my mind until September of last year. I noticed that there were more than 1000 reviews and they were almost all positive. I had to find out what this was about for myself so I asked my Mom to order me the boxed set for my birthday. The only way I could get the American editions was to order them online so thank you very muchFrom the first chapter I knew that I held in my hands the work of a master. The foreshadowing was excellent and the writing painted a perfect picture in my head. By the time I had finished the book I was glad I had the set because I couldn't wait another second for Harry's adventures to continue. I can't really say much more than others have said but I would like to comment on a certain review I just read.H.C. from California has said that the Harry Potter books don't compare to C.S. Lewis, Susan Cooper or Lloyd Alexander. They claim that the other books are more magical. Perhaps what H.C. really means is that the Harry Potter books are very different from the other ones. The books aren't the traditional fantasy novel. Unlike the others, Harry has much more humour and day to day life and isn't as focused on an epic scale battle that will decide the fate of the world.Harry Potter just has to solve a riddle involving his school unlike the Old Ones with their ongoing battle with the Dark or the Pevinses with their quest to free Narnia from Eternal Winter. I perhaps like Rowling's Idea better because it is more original and realistic. The characters in the Rowling novels are also far more developed and interesting than any of the above mentioned authors. In fact, J.K.'s books have more in common with Roald Dahl since he is also very funny, if a little bit more off the wall.(see Matilda).I recommend these books to anyone and everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My son's teacher was reading this series to him.

Harry is a delightful hero, one both girls and boys alike will adore. He reminds me of the great child heroes in Roald Dahl's books (i.e. James, Charlie, Sophie, Matilda). To be compared with Roald Dahl is, in my opinion, the greatest compliment an author could receive. I only regret I don't have a 4th grade class to read this book aloud to.

I absolutely love them! However, I read the reviws, and some of them made me want to puke! Someone said that they are glorified horror stories! Get a life! I have read so many ridiculous reviews of this book that are written by people who are looking for something to complain about. Someone said that the author made fun of fat people because Hagrid gave Dudley a pigs tail. Wasn't he a mean, selfish, spoiled brat? That's why that happened. It had absolutely nothing to do with his weight! And some people say that they thought that breaking rules was not okay with them. HONESTLY! Would this have been an interesting, funny, delightful book if Harry, Ron, and Hermione had not broken the rules? Not at all! Some people remarked that they didn't like the idea of witchcraft and wizardry being OK. Well, are the students being taught magic so they can hurt or curse other people? No! It's the wizards that do that, the ones that &quot;went bad&quot; that are the enemies! My main point is that some people are taking these books too seriously. THey interpret them as bad influences, instead harmless, funny entertaining childrens books! Lighten up, people! Anyway, I love these books so much, and I will save them to read to my children, and they will read them to their children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter is a great book and it is very exciting so I rate it five star.

I can recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneBook Review - ****1/2 (out of *****)While reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I remembered several things about being a young boy that many often forget as they enter their teens. We often forget the hope that one feels at the idea of meeting a stranger who will take you off to your true destiny, which lies beyond the seeming monotone of day-to-day life in the real world. We also forget the power of enduring innocence, humility, and purity of heart. Along with a great many other important themes, Harry Potter is not only an entertaining and captivating read for children and adults alike, but also a very rich and vivid work that is sure to endure beyond the reaches of its modern children's book contemporaries.Harry is a boy entering his eleventh year of age. He seems normal on most counts; however, little does he know that he is a wizard-and not just any wizard, but a famous one, having caused the downfall of the greatest dark wizard of all time at the age of one. Of course, any further explanation is vain, as you have been living under a rock for the past decade if you don't know the story by heart yourself.One of the most unique aspects of this work is that although it is a children's book, it is still hard and vivid in its depiction of the wizarding world. The book starts off with talk of a double murder, and as the book goes on, we realize that the world of wizardry is not all fun and games. Danger lurks around every corner, whether in the form of a giant troll or of a twisted madman, reduced to the level of parasites. It is scary, but depicted carefully, so as to keep it a children's book.The one complaint that one may give the book is that it is a hodgepodge of themes-a prelude of sorts for a projected seven-book series. We see the first hints of themes of loyalty, purity of heart, love, and, most importantly, choices. Individual books later in the series will expand on individual themes, but the tapestry here gives this book a richness all its own. Such an engrossing experience is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter isn't your average kid on Privite Drive, he is wizard. When Harry was very young, his mom and dad were killed by the one who's name shall not be said \\"Voldamort\\". Voldamort is an evil wizard that gave Harry a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead. Harry goes to Hogwarts (a wizardry school) to learn and make his first friends he ever had. Harry goes through a series of challenges there and ties to win the Wizards cup.Some parts of this book I don't like are when Harry won the wizards cup. I didn't personally understand why the Sorcerers Stone was all that important. I also didn't like the part when Hagrid was hiding the stone and Harry was wondering what was exactly in his pocket. The part when Voldamort died was my favorite because Harry got to sees the attacks on everybody for the time being.I think the Fantasy and Fiction readers would read this book because there was a lot of magic in it and there's no such thing as magic. A book I would recommend is After because that was my first book I read and it was good!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series begins! This is the first novel written by J.K Rowling in the Harry Potter series! This book is like an introduction to the series.The book begins with covering what happened to Harry's parents, how he got to live with his nasty aunt, uncle, and cousin, what weird, strange, unexplainable things happened to him, and how he found out what he truly was; a wizard!Apart from introducing you to the series, the book has parts in which you actually hold your breath and read what comes next! The book also introduces the reader to Harry's friends, teachers, and enemies! The book also has a very good plot to keep the reader entertained! You can almost feel yourself right next to Harry as he explores the realms and secrets of the wizarding world!Carefully detailed sentences and phrases! J.K Rowling did an amazing job in making sure you don't fall asleep reading the book! She also put loads of humor to keep the reader laughing! You can read this book ten times, and still want to read it again!Overall, this book is an amazing introduction to the Harry Potter series, has a good plot to it, has a lot of humor, and is basically a very fun and amusing book for all ages!Well recommended!Rating?

And I'm glad I did. The movies are awesome, but the books are even better. There's a whole level of hilarious humor in Rowling's writing that just doesn't make it into the film versions of Harry Potter. Because of the time crunch, numerous scenes from the book never make it onto the big screen. If you've seen the movies and think you've seen it all, you're in for a big surprise when, like me, you finally get around to cracking the books open to really enjoy the ride.Rowlings is simply brilliant. She writes in a style that appeals to all ages. I enjoy how she gauges time by the school year and its associated seasons. Her vivid descriptions appeal to all the senses; you can \\"taste\\" the sweet custard or \\"feel\\" the coldness of a passing ghost. When things get intense, she lightens things up with a hilariously funny episode -- often something happening to Harry or Ron. When you're lulled into thinking things will be routine for a while, something leaps out of the pages to turn everything upside down.The characters, of course, are magnificent. Ron always gets to say what everyone else only dares to think. Without Hermione's brains I think all of Hogwarts would simply fall apart (or blow up)! And Harry, the reluctant hero, is remarkably human, never seeking the spotlight but always finding himself in the center of things, always having to face and conquer his biggest fears. We can see ourselves and our friends quite clearly in this trio. The rest of the cast, from wise wizards to eccentric teachers, brings color and fun to the text.If you like a good book, read Harry Potter 1. Once you're done, you'll undoubtedly find yourself picking up Harry Potter 2 immediately. The second book is just as fantastic as the first. I'm ready to start Book 3 ... if I hurry, I just might get through Book 4 before the fourth movie comes out!--Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this is the 1st book of the most captivating fun,imaginative,best book series harry potter this is where you learn about harry and why he has a scar the shape of a lightning bolt on his forehead you also learn all about the very different characters through out the story with fun,imagination,great adventures,a pesty poltergeist,the funny humor within the books,the hogwarts ghost,the headmaster albus dumbledore,all the professors and students,all the different corridors,talking potraits,magical classrooms,staircases that move,the vanishing step,and all the things that lurk around every corner and in the forbidden forest and the giant gameskeeper of hogwarts hagrid i escape to all this places and leave the real world behind and escape on platform 9 3/4 to hogwarts a fun imaginative amazing book that everyone should read take from me the biggest harry potter fan ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Gift made it to it's destination in good time and in good condition.

You would enjoy these books as much as I did"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was just 3 weeks ago when I picked up my sister's copy of Sorcerer's Stone and started reading. Hoping to understand what the big deal was all about. I found out quickly.The story of Harry Potter's first year is not only moving, but thrilling. From the start I cared about Harry, because of the way his parents were taken away from him. From the start, it was a tale of vengance. From there it moves to how horribly his life is going with his Aunt and Uncle. Which forces the reader to care about wether or not this kid can get away from them. From there he starts to attend the fabled Hogwarts School and we want to see Harry succeed. Not only in the class room, but the confrontations he faces with teacher's, and other classmates, but the final confrontation with the murderer of his parents.What so impressed me with Harry Potter, was that it was incredibly matture for the targeted age range. It proves that people can write Children's Books without dumbing it up, or talking down to children.Although I thought so highly of this book, I gave it four stars becuause of the predictiability of it. At the end of the book, I knew that Harry would win the day, and be the hero of the school. It was no surprise to me when everything that couldn't happen to a first year student at Hogwarts happened to Harry.All-in-all it's a very good book for not only children. But adults. I quickly read all four of the books, and I am now EAGERLY awaiting the release of the fifth one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...To have a book make me smile while I am reading it, and discuss it excitedly with friends, to make conversation with strangers you see reading it on the commuter train in the mornings... that is the mark of a great book. This book thrilled me because of the plot twists, (I never saw some things coming), the remarkable breadth of the characters (Snape is so hateful, yet is emerging as one of the most intriguing characters of them all, and in this book, you get to see his first encounter with Harry.) If one wants to read Harry, definitely, they can only start with this book. Some complain the book is not well written, or sophisticated. Who cares? This book hooked me from beginning to end, (and so many other readers) that it truly is a phenomenon. This book deserves to be a classic with a long, long shelf life. Once you get past Chapter 1, you're hooked for ever. And considering that Rowling, like the rest of us is just a Muggle, that is true magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OK, heres the deal. Plain and simple. I am in college, and I hear about this so called &quot;Harry Potter Craze&quot; from my little brothers, mom and sister at home. I was like, yeah I might read this kid book.

I have a 2 hour trip on the way home from college, and my work is 45 mins away everyday, so heres a way for me to read this stupid book and make my brothers happy. So I come to realize that I am like the 30th person on the waiting list to get this set of tapes. I even found out that the county had like 10 copies. Ok, ok, so maybe this book could be descent. so anyways, i finally get the set like 2 weeks later and I pop the tape in on the way back from south beach at rush hour (yeah you know what I'm talking about.) By the time I get home to the Univ of Miami, I am engulfed, hook, line, and sinker. I couldn't stop. I even brought a walkman so I could listen on my stroll to classes. Then, I start on my friends in college. read it I tell them, but you know how most college kids are. they are just too plain lazy to even GET the book. SO I go out and buy it for one of my friends, cause she didnt have a tape player. within two days, shes done and going to the store for #2.

This fictional series by J.K. Rowling is about a boy names Harry who lives with his neglectful aunt, uncle, and cousin, because his parents died in a fatal car crash when Harry was just one year old. Or did they? When odd things start occurring and Harry finds himself in a shack-like house face to face with a giant man named Hagrid will he find himself questioning the truth to his past? This intriguing read opens up a whole new world of mystical creatures, spells, culture, and even sports. Follow Harry as he travels through wizarding school, makes friends as well as foes, and sneaks through the night under an invisibility cloak. This book is so exciting and magical that you wont be able to put it down. I know I couldn't!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you read this book you will be amazed at how exciting it is. I would recommend this book to a nine or older child. Harry Potter is an intelligent, courageous, and brave person. This book might be long but it still is a great book. J K Rowling is a very good author. The books that she writes are very exciting and interesting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a very good book. You might think it starts slow but the rest of the books would make up for that slow start you might think it has."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was never a Harry Potter devotee in the beginning. Hell, I didn't really understand the craze, but I figured, if it got kids reading, then who was I to complain.Last summer a friend of mines daughter overheard a few of us conversing over the phenonmenon and she offered to loan me the first of the collection. To be honest, I wasn't interested in reading them, but I didn't want to mean and turn her nice gesture down.To state it bluntly, I read this book in a week and immediately became a fan. As soon as I finished the book, I rented the movie and became an even bigger Potter geek. I'm not going to go into specifics of the plot, but I loved the development of the characters and have a fascination with Snape for some reason. The details of both the muggle and wizard worlds were excellent and I'll admit I thought for a little too long about what house I would fit into (according to quizzes, I'm a Ravenclaw.)It's a surprise to hear that even some college professors in our English department have these books as required reading! The next week, I asked my friends daughter to loan me the second one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It starts where Harry is having a horrible life and living in a horrible family. That family is the Dursleys. He is having a horrible life because his life is miserable and he is living in a room that is small and his birthdays are never celebrated including his eleventh birthday. Then something good happened to Harry. A person named Hagrid, the Keeper of Keys and Grounds came and told Harry about his life with his parents and who he is. The Dursleys was in shock and so was Harry because he couldn't believed all this. Now Harry is going to Hogwarts to learn about magic and wizardry. Harry never felt this happy before because he didn't have to live with the horrible Dursleys and live with in that horrible house. Harry found many secrets about his family because of many people like Albus Dumbledore and artifacts like the Mirror of the Erise. The most horrible secret he found was the person-whom-must-not-be-named. That person was Volemort. Now Harry and his friends goes on an adventure to find out about Voldemort with many secrets being revealed.This book is great to read because the book puts your mind into the book. It reaveals many secrets and many mysterious things about Harry's life and about Hogwarts. Also it shows many adeventurous things like where he goes to find out about who is Voldemort and what is he doing at Hogwarts. The book shows many cool and magical things like the flying broom, the wands that people have, the classes things to do like transfiguration, and other many stuff, but the most interesting about Hogwarts was Hogwarts and it's great magical powers and its creature beings living inside it. This book just grabs your mind into the book showing great and mysterious things for all the readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"~When hearing about the Harry Potter books, I was skeptical. I have read so many books that are about the same sort of thing, and the authors absolutly murdered the whole idea. After hearing about how good it was from several friends, i finally tried reading it.The begining, although very interesting, is somewhat hard to get through. It is worth it, though. I fell in love with theis book after the first couple of chapters. I found myself reading it whenever possible. the plot is great, and~~ keeps your attention.Fantasy lovers will love this book, and I advise you to read all the others, too. JK Rowling is a wonderful author, and puts magic into books about magic!~"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When Harry Potter came out about seven years ago, I thought that it was just some sort of fad that would die out. I looked warily on all those children who loved the book so much. What was all the commotion about, I thought? Years passed by and Rowling produced more books. I kept my distance and didn't read any of them. Soon however, my own brothers were starting to read it. They sat fixated on her books for hours. I was puzzled and didn't see what the big fuss was about. I just assumed that her books weren't very good and were for little kids. Soon however, my brothers told me to start reading it. Finally, I budged and decided to would read the first book. So I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. To my surprise, it was actually a pretty good book. It's about the adventures of Harry Potter, who is born a wizard although he's unaware of his special powers. His young years of his life are lived with his annoying relatives, the Dursleys. He must suffer through being treated like a second-class person while his cousin Dudley is pampered. The book kept me reading all the way until the end. There's lots of magic going on throughout the book, with stuff disappearing and levitating and walls opening and dragons. However, there's still an interesting drama in this book. There's a lot of things that appealed to me in this book. I liked how Harry Potter dealt with his new powers. There's a good deal of humor in this book too. The characters are unique and interesting. If you haven't read any Harry Potter books yet, just remember-it's never too late."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Evaluation: Ever since I heard of Harry Potter and its popularity I've wanted to read it. Until now, I've never found time to read a Harry Potter book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was by far one of the most interesting books that I have read. I would hear all these different people talking about how good of a book it was but I always figured it was for a younger audience. However, this was not the case. Every new chapter I started seemed like a new adventure which prevented me from putting the book now. You can read this book for 2 or 3 straight hours without a problem, unlike most other books. This is exactly what separates Harry Potter from any other book, along with that it's meant for any age group and audience. I don't think that there is any other fantasy book that is quite like Harry Potter. It sucks you into the story, making you feel like you are along for the ride. I would recommend this book to everyone, even if you're not a fantasy book lover. It's a whole new experience that you have to take on for yourself . I will guarantee that you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was pulled into reading this book because of all the hipe.

I strongly recommend this book, and have fun reading it"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first read the book, I didn't think that it would be fun at all.

It probaly won't change your life but it will prove to be a great book.

I will make this short don't spend all your time reading review, just start the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What is it that makes the Harry Potter books so absorbing? The basic plot, certainly--who could resist this story of the underdog triumphant, especially when he gets to be a wizard with magical powers? But most of the appeal of these books, I think, lies in the details. J.K. Rowling (like another of my favorites, Roald Dahl) has the gift of creating an intricately detailed, humorously absurd world. You want to go to school at Hogwarts, eat Chocolate Frogs, and ride a Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick to play Quidditch, just like Harry.I might mention that the American version (&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;) changes some of the dialect from the British version (&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;). I prefer the British version.A wonderful book, and a wonderful series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've been trying to figure out what made this series so popular and this is what I came up with.Don't get me wrong, the Harry Potter books aren't bad and I like the idea of making the books progressively more mature. And the fact that its over-rated goes without saying. Of course its over-rated. Anything this big that doesn't fundamentally change life as we know it is over-rated.As a children's book its probably brilliant and I won't dispute that...however, I think that the fact that so many adults have got into it is misleading. Reading these reviews (and many others) one would get the impression that the books with imigination the likes of which has never been seen before...and that's simply not true.I think that the reason one would get this impression is because most of the readers who buy the hype associated with any mainstream book are mainstream readers. So to the likes of those who spend most of their time reading books by writers like Danielle Steele and Tom Clancy any writer with a half decent sense of imagination is something new to them (I'm talking about imagination in the fantastical sense here...I'm not suggesting that writing based on reality is not imaginative...just a divfferent type of imagination). But for those of us who's reading is dominated by stories set in magical realms and universes, there isn't much in Harry Potter that is new.In fact, Harry Potter is very much a recycling of many cliches associated with magic rather than an innovative exploration of the theme. For example, the concepts that magic users wear Wizard and witche's hats and use wants and broomsticks are old and tired. Its perfect for children, because that's what they probably expect, but not for adults. There is nothing new in stones of power, mirrors reflecting other dimensions, flying vehicles and so on.So basically, if most of your reading is fantasy, you will probably be less than throroughly impressed with this book. However, if these themes are relatively new to you, you'll probably find it nothing less than an amazing feat of imagination and you'll rave about it endlessly..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I, as an adult with four children, have read all four books.

There are many wonderful storyplots in the book that keep your attention through out the entirebook(s): Rags to riched, being poor, being too smart, being picked onby bullies at school, and yes good verses evil. All of my childrenhave read the first book and the oldest has read all four.

Honestly, I find all the hype bewildering. The book is entertaining but certainly not the &quot;best book I ever read&quot; which is what I keep reading from other reviewers. It makes one wonder what these people have been reading all these years...the funnies perhaps? Well, it's certainly better than the funnies so in that respect I'd have to agree. Actually, I feel kind of cleansed not being part of the masses, the hoards that rave and drool over every word from the Potter series. It really isn't that great of a book. And in some respects may actually be inappropriate for some kids. We learn in the first chapter that Harry's parents are murdered and he is witness to the scene. He is persecuted and endures emotional and physical abuse by his adopted muggle family and later, he is almost killed when he comes upon a sorcerer drinking the blood of unicorns. Furthermore, some of the characters are rather flat. None of the non-witch type people (muggles), to my recollection, have any good qualities at all; rather, they are evil, foolish or lazy, etc. It makes one wonder why such one dimensional writing is praised to such extents as to create a climate of hysteria. I'm bewildered. It's a good read but again, certainly not &quot;the best book I ever read in my life&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was a little slow to catch onto the Harry Potter craze and I am so pleased to have finally done so. I actually read the original British edition of the book which I trust is the same as the American one with the exception that some of the language in the US edition has been &quot;Americanized&quot;.I didn't read this with the thought in mind that this is a children's book. Coming at it from an adult perspective, I was thoroughly taken in and found it quite &quot;unputdownable&quot;. I actually found myself wanting to skip ahead to the next page to find out what was coming next. It's been a long time since a book has made me do that.The central trio - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - is delightful as are the cast of colourful supporting characters, particularly Hagrid the giant who first alerts Harry to his magical gifts, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' chief wizard, and Malfoy, the bully Harry and his friends repeatedly come up against.The &quot;action&quot; sequences - particularly the Quidditch (the invention of this game is particularly creative) match and the sequence in the Forbidden Forest - are filled with narrative tension. I also love Rowling's descriptions and her names for people and places. The way she has her characters enter their &quot;magic&quot; universe is delightful as well.I will say though that there is more than a hint of menace (one might even say an underlying cruelty) running throughout the book that even I found surprising. (I can only imagine how younger children would react!) Harry, whose parents we are informed early on were brutally killed, is essentially abused by his uncle - forced to sleep in a cupboard, etc. A three-headed dog nearly bites the leg off one character. There is also a particularly frightening trek through the Forbidden Forest that results in some rather gruesome blood-letting.&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; is certainly one of the best books I've read this year and in quite some time. I heartily look forward to the second volume."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a book about Harry Potter, who finds himselfin a parallel world of magic.I am 9 years old and I think this is one of the best books I have readand I have read a lot of books!!

Now I'm sorry I waited!The Amazon review pretty much tells you the story of Harry's amazing transformation from ordinary, unloved boy to renowned wizard. What it doesn't get across strongly enough is how much FUN it is to read about it! Although I'd been assured this was as much a book for adults as it is for children, part of my hesitation to read it was because I doubted that. I shouldn't have.

All over the world adults haverediscovered the magic of children's literature - on any bus or trainyou could spot a university student or a man in a suit reading aboutthe adventures of Harry.I loved children's books before HarryPotter, but many of my friends (who I nagged until they read the firstbook) had forgotten about them. My Mum in particular found the seriesa wonderful escapist experience for reading after work.The onlynegative I could say about the series is that it brought theimaginative, Fantasy genre to the attention of people who think thatanything out of the mundane must be of the occult.

The author invents a full world of discoveries and excitement, and it seems as though she treats her young (and older...) readers with respect to their logics as well as their imaginations... A must read for all of us who are young at heart and still enjoy using our imaginations...It's especially interesting to see how both wizards / witches and &quot;muggles&quot; look down on the others, while both sides have trouble getting along in each other's world...

Being a muggle, Harry starts his adventures with his evil Aunt and Uncle, eventually being bombarded by letters until they have no choice but to let him go to Hogwarts Wizarding School. He lives his parents name to the fullest no matter if he's up to trouble late at night with Ron and Hermoine or playing Quidditch, the game of many balls. This book was most interesting because it opens the mind to new worlds and ideas. You dont realize that theses ideas are too extreme until it closes each night. Also it leaves you feeling curious, it draws you towards future books, you never know the complete truth of Harry's life. Children will sleep at night dreaming of magic, not of nightmares of the evil Voldemort, its not too scary, just enough to keep you interested. A true classic in the making, don't u think Constance? Love your main man Mr. B!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter by J.K.Rowling, was by far the most imaginitive book I've ever read. It starts off with a wizard, Albus Dumbledore, who is the Headmaster at Hogwarts, a wizard school, he drops a baby off infront of the Dursley's doorstep. The baby was Harry Potter, and he needed someone to look after him because his parents were killed by an evil wizard, Voldemort. The only family he had left were the Dursley's and the absolutley hated wizards and Harry! He grew up not knowing who he was or where he came from, all he thought he knew was that his parents died in a car accident and he was the only survivor, left with a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Harry grew living in a cupboard under the stairs, and he always looked really skinny, it was from the big hand-me-down from the Duresley's son, Dudley. He was the same age as Harry but about ten times the size. The Dursley's often sent Harry to his cupboard without any dinner, if anything bad that happened, because they knew what he was, but poor HArry had no power over it. Well Harry started to receive mail, with no return address. Harry went to get the mail one day and saw a letter addressed to him, so he started to open it, but then Mr. Dursley took it away. Well, he received MANY more letters but still, they kept them from him, eventually they were forced to drive away to stay away from all the letter. On Harry's eleventh birthday, a wizard named Hagrid found Harry and told him he was a wizard and explain everything that happened with his parents. He happened to go off to Hogwarts Wizard School, and at the end of the year he has to battle a man named Quirrell, who in the end turns out to be the wizard that killed his parent, Voldemort. Voldemort lost the battle but is still alive and waiting for his next attempt to kill Harry Potter. This book was full of imagination and fantasy. I liked it to a point, but I'm not into fantasy books. It was also full of suspense, which kept me going in the book, or else I would have had to put the book down, but over all I really liked it, but I recommend this book to younger readers, for example, eight year old to about eleven.

Harry Potter seems to be this teenage boy that is almost like a symbol for bravery - and perhaps even immortality, for he never seems to die. He may be thrown from a mountain, thrown into shark-infested water, thrown amid a horde of savage beasts and yet come out unharmed. Harry Potter seems to be all that I myself would like to be. That's perhaps what makes me like him. As for the book, the never-ending adventure makes me like it. I have read it, have read the sequel, and plan on reading the third and upcoming fourth book.This Harry Potter kid is really taking the world by storm.

This book was a delight to read. Its fun and whimsical and easy to read. Get it, you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When my mother first suggested that I join the craze and pick my self up a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I plain out laughed. Reading wasn't my \\"thing\\". Alas, after much nagging, I finally gave in and agreed to read just a little of the book. My plot was to read the first chapter and then inform my mother that I had better things to do. Everything was going according to plan until I came across one little problem; I loved it. Within the first few pages this book already had me totally engulfed. I absolutely could not put it down. I finished the book that same night.The way J.K. Rowling writes - with such wit and enthusiasm, makes the book a magnet to all types of readers, the avid and, well, like my self, the non-reader. It was amazing to find myself having in-depth conversations about Harry Potter with an 8 year old. That's the best part about the book - although the book is designed for ages 9-12, it appeals to a much broader age range. One of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much is due to the fact that I could identify so well with the main character, Harry Potter; in Harry I saw strength, courage, and honesty. This book was filled to the brim with fantastic writing - one minute you'd be laughing with Harry and his friends, and the next you would fear for their lives.This great book has introduced me to a new favorite past-time - reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wanted to read this book because I heard of all the hoopla about the book being banned from schools, and children shouldn't be allowed to read it. I'm a high school senior and after reading this book, I wanted to read the other two! I loved the books, and the way the author writes, she paints a picture in your mind that you'll never forget. I also noticed that after reading this book I had the coolest dreams. I used this book for a english book report and my teacher loved it. I think anyone young or old should read this book. The ideas in the book are great, and witchcraft is mentioned in such a funny way that you don't even think of it being real. Unless you really believe in hats that talk and paintings that talk, but that's you. Buy the book! It's worth it! I finished it in about three days. I couldn't put it down. BUY THE BOOK! Peace, Love and Hockey~ Lauren, 17"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A touch of Anglophilia, a mixture of realism not usual in children's fiction (yes, realism), a gripping story that moves at a furious, roller-coaster pace, a wonderful combination of the ordinary and the extradorinary-- all these combine to make this first Harry Potter book a well-deserved sensation. The friendship between Harry and Ron is also intensely sweet and harkens back to other great friendships of children's literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Before you begin reading this forget everything they said about the age range for this book. I am almost 14 and really enjoyed this book.When I first picked up this book I saw it as a light read, nothing more. As I read it it remained a light read but also a good one. The writing style is simple and humorous with words and names such as quiddich, Hogworts, Dumbledorf that fit in perfectly.The characters are also wonderful. Harry, Ron and Hermoine work very well together (especially the back and forth dialouge between Ron and Hermoine) and the side characters are are also well written. With characters such as the nervious Quirrel, friendly Hagrid and mischiefous Peeves circulating the books pages and popping up where they wish makes the book better too. Some of the side characters are better than the main characters themselves.What makes this book great though, is the way the plot twists and turns and opinions changes. Heroes become villians, villians become heroes and suspects become innocent bystanders. The lttle puzzles also make this book great. The end itself is almost like a puzzle on psychiatry and the human mind.A must read, even if just for a light one, and a wonderful tale. Splended in all catagories. Buy it as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book thinking that I needed to see what the book-buying craze was all about...and now I am part of that craze. As a children's novel, I couldn't figure out what the big deal was, but having read the first book and currently reading the second, I can honestly say that this is some of the most creative and fun reading I have ever done. Harry's story and the characters around him are wonderful for all ages. These books will be classics some day, I am sure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I could safely say that this is the best book that I have ever read, except for the other Harry Potter books. I could not take my hands off this, even to eat or sleep. J. K. Rowling did an awesome job on this book. The tale is wonderfully woven, and with some many exciting twits and turns, this book keeps you on your feet. People of all ages can enjoy this book. It is exciting enough to keep and adult interested, yet with no bad plots (violence, cussing, etc.) it is ok to read to small children. This is one reason that so many people like this book. If you haven't read this go out and buy a copy, or borrow one from a friend, you don't want to miss this.Lindsey Cobb Age 13"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this was book was such a delight.

I am a devout fantasy reader, and have not had this much enjoyment from a book since reading Tolkien's! The Harry Potter books will definitely remain on my bookshelf for years to come!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first heard about Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in our local newspaper I thought it was going to be another unexciting book for littler kids, boy was I wrong! I was going to the bookstore to pick up a book on dog training because we had just gotten a new puppy. My mom spotted the first Harry Potter book. After awhile, she talked me into buying it. That night, I started reading it and I couldn't stop. I only stopped because my mom made me shut off the lights at 10:00. I am 11 and I finished that book in three days because it was so good. It talks about a boy that was just born when an evil wizard came to their house and kills his parents. Harry somehow survived the attack with only a scar on his forehead. He was stuck living with his mean aunt and uncle the Dursleys. The next thing he knew he was going to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't had a thrill for awhile. It's funny, scary and full of adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Everyone, their kid brother and their great aunt said Harry Potter was the best thing they'd ever read. But the books came out one after the other here in the US and I was used to the &quot;diminishing returns&quot; phenomena of book series: the first book is great and then it's all down hill.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone IS great. The characters are dead on and the plot is rock solid, but what I like best are the moments that hit you, when you are *so* in awe of Rowling's writing and her vision. Some lines are just so wryly funny, you know she must have had a great time writing it. And she really sweeps you up into it. When Harry (or any other character) is enthused, you'll be enthused. I still am! Everytime I look at a phone I'm floored by how ingenious we've been devising all these ways to get around not having magic! (Read it!)The MOST exciting moment for me was finishing the third book, the Prisoner of Azkaban. Everything starts coming together -- things you had no idea had anywhere to go when you read the first two. I really, REALLY started to feel for Harry. And although the climactic ending, and the emotional wringer it put me through, were more than you could ever ask for from any book, I am REALLY excited about where the series is going. When you finish it, you'll see there's still a lot of things for Harry to do, and the mischief he and Ron and Hermione can get into will only increase as they get more privileges with age.So far there is one book a year -- a year at Hogwart's, that is -- and there will be seven books. Since they started there at age 11 that makes a lot of sense. For once I don't wonder how an author will &quot;stretch&quot; the series &quot;that far&quot;, I'm wondering how she can fit it all in!Harry Potter is going to do incredible things and it's going to be an incredible ride. You have to read this one to get on board, so do it: Jump in! Experiences this magical don't often occur in our Muggle world. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In the UK, at least, the Harry Potter books are published in two editions: one with a children's cover and one with an adult cover. Both are best sellers. Says it all really. I can't remember the last time I read two fiction in two nights. I could say - Terry Pratchett meets The Secret Seven - but it wouldn't do Harry Potter justice.

While it may have appeared that it was adults accompanying their children, there were enough adults buying these books up for themselves that I thought I really needed to see what kind of book would get American adults so excited to read. I'm very glad that I did! J. K. Rowling has a special gift for writing story lines and developing characters that transcend all age groups. I was especially appreciative of the author's high quality of writing, her plot progression, and the development of her characters. This book is an excellent, vivid, and solid introduction to that which is to come in this series, and it certainly made me want to board the next train to Hogwart's!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Kids and adults the world over have fallen in love with the adventures of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Why? Simply put, they make reading fun. The books are written at an easy-to-read level, yet they are packed full of excitement.I won't go into a huge review of the storyline (read other reviews or the back cover for that) but I will go into the basic plot. Harry Potter is an eleven-year old orphan living with his horrible aunt, uncle, and cousin when strange letters begin to find their way into the house. Soon after, a giant named Hagrid arrives to tell Harry that he is a full-blown wizard, like his parents, and like his parents he has been accepted into the greatest wizard school in the world, Hogwarts. Upon arriving at the institution (in a highly unconventional way), Harry begins his studies and faces the challenges that all kids his age go through - homework, friendships, and playing sports, though most of us don't do it flying on a broom in a game called Quittitch!However, the books aren't mere fluff. Harry's past contains a terrible secret, and while at the school the young boy must literally face his demons and make the ultimate decision as to where his loyalties lie.The boooks (and films) have been scrutinized for being about witchcraft. Here's the deal: yes, there is magic in the story. Many of the characters are, after all, wizards. However, these stores are not anti-religious or atheistic. The central themes to the books deal with good versus evil and the importance of being true to yourself and your friends, issues we all encounter.Overall, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is an incredible work of fiction. It successfully kicks off one of the greatest-selling children's series of all time, and even adults like myself are continually captivated by Harry's story. Reading it is a magical adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is not my favorite but it is wonderful. I can find no fault with it what-so-ever! I loved it. The only reason I rate the 3rd and 2nd books higher is that we already know the characters by then so the story comes along faster and easier because we don't have to explain so many things. But that is no fault of this book. Unique fiction for older children that adults can fully enjoy and look forward too?!? I cannot believe she did it, but she has kept it up for 5 books now and I cannot wait for the final 2. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"(...) I really wasn't interested in this book at first, but like some of my favorite books, I tried to get into it for a second time, and boy howdy, I did. I love Harry Potter right now!I read this book about four years ago when the fourth one was fresh off the press and I was in third grade. I really didn't want to ride the wave, but my friend and I chanllenged each other to who would finish it first. I got to the first a hundred pages in about a month but returned it to the library since it seemed to bore me. (My friend only got to the first eleven pages)!For some reason or another, I checked it out again. (I am a very complex person with my feelings). The book grabed hold of me and drew me in. I finished it in a couple of days.Now, I don't know if I should tell you about the plot because, come on, don't we all know it by now?Well, I guess I should tell you anyways. It is about an eleven year old boy named-you guessed it- Harry Potter.He is an orphan who is abused by his only relatives-his uncle, aunt, and porkish cousin. He was alwaysed told his parents died in a car crash, but no. They were killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort. so that means that-duh!,-Harry's a wizard. He is then whisked away to Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardery. There he meets friends and finds out he's famous.I'm leaving it there. I don't want to give away the whole plot.All in all, I highly recomend that YOU FIND THIS BOOK AND READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!! I don't care where you find it.

Harry Potter is an 11 year old boy who doesn't know that he's a wizard. He had no idea his parents were and that they were killed while he was just a young child. All he knows is that they were killed in what was said a car accident and he lives with his mean relatives the Dursley's. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia wanted nothing to do with Harry when they found him left on there porch one evening. They had there spoiled baby Dudley and they hated Harry's parents because they weren't normal.Harry had a bad childhood. His room was under the stairs of the home. His clothes were all of his mean cousins seconds and hand me downs. He had to deal with constant abuse from Dudley until one day that all changed when he received a letter. A letter to attend a school of Magic called Hogwarts. Uncle Vernon would have nothing to do with it calling it jibberish. After much fun and convincing which I won't spoil for you he is off to Hogwarts.Once at Hogwarts Harry meets Ron and Hermoine who all quickly become friends.

The three share a lot of the same interests and all have their unique qualities that add to the group.The three however discover a secret that could threaten the school. Voldemort the man who killed Harry's parents is rumored to be back and could be trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. One of the few things that could return the evil wizard back to his full form. Harry and his friends can't let that happen and they will stop him no matter what the consequences.This is a fantastic novel. People of all ages will enjoy it. I had scene the movie but had never read the book. My younger sister had recently purchased all of the books that had been written and I've decided to read them. I was surprised on how good they were. You get hooked by the book instantly and there is no wanting to put it down. J.K. Rowling is awesome and I'm glad she has been so successful off this franchise.Over the years many books have been written geared to make children read. Fantasy is an easy topic to get kids to read because of the nature of it. The most notable of these series was C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Those classic books can be set aside because of Harry Potter. The Potter era is here and what a fun world it is. Let your children read Harry Potter. Sit down and read the book together. It's an absolutely brillant book that is an instant classic and is here for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin ever since he can remember. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, wears his cousin's hand-me-down clothes (which fit him like tents), and spends his leisure time being his cousin's punching bag. But on his eleven birthday, everything changes. Harry finds out that his parents were wizards, and that no one can stop him from entering the Hogwarts School where they were trained. As was the evil wizard who murdered them, and tried to murder the infant Harry - whose lightning-shaped forehead scar still burns whenever there's a supernatural threat afoot.At Hogwarts, Harry tries to balance being as ignorant of his heritage as any \\"Muggle\\" (that's a non-wizard human like the rest of us) with finding himself a ready-made celebrity. Everyone in the wizarding world knows about him, and wonders at him; because no one else has ever survived the dark magic that killed his parents. But being famous can't protect him from friction with jealous classmates, harassment by a professor who hates him on sight, or the consequences of breaking school rules. Which Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione do with alarming frequency, as Harry's curiosity about a mysterious \\"sorcerer's stone\\" turns into an urgent obsession....Classic good vs. evil, \\"hero rises from obscurity to find his destiny\\" tale, with an equally classic English boarding school setting put to excellent use. It's easy to see why this book captures nearly everyone who reads it, and forces purchase of the rest of the series. After all, we all were Harry Potter once in our own minds - a misunderstood child destined for great things.

I must have missed a line in the review that said it was a childrens book, because when I asked where I could find a copy, I was lead to the childrens section. I even questioned my escort about the location and she said that adults are always asking for this book. I bought the book and haven't been able to put it down! The characters show enough emotion and heart that they are easy to identify with. The story line is great and moves along at a great pace. There never seems to be a dull moment. Being a 27 year old that is reading a book aimed toward 9-12 year olds, I felt a bit foolish. However, it is stories like 'Harry Potter' that keeps older individuals, like myself, young at heart.

Usually I am cynical about books with so much praise, but I just get blown away every time I read and re-read a Harry Potter book. J.K. Rowling writes with pure magic, and her simple and infectious tone makes these books great reads for any ages. Simply amazing. All the characters are likeable, and in this fantasy world, there are many parallels to our world. Once I start reading a Harry Potter book, I can't think of anything else while I am reading it.\\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\\" is book one of this magnificent, internationally-famous series, the book that started it all. By now, I'm sure you all know the plot, a horribly mistreated young boy learns he is a wizard and attends his first year at a school of magic. Every page in this book is a winner; this book is beautifully written. Book one is my favorite of all of them, even though it is hard to pick a favorite, just because it is the book that started this legendary series. The magic in Rowling's writing really shines in this book as young Harry, who had lived his first ten years cooped up in an obnoxious household, encounters adventure after adventure as a young wizard in the wizard world. Every page is a new adventure.If you haven't read these books yet, read them. Don't doubt all the praise on these; they are truly wonderful."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"well i ahve just finished reding Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone. I thought this was a realy good book. A story about a young boy who at the age of 11 finds out he is a wizard and is about to go to a school of wizardry will intrest alot of reader. Not just adults thoug. this book is good for both kids and adults. One character that I was intrested in was profesor Snape. when you begin to read this book you think that he is trying to kill Harry when in fact he is trying to save him. I found out that Harry's father had once saved Snape. so Snape feels obligated to help Harry. Take the incedent at the Quiditch game. They think that he is the one cursing Harrys broom when it realy was Quirell. Althoug,it really wasn't Quirell but Voldemort controling him. Why Voldemort chose him to do his work, i dont know. Also i think that Dumbledore is helping out Harry the most he can. Like when he didn't get him in trouble when he found the mirror of Erised and when he returned his invisibility cloak.Another thing that inrested me wasw the mirror of Erised. I looked closely at the writing that ihad on the top. I understood whut it said becouse it was only writen backwards. It said \\" Is how noy your face but you hearts desire\\" Thats why it shows your deepest desires. so i recomend this book to all people who like to read.

The authors present the information that is needed so that it is easy to digest."},{"Title":"Successful Scientific Writing","review":"Words can hardly express the beauty and cleverness of &quot;Successful Scientific Writing&quot; by Matthews, Bowen and Matthews as a step-by-step guide on how to write scientific reports for publication in English. I am using this book for a course that I teach on scientific writing at the Postgraduate School of Health Sciences at Aarhus University in Denmark, and I find it to be perfect! Before this book was published, there was none that dealt so well and so entertainingly with so many aspects of what it actually takes to prepare a manuscript for publication in a scientific journal. Many young (and old) scientists are good thinkers, but they are often poor writers! Thus, although they may have been able to design and carry out an experiment, they often lack the ability to express what they have done clearly and concisely. This book is for them! The first few chapters provide mainly words of encouragement for getting the writing process underway. There are also remarkable bits of advice, such as the notion of avoiding certan snacks that could derail ones momentum. In my view, the crux of the book appears in chapters 5, 6 and 7 in which extraordinarily lucid and practical instructions and exercises are presented for improving one's ability to write scientifically. There are also tips on how to optimize word-processing so that the manuscript submitted to the editor of a journal is most likely to be accepted for publication. Perhaps some old-timers in Science can do without this book, but they should nevertheless have a copy of it on hand for their students."},{"Title":"Successful Scientific Writing","review":"This is a funny, well-written, thorough, and authoritative book that goes through every step in the process of creating a journal article, including some topics unique to this process, like how to deal with multi-author editing, peer review, and lit searches. Lots of great advice about how to overcome writer's block. Although the book is written with biomedical science in mind, the advice on grammar, style, structure, and process management is useful to all technical writers. No scientist should be without it."},{"Title":"Successful Scientific Writing","review":"Our lab used this book for a study group on effective scientific writing. We are located in Korea, so with the exception of the instructor and I, all participants were not native speakers of English. As a result, this review is from the viewpoint of foreign students. It is based on chapter reviews written by the members of our lab after finishing the book.The book is just what it claims to be, a step-by-step approach to writing a scientific manuscript intended for publication. The first chapter helpfully furnishes a checklist (Table 1.3) for preparing a research paper. The chapter is actually a summary of the rest of the book so a reader already in the process of writing can easily find which chapter they wish to skip to via Table 1.3.In the subsequent chapters, the authors provide good advice accompanied by helpful tables, examples and exercises, although the figure chapter could have used more tips on actually preparing the figures. Examples of poorly prepared and corrected figures would be a useful study aid. One student suggested that the second chapter on computer use was not particularly informative for graduate-level students. Regarding the chapter on grammar (chapter 6), another student pointed out that in some scientific articles, ungrammatical sentences are not corrected in order to effectively deliver the point.The overall use of informal expressions and phrases seemed intended to make the text livelier for English-speaking students, but was confusing for several participants with English as a second language. We would like to suggest that the authors take their own advice and refrain from using slang and jargon. Several of us liked Appendix 2 and thought it was a good read for those unfamiliar with the practice of journal editors.Apparently the authors had intended to attract those who had not already submitted a manuscript to read their book, but Successful Scientific Writing contains many helpful pointers for published scientists and journal editors, as well."},{"Title":"Successful Scientific Writing","review":"This book provides a useful description of the entire process of writing manuscripts, from information acquisition and literature searches to a very lengthy description of the editing process.

Even the wire, lay open binding is user friendly. The text is up to date, well organized and provides guidance on effective use of computers and software in the entire scientific endeavor. Of course the primary strength is in helping the reader through the writing and publication of the scientist's efforts. This concise work would be especially appropriate as a text in scientific writing classes. The exercises provided would be great student assignments. Additionally the exercises are fun and enhance points made in the text. Matthews, et al have given us a guide that is appropriate for advanced writers as well. Virtually every page has gems of wisdom or insights that will enhance the end result of scientific communication. This book may be especially helpful for those that are &quot;stuck&quot; in trying to get started writing or have complete &quot;writers block&quot;.

It does a credible job of explaining Fanuc tape code. It might be the best of its genre of CNC programming books but like most of its kind the only thing contemporary about it is its date of publication. Otherwise, it is a throw back to the late 1970's and early 1980's when CNC could get along with a dearth of explanations and explanations that were hardly rigorous. For example: 1) Mr. Sims brings forward a 50 year definition of Numerical Control that is just as useless today as it was in its time. 2) He doesn't define interpolation; the word does not even appear in the book's appendix. 3) There is no discussion of servo and associated topics like proportional negative feedback control and following error. 4) Mr. Sims keys his explanation of CNC Cartesian systems with reference to \\"Home\\" as if this word has meaning. Words like reference return and machine zero have meanings established by CNC configuration functions but the word \\"Home\\" has meaning only in context. Operators will call \\"Home\\" a variety of machine positions such as tool change positions and load stations. (Even in the assumed meaning of \\"Home\\" as synonymous with machine reference how would a programmer or operator clarify the \\"Home\\" position on an axis with distance coded scaled?) 5) The book does not dissociate machine reference (a landmark position) from the machine zero position (associated with the machine coordinate system which is the \\"ground\\" system of the coordinate system hierarchy). Even in the early 1980's Fanuc CNC had machine setup parameters to specify the reference return point as a point in the machine coordinate system. 6) The idea of a hierarchy of Cartesian systems (frames) is beyond the books comprehension. 7) You cannot adequately discuss CNC coordinate systems until you define tool length offset (the difference in length between an actual tool and a standard tool typically a zero length standard) and once again, nothing rigorous from this book.I could go on and on about the book's deficiencies - it does not explain CNC in an organized, methodological manner based on established technological sensibilities - but it is no more deficient than the other books of its kind so that in the end, if you need something to augment the Fanuc programming manual, it might work for you. I give it a thumbs up but not a lot of stars."},{"Title":"CNC Programming Handbook","review":"Peter Smid not only knows his subject backwards, he has the ability to put it into a form which is easily understood.

Having said that the author is without a doubt the master of his world when it comes to CNC. Maybe version 4 will see the grammar rectified and smoother reading as a result.

The book reads like it was written twenty years ago, and it essentially ignores all the amazing progress of the last several decades of CAD/CAM software evolution. Of the 500+ pages of content, only the last 16 are devoted to the use of graphical systems to design and produce three-dimensional objects. The author introduces this final chapter by assuring the reader that the reading the book up to this point \\"has not been a waste of time\\" -- which strikes me as a pretty revealing comment -- then goes on to explain what a mouse is and how it can speed things up as compared to using a keyboard. This is clearly a highly regarded text in the CNC field, but I would recommend it only for those who will use these machines extensively and need to go deep into the details of how high-level designs are translated into low-level machine controls and tool paths. If this is what you need to know, this is the book for you.

In her previous mystery, Final Copy, it was the giddy alliance of venture capital and designer cocaine. In A Confidential Source, it's the low-rent neighbors of scratch tickets and casino gambling. For the protagonist, Hallie Ahern, has lost her impressive position as a Boston investigative reporter, and relocated to low-end employment and low-rent addiction in Providence, RI.Brogan is always honest about the problem of economic temptation (an early work included an elegant Ponzi scheme, imaginary yachts, and the gullible folks of a sea-side town.) and isn't too delicate to give us a character on the margin financially, professionally and emotionally. Yet she treats her hapless protagonist with compassion and wry humor. Like Colombo, there is much more to Hallie than meets the eye. Beneath the vague dishevelment and the thrice-worn-this-week apparel is a tenacious and intrepid investigative journalist. The reader is drawn easily into her world without resistance and is carried along through a well-paced story to a satisfying conclusion The book buzzes with likely characters, not the least of which is the city itself drawn with an eye for local folk and foible."},{"Title":"A Confidential Source","review":"She had an affair having an affair with an alleged murderer that she was profiling for the Boston Ledger. When she learns he was using her, reporter Hallie Ahern quits and relocates to Rhode Island where she takes a journalist position at a satellite bureau of the providence Morning-Chronicle. She fears working on any major story until the night she is in the back of the near deserted Mazurksy's market when someone shoots Barry the manager.Hallie writes the article and Leonard of Late Night radio offers her vital information for her story. Leonard tells Hallie that Barry had a gambling addiction that forced him to sell his stores, but though broke still played; he believes the mob sanctioned a hit. However Hallie notices how rabidly anti-gambling Leonard is as he challenges the mayor every chance he gets on the issue as His Honor wants to legalize the \\"vice\\" in Rhode Island. He offers her more information on political corruption at the highest state levels, but someone who has killed twice to keep the story out of the media will add Hallie to the list of the dead if she fails to drop her investigation.Fans who read A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE will understand why many people oppose legalized gambling; Jan Brogan shows how the lure can cause a person to lose everything yet the addiction keeps them playing. Hallie learns this first hand when she begins playing at a casino and quickly is unable to pay her bills. Though one sided on the issue by ignoring the multi billion dollar illegal gambling industry, this novel is a well thought out thriller that is full of misdirection especially a believable unexpected u-turn that will surprise an elated audience."},{"Title":"A Confidential Source","review":"Although I love mysteries and thrillers, I only read a few each year.

Here's why:1) The main character, Hallie Ahern is deliciously flawed. She is just smart and gutsy enough to unravel the mystery, even with all her personal shortcomings.2) Leonard of Latenight is the overnight radio talkshow host with an agenda to bring down the local government in a corruption scandal. He's a composit of the guy who fills these shoes on the AM dial in just about every town.

Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"A Confidential Source","review":"For reporter Hallie Ahern the road to redemption has taken her to Rhode Island and the Providence Morning Chronicle. She works out of a county bureau office in South Kingston and spends her days covering school board meetings, retyping press release and police reports, and other lightweight but needed articles. She still dreams of the big story but the big story blew up in her face once before and she constantly worries it could happen again.Dreams are what got her into trouble in the first place. Dreams that caused insomnia so severe that she became addicted to sleeping pills. And addiction she still fights and is very careful not to give into again. That battle quickly becomes harder when the owner of The Mazursky Market, Barry Mazursky, is gunned down while she is in the small convenience store. While she did not see the shooter put the bullet into Mazurky's brain, she knows exactly who did it. Moments before a large man in a parka had cursed her when she saw his face and there is no doubt he killed Mazursky.While she cared deeply about Mazursky and felt him to be a friend as she wrote in the paper for a lead story, the facts are that she really knew very little about him. After praising him extensively in print, it slowly becomes clear that Mazursky hid dark secrets. Assigned to continue to work the case by the editorial staff of the paper, she begins to discover pieces of information while asking why the police are stonewalling the case. Links to political corruption and a coming referendum of gambling appear and it seems many of the characters are using Hallie for their own ends. As she investigates, Hallie figures out this wasn't a simple robbery gone wrong, but a public execution designed to send a statement to certain individuals. She realizes this could her chance to break back into the big leagues and claim total redemption for her past sins. That is, if she doesn't miss the warning signs and get herself killed.Rich in detail and with somewhat stock characters, this novel works forward very slowly as Hallie pulls the pieces together. As in many cozy style novels, the pace is slow and the mystery is an ongoing theme but often not primary. Such is the case here, as Hallie deals with possible romantic entanglements with a handsome District Attorney among others, her own addictive personality, relationship issues, both professional and personal, and her ongoing debate with herself over her own past failures and triumphs. Hallie is a complex persona who seems to shift back and forth, waffling between the responsibilities of adulthood and a wishing for simpler things. With the focus so scattered across so many themes, the first two hundred pages of this novel read like an elaborate setup piece.But the final seventy-five to one hundred pages make the wait worth it as the novel begins to go. As the pressures rapidly mount, Hallie spends less wasted time with doubt and self-recriminations and becomes real to the reader as she reacts to the considerable forces allied against her.Those familiar with the background political history at the state and local level in Rhode Island will appreciate this novel more than others. No doubt heavily based on real life people at high levels of State and local government, this cozy encourages speculation as to who the fictional characters are based on. That fact as well as the rich details in setting work well and make this novel come alive for the reader.All in all, this is an enjoyable read that follows her first novel, \\"Final Copy.\\" This novel is not a sequel and easily works well as a stand-alone or as a possible series start. That of course, is up to the author, but I hope that she will bring back Hallie for another adventure soon.Kevin R. Tipple 2005"},{"Title":"A Confidential Source","review":"Unlike any mystery I've ever read, Jan Brogan's novel captures the pressure and anxiety of being a newspaper reporter on a big story -- pressure from sources, skepticism from editors, and the worry that you'll publish hundreds of thousands of copies of an error. I should know: I was a reporter for 10 years, most recently at a 350,000-circulation daily. Brogan's plot is smart and well imagined and completely believable.Brogan's hero, reporter Hallie Ahern, is the perfect depiction of a certain type of person drawn to the news business. Her life is empty except for her job, making her success or failure at work synonymous with happiness or misery. Brogan's wonderful writing lets you feel Hallie's desperation, puts you inside her head as she rationalizes her way into destructive decisions and takes terrible gambles. The whole time you're screaming for Hallie to make the right choice, yet you have the sinking feeling she won't. Still, you're rooting for Hallie to succeed because you know her ambition is a frantic attempt to repair serious emotional damage.I really have to disagree with the Booklist review above -- clues don't fall into Ahern's lap at random. She uses her persistence, leverage and moral appeals to persuade people to help her get the story. Like in the real world, much of the information provided to reporters is given to serve the provider's agenda, something Brogan explains in the narrative.I blew through this book in two days and am adding Brogan's first novel, Final Copy, to my TBR pile. I can think of more than a couple of bestselling authors who should yield their spots on the bestseller racks to well-written mysteries like this one.

Take for example, the scene at the hospital where protagonist/reporter, Hallie Ahern tries to wait out the security guard outside the hospital room of a wounded murder suspect. Or the touching sequence where Hallie tries to interview the family of the man who's murder she witnessed.This plot could've worked in any setting.

I found it a very pleasant and enjoyable book, definitely 5 star in my book, but not electrifying by any means.The flawed heroine is what carries this book and the one other Hallie Ahern book I've read and what compels me to read the other two. She is so very human and easy even for a guy to identify with.This book like TEASER, the other book in the series I've read so far, touches on real issues, gambling and lottery addiction in this case. However, the approach is cautionary, not preachy or starkly dark. It's ideal for summer or bedtime reading.

Now, she is starting over in Rhode Island, but the work is boring, until she witnesses a shooting that is more than it seems. Hallie might have uncovered a story of gambling, corruption, and secrets that can make or ruin her career, if she lives to tell the tale.Though Hallie is the headliner of this novel, it is the supporting characters, particularly Leonard, the late-night talk radio D.J. who capture your interest. Fans of a complex thriller with virtually no romance will find this a fascinating read. The author courageously tackles what can be a highly divisive issue and wraps it in a riveting mystery.Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"A Confidential Source","review":"Hallie Ahern is a former big city (Boston) newspaper reporter, newly arrived in Providence, Rhode Island. Her last big story in Boston was a career-booster, but her actions were unprofessional. She got romantically involved with her subject, who was later sent to prison. So Hallie is starting over with more humility and fewer pretensions, including a flirtation with a substance-abuse program. However, she is currently nursing a nighttime addiction to the local shock jock, Late Night Leonard, who hints of illegal machinations behind an upcoming election on casino gambling and suspicious lottery interests.A visit to the neighborhood market leads to another complication when the storekeeper is shot in the head and Hallie is a potential witness. Her first instinct is to write the story, even at the risk of incriminating herself. Besides, there is a promotion being offered at The Chronicle, an opportunity to escape from the satellite bureau where she now labors. Putting on her investigative journalism cap, using Leonard as a confidential source, Hallie sets out to uncover the graft and resuscitate her career. The intrepid reporter will have some close calls with unsavory sorts, do background \\"research\\" at local casinos, look into legalized gambling, crooked politicians, avid gamblers and witness a murder. When Hallie uncovers too much information, she becomes a target for the killers.For this reader, this is the little mystery that couldn't, although it tries really, really hard. But the author fails to deliver too often, not the least of which is the protagonist. Hallie can't decide if she is a grownup or a professional victim, vacillating between responsible reporting and compulsive behavior, a gambling jones that threatens her financial security and a 12-step program she blithely disdains. The characters are colorful, if predictable, the mystery ho-hum, the usual good guys (an attractive DA), bad guys and oversized thugs, Hallie running for her life at the end. This character has a lot more 12-step work to do before she takes on the world again.

Few in the Mid-East or the international arena now give credence to the evaluation that the &#65533;peace process' is still functional.This book is of considerable value in that it examines how the so-called &#65533;peace process' actually died. This is not a &#65533;play on words' but an actual investigation into what went wrong and why.The basic premise for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian/Arab world was allegedly &#65533;land for peace'. This book scrutinizes how this principle was actually just a facade. The most far reaching concessions ever offered by any Israeli leader only resulting in the Palestinian &#65533;intifadas' that are analysed here and which &#65533;grace' our television screens almost on a daily basis.The book scrutinises the previously unheard of offers by former Israeli PM Ehud Barak in relation to ceding some 98% of the &#65533;West Bank' and Gaza towards a Palestinian state, a deal on &#65533;settlements' and &#65533;refugees' plus an agreement to &#65533;share' Jerusalem. Investigated too are the failure of Yasser Arafat & the Palestinian Authority to accept this as even a basis for negotiation, their violation of previous agreements and the reneging of their promise to resolve all disagreements through negotiations.The authors themselves show that even despite agreed Israeli withdrawals peace was not forthcoming, the PLO not even amending it's Covenant calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.The book outlines a statement through Jordanian Television by Yasser Arafat on the very same day as he appeared in 1993 on the White House lawn with Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Bill Clinton and co., shaking hands and making his promises of peace.The book (on page 22) declares that Arafat, in his public statement in Arabic on Jordan Television, stated that he had no intent to halt terrorism, or any peaceful co-existence with Israel. Instead he described the agreement, in fact the whole &#65533;peace-process', was in the context of the &#65533;1974 plan', known by the whole Arab world as the &#65533;plan of phases' for the destruction of Israel.Perhaps this should have opened everyone's eyes to the real intent and agenda behind the scenes, but clearly not so.This book provides a number of essays by very learned people including Efraim Karsh, David Bar-Ilan, Dore Gold, Daniel Pipes and others, that investigate how Arafat duped the whole world into believing that he was pursuant of a peaceful co-existence with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.This book also explores the regional & international consequences of the failure of the Mid-East &#65533;peace-process' in light of September 11th. This becomes even more relevant in few of recent developments appertaining to Iraq. Also explored and discussed are the future, potential conventional and nuclear conflicts between Israel and the Arab world, also weighed against the possible existence of a Palestinian &#65533;state' in Israel's very heartland.A very illuminating, thought-provoking read and a handy reference book for the days ahead which we must all watch with interest."},{"Title":"The Mideast Peace Process: An Autopsy","review":"In 1993, millions of people enthusiastically supported the Oslo peace accords. I was one of them. From the Jewish and Israeli perspectives, it was incredible and exhilarating to see the leader of Arab terrorists plan to recognize Israel's right to exist. The joyous prospect of an end to war, a lasting peace, allowed us to imagine a thrilling repeat of Anwar Sadat's triumphant visit to Jerusalem, to suspend our disbelief. Sadat had been murdered for his daring; he was not the first Arab leader killed for his pacifism and would likely not be the last. But we squelched all doubts.Now, all doors seemed open. At a heady November 1994 Jerusalem business conference, Tansu Cillar became the first Turkish Prime Minister to visit Israel. Arab, Jewish and Israeli businessmen and politicians applauded wildly, crying in joyful expectation, as she spoke of the peace dividend about to engulf the Fertile Crescent.Even in 1993 and 1994, skeptics warned that the perceived peace was, from the Arab side, a sham. Virtually no one in power--in Israel, the U.S., or Europe--listened to these professors, politicians and Middle East scholars who had spent their lives studying the region. But in Commentary magazine, they wrote their opinions, backed up by substantial and alarming data.The 11 articles in this powerfully persuasive book were culled from essays that appeared between September 1993 and May 2001 and are framed by Neal Kozodoy's forward and Mark Helprin's afterward. The first, by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu communications minister David Bar-Illan, marked the \\"historic handshake\\" of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn. It questioned why, given many disturbing facts, the Rabin government would throw caution to the winds.Washington, he noted, had promised Arafat \\"the return of territories according to resolutions 242 and 338,\\" which Arabs took to mean total withdrawal. Meanwhile, Washington had falsely assured Israel it would \\"give weight\\" to the latter's security concerns, that negotiations would be based on the 1978 formula from Camp David. While there could be an interim five-year period of Palestinian authority, with final status negotiations starting only in the third year, Washington assured Israel that every possibility would remain open. Given the incompatibility of these promises, Bar-Illan believed that hopes to achieve real peace were most likely mere chimera.The last essay, by noted Middle East historian Efraim Karsh, discussed all the reasons that the Arab claim to a right of return is fictitious. It closed with comments of the late (supposedly \\"moderate\\") Faisal Husseini, who had in his final speech exposed his radical aim. \\"[We] may win or lose,\\" Husseini said in March 2001. \\"But our eyes will continue to aspire to the strategic goal, namely to Palestine from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] sea.\\" In short, he desired Palestine to take Israel's place. Karsh noted that until Husseini's \\" 'supreme truth' is buried once and for all, no amount of Israeli good will, partial compensation, or symbolic acceptance of responsibility can hope to create anything but an appetite for more.\\"The nine essays in between each provided an alarming set of facts surrounding the peace accords as they occurred. Yigal Carmon, a former Israeli intelligence colonel and counter-terrorism adviser to Rabin, wrote in March 1994 that a path to dialogue with Yasser Arafat in 1988 was suspended in May 1990 after Arafat refused to condemn a PLO terrorist attack on a beach near Tel Aviv or disassociate from its commander, Abu Abbas. Norwegian social scientist Terje Larson in early 1992 nevertheless sought out Israeli Economic Cooperation Foundation chief Yossi Beilin, who a short time later became a deputy to Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres. Until December 1992, at least, Beilin negotiated without Prime Minister Rabin's knowledge. When Rabin finally did learn, he proceeded anyway, comforted falsely by Arafat's promise to declare an end to \\"armed struggle\\" and the intifada. But when the Declaration of Principles was signed in September 1993, Arafat failed to keep his promise.Similarly, Douglas Feith wrote in June 1994 that Israel would be trading land for \\"no peace.\\" For everything that Arafat had promised in the DOP he had promised in 1988, to gain a dialogue with the U.S. government, and every promise he had made in 1988, he broke. By now it was clear that the PLO had not and would not change its covenant to recognize Israel's most basic right--to exist. In fact, the very day Arafat signed the DOP, Jordanian television aired a speech in which Arafat called for intensified jihad, struggle and \\"sacrifices.\\" Neither did the PLO leader delay his demands for sovereignty, as promised. Worse, Arab violence against Israel had actually increased. The DOP was supposedly conditional on Arafat's containing the violence. When the Arab violence continued, Feith cast the problem not as Israel's flexibility or intransigence, but \\"whether [Israel's] neighbors have the political leadership and the good will to sustain peace with a Jewish state on what, according to their religious and cultural convictions, is their land, Arab land--that is, anywhere in Palestine.\\"This idea was reiterated eloquently by Norman Podhoretz in a December 2000 essay, \\"Death of an Illusion?\\" He referred to T.S. Eliot's lines, \\"human kind/Cannot bear very much reality.\\" Here, he wrote, the \\"unbearable reality being evaded is that Israel's yearning for peace was shared neither by the Arab world in general nor by the Palestinians in particular--that their objection was not to anything Israel had done or failed to do, but to the very fact that it existed at all.\\"That sums up the Oslo Accords. Rather than the promised peace, they brought death and destruction. Since August 1993, more than 575 Israelis have been murdered by Arab terrorists, thousands maimed for life. The victims were not fighting, not at war. They were going about their daily lives, praying for the final peace that Israelis have sought since the state's 1948 establishment.This book will help you understand. Alyssa A.

Certainly there is a bias against the Palestinian side, but that bias never goes so far as to be untruthful and serves as a much needed counterpoint to the ways in which the Mideast conflict is covered by most news agencies.

And that Arafat and his negotiators would be in favor of peace, justice, truth, and good behavior by both sides, in keeping with what was expected by society at large.That is not what Commentary thought. Its articles tended to imply that Arafat and his gang were thugs who wanted to incite and sacrifice Arabs to benefit only themselves at best. To Commentary, the goals of Arafat's side were to destroy Israel, reduce or obliterate human rights for Jews, and rewrite and fabricate Arab and Jewish history. And Arafat's main demand seemed to be for the enshrinement of his right to perform all these misdeeds with worldwide blessing, approval, and applause.Roughly speaking, Commentary's articles indicated that the dubiously named Peace Process would fail because neither side's goals would be met. In addition, they showed that any concession demanded of Israel by the Arabs, if granted, was almost invariably designed to reduce the prospects for peace. Meanwhile, it appeared that the international community was prepared to allow the Arab side to break its promises, and apply serious pressure only on Israel. In addition, Arab incitement against Israel was unlikely to lessen, and international propagation of Arab propaganda was expected to increase.Sure enough, Oslo failed. And we can and should read the articles from Commentary that compose this book. I think the best of them is the one by Fiamma Nirenstein. However, let's face it: Commentary was basically claiming the Earth was round when it was politically correct to say that it was flat. That took some courage, maybe plenty of courage, but not much brilliance. At least, let's give Commentary credit for taking a moral and honest stand on this issue."},{"Title":"The Mideast Peace Process: An Autopsy","review":"I like this book, and I'm in favor of Israel in this conflict.

The book is relatively short at 146 pages.The metrics covered in the text are number of scenario scripts, number of key classes, number of support classes, average number of support classes per key class, number of subsystems, average person-days per class, average number of classes per developer, number of major iterations, number of contracts completed, number of message sends, number of statements, lines of code, average method size, method complexity, number of public instance methods in a class, number of instance methods in a class, average number of instance methods per class, number of instance variables in a class, average number of instance variables per class, number of class methods in a class, number of class variables in a class, class hierarchy nesting level, number of abstract classes, use of multiple inheritance, number of methods overridden by a subclass, number of methods inherited by a subclass, number of methods added by a subclass, class cohesion, global usage, average number of parameters per method, use of friend functions, percentage function-oriented code, average number of comment lines per method, average number of commented methods, number of problem reports per class or contract, class coupling, number of times a class is reused, and number of classes/methods thrown away."},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"I have a couple of myke's books (PIC, 8051) and this one is quite a departure from the normal run of the mill &quot;microcontroller&quot; books that he does. The book is devoted to explaining digital logic and he does a really good job and approaches it from a direction that I've never seen before.For example, I've never seen anybody actually &lt;i&gt;build&lt;/i&gt; a TTL gate out of discrete transistors and resistors before. This was really helpful for me - I've never really understood how the built in pull ups in a TTL gate worked before I read this book.Myke has really latched onto the idea of including PCBs in his books and the power supply/TTL interface is really helpful to get the reader started in working with TTL. What I have always liked about Mykes books is that he really tries to provide circuits that the reader can build easily. With the power supply/interface PCBs included in the book, creating the experiments just takes a few moments. This is really nice.JD"},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"I think the idea behind this book is fantastic and if there wern't so many typos and mistakes in the diagrams and project schematics it would be a 5 star book.The ground and power bus is mislabeld in almost every project. Some of the projects won't run without fixing the bugs in the diagrams.If there is a second edition, hopefully these issues will be resolved."},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"The content of the book is good, and the included PCBs will be useful, but you MUST know enough about electronics to detect and correct the numerous errors in the wiring diagrams, etc.The text is a little disorganized and key points and concepts are not as clear as they could be, but the information is good. This is NOT a book for complete beginners. If you're new to electronics, try a NerdKit instead."},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"This is an excellent book for neophytes like me. Unfortunately, it is marred by a surprisingly large number of typos, like many of Mr. Predko's books.Part of this is because he reuses large blocks of text in his many publications w/o really matching up figures with text, etc. He doesn't always match numbers on his printed circuit boards with the text. Perhaps these errors sneak in between editions. Most of these are so obvious there is no problem making out what he meant. Still, I worry that there are typos which I don't recognize.The printed circuit boards are excellent with plated through holes. Even an inexperienced solderer like me can do a neat job easily and quickly."},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"O.K., the idea behind this book is very good, but it is unrealised idea. I agree with a reader below who said this book is an error galore (I am not reffering to grammar errors but more importantly technical errors). Imageine if we tried to build space shuttle with the same number of errors as in this book (or any other Predko's book). Would it lift off? Yeah right! I was unable to make anything work from his books and I own 2 books. It is so confusing and not worth the money. If you are able to make sence of drunk man talking then go ahead and buy his books, otherwise stay away."},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"I just put in a review for &quot;Programming and Customizing PICMicro MCUs&quot; and I realized that I should also put in a few words about this book - Mr. Predko has really come up with an outstanding book for working with basic digital electronics (TTL).I graduated from university over ten years ago and while I understood the theory behind TTL, I feel like my understanding of how it works by this book. It really ties together theory with practice adn even shows you hot to create a TTL inverter from transistors!"},{"Title":"Digital Electronics Guidebook: With Projects!","review":"This book is fantastic. The two included PCBs were a joy to build and are very helpful when doing lab experiments. This book would appeal to an absolute electronics beginner as well as an expert.

Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Stevens Pass: The Story of Railroading and Recreation in the North Cascades","review":"Stevens Pass has always had an aura of mystery about it. Even while Seattle boomed during the great gold rush of the 1800's, there remained no way to cross the formidable North Cascades. Inspired by the Orient trade, railroaders spent years looking for a suitable route over the mountain until surveyor John F. Stevens discovered a pass in 1890.The Great northern Railroad lent romance to the crossing of Stevens Pass. But its real saga consisted of the nearly superhuman feats of construction crews, ghastly design mistakes, unpredictable acts of nature, and the determination of magnates, despite countless unforeseen obstacles, to connect communities by rail.The other half of the saga consists of individuals who traversed the mountains, built crude homes, and schooled their children at home or in drafty log schoolhouses with few books. Nefarious pioneers took advantage of the isolation to work scams, fight, steal, and even murder.More than a regional history, this story tells of the Wellington disaster, a killer avalanche; the period when ski jumping events grew crowds of thousands; the growing efforts of the United States Forest Service to serve recreational seekers; and the scoundrels and heroes of the new frontier.I enjoyed this book immensely, and learned a lot about an area in history that at one time was sitting in my own backyard, so to speak."},{"Title":"Stevens Pass: The Story of Railroading and Recreation in the North Cascades","review":"this work is EXCELLENT! It outlines & refers to some of the significant items from Stevens Pass history. I worked on the GNRy during my college years, and i've somewhat kept up with events; I salute this book for accuracy & detail!I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of long-abandoned minor stops along the GN,(more modern place photos would have been welcome additions), but I was a bit worried about the details given to the (number of BROTHELS, for example....!Perhaps a bit more information regarding James Hill & his Zeal for the PNW / western RR expansion would have been appropriate, but can be easily found elsewhere. the Maps I found to be Very Helpful, but both large & small-scale maps showing the stations (current & former locations) would have been helpful.edited to add: One 'GLARING' mistake Ms. Roe makes is (repeatedly) referring to the GN as 'Railroad'; the GN always styled itself as the 'Great Northern RAILWAY', a distinction - difference that most 'true fans' would easily recognize (and, was quoted Correctly in a GNRy press release found in the book!)"},{"Title":"Stevens Pass: The Story of Railroading and Recreation in the North Cascades","review":"Growing up in the Northwest and hiking in this region I have an appreciate for the authors over view of the history of Stevens Pass.

A must for followers of the pagan path. But a good practice for those who aren't pagan, follow this to relax. I loved it...i could understand every word...no metaphysical jargon to confuse me. I am a pagan and follow deep workings but this was a fundamental work. I would recommmend it to anyone of all skills. You don't have to be pagan to love this book. Try it...enjoy."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to the bookshelf of anyone interested in paganism, witchcraft, or meditation. The author leads you through a series of meditation based upon the Wheel of the Year. The meditations are well designed and certainly will help one connect with the seasonal cycles. I recommend this title!"},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"This book is a series of guided meditations. Each of them is based on one of the main pagan Sabbats, but may be easily understood by anyone who has a basic interest in the Earth best known festivities. The meditations are thoroughly thought out, and the book includes suggestions in enhancing the experience by celebration.Also, there are a few meditations centered on Deities and there's one for each four of the elements. The only flaw I see in this book, as in most pagan oriented books, is it's heavy anglosaxon feel (but then again I suppose you can't please everyone). Also, it is such a pity that there wasn't an accompanying CD going with the book. This has been partially corrected in Yasmine Galenorn's new book &quot;Tarot journeys&quot;. But those are minor problems, and the book is still a very good addition to any pagan library."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"If you have any interest in guided meditations, this book is a must-have! With about 20 long, creative, beautiful meditations and many informative passages as well, it's perfect for Pagans or any open-minded folk. Although a few meditations are not entirely appropriate for children (the Beltane meditation has graphic sexual content), many can be adapted for family and/or coven use. This author is one to keep your eye on!"},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"If you're having trouble meditating or visualizing, pursuing a work like this is a good step in the right direction. It offers wonderful guided visualizations on the four elements and solid advice about meditation and visualization in general. The major shortcoming of this book is that it is not accompanied by a CD. Since you certainly cannot perform a guided visualization while reading it, you are forced to narrate to tape recorder and then play the tape back for yourself. One problem that can be encountered is timing. The first time I did this, I went entirely too fast, so I had to learn the art of narrating a visualization for self-use. And if you do this recording yourself, you've essentially already read the visualization, so it spoils the element of surprise such that actually going through the visualization is not doing so for the first time. The ideal situation for using these visualizations is to get a friend to record them for you and for you to then just go through them, but for many this is impractical. I'm sure you see the dilemma.In any case, it's a good work, and I recommend buying it if money and patience permit. But if you are looking for a ready to use guided visualizations, I recommend some kind of tape or audiobook."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"This work, the first of Galenorn's, is a wonderful journey through the season's and the elements. Each meditation is a lesson, an unfolding story that absorbs you in every trance. The Sabbat meditations strike an especially deep chord. Trancing the Witch's Wheel is essetial. It is especially useful to those oppressed solitaries who, living with families who wouldn't understand, can neither afford fiancially or emotinally to drag out a million different tools every time a High holiday rolls around."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"This is a useful book in many different ways. It contains nicely written guided meditations for the elements, some dieties, and for each of the sabbats. The meditations are filled with sensory stimulous and if read slowly and with feeling by some helpful volunteer will transport you to places that will help in your growth and understanding as a pagan. I have used several of them with my coven and we have enjoyed them thoroughly. Sometimes I have found them a bit too wordy, sometimes they're just not my style and I don't want to use them for guided meditations, BUT they are always very innovative and they help me out when I'm preparing to write ritual because they do have such an abundance of super ideas and accurately depict so many important pagan concepts. Our coven has many new witches and so I work doubly hard to make the rituals instructional and this book has been a huge help several times by priming the creative pump, so to speak, and getting my own magickal processes flowing."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"Yasmine Galenorn has done a great service for the Neo-Pagan community with this book. It's too bad it's out of print.In _Trancing the Witch's Wheel_, Galenorn presents a set of guided meditations to connect with the four elements and several deities, and to celebrate the Wheel of the Year. The Wheel meditations take up the bulk of the book, and are beautiful and inspiring. A Witch in the broom closet can perform many of these rituals completely without props or tools. A Witch who prefers trance work to &quot;standing at the altar chanting&quot; sorts of rituals will find meaningful practices for the Sabbats here. And, one can easily adapt the meditations to one's own practice. For example, you can rewrite the Beltane meditation to honor the Goddess and God of your pantheon, if Aphrodite and Pan don't suit you. Her meditations can be a jumping-off point for lots of meaningful trance work. At the end of each meditation, Galenorn suggests further activities, both magical and mundane, to help you further experience the energies you are invoking._Trancing_ is the only book of its kind that I know of, and is a solid addition to any Witch's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Trancing the Witch's Wheel: A Guide to Magickal Meditation","review":"If you're having trouble meditating or visualizing, pursuing a work like this is a good step in the right direction.

I feel that this willingness to go againsed the social norm by producing such a controversial, yet masterful piece of work without restraints or care for what people think make it a one of a kind play. It is raw human emotion at it's best and is full of non stop suprises. The plot is eerie, and leaves you with an appetite for more. Good work Brad!"},{"Title":"The Ugly Man (Prairie Play, No. 13)","review":"I began reading Fraser's work for a drama independent study I was dreading to do.

Zupan carefully explains the key concepts behind single and multilayer networks to an audience that he knows will not be familiar with most of the ideas. The level of maths is not trivial, but should be understandable to any chemist who has ploughed through several courses on quantum theory.The book applies the networks to designing drugs. Given the inherent black box nature of the nonlinear feedbacks during the training steps, the book's detailed explanations should be reassuring to those using networks for the first time."},{"Title":"Woodcarving Tools, Materials & Equipment","review":"Chris is an English carver with a vast knowledge of tools and carving history.

He also tells you how to modify existing tools--reshaping, grinding, and bending. He included a very good explanation on how to anneal, harden, and temper your own carving tools.I first opened this book, early one evening, intending to read for an hour or so; I finally set it down at 2:00am.

It updates and adds new material by providing a thorough review of the literature on adaptation to new cultures and the return home and draws the most critical issues out of that material. The book goes from the impirical to the practical-not only what culture shock is all about but how to cope with the learning/adjusting process. I use it for training trainers who will work with people moving to unfamiliar cultures and recommend it to anyone who is studying intercultural communication. All three authors are known experts in the field and have collaborated to integrate their knowledge of the processes that are involved in adaptation, how to deal with those challenges, how to select and prepare people to move into new cultures, and how to bring them back. They also look at the research that has been conducted on specific groups such as international students, business personnel, refugees and others. This makes it possible to explore the unique issues that apply to each group. This is an essential reference for intercultural professionals and students in many fields."},{"Title":"Airport Builders","review":"This book is a refreshing change to the typical airport-architecture text. The days of airports being uninspiring transport interchanges are numbered, with this book demonstrating full-page glossy photos of 40 or more of the world's most recent developments including Chek Lap Kok and Kansai. Good photography and clearly written, it was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Airport Builders","review":"As the architecture correspondent for The Times (London), author Marcus Binney travels the world in search of new directions in design and important building achievements. &quot;Airport Builders&quot; stands as a fine compilation of the most impressive airport-related projects to come out of architects' shops in the 1990's.The beginning section of the book presents a discussion of the primary considerations in airport design today (number of floors, terminals and satellites; carparking, landscaping, etc.) which is thankfully neither ponderous nor overly casual. Following are overviews of 46 airport and terminal projects, with interesting and easy-to-understand descriptions of the problems overcome in each design process, structural considerations and noteworthy aesthetic features for each airport.This is a book written for architects by an architect, as evidenced by the wealth of plans, elevations, model views, artist renderings and computer-generated perspectives. Each airport/terminal project takes up between two and ten pages (Denver International gets the most), including text, photos and illustrations. The most superb photographs are the large color ones which show innovative roof and ceiling concepts, exterior perspectives, and exquisite interior spaces formed by glass and structural elements.Aside from being enjoyable to read, the book is well-constructed and printed on quality paper."},{"Title":"Airport Builders","review":"I was looking for a decent airport architecture publication, and I found Airport Builders to be an informative and beautiful book.

Some of the airports included are Denver International, Chek Lap Kok, Kansai International, Charles De Gaulle, and London Stansted, among many others. Almost all of the projects higlighted include technical schematics and renderings. Large color photos are also abundant. Anyone with an interest in commercial aviation or airport architecure should definitely give this a look."},{"Title":"Airport Builders","review":"As a serious airport architecture enthusiast, this book is about as good as you'll find.

I don't understand hedge funds and banking that well, so reading this book took a lot out of me. I was thinking so hard trying to understand what it all meant, how it all tied into the plot, that I missed out on the rest of the story. I finished this book feeling incomplete. I wasn't sure if I figured out who the real bad guy was, who the spies were, etc. I also got lost in trying to figure out how Jackie investigating Hayek and the banking stuff tied in with the congressman and his wife and this so called smear campaign. Overall, I rate this book with 3 stars. I liked the descriptions, but I couldn't fully grasp this story. If you understand hedge funds, politics, and banking then you could probably read it and enjoy it. But this book was not my favorite!"},{"Title":"Drummer in the Dark (Marcus Glenwood Series #2)","review":"T. Davis Bunn keeps getting better. Wow! I thought he'd found his niche with &quot;The Great Divide&quot; (his legal thriller), but this book of political and financial intrigue raises the standard even higher. I'm not a big stocks and funds enthusiast, but Bunn manages to create a suspenseful and well-researched plot that hooked me early on. He works in a credible idea of dealing with Third World debt that I particularly found interesting. Beyond his obvious knowledge of the subject, Bunn creates believable characters and writes with a narrative flair that I personally love. His story is complex and maybe too intertwined for some to delve into, but I couldn't get enough.As the title of this review suggests, I did lose sleep finishing this book. But the title is stolen from Bunn's own writing. &quot;Jackie's eyelids felt coated with shards from the hourglass of lost sleep.&quot; It's writing such as this, passionate and imaginative, that make the political and financial arena come alive. Jackie and Wynn, the two protaganists, are complex characters whom I came to care for. Although the spiritual lessons are muted and few, Bunn works in heartfelt and very real spiritual thoughts without seeming preachy.With a recent batch of superlative novels by Christian authors(&quot;When Heaven Weeps&quot; by Ted Dekker and &quot;The List&quot; by Robert Whitlow, to name a few), I must include &quot;Drummer in the Dark&quot; as one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Drummer in the Dark (Marcus Glenwood Series #2)","review":"Successful businessman Wynn Bryant is approached by his brother-in-law, the governor of Florida, to take over the position of congressman Hutchings, who has recently suffered a stroke. Wynn refuses, but quickly learns he has no choice, and the reason becomes clear...Legislation has recently put together the Jubilee Amendment which is to relieve Third World countries of their debt, and the governor was this squashed, no matter what the cost.Jackie Havilland is working for a small detective agency when she is approached with a mysterious and unusual request...Esther Hutchings wants Jackie to find out who is behind the smear campaign of her husband, and make sure the Jubilee Amendment is passed.As Jackie and Wynn become deeper involved in their assignments they realize there is a far reaching conspiracy, one that involves a secret project called Tsunami. Tsunami is the biggest currency scam in history, one that congressman Hutchings was investigating before his stroke. Before long Jackie and Wynn are faced with a deadly race against time with powerful forces. Forces that will kill anyone that gets in the way of their plan to reshape world economy.\`Drummer In The Dark' is a great follow-up to the best-selling \`The Great Divide.' T. Davis Bunn has switched gears, and instead of giving us another legal thriller, he has given a fast-paced political thriller laced with intrigue. The plot, while complex, is well written, and easy to follow, with plot twists at every turn, and enough shocks to keep you turning the pages.T.
