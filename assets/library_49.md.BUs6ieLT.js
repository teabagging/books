I had already digested \\"Team Yankee\\" and \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and remember being bored stiff by this one. My memory was that there was a lot of character-building and very little action.I've now re-read the book 26 years on, and like my taste in music, I'm happy to admit I've reconsidered my position. This book is outstanding. Not only is it dramatic and well-written, but it can almost serve as a primer on Cold War-era Soviet operational doctrine. You appreciate how the Soviets wanted this war to GO GO GO. Non-stop advancing. No consolidation on the objective. No set piece battles. Get as deeply into the enemy rear as quickly as possible to deny him the initiative and prevent the establishment of fortified defenses.The book has aged well and even if it now solidly in the \\"historical fiction\\" category, it is still very much worth the read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I'm a huge fan of \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and initially almost gave up on this. There was not much technical detail or background to the war (start of hostilities, theaters, combined services, etc.). However, as I forced myself to continue the story picked up.If you're use to and very anal about Cold War technology, this isn't for you. But the author does put together some great character background and story lines. You really get a feel for the other side.The ending was not what I hoped for, but still very good."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"It ended a bit abruptly but it was a great read and an interesting perspective."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"This book is amazing in that unlike many contemporary writers, Ralph Peters writes from the perspective of Soviet soldiers. Imagine a Tom Clancy/Larry Bond novel, but from the enemy's point of view. Some of the revelations are quite intriguing."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Peters' story about a Soviet push into western Europe was perhaps the best war novel that I have read yet...Peters uses brilliant imagery to describe WW3. What is unique about Red Army is it's perspective - it's all shown from a Soviet point of view, and from every type of Russian military branch. This book is so good it's scary."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I read this book for the first time as a new soldier stationed in Germany with the US Army. Found it to be an outstanding read due to the book looking at World War III from the Soviet's viewpoint. I am a big fan of most of Clancy's work, but I thought this book to be at least as good as, if not better, than Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"This is actually a great book of how a war fought in the 1980's in Europe would happen. The troop movements and weapons are all real. All in all, this is a very serious and realistic scenario for a war being fought in the 1980's."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"The first three quarters of this book seems entirely plausible, but the last part is a bit far fetched. At one point the Russian officers in each AO are complaining about supplies. Firstly, after the initial Soviet thrust they could forget about getting any more supplies. NATO would have pounded their staging areas, denying them eqpt & ammo followed by a counterattack from south to Northeast, cutting them off a la the Demyansk pocket or Stalingrad, writ large. The second reason is we're talking about GERMANS, people with a propensity to fight until the last shell. Although geographically impossible, the story would have been much more believable had the USSR invaded France"},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"There is no longer a Soviet empire which makes the book anachronistic. It lacks credibility because it deals only with mechanic war manuevers. It supplies no political background. The invasion just comes out of the blue - no motivation, no explanation, no &quot;big picture&quot;. Just a mechanical war story. Maybe living a potential war reality in Israel is part of what makes me cynical about this fictional book."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Let me start by saying I am a big Ralph Peters fan. However, Red Army is awkwardly one-sided and unrealistic. Peters' stated goal was to present a Soviet victory in a conventional war in Central Europe, but he went to the extreme in presenting his alternative vision. The following are some of the most glaring problems:1. Air power: Peters presents NATO air power as a nuisance at best and even tries to explain that away by saying that most of NATO's air power was \\"caught on the ground.\\" Japan pulled off a surprise attack on a number of western bases on December 7-8, 1941 (e.g., Pearl Harbor, Philippines, etc.) due in part to the distances involved and lack of effective communications technology. Such an attack today in the age of satellites and other advanced communications technology and intelligence would be impossible even with advanced jamming. Peters wants us to believe that the Soviets pulled off dozens of modern day Pearl Harbor/Philippines-like raids against NATO air forces, which is not believable at all. Also, Peters again presents Soviet hardware as equals of the F-16, F-15, Tornados, etc. of the time. Was there ever a Soviet jet that exceeded or even matched its western counterparts? The answer is no, which makes this failing even more glaring in the book.2. Land power: The M-1A1 was best tank of that time, and newer Abrams are even more dominant, yet Peters ignores their superior range and ability to stand off and destroy targets from a distance. He presents Soviet T-72s as peers of the M-1A1 and that is laughable, even more so considering he was in intelligence. Also, where were the TOWs, A-10s, MLRS, and other anti-tank systems? Virtually no mention was made of these, and the book reads as if NATO didn't expect an armored thrust through Fulda.3. Nuclear weapons: Where were the tactical nukes? No tactical nukes from cruise missiles, bombers or even artillery? The West would have relied at the very least on its considerable tactical nuclear arm in the face of significant Soviet gains.I highly recommend most of Peters' other books, just not this one."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"When I bought this book (thankfully used) I was looking for something like Red Storm Rising (Blue Storm rising?) and Red Army was somewhat of a disappointment in this regard. This book is a very average depiction of the standard \\"Russian Shock Army Devours All Before It\\" that was popular in the '80s. Peters provides us with a more stripped down version of the genre, concentrating more on the individual experiences of the Russians involved rather than the sweeping scope.If Red Army had done that well, it would have succeeded. Unfortuantely Peters' characters are cardboard characterizations of standard Red Army themes. You've got the sensitive guy, you've got the maniacal general, you've got the \\"Russian Hero\\" who loves Russia more than communism. Everybody sees Western prosperity and some of the Russians steal things and rape women.The sad thing is that this book is stuck in the middle. There isn't really enough room for Peters to create characters you can really hang your hat on, and what's crowded out is a real battle strategy. All we see is the Russians advancing into Central Europe with no political subtext. Even Hackett gave us something mildly plausible in \\"Third World War\\".For this reason my response was a very emphatic \\"meh\\" to the resolution of the book."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I can't explain it. I've probably read close to 1,000 books in my life. And I've never found a book as difficult to complete as this one. (And I always finish a book once I've started it.) It's not that I disliked every element of the book. Some of the battle scenes were very well done. But I found the rest of the book to be a real struggle. Maybe I had a hard time rooting for &quot;the other side.&quot; My friend was very disappointed because this is one of his favorite novels. I know that he would give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I read this book when it first came out 12 years ago. I was working as a Battalion Intelligence operator at the time and was comparing doctrine of the forces involved. One main difference is that the Soviets reinforce success, wheras NATO would have to reinforce their weakest part of the line. A touted NATO advantage was their communcations system that would allow it to manouver units more quickly, which may have been a false assumption. Of all the books I've read, this is the best.Warfare is notoriously difficult to model, as small events may have great importance. On the other hand, capabilities of equipment and units are accurately known and not likely to change much in battle. While recognizing the differences in equipment and ways of employing it, Peters realizes that most professional soldiers have common characteristics. Some leaders are daring and intuitive, some are not. Making sure they are employed in the right spot is crucial, and again Peters shows that the Soviet professional development system is much like that of the West.By contrast, Clancy's Red Storm Rising makes it seem as if a handful of men can change the course of history by themselves. Coyle's Team Yankee makes the Americans invulnerable to Soviet attacks. Only Hackett's Third World War comes close to Red Army in what I believe could have happened. That's no surprise given Hackett's experience as NATO's ground commander.Since the Second World War westerners have fostered and been fed the idea of Russians as backward and without initiative. We have concentrated on Patton, Rommel and Montgomery as military geniuses without recognizing Rokossovsky, Koniev and Zhukov and that the Red Army defeated the Nazis and took Berlin. Ralph Peters simply puts human beings in charge of the Red Army."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"There are three major novels on the subject of World War III that I am familiar with -- Gen. Sir John Hackett's \\"The Third World War\\" Tom Clancy's \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and Ralph Peters' \\"Red Army.\\"\\"Red Army\\" is the best of these. It should be read by anyone who wants a plausible, if not necessarily probable, scenario for a war that never happened.The fact that the war didn't happen, and the USSR is no more, doesn't affect the readability of this book in the slightest, so if that was holding you back from reading it, don't let it. You would be missing a first-class war novel that isn't a commercial for the military-industrial complex or a propaganda pamphlet extolling the virtues of NATO.\\"Red Army\\" is a war story told from the perspective of the Red Army, from its senior commanding general, Malinsky, to the lowliest private, the decidedly unwarlike Leonid. It is Peters' attempt to put human faces on the Soviet \\"hordes\\" we (me, anyway, since I'm old enough to remember them) grew up fearing and dreading.Some of the characters are indeed dread-worthy, such as the bullying drunk, Struharkin, the murderous coward Seryosha, or the emotionally scarred airborne officer, Gordunov (the most unfortgettable character in the story). But they are outweighed by characters so sympathetic I was actually rooting for the Soviets to win (traitor!).Most everybody who has posted a review here liked the book but almost all of 'em took issue with the plausibility of the ending. Without giving anything away, let me respectfully disagree and point out the following:1) Somebody pointed out that Peters isn't impressed by the German Bundeswehr and that in real life the Germans would fight much better, if necessary to the last round. They certainly did in WWII but that was a long time ago, under a different system. The German army is the smallest comparible to its population in the European community and the German people of today are largely pacifist and anti-nationalist. Furthermore, during the Cold War the Bonn gov't insisted on a policy of \\"forward defense\\" i.e. of meeting the Soviets head-on at the border so as not to lose territory. Hitler used this as his defensive strategy in Russia from August 1943 onwards, and it failed miserably. War conditions have certainly changed since The Big One, but putting all their armies forward and making them hold a rigid defense designed to conserve territory and save German cities would cost a huge price in lives and equipment. Peters (in my opinion) was right to question whether the modern-day Germans would pay it.2)The Soviets indeed did perform badly militarily on many occasions and Peters does not address the issue of mass desertion, raised by Suvorov in his seminal work \\"Inside the Soviet Army.\\" I'm not sure, however, that he is overestimating the Red Army so much as assuming it would perform at or near its ideal. I think in a short, set-piece war, where the Soviets had the advantage of political surprise and their usual advantage in numbers, they might nearly have done this well -- maybe. A lot of things do \\"go the Russians' way\\" in this book, but a lot of things went NATO's way in \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and Hackett's \\"III WW\\".3) Judging the Soviet army on the performance of the Taliban, Iraqi or Arab armies is a bad idea because the Soviet equipment sent to those countries was \\"for export only.\\" The Soviets referred to equipment (tanks, aircraft, APCs, missles, etc.) shipped overseas as \\"monkey models.\\" The monkey model was a no-frills, stripped-down version of the real Soviet model and was never the best version or even the most modern. For example, the Soviet army of the 80's would have been using T-80 tanks, not the T-72s used by Hussein. And the first echelon of Soviet forces NEVER is issued the best equipment; during WWII, the Germans did not encounter the great T-34 and KV-1 tanks which gave them so much trouble until they were hundreds of miles inside Russia proper. The Soviets believe their first echelon will be wiped out in both offensive and defensive war and see no reason to give it the best equipment. While the Abrams and Leopard are better tanks than the Sovs had, the Soviet advantage in numbers must at least be taken into consideration.Anyway, I have my opinion, you have yours, and Peters has his: his book \\"Red Army\\" is the \\"alternate ending\\" to a war that was -- thank God -- never fought."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I have read just about everything ever written by Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, and Howard Coyle. I enjoyed this book more than any of them. Only Clancy's _Red Storm Rising_ even comes close. The author's background in NATO gives him an edge on the competition.Of course, this is strictly a novel about war. It focuses entirely on the soldiers, not politics or technical details of specific weaponry. The fact that it's told from the Soviet point of view makes it all the more fascinating. Many war novels have had Soviet generals as characters; very few feature Soviet tank crews, infantry squads, artillerymen, etc.Don't let the outdated topic deter you. This is one of the best novels ever written. I've read it six times. In a word: outstanding."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"This book is top class, especially when you consider the era it is written.Not writing about your own Army has its advantages. You don't feel so compelled to portray them like saints. Maybe Ralph would not have fallen prey to this fallacy even if he wrote about the US Army, but this factor couldn't have hurt him in portraying a wide variety of characters, good and bad. I don't know whether he managed to portray Russians or just more \\"3D\\" versions of Western-stereotypes, but he definitely portrayed them as MEN, and that rises this book into a level Red Storm Rising (RSR) and most technothrillers (certainly all in my experience) could not match. If Ralph's 1st Western Front faced off Clancy's RSR NATO, the 1st Western Front would have won by sheer virtue of the characters being men instead of cardboard cutouts - the characterization is THAT different.Ralph decides not to mention technical matters too explicitly so as to showcase the men. That's a nice strategy when the book was written, but it also means the book ages better. Even if the Cold War continued, technical perceptions change. By blurring it, the macroaccuracy (often determinable early on) will rule over the microinaccuracies (which takes years to ferret out with spies).Some people object to the story on the grounds of American-forces doing well against Soviet-forces in the past. What is closer is that generally, at least one side is only vaguely relevant to the patron. Example: the Iraqi army is only superficially similar to the Soviet Army. T-55s are the majority. Even the T-72s are early export versions and armed with ancient, export use steel-cored sabot rounds. The maneuver war was preceded by an unrealistic (in Cold War context), multiple month fire preparation with planes. Of course, perhaps the Americans will still have gone through everything like a knife through butter anyway, but not necessarily.Some people criticize the book for not explaining the cause of the war. However, I'd say the cause of the war is out of scope for the characters involved. Even Malinksy shouldn't have to care about why the war occurred, just to win it. Besides, the book is has too much to say as it is, and war triggers in technothrillers tend to be on the thin side. Best to leave it to the reader's random imagination.The overall operational strategy is handled very well. With the short briefing by Front Chief of Staff Chibisov at the beginning, and a few maps (truly pictures worth a thousand words), the flow of the battle and geographical positions of all the major Soviet units are easily grasped.Some people groan about the ending, but it is the best possible. The apparent success of the Americans suggests that NATO could have won (or at least done better) had it got its act together, which I think was a point Peters was trying to make. It also no doubt appeases the American readership. Yet, the success, beyond blowing out the foremost Soviet OMG brigade, is deliberately left vague.Storywise, the cease fire route was the only way to go - never mind he's running out of pages, two general alternatives are plausible given the setup but they are impalatable. The Americans were apparently doing well, so he could arrange for them to win the battle for NATO (with a little help from the rest) like some reviewers suggest. That would likely lead to nuclear war on the part of the Soviets, and if that didn't happen kind of makes the whole book rather meaningless by not giving NATO the \\"punishment\\" Ralph thinks their lack of coordination and other weaknesses deserves.Alternatively, the map shows that 7th Tank Army is about to enter the battlefield, and it is positioned to hit the American counterattack's flank or rear, depending on how far the US manages to penetrate into 3rd Shock Army's zone. So at least an equally likely scenario is that the Americans get crushed. Which will also mean nuclear war, and the whole American counterattack becomes almost as strategically (and storywise) meaningless than the local counterattacks on the Russians during Day 1 of the war.With nuclear war being a high probability and with the warheads due to fall on their own territory (assuming the tactical nuke war does not go strategic), it is very likely that West Germany would choose a cease-fire. In fact, arguably the most unrealistic part of NATO's nuclear defense is that the Germans will let it happen.And once the Germans decide to quit, there's really little choice for the others as far the battle in Germany is concerned. With twelve divisions, and one of the largest airforces in NATO going out, their line would utterly shatter, leaving the rest of NATO like islands waiting to be surrounded. There was really nothing to it but retreat.Even with the rest of the Reforger divisions arriving, they would face the fresh Soviet 2nd echelon and the reorganized 1st echelon - not a particularly good correlation. In the longer run, the Soviet economy is strengthened by the acquisition of West German technology, while the Western economy is badly dented by the loss of a major trading partner. Conventional war, in the short or middle run, simply isn't the way to go."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"\\"You realize that we had to fight...It wasn't only the political situation. We've been through worse crises. But we had to fight them now. It was the last chance. They we're beating us without ever firing a shot. They forced us to fight so long with their weapons -- technology, economics, their entire arsenal for destroying us in peacetime. And we could not compete. We were losing, and it became so apparent that even a fool could see it...\\"Those are the words from General Malinsky, the Soviet leader of the Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany in Ralph Peters' book, \\"Red Army.\\" Ah, WEST Germany... It's been a few years since we've thought about that political entity, yes? The fall of communism seems so inevitable now.At the writing of this book, in the late Eighties, that didn't seem so inevitable, did it? What if the Russians quit fighting the Cold War our way, through the clash of economic strength? What if the USSR saw its imminent demise, and lashed out militarily?Ralph Peters addresses that question amply in this book. I enjoy a technothriller now and then, but this novel's emphasis on the human element of a Third European War was like a fresh breeze. Completely from the Russian point-of-view, the characters live and breathe, have strengths and faults, prejudices and hobbies. NATO is treated harshly, its political fragmentation endangering its military strength.Peters says in his Author's Note, \\"It is not a book about lethal gadgets. While seeking the highest possible technical accuracy for its backdrop, this book is about behavior. How would that other system behave at war -- and how might its individual members prove like us or distinctly unlike us in their responses to the stress of combat?\\"I'd whole-heartedly recommend this book as a fresh alternative to flag-waving, give-all-the-breaks-to-the-wholesome-Americans contemporary war books. It will open your eyes."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"wow. This book was absolutely amazing. I read it in four days (but only an hour or two a day!). Its all russians, which is cool. Its got every concievable character- tankers, infantryman, artilleryman, supplyers, generals, KGB officers, MiG pilots, Air-Assault Paratroopers, Reconnaissance Tankers, Engineers, Air defence troopers, and (of course) your local neighborhood political officer! ( but there are a couple who are actually good soldiers, and do their duty.). Its a great book, and a must have for anyone who likes the military or action. One definite plus is that it doesn't get into all of the technology details. The author simply says &quot;tank&quot; not a specific type-like Tom Clancy loves to do. Just read it, you won't be wasting your time, and it might just give you a whole new perspective on modern war!"},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Born in 1980 as I was, by the time I was old enough to understand the Soviet threat, it had ceased to be a threat! Therefore, I once looked back at the high anxiety of the Cold War with a sort of Panglossian detatchment. Not after reading Red Army.From the moment that Soviet tanks crash across ill-prepared Western defenses, it seems clear that the threat posed by the huge Soviet military machine was indeed very real. I do not claim to posess the same level of knowldege as other reviewers, particularly those who were former service members, but from a lay perspective, the Red Army seems very frightening and very powerful. They were, indeed, not ten feet tall, and, clearly, not invincible, as the novel makes clear. But one must concede that proper timing, force of will, huge numbers, and a very Soviet willingness to accept causalties made them a danger.Also striking is Peters' ability to write cogently about many, many different strategic and tactical levels of his imaginary war, from conscripts in the mud to generals by their maps and computers. While the highest ranking character is a four star general, one gathers that Peters might well have transitioned effectivley to the multi-front level and the grand, international strategic level. These were not, however, within the realm of his story so, aside from tantalizing hints (\\"perhaps the war would develop and Asian phase\\") he forbears. Aspiring authors must admire this level of skill, knowledge, and discipline.The characters are wrenchingly human. Most memorable to me was Anton Malinsky, son of the four star Soviet general. Peters shows us how war twists men's fates into terrible mockeries of what they might have been.Red Army has now passed from being a vivid cautionary tale to an article of academic debate. It is, however, still one of the better war novels out there, and well worth the investment in time for those interested in recent history."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"I was a field artillery officer in the US Army in Germany during the height of the Cold War, and of course we spent a great deal of time thinking about the Soviet Army and the threat it represented. This novel does a fairly good job of presenting what a conventional war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO might have been like--using one set of assumptions. Specifically, this novel assumes that the Soviet Army would function pretty much as its leadership intended.My personal belief is that although this book is plausible, it is unlikely that the Soviets would have had the easy run into the heart of Germany that this novel envisioned. Anywhere during the 1970s or 1980s that the Soviet military or its surrogates went up against an American-style force, the Soviet force did very poorly. Contrast the two month American liberation of Taliban Afghanistan with the utter inability of the Soviet Army to prevail over the same adversary despite trying for eight years with far more numerous forces. A modest supply of American Stinger missiles and TOW rockets immobilized and thwarted the Soviets. In Germany the number and sophistication of such weapons, and the skill of the NATO soldiers, would have been immeasurably higher. It doesn't seem likely given what happened in Afhanistan that the Soviets would have had an easy time of it against NATO's well-drilled, well-equipped forces. Similarly, whenever a Soviet-style air force went up against a US-trained one, such as Israel's, the result was a debacle for the Soviet side. In short, in the 1970s and 1980s there is not a single example of Soviet tactics or equipment coming out on top against any Western army or air force. Just look at what happened when the American Army went up against Iraq's Soviet-style, Soviet-equipped army. The Russian tanks were nearly helpless against American Abrams and British Crusader tanks. Why would Europe have been any different? It would not have been.Despite the above opinion, which is strictly my own, this is an interesting and thoughtful novel even in the post-Soviet era. We will never be sure that the West could have prevailed against the Soviet Army. Certainly the author makes an excellent case, and weaves a fascinating story of a military-political assault against the West by the Soviets. The novel is eminently readable, never strains the reader's credulity, and I found the political dimension of the novel to be particularly interesting.Overall, this novel in my opinion embodies common Cold War fears that the Soviet Army was stronger than it really was, and is a pretty accurate depiction of those fears. This makes the novel an insightful look at military attitudes during the bad old days of the Cold War."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"Much more than just \`Red Strom Rising' from the soviet side. This is easily one of the best \`war' books I've ever read, fiction or non. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Army","review":"This book is a wonderfully written book. It avoids the techno-jargon of the Tom Clancy books and focuses on the personalities behind the equipment and how they might respond in the absurdity of war. He creates vividly chaotic battle scenes that stupify the combatants.My biggest objection is that the ending is so anti-climactic. After dramatic, but costly initial successes, the Soviet Forces are caught off guard by a dazzling and powerful American counterattack out of CENTAG that most strategists agree would have to happen. The men are only coming to grips with the possibility of defeat when the surprise ending is sprung on the reader.This ending is not plausible because the US forces would never cease fire after taking minimal losses to come within 12 kilometers of cutting off a large Soviet Force at the Weser. Politically West Germany would not have crumbled when it had only yielded perhaps 25-30% of it's territory on the heels of a successful counterattack with some 8 fresh American & British divisions arriving soon as an operational reserve.I highly doubt the American, British & French would allow the unilateral surrender of German Forces with the tide turning decidedly in their favor.I do agree with the inherent weaknesses of NATO as a political unit. I agree that the Europeans would resort to their \\"see no evil\\" mentality and therefore allow themselves to be caught thoroughly off-guard by a Soviet onslaught. NATO's survival would hinge on the ability to establish a credible front within NORTHAG. If that failed to materialize there would be little CENTAG could do alone to stop the siezure of Germany north of the Harz Mountains. That being said, I still believe the British and Americans would carry on the fight even if the West Germans gave up.The Soviet Union never had the economic capability to support a war lasting longer than 30 days in Western Europe. The US, UK, and other NATO partners would have the means to outlast the Soviets in terms logistics and air power.This acknowlegement on the part of the Soviets is why they never invaded West Germany..."},{"Title":"Historic Arts & Crafts Homes of Great Britain","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book depicting ten magnificant houses from the Arts & Crafts period in Great Britain.

You almost expect to find Sherlock Holmes or perhaps Lord Peter Wimsey to come around the corner.The homes are architectually impressive, but this book is mainly on the interior style and decorations. In many cases, such as Red House, the architect designed everything about the house from the structure itself down to the dining room table and the candlesticks and glasses to put on it.Needless to say, these houses were not built for the common ordinary people, but were the country homes of the very well to do.

The secondary characters Toniette and Robinson were more interesting and rightly got their own book.Body and Soul - this also dealt with welfare, forgivess and also the older woman, younger man syndrome - the gap was 13 years which is quite a gap but not a 'mother age' gap. As we know society is hypocritical when its an older woman but Robinson never gave up on his love for Toinette even when he broke things off whn he could not handle her hangups any more, every man has his limits after all. It all works out in the end but is a longer story and could have been shorter but deserves 5 stars.Seduction- lust turns into love in this hot book deserves 4 stars. However I never understood why C.J felt the need to hide her indentity she was on a career break and not exactly a famous face. It was a part of the plot line but that bit never made sense."},{"Title":"Seductive Hearts: For The Love Of You\\\\Body and Soul\\\\Seduction (Arabesque)","review":"This was my frist time reading a Felicia Mason book.

Yes, you can see the Sydney Opera House from the Park Hyatt Hotel and that's the limit of his accuracy.The protagonist travelled from Sydney to Darwin in 116 minutes? Not in a P3 Orion he didn't (unless it is unique among propellor driven aircraft in that it can travel at Mach 2. Maybe it was a Concorde in disguise.) The distance is more than 2000 miles (about equivalent of LA to Miami or New York to Phoenix). The offending yacht travelled from the Celebes Sea to Cairns (well over 2000 miles) in 30 hours. Australia's P3s are owned by the Air Force, not the Navy. In the RAN, a Warrant Officer is not a senior officer. A wommera is not a means of throwing darts, it is a means Aborigines used for throwing spears (it applies extra leverage as an extension to the length of the arm). In itself, a wommera would be about as useful a weapon as any other thin stick and it is hard to imagine why anyone would carry one, especially as that character was supposed to be half Aboriginal..A willing suspension of disbelief in the interests of a good yarn is one thing, lamentable research and gross (easily checkable) error is quite another. Don't waste money on this dog."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"Among the countless and careless errors throughout this book, as attested to by several other reviewers, the one that bothers me the most is the author's horrendous misunderstanding of the terms &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;radiation.&quot; Being an ex nuclear submariner and nuclear engineer, I have always been impressed by the accuracy of Tom Clancy's research, whether it was the details of nuclear submarine operations or his insights regarding interactions among members of the officers and crew. Tom Clancy was a meticulous researcher. Tom Clancy understood the difference between &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;radiation&quot; and never would have written a book based on such a misapplication of science.Lee Tong, the &quot;radiation man&quot; who sets off the entire story, conceivably could have been irradiated by gamma rays from the nuclear cargo on his target ship but that exposure, no matter how intense, would in no way have made him radioactive. There would be no need for a lead shield as described in his hospital room. If on the other hand he became contaminated with radioactive material from the target boat as a result of the explosion, then the target ship and many of its crew members would also have been contaminated. But they weren't. You can walk away from a radiation source, but if you are contaminated with radioactive particles, it goes with you.For those of us who have been conditioned to read anything with Tom Clancy's name on it, and who do so because we have learned to trust the authenticity of his work, this book is extremely disappointing. We used to read Clancy because we trusted him and because of this trust we had confidence that the technology described in the story was accurate, not science fiction. Apparently, that is no longer so, a sad finding for thousands of Clancy fans.Much of the public fear about nuclear power comes from misunderstandings, such as Jeff Rovin's misunderstanding of contamination and radiation. Also, co-creator Steve Pieczenik, having a Ph.D. from MIT, would have easy access to the science that is at the heart of The Sea of Fire. He has no excuse to get it so wrong. For a ready reference, the difference is very clearly described on the Internet at:Definitions Related to Radiationor go to: http://www.orau.gov/reacts/definitions.htmIf you are looking for fairly good science fiction read, and don't care about its technical accuracy, or how big Australia really is, this book might do it for you. Otherwise don't be misled, find another book.Thomas Banfieldtvbanfield@aol.com"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"Each of the Op-Center books has presented a crisis based on the current events and global political circumstances at the time of its writing. This one isn't different. The prospect of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear material is daunting, and the job of preventing such a disaster even more so. This book isn't quite as gripping as some of the earlier books in the series, but it did present a few surprises, and it wrapped up the story nicely. This book placed some of the Op-Center staff in new roles in the field, which was refreshing, and it introduced at least one new character that I suspect will return in future volumes. This was a fun, light read, perfect for any fan of espionage/political thrillers."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"The story ran smoothly, but the ending was not exciting...it just ended.

One good thing: The chapters were short --- just right for bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"I agree with the others who panned this. It is full of obvious errors, and they show the gross ignorance of the author. The one that got me and sticks is his description of the men in the Sampan using the oars to get close to the yacht. They 'oared' there. Oared is not a word. When men use oars to move a ship, boat, or any floating vessel, the term used to move it is ROW. You row a boat, you use 10 foot oars in a viking ship to ROW the ship. One paddles a canoe, but one does not OAR a boat. Obviously this book was thrown together in as short a time as possible, given minimal proof reading, and then published. Tom Clancy should be ashamed to have his name put on it."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"I being an ex Military Officer and a military historian have always respected and appreciated the detail and accuracy in almost all of Mr Clancy's works. He is regarded so highly that certain titles like &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; are on an officers must read which list supplied by Training Command.Thus it was with sadness I read the multiple inaccuracies in this latest feature. My frustration occurs because the information is readily attainable and in some cases just common sense.Some glaring errors are:1. Tasmania is a Island state of Australia not a country...that would be saying Hawaii is a separate country to the U.S.2. A Warrant Officer in the Australian force does NOT rate a salute.3. There is only one minister of Defence in Australia, not numerous.These are but a few of the more obvious errors, I remember that in an earlier book of this specific series another Australian character was briefly introduced an he also was incorrectly researched.Apart from these errors the book was not as enjoyable as others of the series and I would NOT recommend it to any Clancy fans. Also if your going to write about Australia and the Australian Military please get someone who has been there to proof read."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"I snatched this book off the english book rack at the Munich airport thinking it was a Tom Clancy book.

I highly recommend it to any fan of Mr. Clancy's writes especially in audio format."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"I really enjoy action/thriller books, and the Op-Center series is consistently first-rate. Indeed, these books are the most true to the quality and fast pace of Clancy's early books Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. Sea of Fire is a good, solid read, and typical of the Op-Center books well thought out and nicely detailed.Like the last Op Center, Sea of Fire uses geo-political events as a backdrop. This time, it is the Pacific Rim and nuclear smuggling. Lowell Coffey, the Op Center lawyer, finds himself in the middle of a rapidly unfolding crisis while attending a conference in Australia. This was a surprising twist, since Coffey has been a behind-the-scenes-player in the other books. Also of interest, wheelchair bound Bob Herbert makes his first appearance in the field since being maimed by a terrorist bombing. The use of these two, more human characters in lead field roles was refreshing -- always good to see lead characters that well, are frankly, more like you and me.As usual author Jeff Rovin did his homework. You'll gain a lot of useful and discomforting information about the nuclear smuggling trade and how much needs to be done to secure these dangerous materials. I noticed that Rovin went so far as to ensure he had the correct title for members of the Australian Fire Brigade. It's the small touches that sets this apart from the pack of other action-thrillers.Anyway, this is a great, quick read. Take it on the plane or train, and finish it on the beach. Well worth the time and much fun."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"Hmm. I normally like Tom Clancz - even in this spin-off series. However, this book is a dog of the first water. Why? Simple. It is written by someone who hasn't bothered to do even the most basic research on ... well, on *anything*. Basic things - like Australian politics, the Australian Military and its ranks and organization, and even, damnit, *geography*. In the book, for example, we have a Singaporean patrol boat in the sea off the Celebes (what it's doing in Indonesian waters is not obvious -but it's *way* to hell and gone off course and out of the area it has any business being in) and the action then, within the space of a few hours, moves it from there to the *east* Queensland Coast off the Great Barrier Reef. Bzzt. Sorry. No. Unless Singaporean Patrol Boats are capable of supersonic flight, this simply isn't gonna happen. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is simply impossible. To those readers who are (like the writer, one presumes) Americans, this may not be obvious ... though looking at something as basic as an atlas should have clued the author in... but it is bleeding obvious to an Aussie.The story is sort of OK, but, frankly, the background flaws are of such an order of magnitude I simply couldn't rate this as anything other than poorly written crap."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center Sea of Fire","review":"WAY TO BORING AND HARD TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH THE FLOW OF THE BOOK.

I believe this book is intended for professional chefs or those with a high skill level of home cooking; I mean REALLY high level. It starts out with over 100 pages of how to make sauces and stocks--which Escoffier maintains is the basis of French cooking. The directions given assume a good knowledge of advanced cooking technique. The recipes in this book do not follow the step-by-step enumerated process that the vast majority of cookbooks today follow, even the more sophisticated ones. Also, the French titles can be very intimidating for those who are relatively new to French cooking. The definitions page is not very helpful, either.Now to balance out the review: I believe if one really puts their heart into this book, they will emerge as a cooking goddess. This is a very large, intricate cookbook teeming with advanced knowledge and techniques, but as one review noted, it is not a book for the faint hearted, which I guess I am.

It is a fascinating look at the art of professional European cookery at the beginning of the 20th century.However, to appreciate this book fully, it's important to understand exactly who it was written for. Escoffier's original guide was never for a second intended for the home cook. Escoffier was a pioneer with respect to the education of professional chefs, and originally wrote this book for the use of those working in grand houses, in hotels, on ocean liners, and in restaurants who might not have had access to contemporary recipes. Accordingly, the original book does not attempt to teach basic cooking or food preparation techniques. The American translation does include some details on cooking techniques and utensils unfamiliar to the average American chef (such as poeleing, worth the cost of the book alone, and the old French form of braising), but even in the translation it is assumed that the reader is a trained, experienced chef.The recipes themselves are clear and simple to follow, but represent only a small subset of French cooking of the early 20th century. An earlier reviewer mentioned that there was no recipe for onion soup; this is true, but it should be understood that onion soup would never have been accepted by the class of restaurant patron Escoffier cooked for. Much of what has arrived on this side of the Atlantic as \\"French cooking\\" - dishes such as pot-au-feu, onion soup, and steak frites - is distinctly middle-class, and consequently would have been rejected by the clientele of quality restaurants of the time as being unspeakably boorish. Escoffier personally enjoyed bourgeois cooking, but as an astute, intelligent businessman he provided the haute cuisine his clients demanded.One interesting difference between modern cooking and the cooking featured in this book is that Escoffier uses few spices, and indeed declaims on the foolishness of using large amounts of spices in meat dishes. This appears bizarre from our vantage point, but Escoffier had sound economic reasons for his proscriptions. Most diners of the time grew up in the days before refrigeration, when old deteriorating meat was heavily spiced to make it palatable. Fresh, unspiced meat was a sign of the highest quality. The association between strong spices and poor quality was powerful enough to survive long into the 20th century, as any reader of a 1950s American cookbook can attest.As for the recipes themselves, I doubt that many of them could be prepared by the North American home cook. Most of us cannot afford (if we can even find) foie gras, truffles, or capons, and few have espagnole sauce or fish fumet available at all times. However, many recipes can be adapted for the modern cook - using cepes or porcini mushrooms for truffles, for instance - and those that can be prepared really are delicious."},{"Title":"The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery","review":"This book, published in the 1890s, is an excellent resource for those who aspire to cook great french food. Too often cookbook authors insult readers by leaving out key steps for fear that they may be 'too complicated' or call for veal stock when chefs use demi-glace. This book is complicated, poorly organized and difficult, but it WILL tell you the proper way to make french sauces (an incredible section, and well worth the price of the book in itself) and how best to lard a joint of beef. Treat yourself and buy this book to learn the proper way to prepare traditional french cuisine."},{"Title":"The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery","review":"\`The Escoffier Cookbook' is an English translation of the \`Guide Culinaire' by the renowned French chef, Auguste Escoffier, the most important figure in modern professional French culinary practice. One may argue that Antonin Careme is more important simply because Careme influenced Escoffier and write many books on culinary technique, but I suspect every culinary professional reads Escoffier today and few outside academic circles read Careme's original works.One of the most reliable symptoms of Escoffier's importance can be found in the first essay of Michael Ruhlman's \`The Soul of a Chef' dealing with the Certified Master Chef examination given at the Culinary Institute of America. Whenever the candidates were presented with a problem in an unfamiliar area and had the night to consider the problem, they consulted Escoffier for their preparation. This is because most of the situations in the problems came straight from the practice defined by Escoffier a 100 years ago.For these and many more reasons, this book is THE standard by which all French culinary issues should be judged. Therefore, my review is less on why this is a good book and more on why you should pay attention to it if you are serious about cooking.For starters, this 920 page book with 2,973 recipes lists for about $20. Admittedly, the text describing many of those recipes is pretty terse, being based on techniques from one or more earlier recipes. Therefore, you must be committed to really getting involved with this book and mining it for its riches rather than expecting to make a quick search for a particular recipe you can copy or scan at the library on the way home. Of course, if you are already a fairly experienced chef, many of the recipes suggestions are all you need to follow up with a good improvisation based on techniques at your fingertips.The very first thing you learn from this book is that professional French culinary doctrine was concerned about lightness, using fresh ingredients, and eliminating excess fat a century ago. This is not an invention of modern nutritionists and Alice Waters. The next most important lesson is less surprising. This is the importance of sauces in French cuisine and therefore, the importance of stocks, fonds, consomm&eacute;s, essences, and glazes. James Peterson's great book, \`Sauces' may be just a bit more accessible to modern readers, but this is the book from which he got all his material. Stocks, sauces, and many other basics are covered in \`Part I Fundamental Elements of Cooking'. These 135 pages should be read from front to back by anyone who is remotely serious in doing good cooking and adapting the ability to improvise with food.Readers like myself who are impressed by Alton Brown's footwork with details about cooking technique will be happy to discover that the French like Escoffier knew a thing or two about careful observation and measuring, as when Escoffier discusses temperatures of various frying media such as butter, various animal fats, and vegetable oils.Next comes \`Part II Recipes and Methods of Procedure', organized by how various dishes typically appear on standard menus. This means chapters on:AppetizersEggsSoupsFish and SeafoodReleves and Entrees of MeatsPoultry and GameRoasts and SaladsVegetables and Starchy FoodsAppetizers and SnacksDesserts and SweetsA quick look at the egg chapter shows 192 egg recipes, almost as many as in my favorite book dedicated entirely to egg recipes. There are 22 recipes dedicated entirely to poaching. These counts just suggest the depth to which Escoffier covers this subject, as many recipes will refer to one or more recipes in other parts of the book, as we find for \`Careme Hard-Boiled Eggs' which involve a timbale crust and a Nantua sauce from other chapters. One small symptom of how \`modern' Escoffier is with his recipes is in his recipe for scrambled eggs. Many authorities, including James Beard, will insist on scrambled eggs being done in a water bath (bain-marie). Escoffier allows that it can be done on direct heat, as long as the cook is especially careful with using only moderate heat.One thing you may have noticed from some of my quotes is that you will need or expect to acquire knowledge of basic French cooking terms to understand this book, even in this excellent English translation. Learning the term \`releves' will take you deep into the history of French cuisine and how that contrasts with the Russian style of service popularized in France by Antonin Careme. The Russian style of one course following another became so popular that today we are inclined to think that is a French invention. Not so! By the way, entrees are dishes based on tender cuts of meat and releves are braised, poached, or roasted dishes done with less tender cuts of meat. You will not be able to dip into a recipe at random in this book without a firm handle on terms such as poach, braise, sautee, croquette, blanch, julienne, and several other terms.This is the one book I believe a food lover should unequivocally have on their bookshelves. Cook all you want from Saint Julia's \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking', but come to Escoffier to really understand the underpinnings of French culinary practice."},{"Title":"The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery","review":"I do not how big or how many recipes the original Escoffier book has, but this one is most probably not the all-in version. As i read through the book, i somehow found myself loosing my way from one category to the other, not to mention that there are lists and indexes that are lacking basic data - which certainly Escoffier hadn't left out when he first wrote the book.However, as a first contact with this great Chef, it's a good start buying this if you do not want to spend more for the full version. Just have in mind that - expect for the hard cover - the rest of the paper used for this version is of really low quality and very easy to be torn apart."},{"Title":"The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery","review":"I call this book dangerous because when I fell under its spell, a couple of years ago, I spent a ridiculous amount of time, and certainly more money than I should have, attempting various of its recipes. However, if you love traditional French cuisine, if you have lots of time to spend in the kitchen, and if you already know the basics, this book is a treasure. I personally can attest that the \\"little tea cakes\\", the \\"Reve de Bebe\\" (strawberries and cream inside a pineapple) the trouts in aspic, the hollondaise and espangole and various braised meat dishes are all sublime.In Mastering the Art of French Cooking Julia Child and her colleagues often offered slightly simplified versions of many of these things. Sometimes there was a promise held out: they would write something like \\"someday you will learn from Escoffier how to give it the full original treatment, but to start with....\\" I think that sums up the role of this book. If you've mastered what Julia Child has to teach (which you should if you want to do French cooking) and want to try something even more traditional and more \\"aristocratic\\", then get this book.Another treat about this book is that a whole world opens up while reading it--the world of Proust and Collette and the Paris chapter of Brideshead Revisited: here we see what they were eating and how.I haven't really used this book for a long time now. It's too seductive--if I start looking into it I end up spending hours in the kitchen over stocks and braises. And yes--you'll dirty a mind-bogglingly large number of pots and pans. But once in a while I try something new from it and I've never been disappointed yet.*Note--I am not sure that the version I am reviewing is the same as the one I have in mind--some other reviewers have alluded to it's being an abridgement, which mine assuredly is not. What I say above is said with the original in mind."},{"Title":"The Escoffier Cook Book: A Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery","review":"Please note that this is an abridged version of Escoffier's famous Le Guide Culinaire.

It is amazing how this reporter, researcher, historian and anthropologist can go around the world and find out information in the most minute detail, for presentation and presently you have modern academicians who cannot decipher many of the historical texts with any type of accuracy and not without bias. The author will answer most of your questions on the social sexual issues between Africans and Europeans. If you have a question Mr. Rogers just may be the man to answer it. In addition there is the WOW factor, or the history you just may not get anywhere else except with exceptional authors like this one&#8230;.. And just like the previous two volumes to make his case he has great black and white photos and all of the references that may be possible.Especially of interest&#8230;The myth of how Ham became black because of a curse, the universal decay of empires, the views of Arthur Schopenhauer, mental illness among the wealthy, the African Polynesians, Hitler, the Nazis and homosexuality, who really colonized the US, Mexico, and Europe, Lincoln, the incompetency of man&#8217;s knowledge, and finally be sure to read the notes section which is every bit as interesting as the major content."},{"Title":"Sex and Race, Vol. 3: Why White and Black Mix in Spite of Opposition","review":"The notion that 'racial' purity is a good thing has been and continues to be taught and encouraged in society. Although many (particularly whites) may consider it rediculous and even paranoid to think this, it is nevertheless true. After reading J.A. Rogers Sex and Race books, I've become acutely aware of how racially conscious people are particularly when it comes to sex. The gist of this book is that although many people (particularly whites) have aversions toward interracial marriages, they continue and will continue to have interracial offspring of every kind imaginable. When there were laws against interracial marriages and great turbulance between whites and blacks, interracial unions were going on regardless. Today, there are less overt suggestions that blacks and whites should not marry one another. For example TV ads, movies, and TV programs very rarely show blacks and whites together in loving relationships and if they do they make a point that there is something odd or unusual about it. Another thing which is done is to only use actors and actresses who appear to be very 'pure racially'. The people we see in the movies do not acurately reflect what people look like in society.The book really points out how rediculous notions of racial purity are. It is biased towards blacks however, so anyone who reads this needs to keep an open mind and think about what is being said. If one is offended at the suggestion that such and such a great person commonly accepted as white may have black blood then you must examine your racial sensitivities."},{"Title":"Sex and Race, Vol. 3: Why White and Black Mix in Spite of Opposition","review":"J.A.

I believe these were due to a lack of quality proof-reading of the product of an electronic scan of printed pages. For example, the word &#34;die&#34; was repeatedly scanned as &#34;the.&#34; It took a couple of occurrences to figure this one out. Also, periods went missing, quotation marks reversed, etc. Sometimes the error was obvious, but sometimes frustratingly obscure. Poor execution damaged a potentially good product."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"I have no problem with the novel. It was a fast read.I do have a problem with the Kindle edition. It must have been scanned using character recognition software from a print copy and then not proof read. The book is rife with strange words in the middle of sentences and typographic errors. The software must have particularly had a problem scanning the word \\"die\\". There were several places where the word \\"die\\" would fit in the sentence and we got words like \\"the\\" in its place.

That being said, this book was good but way too many gap fillers. I thought I'd never get through it. Like another reviewer I almost gave up but toward the end I had to know the answer. Cut out all the non-essentials when writing these types of books."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"The Parsifal Mosaic by Robert Ludlum cemented to me that Ludlum is one of the greatest spy thriller writers of all time. In this book, I can attribute this mainly to his amazing manipulation of suspense and the manner in which he uses a series of microcosms to demonstrate the central conflict, between the United States government and a renegade individual named Parsifal who has extremely sensitive documents that have the potential to cause global calamities.Ludlum's superb spectacle begins in Spain along the Costa Brava where scarred CIA operative of Czech background Michael Havelock witnesses his lover Jenna Karas get gunned down by his own people because she is proved by higher authorities to be a double agent. Devastated by the series of events, he immediately announces his retirement and looks for a job in a university. While travelling through Europe, in Rome whilst at a train station he spots her and the chase is on. Ludlum starts the action at this point and never lets up; he moves the action from Italy to perilous alpine passes in Col Des Moulinets to the USA where Havelock slowly uncovers clues of something much more sinister that spreads all the way to the White House. Havelock is not only chasing Karas, he is being pursued by his own organisation that sees him as a paranoid schizophrenic gone rogue who can compromise various operations around Europe. This causes senior members of the CIA to send various deadly assassins to try and eliminate him while he desperately searches for the truth.Havelock discovers the connection between the mysterious figure of unknown intentions Parsifal, Havelock's childhood friend and Secretary of State Anthony Matthias, a branch of Soviet right wing fanatics called the VKR and the danger of nuclear war. This leads to the last 100 pages being full of twists and turns which proved to me to be one of the most compelling sections of a novel I have ever read. The only problem I encountered with this novel was the more than sporadic use of superfluous, convoluted dialogue which Ludlum seems to have been prone to due to his past as a playwright. Some may criticise Ludlum for lacking in \`realism' and characterisation however his novels are among the most entertaining of all time due to the nonstop action, the massive scale and the extremely enthralling, vigorous plot which will keep you hooked to the very last twist. If you read any Ludlum books make it this one and the unforgettable Bourne trilogy."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"great book. another opportunity to enjoy a suspense novel. great read for the airport or the beach or the easy chair"},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"As allways Robert Ludlum keeps you wanting to know whats on the next page.A great book."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"Parsifal Mosaic is a one great true read.

I waited quite some time before attempting 'Parisfal', and by the time I finally got around to doing so, it didn't take long to realize that I had cheated myself out of quite an adventure.I was going through my library here not long ago fixing up my book shelves when I ran across my old copy, and decided it was time to crack it open yet again. I was amazed at how well it has held up over the years, and just how REALLY GOOD it really is. I won't attempt to go into the details of the plot, because quite frankly, Ludlum puts just too many twists and turns into his average novel that just to attempt to summarize 'Parsifal' in such a short amount of room would be incredibly disrespectful to the memory of Robert Ludlum (in my opinion). No, instead I would rather go into what makes his novels so darned fun...Ludlum will never be confused with what some consider 'True Literature' but what he lacks in major character development, he more than makes up for with the sheer speed of his plots and how his stories seem to be several plots all going at once on a runaway train with no brakes...yet he manages to keep control at all of the crucial moments and never gives you more peeks into what is really happening than you absolutely MUST have, and yet you still have a grasp of what is going on, without knowing what is going to happen next. Is someone going to die in his books?Yes...PLENTY of bodies stack up over the course of the typical Ludlum novel, but that really isn't what drives the story...it's the amazing creativity in which the story unfolds and the complexity in which the circumstances seem to rope you in to the point where if you don't continue to keep reading, you just may find yourself lost because of just how sophisticated he writes his thrillers. Many have called Ludlum the Master of the Superthriller, and I echo that in a HUGE way. In my opinion, 'The Parsifal Mosaic' is easily one of his top 2 books, which is high praise indeed when you consider his earlier & later works.Simply put, if you have toyed with the idea of reading a Robert Ludlum novel and you have yet to check out 'Parsifal' than you are in for one incredible treat. Pick it up and get lost in one of the greatest imaginations in adventure thriller fiction of the past 40+ YEARS. Simply put, this is an absolutely amazing novel that is more fun than I can put into words...and I have to say, it is JUST as fun the 2nd time around, too. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"I'm a big Robert Ludlum fan, and love the spy / mystery type of novel. The Parsifal Mosaic is very involving and complex, and in general great fun.Without giving away the inner layers of the story, Michael Havelock is a US spy with a tortured past, who has finally found some happiness with a fellow spy, Jenna Karasova. Unfortunately, he is shown that Jenna is a double agent, and watches her die for her betrayal. Preparing to abandon his agent-life and retire to become a teacher, he catches a glimpse of Jenna, alive, at a chance meeting in Europe. The chase is on, as he tries to track down Jenna and figure out why she's alive, and who was deceiving who.There are a variety of interesting locations, from the docks of Italy to meeting rooms in Washington DC. The characters each seem to have an outward 'mask' plus an inner 'motive', and Michael moves from scene to scene trying to unravel it all. There are twists and turns as he gets closer and further away from the truth.Maybe it's because I've read so many mysteries and thrillers, but I do have to say that a few things disappointed me. First, many of the situations were extremely staged and obvious. There were many things that I guessed long before the characters did, and with the lead characters made out to be extremely intelligent and quick, it was hard to believe they were still muddling through something for chapters after it had been made obvious. For example, Michael recognizes one of the guys killing Jenna - Michael knows he knows him but doesn't remember WHO he is. Throughout the rest of the story, while trying to figure out what is going on, he never bothers to try to track this guy down. The identity of the two main secret characters was pretty obvious from the get-go but of course Michael doesn't figure it out until the very end.There were many &quot;this situation proves that I am a master spy&quot; setups that were clumsy and showed if anything that the people around him were completely clueless. I'm all for helping people learn &quot;how spies act&quot; and that &quot;Michael was very good at spotting discrepancies&quot; but if you read Spenser or Bond stories, that is done in a subtle, intelligent way. In this book it was more like a hammer slamming a staple. Rather overkill.And finally, the dialogue is over the top. It seems every page has &quot;Oh my God!&quot; or &quot;Christ!&quot; or &quot;Jesus!&quot; or &quot;You Bastards!&quot; It's sort of like wading through a spy soap opera :)Don't get me wrong - I do enjoy Ludlum a great deal and ripped through the book in a single evening. I enjoyed the ride, but I did keep feeling like I was hitting a &quot;speed bump&quot; along the way that I'd have to roll my eyes about, and then keep going. A fun read for a day at the beach, or an escapist evening!"},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"One feels almost shame in enjoying the works of Robert Ludlum. The dialogue steps out of the Stone Age onto the paper (the phrases &quot;my friend&quot; and &quot;spell it out&quot; are used overgenerously), the melodrama is suffocating (ditto the words &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;insanity&quot;, always in italics and always followed with an exclamation point), and the characters are photocopies of each other from book to book. Meanwhile, the good-guy spy is over-romanticized, the stuff of a fourteen year-old girl's wildest fantasies. The problem is, Ludlum is so darned fun to read. And, as his novels go, The Parsifal Mosaic is among the best. This might be directly related to the sky-high body count, but it's Ludlum: get used to it. I felt almost guilty the first time I acknowledged to myself that the bloodbath trick--someone getting killed every four pages or so--never gets old. No one said this guy was Tolstoy. He's not even John LeCarre or Frederick Forsyth. But nor are they Robert Ludlum. If you want pragmatism, realism, and a spy hero who gets his hands dirty, eats corn flakes, and drives a Taurus, then read LeCarre (the master of characterization) or Forsyth (the master of the political thriller). But none of their work gives you quite the same thrill as sitting down with Robert Ludlum......while he blows away five hundred people with machine guns."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"This book represents Ludlum at his best, bar none!!! My only problem with this book is the dialogue which strikes me as unrealistic. I found myself repeatedly thinking that people do not speak to each other as the characters do in this novel. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the plot development and, well, just about everything else. In fact, I have read this book at least ten times. For my money, I would strongly recommend this novel and the following: The Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, Scarlatti Inheritance, Aquitaine Progression, Matarese Circle, The Holcroft Covenant and The Gemini Contenders. Please, PLEASE, avoid the following: The Matarese Countdown, The Road to Omaha, The Scorpio Illusion and The Bourne Ultimatum."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"Firstoff, I am a huge Ludlum fan. I was one of the first people to write a review of his latest novel &quot;The Matarese Countdown&quot; which I really enjoyed. Sadly though many people did not agree with my assessment and I even received email inquiring about my mental state! While I certainly believe that people are entitled to their opinions it really bothers me when people talk about giving up on an author just because they haven't enjoyed their latest effort(s). By doing that they seemingly have forgotten why they chose to read that same author in the first place. To anyone who read &quot;Matarese Countdown&quot; or &quot;Apocalypse Watch&quot; and then couldn't bear to read anymore I beg you to reconsider and before giving up on of the best authors of escapist thillers take a chance with this book or one of his other earlier works (Aquitaine Progression, Chancellor Manuscript, or the Bourne Trilogy). Years ago, when I had discovered Ludlum and was in the process of reading all his books I earmarked this one for the grand finale, hoping to close out the collection with a BANG! I was not let down one bit! In fact I was astonished by how great it was!! From the opening scene on the Costa Brava to the climax in the woods of Pennsylvania this book is filled with vivid characterizations, exotic locales, and shocking twists of fate which helped to earn Ludlum his reputation as the &quot;Unsurpassed Master of the Superthriller&quot;! It's probably true that no one will ever mistake Ludlum's work for &quot;literature&quot;, if that's what you look for in espionage novels try Johm LeCarre or Frederick Forsyth(Both of whom I also throughly enjoy!) but if you are looking for action and escape a la Clive Cussler, David Morrell, or the lesser known but equally as exciting David Hagberg and Jon Land then by all means stick with Robert Ludlum!! The way I look at it Ludlum is like a superstar athelete in the twilight of his career...He may not be able to do everything he used to in his prime, but he is still capable of providing some highlights and I'm still willing to pay to see(read) him!! END"},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"I'm a big Ludlum fan and have read several of his works. I have to say, Parsifal Mosaic is definitely one of his best works. The characters are well developed, plot is deep, and descriptions of places and events are vivid and well put together. Ludlum has built the characters very well, and this book is really a thriller from the protagonist's (Michael Havelock) perspective, as opposed to some of this other works where the focus is almost entirely the plot and sequence of events. Even with a plot that gets complex towards the second half of the book, the suspense is very engaging, and it's hard to put the book down. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"I have never really been a 'Spy Novel' fan, i got interested after reading XPD by Deighton. But this book definately beat it. The Parsifal kept me interested during my travels around europe, 5 hour train journeys flew by with all the intruige and the plot building.

Then some time later, on a field assignment in Rome, he spots her at a railway station and decides impulsively and obsessively to track her down. The trail leads to France and a secret airbase near the Italian border where he sees Jenna again in the hands of some cold-blooded terrorists. His search reaches the US where a top-secret government operation is forming that could change the balance of world power as we know it for ever . . . who is behind this operation? Often very similar to THE POWER and THIS UNITED STATE by Colin Forbes, the villain is surprising . . .and who is the manipulative PARSIFAL character, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle, or mosiac if you will!

The plot--why did someone trick Michael Havelock into thinking his girlfriend betrayed him? -- leads to a strange twist about the world teetering on the edge of chaos because one man decided to prove that another man had too much power.

While riveting, it is hard to follow at times."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"In The Parsifal Mosaic by Robert Ludlum, the literary device flashback was used very frequently and very effectively. Since it revealed many very essential plot elements, the novel was much strengthened by this device. And, Robert Ludlum brought much needed suspense and complexity to the plot by using flashback.This literary device was used very much throughout this novel. And the reason it was used so much was to reveal essential and thrilling plot elements. Each flashback made by the main character, Michael Havelock, made the story more understandable and put plot puzzle pieces together. Without the use of this literary device by Robert Ludlum, there would be many gaps in the story and the book would not make sense at all.Not only was the plot put together by the author's use of this literary device, the story was made more suspenseful and complex after these flashbacks by the main character. Each one of them blew you away by revealing something totally new and surprising that made the pages keep turning. It made the book intriguing from beginning to end.Robert Ludlum's use of flashback in The Parsifal Mosaic ultimately strengthened the novel. In no way did it make it weak or uninteresting or bland, it actually held the plot together and made it suspenseful.

It also happens to be dramatic, suspenseful, and breathtaking. Every aspect of this story is done with expertise. The action scenes are entertaining, the dialogue is fluid, and the plot gets deeper as the pages turn, but never becomes confusing or ridiclous.

A trail of dead bodies marked his passing as he grasped the flimiest clue that would led him from one place to another. Certainly, it was the better part of the novel where reader can admire the tenacity and brilliance of the would-be-retired-agent.The later part of the book tracked the conspiracy to its source, but this part is less well-written as convoluted details were rambled and readers get lost in data overload. Also, Michael's jogging through his memories became more confusing for readers.Character wise, there was little to be criticised, though dialogues were a little stilted. But otherwise, each character was clearly distinguishable with a fair degree of realism. Twists in characters could not be anticipated but were introduced brilliantly. The only complaint was readers today could tell if someone calls to say he's got vital info that could not be communicated immediately or needs more confirmation, something bad is sure to happen to ensure the communication would not take place. But to be fair, that is after countless movies and thrillers today, and should not be judged on a book that was written long ago before it became a common ploy.Everything points to an explosive ending and it was almost anticlimatic when it did end though. On the other hand, I suppose no one would really expect an all-out nuclear war."},{"Title":"The Parsifal Mosaic","review":"You want it to happen. You can't believe it when it does.

The Greek text of the Magdalen Papyrus P64 \\"hekastos auton\\" agrees with the Textus Receptus (Source of the King James Version) and not the Critical Greek Text of Nestle \\"heis hekastos\\" (modern translations came from the Wescott and Hort Critical Greek Text). This will cause no small storm in the realms of modern theological textual criticism. The modern Scripture revisionist will have to retire or use the Textus Receptus. The closest Greek to the original God inspired writing of the Apostle Matthew is the Textus Receptus. The Critical Text of Wescott and Hort is no longer to be considered the parent Greek text.

The prejudicial comments and reviews attacking Thiede's scholarship do not in themselves establish an argument against his work."},{"Title":"Eyewitness to Jesus","review":"What could be of greater moment than the discovery of ancient papyrus fragments which date to a period which would place them as eyewitnesses to Jesus? And if these fragments capture contentious passages, what might be the implications of their \\"witness\\"? I anticipated the arrival of ETJ with great excitement. However, I was put off by the newsy approach to this story which detracts from an otherwise interesting account that needs no artifice. The story is the fragments and should be centered on these remarkable witnesses. However, there are no *detailed* photos of the critical fragments. The dust jacket has better images than what are inside. Very disappointing.There is one page (2 photographs) dedicated to the three fragments, but the image is so small, that it's nearly impossible to read the uncials. A large image of a Qumran fragment was shown; the authors should have afforded the same attention to the Magdalen fragments. (Arg!)Although the fragments in the photos are shown verso in one image and recto in the second, the fragments themselves are not identified using the numbering convention as in the text. So, it is extremely difficult to establish a correspondence with that portion of the text which analyzes the fragments. (Arg!!) With extreme difficulty I was able to identify portions of Matthew 26:31 -- [totelegei]AUTOISOIx[pantesumeis]SKANDALIS(theta)E[se(theta)e]ENEMOIEN[entenukti][TAUTE]. I could not completely make out the sacred name, the two character abbreviation, for Jesus (see \\"Ix\\" above for \\"IS\\" -- IESOUS) following AUTOIS.Since special imagery was needed to enhance fragment 3 in order to read the uncials in line 1, an overlay showing the recovered characters would have been helpful. As it is, I cannot find the critical word \\"auton\\" (Matthew 26:22-23), or any portion thereof, on the recto. The fragment is claimned to exhibit a reading in agreement with the traditional text ([hekastos] auton \\"each of them\\") and not the critical text (eis auto \\"each in turn\\") (principally Vaticanus B). Where is the enhanced scan? I'll just have to take their word on the matter.Worth the time and effort, to be sure, but ETJ could have been much improved. Thus 3 stars.

However Thiede's paleographical dating methods are found to be selective; certain letters are compared and certain other letters which would contradict Thiede's theory are not compared. (Klaus Wachtel wrote about this is in a German publication in 1995.)D'Ancona's book rates three stars because of the depth of information he includes on paleography and ancient writing practices.

The authors work backward in dating the papyrus pieces. They find that the writing style is the same as in 132AD, then they find that the writing style is the same as in around 70AD, and then they find that the writing on the papyrus pieces is the same as writing found even further back, to around 60AD, which is within the lifetimes of people who could have been eyewitnesses to Jesus. But what astounds me is that no one I have seen so far questions this logic. Everyone seems bedazzled by the historical research.Quite simply, there's nothing that is presented here that sets any of these time frames as exclusive to the time that these papyri could have been written in. In other words, they could have been written in any of these time frames. Nothing in this research shows that they only could have been written in 60AD. All is shows is that they could have been written in 60AD, not that anyone proved that they definitely were. It's a clever bit of misdirection, but that's all. Handwriting of the time didn't suddenly change every decade. And if it did, the authors didn't prove that this handwriting was exclusive to 60AD.

The scraps are believed to be from the Gospel of Matthew. When they were discovered, they were dated to the time period 80-100 A.D. Thiede re-examines the scraps and finds them to date from around 60 A.D. Such a dating would mean that Matthew's Gospel most likely was written by an eyewitness. It would also mean that the four document hypothesis, that well-respected mainstay of Gospel scholarship, is dead wrong. Thiede tries manfully to explain how he came to the dating. In so doing, he must explain the arcane, esoteric, and almost impenetrable world of papyrology. It makes for slow, painful reading, and students who are not familiar with the science of the study of papyrus scraps will have to take much of what Thiede says on faith.

Greatreading!!"},{"Title":"Eyewitness to Jesus","review":"Around 1901, an Englishman, Charles Huleatt, who was a scholar as well as an Evangelical missionary to Egypt, was living in the Egyptian town of Luxor when he came into possession of three tiny papyrus fragments, on which were written, in Greek, words from the 26th chapter of Matthew's gospel.In 1994, scholar Carsten Thiede came upon the fragments, which had been largely ignored, stored in a display case of an Oxford University library. In the 1950s, the fragments had been dated to about AD 180-200, but Thiede thought it might be worthwhile to re-analyze them using modern techniques not available in the 1950s.For example, Thiede, together with biologist Georg Masuch, developed and patented a new type of \\"epiflourescent confocal laser scanning\\" microscope, which can differentiate between twenty separate micrometer-(millionth of a meter; micron)-thick layers of a papyrus manuscript. This instrument showed that a certain puzzling dot \\"which has caused so much debate and irritation\\" (p. 60), and which was on one of the three fragments... was only 4.0 micrometers thick (thickness = height of ink on, plus depth of ink within, the papyrus sheet).Yet the recognizable Greek letters were 12.1 micrometers thick. The troublesome dot was thus revealed to be nothing more than an accidental ink blot, common enough on ancient papyri.And now we come to the matter of dating--when was the papyrus manuscript (of which the three scraps remain) actually written? In dating the three fragments, \\"The weakness of previous estimates was clear: certain key assumptions had persisted out of respect for tradition rather than because they were logically defensible\\" (p. 114).So I wondered why carbon-analysis (a standard method for dating ancient manuscripts) had not been done on the three fragments, to settle the question of how old they are, once and for all? However, upon reading further, I learned that a portion of the manuscript is necessarily used up--destroyed--during the process of carbon-dating it. Hence, only blank margin space is ever used for such analysis.But the three pieces of papyrus have no blank margin space; writing covers them to all their edges. To radiocarbon-date them would result in the destruction of one of the three postage-stamp-size fragments (including the text written on it), which is not an acceptable option (p. 71).Fortunately, it turns out that there are other methods, besides carbon-dating, to determine the age of an ancient manuscript.When Carsten Thiede analyzed the handwriting style of the three fragments (p. 113), he found it to be quite similar to manuscripts discovered at Qumran. (AD 68 is the most recent that Qumran manuscripts can have been written, since that is the year the Jewish settlement of Qumran was abandoned, right before the conquering Roman army arrived [p. 116].)Thiede discovered that the handwriting style of the three papyrus pieces was also very similar to at least one manuscript found at Herculaneum, a town in Italy. (AD 79 is the most recent the Herculaneum manuscript(s) can have been written, because the Mount Vesuvius eruption's lava flow buried Herculaneum [as well as Pompeii] in that year [p. 104].)Therefore, based on the 'most-recent-possible' dates for manuscripts from Qumran (AD 68), and from Herculaneum (AD 79), Dr. Thiede concluded that the three papyrus fragments of Matthew's gospel \\"should be dated to the first century AD, toward AD 70 or even earlier\\" (p. 106).Incidentally, Thiede was the first person to use the Greek-language fragments from among the Dead Sea Scrolls ( = Qumran Caves manuscripts), in order to date other ancient Greek-language writings (in this case, New Testament manuscript fragments) (p. 116). (Since the Dead Sea/Qumran scrolls were discovered 1947-1955, I wondered why nobody else had made such comparisons any earlier. But no explanation is offered, which omission I consider a deficiency of this book.)And now I turn to a somewhat peripheral matter, yet of some value in understanding more about Matthew's gospel, and hence indirectly setting the three papyrus pieces in a broader perspective. The author of Matthew's gospel is evidently Levi / Matthew, the tax collector. (The authors provide some evidence of his authorship in the text, which I will not go into here.) He managed the tax office at a border-crossing (between Galilee on the west, and to its east the Tetrarchy of Philip), on a trade route (from the Mediterranean Sea, to the inland city of Damascus), in Capernaum (on the northern edge of the Sea of Galilee).As a result, though his occupation made him a social outcast, it also made him wealthy enough to throw a big party at his house for Jesus, which was attended by \\"a large crowd\\" (Luke 5:29, New International Version). \\"A large crowd\\" leads me to conclude that Matthew's house was a large one...confirming that he was indeed wealthy. More importantly for us, in order to operate such a (relatively important) customs station, he must have been both highly intelligent, and well-educated, being \\"fluent in Aramaic and Greek\\" (p. 17).....So that is the background scoop on Matthew the tax-collector, who, after leaving his lucrative but disreputable position, later became Matthew the gospel-writer.By the way, it is not only Matthew's gospel which turns out to have been written earlier than was once supposed. A snippet from the Gospel of Mark was found in Qumran Cave 7, proving that, like Matthew's gospel, Mark's gospel also was written before AD 68, the year when both the town of Qumran \\"and the nearby area of the caves were overrun by the Tenth Roman Legion\\" (p. 30).Furthermore, a papyrus fragment from the Gospel of Luke--which was acquired at Luxor, Egypt, the same town where missionary/scholar Charles Huleatt obtained the three fragments of Matthew's gospel--has a handwriting style which is remarkably similar to that of the three Matthew fragments. As a result, it is now generally regarded as being (part of) the earliest known manuscript of Luke's gospel.In fact, author Carsten Thiede agrees with the assessment of American scholar Philip Comfort; in Thiede's words, \\"the Paris papyrus [named for the city where it now resides] of St. Luke's Gospel is not much later than\\" the three scraps of Matthew's gospel (p. 70). Furthermore, Thiede concludes that \\"the Paris codex--quite probably came from the same scribal school or center, commissioned by a different patron, and only slightly later\\" (p. 68).The overall SIMILARITIES between the three Matthew fragments, and the Paris papyrus of Luke....are the basis for postulating that they both came from the same scribal center, probably somewhere in Egypt.Slight DIFFERENCES in the handwriting on the Paris papyrus (differences from the three Matthew fragments)...are the basis for assigning a \\"slightly later\\" date to the Luke papyrus, since ancient handwriting of Greek letters evolved gradually over time in characteristic ways, such as changing from a cursive joined-letters style....to a more printed separate - letters style (pp. 119-120); thus the handwriting style of a particular manuscript gives a good idea of when it was written.There is much more in \\"Eyewitness to Jesus\\" than I have discussed. Such as abbreviation of holy names, which the three papyrus fragments of Matthew's gospel are the earliest example of among all ancient papyri. Specifically, one of the three Matthew fragments abbreviates \\"Lord\\" which in Greek is \\"kyrie,\\" as \\"KE\\". Likewise another of the three fragments abbreviates the name of \\"Jesus,\\" which in Greek is \\"ieous,\\" as \\"IS\\". Suffice it to say here.... that the authors feel such abbreviation \\"asserts unequivocally the divinity of Jesus\\" (p. 143).If you wish to follow their complete line of reasoning about how abbreviation of holy names signifies that the writer (Matthew) believed in Jesus' divinity, I encourage you to read the book. In fact, for anyone who is interested in finding out more about what science (papyrology)...can tell us about religion (the origins of the New Testament), I heartily recommend reading this fascinating book.I also liked and recommend two other books on related topics: \\"The Stones Cry Out\\" (which I have also reviewed) describes how modern archeology--often surprisingly--confirms the Bible as a reliable record of actual historical events.And \\"Brother of Jesus\\" (also reviewed by myself) is about an ossuary (stone burial box) that might have contained the bones of the same James who is mentioned in the New Testament as being the brother (or cousin?) of Jesus (!) (Just make sure you are getting the revised \\"UPDATED AND EXPANDED\\" 2004 [paperback] edition, which contains new material that is not included in the original 2003 [hardcover] edition.)Also worthwhile reading for me has been \\"The Miracle Detective\\" by Randall Sullivan, about apparitions of Mary (the mother of Jesus), which the author personally investigated (by interviewing people involved in the visions).And not to be overlooked is a book my sister told me about, and I surprised myself by liking it, as well as its sequel: \\"The Bible Code\\" and \\"Bible Code II\\", about a code seemingly present in the words of the Christian Old Testament / Hebrew Bible.Finally, Joan Wester Anderson has written a bestselling collection of true stories, \\"Where Angels Walk\\" which I enjoyed immensely, about people's encounters with...real-life angels(!)p.s.

The gap between the university and the church, between science and faith', may at last be overcome.\\" Indiana Jones and the Gospel ParchmentsEyewitness; Thiede found:On December 24, 1994, the Times of London ran a sensational article by Matthew d'Ancona that introduced the theories of a German papyrologist, Carsten Thiede, and the story spread like wildfire, published as, \\"The Jesus Papyrus.\\" According to Thiede's thesis, the three Magdalen scraps of Matthew had been misdated, since they were in fact the Gospel's earliest papyrus fragments, dating to the first century and so bear the attestation of eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry. In 1995 Thiede published (Rekindling the Word: In Search of Gospel Truth), offering a popular elaboration on his views. Finally, in 1996, Eyewitness to Jesus appeared.Papyrologists Complain:Thiede's work does not lack good sense, but it is speculative and open to peer criticism. Graham Stanton, New Testament scholar of King's College, London, has expressed scholars and papyrologists complaint that Thiede never undertook to explain the reasons for dating P64 later, particularly the Uncial writing style of the fragments. He prefers to point to Greek writing styles evidenced in Qumran and elsewhere in order to show that P64 (and other manuscripts) are from the first century. Thiede's attempt to redate Magdalen's P64 may well be vindicated by subsequent research.Most rational review:Thiede's attempt to redate Magdalen's P64 may well be vindicated by subsequent research. And he is right when he says that New Testament scholarship is rarely willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the antiquity and authenticity of the New Testament documents. But the merits of his arguments should be weighed in the scholarly journals instead of exploited by publishers' marketing departments.

In this very large-format book, many of his pictures are reproduced in their full, monochrome glory. However Adams has spent a large part of his life in Yosemite National Park photographing the (admittedly breathtaking) landscapes there. This means that there is not a great deal of variety in the subject matters. There are some excellent portraits near the back of the book, and these images, again in monochrome, are object lessons in how to light a subject. I feel the book could have been improved with more diversity, Adams has after all travelled the world taking landscapes and this would have lifted the book a little.Although most pictures shewn here were taken on large-format cameras and a 35mm Pentax, he does have a few examples of shots taken with a Polaroid Land Camera, showing that anyone with the artistic ability and a good eye for light and composition can take serious photographs.There isn't much text in this book, apart from the introduction, it's mainly a coffee table book of pictures to be enjoyed (and despite my moans, there isn't a duff shot among them!)"},{"Title":"Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra","review":"I am a fan of the authors writing in general. If you're a person who enjoys reading stories in the Wall Street Journal etc then this book may very well be for you (the author works at WSJ).This is a fascinating story of international intrigue and business. The author provides historical background for both AmEx and Mr Saffra and then proceeds into the meat of the story.What's interesting here is that the Vendetta alluded to in the title raises some serious ethical questions on the part of some folks. All I'll say is as you read it do a name search on the web and see where some of them are today, it's not the poor house and it's not jail either.The book exposes high finance, high power, bare knuckled business street fighting taken to an internation stage."},{"Title":"Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra","review":"What happens when business people start to act like 5 year olds at the playground - I'm taking my ball and going home.

Not only does the book provide us this weird story but also it gives the reader a great back ground on these two companies - the American Express information was very interesting. The story of the two companies coming together and then having a lovers spat is just darn interesting and a little tabloid TV. The book keeps your interest and is a nice little find if you pick it up."},{"Title":"Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra","review":"Vendetta may be this Author's best work, if not his best known. The twists and turns are so sharp that those accustomed to novels may be nauseous before they get half way through.Events chronicled here are the genesis of many a conspiracy theory. I am reminded of the response from a notorious mafioso when I asked about 'organized crime'. \\"Don't fool yourself.\\" He said, \\"It isn't that organized.\\"Burrough goes to exhaustive lengths to bring the story to the page. The wild ride and incredible characters bounce from continent to continent, villa to yacht to back alley. The key individuals form a perfect personality storm for disaster, and disaster they produced.Saddest of all is Safra himself. Titan private banker to the stars, Safra's Achilles Heel was unwittingly pierced by Amex chief Jim Robinson with a petty smear attempt. Frantically seeking counter attack, Safra lashes out. This brings delight to the parasites teaming around Robinson's sleezy endeavor, who proceed to fan the fire and feed on the turmoil.Despite his genius, ability and drive, Safra's public life climaxed in a pathetic slap fight. Years later the He did not do well in that trip through the gutter, and his legacy may forever have deviated from its career-long steady course.Years after this book, Safra's life ended in a bizarre murder-robbery at the hands of his male nurse, in his villa in Monte Carlo. It was truly heartbreaking end which should have been a beautiful crescendo.Susan Cantor is an intriguing character, the product of conspiracy delusion and self-aggrandizement. Her work was well described in the book by (my cousin) her then-colleague Richard O'Regan, \\"She wasn't a journalist. She played at it.\\"But most interesting of all is the individual named Tony Greco. A true chameleon, Greco masters the energy between the opposing parties, and plays it to his advantage at every turn. While the titans battle, he steals millions form them. While Cantor conspires for her own silly career, he uses her every move to his advantage. After all is said and done, only Greco comes out ahead.Multilingual (to the point of being able to assume specific accents in several tongues), so international no on knows his home, Greco owns the game. Powerful chess pieces have no idea that he plays both sides. Tony Greco, or someone with his name and persona, shows up several times in opportunistic, criminal circumstances all over the world in the past few decades. But the actual individual was so adept at identity theft, or causing others to take his identity, it would be virtually impossible to find the actual individual now. Were he to show up, that's a biography I'd buy. Were I to meet him, it's one I'd write.Burrough takes on a well-researched ride in a stranger-than-fiction odyssey. Tough to put down, the book shocks with its exposure of the silly emotional folly of banking giants. Lacking somewhat only in its written structure, this is a great piece of work."},{"Title":"Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Saw There (including The Wasp in a Wig)","review":"&quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot; is, perhaps, not QUITE as good as &quot;Alice's Adventures In Wonderland&quot;, but it's close enough to still rate five stars. Not, properly, a sequel to the first book, there is no indication at any point in it that the Alice (clearly the same individual, slightly older) from this book ever had the adventures in the first one; there is no reference to her previous adventures, even when she once again meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Obviously, the two books are intended as parallel adventures, not subsequent ones.The most memorable bits from this book are doubtlessly the poem, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, as well as chapter six, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. But all of the book is marvellous, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a magical romp through silliness and playful use of the English language.(This review refers to the unabridged &quot;Dover Thrift Edition&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Saw There (including The Wasp in a Wig)","review":"I personally liked Through the Looking Glass even better than Alice in Wonderland. Though I first picked up this book with apprehension, (how could anyone possibly come up with still more nonsense after a previous book so chuck full of it) I was soon grinning with delight. It is every bit as weird and crazy as the original, but in a slightly different way. For it is not Wonderland that Alice visits this time, but a larger-than-life chessboard. Alice becomes a pawn and begins on her journey toward Queen-hood. Along the way she runs into many nursery-rhyme creatures, a few of which I recognized, and many more that I did not. Someone more well versed in this area will most likely find the book even funnier than I did. In fact, I liked this book so much, that I have just finished reading it a second time, and it remained every bit as funny as the first time. So, Wonderland lovers, go ahead and read this book.

Compares favorably to the more \\"adult\\" work of Calvino and Borges but lacks the floating, warm tone of the former and the dark enigmatics of the latter. These are philosophical and linguistic riddles wrapped up as a pair of children's bedtime stories. The sense of wonder, surprise, and curiosity is paramount here.Because the riddles here can be wrestled with by children, and because the imagery is so fanciful, this can make an ideal introduction to thinking laterally and metaphorically. Children do that anyway, but books like this can truly legitimize the process. Raising children with books like this does wonders to teach the habits of a vital, probing mind.This is also recommended for many kinds of adult readers. Those who simply love the play of words and language -- fans of Parlett'sTHE Book of Word Games, for example, will certainly love this. And those burnt out on the cynicism of much genre and literary fiction will be refreshed here by the atmosphere of curiosity and wonder. Those who seek to perceive what lies behind the commonplace will find much to wrestle with -- perhaps most notably because play is demonstrated as a legitimate mode of thought. And those wishing to revisit childhood -- indeed, there are few greater monuments in childhood literature -- may be flooded with nostalgia while turning these pages.

He shows us how our notion of &quot;dominion&quot; over nature is largely an illusion and looks frankly at the consequences of this illusion, now and in the future, without resorting to darkness and gloom.Mr. Eldredge is a very good writer for the layman and has a flair for transmitting a sense of wonder to his readers. His writing style reminds me of the late Carl Sagan. I especially enjoyed his thoughts on the biblical story of Genesis; how God's words regarding our dominion over the world have affected man and how we need a new story of who we are and our place in nature.Don't worry as you read this book about forgetting anything important along the way, because Eldredge provides a brief and complete review of his salient points at the end. You won't need that highlighter.I most sincerely recommend this easy-to-read yet scholarly book to anyone interested in ecology, evolution, and the future."},{"Title":"Dominion","review":"Eldredge brings his experience as an anthropologist to assess the present world. It's overcrowded, he notes, and seriously so. That's causing stress on the entire planet, stresses the Earth can no longer sustain. The reason for the pressure is that at some point, human evolution brought us to the point where we became detached from Nature. We abandoned the environment to create a new one. With the rise of agriculture and fixed settlements, we were on the path to becoming an ecological disaster. As the first species to accomplish full control over our own food supply, we broke the pattern of nearly four billion years of evolution. Without a precedent to consider, we simply forged ahead with little consideration of what we were doing. It's a formula for disaster.Agriculture, so fundamental to our existence today, was an innovation of immense consequences. It brought humans out of their previous wandering habits and settled us in permanent habitats. Instead of hunting animals, we corralled them in paddocks, to be utilised at our whim. From stone tools shaped on the fly for a limited number of tasks, we now created a range of implements to increase yields and produce items for personal use or trade. These elements led us to become \\"inner-directed\\". With this change in focus, learning the ways of the land, we simply made the land over to suit our needs. This is a momentous step in evolution, and while Eldredge is excellent at explaining what happened, there's nothing of the why. Coming from a palaeontologist, this should be surprising. In Eldredge's case, the reason is blatantly clear.In this brief summary of our history, Eldredge's passion has many faces. He's clearly concerned about the future of our species and the biosphere. He's eloquent in his descriptive passages. He's informative in giving his account of how science has addressed our evolutionary track. Various positions are stoutly defended [his], while others are scathingly treated. Since it's Eldredge, we are subjected to repetitive treatments of the theory of punctuated evolution [evolution by jerks] developed in conjunction with the late Stephen J. Gould. Gould and his selected colleagues have long stressed \\"culture\\" has swamped biology. We have abandoned our biological roots, they argue, and replaced them with cultural mores. Tools and society are prime examples, and agriculture employs them both to grant us our enormous power over nature.In his chapter, \\"Fashioning the Future\\", it would seem we might find solutions for the problems due to our innovative prowess leading to our break with evolution. Sadly, this is but partly true. Since no previous patterns of existence offer means of breaking our cycle of habitat overload, we must innovate further. The new methods, Eldredge contends, must overcome the natural pace of evolution - this after flogging \\"punk eek\\"! We have been \\"genetically engineering\\" domestic species for millennia. Now, we can fine-tune the process to accommodate our needs and reduce planetary impact. We can even apply such methods to ourselves. Beyond these biological questions, lie issues of \\"cultural homogeneity\\". Communication forms: radio, TV and the Internet, are already making inroads into cultural diversity. This \\"smearing\\" process will only increase, leading to broader applications of solutions to problems. \\"Band-aid\\" fixes are already being applied. These will likely be expanded from local through regional to global applications. It will, he concludes, likely require Draconian measures to implement them. One can only wonder which leaders will undertake the task.

He is a paleontologist and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. He is co-author, with Stepen Jay Gould, of the theory of \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" which explains evolution's non-linear genetics. So when we see phrases such as \\"agriculture declares war on our local ecosystems,\\" we need to take note. The central theme is that, with the development of agriculture, ten thousand years ago, man's population has expanded beyond a sustainable level. Our destruction of non-renewable resources, and our careless attitude toward biodiversity are likely to be the proximate causes of our own extinction. As for what can be done about this threat, he proposes to edit the book of Genesis: \\"The People decided to curb their population numbers. They determined to curtail evnironmental damage and the loss of other species. They decided to conserve the world's remaining ecosystems. And they embraced sustainable development, matching economic growth to the carrying capacities of their surroundings. The People lived. And it was very good.\\""},{"Title":"Dominion","review":"As you might have guessed, the first thing that came to my mind after reading this book (and it's a very fast read, so don't feel intimidated!) was how strikingly similar to the series of books written by Daniel Quinn (Ishmael, The Story of B, My Ishmael, etc.), making many of the very same points. The author even makes use of the Bible as support for his position that we developed a mythology of our proper place in the world (thus becoming &quot;homo magister&quot;, rulers of all the world).I certainly don't believe that the author intended his work to be so similar to the &quot;Ishmael&quot; books, but the similarities are striking. Given that this book was published 5 or more years after &quot;Ishmael&quot;, it seems reasonable that the author was influenced in some way by it.While much of the material covered is the same as &quot;Ishmael&quot;, this book is more straightforward (and perhaps, some might think, a bit drier - posh to that!), and complements that book nicely, dealing far more in the nitty-gritty ecological and genetic significance of mankind.In short, this book will not replace &quot;Ishmael&quot;, but neither is it eclipsed by it. The two books complement each other wonderfully, and Mr. Eldridge does a far more exhaustive job of explaining exactly how we are impacting the environment. Don't just get one or the other, buy both (oh yes, I'm sure Amazon is just thrilled to hear that :))!"},{"Title":"Dominion","review":"In his introduction, Eldredge asserts that we have to get beyond such myths as the assertion in Genesis that God meant man to have dominion over all of nature, and that stories are important. Much of the book reviews the science of paleantology, which the field of his discipline. But I saw little convincing connection between that material and the extinction of animals which existed in prehistoric times. He speculates that the cave man artists who lived at least 30,000 years before the writing of Genesis, painted animals as a symbolic means of gaining dominance over them. In the Afterward, he proposes &quot;A New Story&quot;, in which he ignores real history of human understanding of our place in the world. He offers no clear evidence of a connection between his exegesis of Genesis and the massive extinctions of species in our times. Perhaps he should read more widely and become aquainted with St Francis of Assisi."},{"Title":"How to Grow the Finest Marijuana Indoors Under Lights","review":"I have read many titles on the topic of growing marijuana, and this one takes the cake.

It was the first time in his 20 months on earth, that he sat down and paid attention to an entire book without trying to tear the pages, or without just simply finding something else to do. After I finished reading the book to him, and showing him the fantastic, real-life pictures, he was still sitting there waiting for me to turn the page to another picture of an animal. While my 20-month old enjoyed the real-life pictures, my 3 and-a-half year old enjoyed the reading, also. The author's words are informative, but not too deep or complicated.

For example, 'Goldrush' apple is not listed. Descriptions are very brief, probably due to space limitations.

After you hear this music, I guarantee you'll want to buy every one of her CDs that has been released.There is a power and raw emotional edge to her voice that sends chills down my spine and almost makes me feel as though she is singing directly to me. The tragedy of Eva Cassidy's life is that she was struck down by invasive melanoma at the age of 33 and we are left to wonder what might have been.Reading this book, which is loaded with family photographs, has helped to fill in the blanks of her life...I wasn't aware that she was also a talented artist. This is just a beautiful tribute to a pure-voiced singer whose life was cut too short."},{"Title":"Eva Cassidy: Songbird","review":"If you love Eva Cassidy's singing and you want to understand her better as a human being, &quot;Songbird&quot; is definitely a great place to start. Tastefully done, filled with life, friends, laughter, and lots of love, this is a beautiful book about a truly beautiful, talented, strong but vulnerable young woman.So who was Eva Cassidy? A woman with incredible talent, of course, and the ability to reach millions of people with that talent. But, as &quot;Songbird&quot; so richly details, Eva Cassidy was also a normal, complicated human being. A sensitive, shy person who loved art and nature. A perfectionist who could be extremely hard on herself and -- sometimes -- on others as well. A person who wanted badly to connect with others but found it difficult, even painful, to do so. A person &quot;filled with emotions&quot; but &quot;closed, really closed,&quot; as her friend Anna Karen Kristinsdottir described her. A strong woman but also a &quot;shy, afraid little girl that needed to be hugged.&quot; An intensely loyal friend. A person with a great future ahead of her cruelly cut down just as she was taking off into the stratosphere.Although performing in public wasn't easy for Eva Cassidy, thankfully she was able to overcome and share her musical gift(s) with the world. Wow, could this woman sing! From jazz and blues to folk, from gospel to R&B; and rock, Eva Cassidy could do it all -- with passion, with love for the music she sang, and with an incredible voice the likes of which don't come along very often.Some adjectives to describe Eva Cassidy's voice? How about: haunting, gorgeous, inspirational, tear-jerking, powerful, tender, melodic, eclectic, amazing, astonishing, heartfelt, intelligent, poignant, original, awe-inspiring, brilliant. I guess that's enough for starters! And if you think I'm exaggerating, I strongly recommend that, as you read &quot;Songbird,&quot; you pause now and again to listen to Eva's versions of &quot;Fields of Gold,&quot; &quot;How Can I Keep From Singing,&quot; &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;I Know You By Heart,&quot; and many others. If those songs -- and Eva Cassidy's life story -- don't send chills up your spine or touch you deeply, then I fear nothing ever will."},{"Title":"Eva Cassidy: Songbird","review":"Eva Cassidy, it is stated in the beginning of this book, was not an angel. She had the voice of one, as anyone who has heard her sing a note will attest. Struck down by malignant melanoma at the criminally early age of 33 in 1996, she was virtually unknown in America, though her career was starting to gain notice in other countries.The story of her life is told through the reminiscences of her family and friends. She is universally held to have been a very kind woman, but one with a wall within which she protected herself from pain by not letting too many people in. She had a very difficult time showing her vulnerability, and was extremely fragile in public performance. That we have as much of her on video and CD as we do is a miracle in light of this.Her relationship with her father was a difficult one, though it seems to have been moving in a more positive direction as she was getting older. Her father himself shoulders some of the burden for this state of affairs, indicating that being his child was probably not the easiest thing. Eva, being such a self-critical perfectionist, might have found it more challenging than most.I was heartbroken to discover that she loathed my favorite album, Live at Blues Alley. She thought the quality was not present, and it made her angry. This is the one I turn to most often when I need an \\"Eva Fix,\\" so knowing this made me incredibly sad. But then, she constantly doubted any compliments to her singing. She reacted to positive comments with disbelief more often than not. I'm glad she wasn't a diva, but sorry she didn't have some of the confidence she had earned.This book is chock-full of candid photos of Eva from throughout her life, and has a great many examples of her sublime artwork. I won't ever be parting with this, because I'll want to page through it again and again, to enjoy her visual talent, as I listen to her sing to me. Her voice has the pure, raw amazing skill to sooth life's rough edges. How sad that we didn't have her for a bit longer, but how blessed we are to have had her at all."},{"Title":"Eva Cassidy: Songbird","review":"Haunting and captivating.

It is happy, joyous, inspiring though sad and then uplifting all at the same time. The story is told by those who knew her best..family, friends, colleagues etc. in a very beautiful manner. It is not a gushy \\"we love you\\" type book, but rather an honest and frank appraisal of the short remarkable life of Eva Cassidy with the sad irony that the \\"fame\\" she would achieve came after her tragic passing from a melanoma related cancer..which is a lesson in itself.The fact is that she had this remarkable voice that belied her petite stature with a style that couldn't & wouldn't, at her insistence, be pigeonholed..at the cost of a few Record deals that she could have signed..particularly with legendary jazz label Blue Note. Such were her convictions and belief in her music which she sang from her heart. I first \\"discovered\\" her in 2002 when I had bought a Music Store here in Sydney (sadly it's no longer around). I have acquired her back catalogue since then. Her talents were diverse..her love of art and nature are well documented here by those who loved and admired her and she did frustrate a few people along the way too..but that was Eva.It's worth reading this book while listening to her voice as the story becomes all the more poignant. I recommend it Eva's fans of which I am one..but also to those who don't mind being uplifted by a remarkable story as this certainly is.

The pace picked up, but it is a deliberate pace throughout.The jacket had comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, but I did not really see that. Hiaasen's recent works have been peopled by characters that have become cartoonish and parodies. The characters in &quot;Deadly Sweet&quot; are far more plausable.The main players are believeable and the plot makes sense. The comic element that Hiaasen brings is not present here, and to me that was a major plus.It never becomes a fast read or a &quot;page turner&quot; in the strict sense. It progresses at a logical pace and the loose ends are tied up. The protagonists are easy to cheer for and it's easy to feel their losses along the way.I enjoyed it. However, I felt the Hiaasen comparisons were off base, but that was a positive. Maybe reviewers think any novel set in Florida is Hiaasenesque."},{"Title":"Generals Die in Bed (Definitions S.)","review":"This book takes in the experiences of a WW1 Canadian soldier during the mustard gas, lice, trench warfare, flame throwers, snipers, and other assorted horrors.At times, it is not an easy read due to the candid and almost non-descript accounts on the battlefield. He has little prose and even less flowery description - everything is to the point, which further reinforces the terror of all he sees. At certain points of the story, it can also be incredibly sad as well. Not an easy story to read.The description of his bayonett being stuck in a live german boy while his brother watches on in terror is one of the most candid and sad experiences ever read. As well, when Charles is wounded, it is written almost in a surreal fashion, as he hallucinates and falls in and out of consciousness.Pick this one up. It's a true account from the writer (meaning he was there), and it's a story that isn't easily put down."},{"Title":"Generals Die in Bed (Definitions S.)","review":"This is a seminal work, written and published before All Quiet on the Western Front, which bears a strong resemblance to it. The life of a Canadian soldier in the trenches of World War I allowed little room for nobility or love or friendship, filled as it was with rats, lice, poison gas, the ubiquitous stench of death and the few shattered yards of polluted mud which became his whole world. Written in the simple, flat style of Hemingway, this is a Canadian classic."},{"Title":"Generals Die in Bed (Definitions S.)","review":"This is the greatest book i have ever read in my life.

But after reading this, I think it's all a matter of context. When it's been used in other books, it feels like it's the author's arbitrary choice with no real message behind it. For instance, Wolf Hall. What does it matter if I'm \\"right there\\" in Thomas Cromwell's shoes? BFD! I wasn't feeling the urgency or importance of the tone (unless it was self-importance). However, using the tense with the subject matter of a Canadian soldier (Harrison himself) going from new recruit to embittered soldier to wounded and exiting the war was a better fit.This story predates All Quiet on the Western Front and A Farewell to Arms by a year (serialized in 1928, published in 1930 - a year after the other books), and while the anti-war theme is the same, I don't recall feeling so gut-punched when I read Remarque and Hemingway.Harrison's prose is sparse, practically skeletal, and it pounds at you. There's little light and joy, and when there is a momentary bout of pleasure it's quickly snuffed out by the war that must be constantly fed. There are no details given about the narrator beyond his age. You are meant to become him.The soaked earth here is nothing but a thin covering for the putrescence which lies underneath; it smells like a city garbage dump in mid-August. We are sunk in that misery which men fall into through utter hopelessness. (p. 54)How will we ever be able to go back to the peaceful ways again and hear pallid preachers whimper of their puny little gods who can only torment sinners with sulphur, we, who have seen a hell that no god, however cruel, would fashion for his most deadly enemies? (p. 101)During a trench raid, the narrator bayonets a German and can only dislodge his rifle by firing it. He captures two other prisoners (one is the brother of the man he killed), an act which earns him a medal and ten days' leave:I try to decide where I shall go, to Paris or to London, but the thoughts do not stick.The image of Karl, he who died on my bayonet, seems to stand before my eyes.The shaking becomes worse. The movements are those of one who is palsied.I begin to sob.I am alone.I am living through the excitement of the raid all over again; but I cannot relieve myself with action now.I do not think things now; I feel them.Who was Karl? Why did I have to kill him?...The questions press on my brain--cry aloud for an answer. I toss and turn in my searching. It does not come.It is better, I say to myself, not to seek for answers. It is better to live like an unreasoning animal. (pp. 125-129)Ugh. I hate that war above all others.There's plenty of action, but it's never glorious. A physically-decrepit recruit named Renaud is caught by a German flamethrower:Flame sputters on his clothing. Out of one of his eyes tongues of blue flame flicker. His shrieks are unbearable.He throws himself into the bottom of the trench and rolls around trying to extinguish the fire. As I look at him his clothing bursts into a sheet of flame. Out of the hissing ball of fire we still hear him screaming.Broadbent looks at me and then draws his revolver and fires three shots into the flaming head of the recruit. (p. 198)When soldiers aren't dying grisly deaths, they're falling into verboten conversations about the why and wherefore of the war at large. As they march past an ammunition dump that is exploding in the distance, they muse on the amount of money that's going up in flames:\\"I bet that dump going up over there must cost a billion dollars.\\"\\"And I'll bet somebody is making a profit on those shells whether they are fired at the Germans or whether they just blow up....\\"\\"Sure they do.\\"\\"Just think of all the people that's getting a big hunk of swag out of it. Shoes, grub, uniforms, bully beef...\\"\\"Sure, and I'll bet that those people don't want the war to end in a hurry.\\"\\"'Course not.\\"\\"...and they're all praying to God tonight for the war to last for ever while we're riding in this god-damned lorry...\\"\\"...and God must be listening to them. Look how long it's been going on.\\" (pp. 215-218)I thought this book was a perfect length for the style. It had a message and it delivered it, and in an unforgettable way. The final scene, tying in the sinking of the hospital ship Llandovery Castle with the narrator's blind vengeance on the enemy at Amiens, is a twist of soul-crushing irony and I closed the book feeling as I always do when I read about the \\"Great War\\": Depressed beyond all belief.(While I can find nothing stating at the Llandovery was actually carrying ammunition, it's obvious that Harrison's cynicism was such that he believed it.)"},{"Title":"Generals Die in Bed (Definitions S.)","review":"I liked the perspective and could easily see how a young man could become hardened to the cruelty of war.

What I remember about the book is that from the book I acquired this \\"insightful idea\\" : that as we learn our own culture we become a \\"prisoner\\" of our ONE culture. We become a prisoner because we only know ONE culture. If we only know ONE culture we have \\"no choice\\" but to \\"live and think\\" WITHIN that ONE culture. But, if we know two or three or twenty cultures we can then \\"free\\" outselves from living and thinking and perceiving in ONE way.

We become somewhat of an \\"overman\\" because we are \\"free to choose\\" among many cultural possibilities that people with only ONE culture cannot. And, we can become a \\"participant observer\\" among many cultures. We can choose how to live, perceive, and think among many more possibilities which gives us \\"more freedom\\" of action. This \\"insight\\" has freed me to choose \\"the best\\" aspects among many cultures thus enriching my life and giving me more choices about how to live my life.

Anyone interested in the history of anthropology or in Native American Indians will find this book a good read. It's a bit dated, but if you can let that go, you'll get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"Patterns of culture","review":"For generations of students and readers, Ruth Benedict's Patterns of Culture has served as a general introduction, not only to anthropology as an academic field of enquiry, but to our variegated diversity of cultures. The structure of the book is at once so simple, so compact, and so sharply outlined, that it never fails to impress the reader by its analytical rigor and logical coherence. The study of three sharply contrasting cultures--the Zuni Pueblos of New Mexico, the natives of Dobu in Melanesia, and the Indian tribes (mostly the Kwakiutl) of the American Northwest coast--form the core chapters of the book. They are bracketed by three introductory chapters and two concluding essays. The opening part insists on the role of custom in shaping human behavior, the diversity of cultural traits, and the coherence of a culture brought about by a dominating principle. The last two chapters make a plea for cultural relativism and for tolerance towards individuals who do not fit into the dominant social pattern.The diversity of cultures and the coherent pattern that they form are presented as the core message of anthropology. The argument is made stronger by references to other social sciences and by powerful metaphors. According to Benedict, all the possible human behaviors are distributed along a great \\"arc\\" which covers the whole range of possible cultural traits. Each culture then select along this arc a configuration of human possibilities that fits its environment and forms a coherent whole. The analogy here is with language and linguistics: \\"In cultural life as it is in speech, selection [from the inventory of physically available possibilities] is the prime necessity\\"--and capsulated in the famous Digger Indian proverb that serves as epigraph to the book: \\"In the beginning God gave to every people a cup of clay and from this cup they drank their life.\\" Another analogy is with psychology and medical science. The dominant pattern of each culture is compared to the categories used in psychiatry to classify human behavior. Schizophrenia, hysteria, and manic depression are not a bundle of disconnected traits, they form a coherent whole and allows the physician to make an informed diagnosis. Similarly, \\"self-torture here, head-hunting there, prenuptial chastity in one tribe and adolescent licence in another, are not a list of unrelated facts, each of them to be greeted with surprise wherever it is found or wherever it is absent.\\" A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.Each tribal society or primitive culture can thus be understood by its constitutive formula. As the author succinctly states at the beginning of each case presentation, the Zuni are \\"a ceremonious people\\"; the Dobuans are \\"lawless and treacherous\\"; and the Kwakiutl are \\"a people of great possessions\\". Each central chapter develops this fundamental principle stated at the outset, based on observations collected by prominent ethnographers--Franz Boas for the Kwakiutl, Reo Fortune for The Sorcerers of Dobu (and Bronislaw Malinowski for their neighbors of the Trobriand islands), and Ruth Benedict herself, as well as various sources, for the Pueblo Indians. The generalization about a culture's organizing principle emerges from careful observation, which should not be biased by hypothesis, thesis, or theory. There is a fine division of labor between the field worker and the armchair anthropologist. Benedict wants the fieldworker to be \\"faithfully objective\\": \\"He must chronicle all the relevant behavior, taking care not to select according to any challenging hypothesis the facts that will fit a thesis.\\" The anthropologist then rearranges this empirical material along theoretical lines. In a process of inference, he detects patterns and regularities in the observed behaviors and customs. In order to grasp the meaning of a culture as a whole, he first has to immerse himself into a sea of rites and practices, of myths and beliefs. But he also dwells in the realm of high theory, and he draws general lessons from his observations.Another way to express the dominant pattern of a culture is provided by the book's author through the categories of Dyonisian, Apollinian, and paranoid cultures. The Dionysian/Apollonian dichotomy is taken from Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy--and from Oswald Spengler, who substituted Dionysian with Faustian--, while the reference to the paranoid pattern of behavior is borrowed from Freud. The \\"will to superiority\\" which characterizes Kwakiutl culture could be linked back to the same authors. These categories were in the zeitgeist when Patterns of Culture was written, and the reference to literary works or to critical theory gives a cachet of intellectual sophistication to the description of primitive rites and customs.Like the social character of the Pueblos, Patterns of Culture is an Apollonian work, built around symmetries and written in a dispassionate tone. Upon closer examination however, this well-ordered structure shatters, and cracks appear in the edifice. There are contradictions between the bracketing chapters and the substantive part. In fact, Benedict doesn't fulfill the program she sets forth in the opening chapters, and she spends the last chapters dismantling it. The three monographs are self-standing and could well be read in isolation from the other chapters. But when replaced in the book context, they are at variance with the general messages formulated by Benedict. The appeal to tolerance and the celebration of cultural diversity (\\"the equally valid patterns of life\\" mentioned in the closing sentence of the book) are contradicted by the cruel and wicked ways of the Dobuans, or by the belief, shared by all tribal societies, that only their members are fully human while non-members are rejected outside the purview of humanity.There is a sense of jubilation, of perverse sadism even, by which Benedict describes the self-tortures that the Plain Indians inflicted upon themselves in their Dionysian quest for delirious visions. \\"They cut strips from the skin of their arms, they struck off fingers, they swung themselves from tall poles by straps inserted under the muscle of their shoulders. They went without food and water for extreme periods.\\" Similarly, she insists on the wickedness of the Dobuans that manifests itself in all their social institutions: in marriage and conjugal life, in agriculture techniques, in religious ceremonies and magic rites, in economic exchange, in death and burial rituals. \\"All existence is cut-throat competition, and every advantage is gained at the expense of a defeated rival.\\" People are all the more treacherous that \\"in ordinary converse the Dobuan is suave and unctuously polite\\".Apart from the question whether what Benedict describes really was true--and some descriptions seem to be marked by the seal of fiction--, we may note that the three cultures presented in the book were by no means stable and self-sufficient. As the last of the Digger Indians remarks, \\"our cup is broken now\\". The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico were just a shadow of their former selves. They had abandoned their walled cities and troglodyte housings long before the arrival of the white man, and were surviving on strips of desert. One may suspect that their formalistic insistence on rituals and ceremony, counting the number of feathers in their masks, was somehow directed towards the ethnographer, and for the tourists that were to follow in his path. Their culture was on the way to commodification, and would soon transform into empty forms destined for outside consumption. The Pacific Northwest Indians didn't even have this chance: by the time of Benedict's writing, their culture had already disappeared, and was only known through past observations. There was certainly a bent towards self-destruction in the gigantic potlatch and bonfires of the vanities that served as a substitute for war and exchange. Where intellectuals like Marcel Mauss or Georges Bataille, impressed by the descriptions of Franz Boas, saw the logic of a gift economy or the accursed share of culture, we may detect the last sparkles of a civilization consuming itself. As for the wicked sorcerers of Dobu, we know less about their highly dysfunctional culture, but one may detect they learned part of their treacherous ways from the white man, who tried to allure them into indentured labor.The claim that primitive cultures are \\"laboratories\\" in which the problems are set in simpler terms than in complex societies raises the question of what is really being tested in these labs: if even simple experiences on a small scale such as Dobu Island leads to such grotesque failure, then one can be pessimistic about the fate of our complex societies, where problems are compounded by size and scope. But Benedict's point in describing the bizarre developments of behaviors in alien cultures is to emphasize the queerness of our own. She practices the art of extravagant otherness as self-critique. If the Pueblos are formalistic, the Dobuans mean and treacherous, and the Kwakiutl ostentatious to the extreme, don't we all share these proclivities? The whole enterprise of describing these cultures, in three chapters absolutely crammed with detailed material of the most curious sort--Zuni passage rites, Kwakiutl chants, Dobuan residence arrangements--is informed with concerns rather close to home. The author focuses on topics that were of particular salience to contemporary Americans: marriage and divorce (the later being seen as a normal development), adolescence and entry into adulthood (reference is made to the \\"prevalence of the petting party\\" among young Americans), conformism and conspicuous consumption (\\"keeping up with the Joneses\\"). In the end, anthropology is seen as a moral science, and the detour through other cultures as a way to adjust our moral compass to new coordinates. Looking forward, Benedict writes, with a touch of optimism: \\"It is probable that social orders of the future will carry their tolerance and encouragement of individual difference much further than any culture of which we have experience.\\""},{"Title":"Patterns of culture","review":"I had to read this book for my writing about cultures course this summer. While this book is considered to be a classic work in anthropology, doesn't mean that it is easy or enjoyable to read.Benedict wrote this book with multiple writing styles that made it seem like the individual chapters were disjointed from one another. In chapters where she was not writing about what she knew like the introduction, she uses a very rigid, academic, jargon filled style that was near impossible to read even for an anthropology student. I had to read the first chapter four times to get anything out of it. Then you have the second chapter which is a contrasts with the style of the first chapter because it becomes more like prose with almost a poetic quality in portions especially when she tells the story about how the cup is broken.There is a lot of really good insight about the way culture was studied in the 1930s, and its also provides readers with a deeper understanding of Benedict herself, but there are some portions of the book that you just have to dig through and carry on."},{"Title":"Patterns of culture","review":"To put it bluntly, this book is garbage. The language is so dry and the tone of the anthropologist so condescending, it makes one picture Ms. Benedict smoking a pipe in an armchair of a library somewhere.This book should come under fire because Benedict let others do much of the research for her. This is a theme revisited in many of her works (i.e. &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;). She received much flack for it, as well she should.

They read like the jumbled fragments of a beautiful, disorienting dream. Fuentes offers glimpses of remarkable events - the firey fall of the Aztecs, the sexual death of a fading film star, a Roman siege - and makes their ugliness beautiful. All the while, he weaves a delicate web of connective tissue, turning 'The Orange Tree' into a remarkably cohesive tapestry of Latin American history and culture. Surreal, haunting and elegant, this book reads like a vision."},{"Title":"The Orange Tree","review":"There is a certain poetic fusion connecting the five novellas found in this fine book of short stories that is like a disconnected dream you might experience upon waking. Carlos Fuentes delivers his verbal barrage and assault upon everything that has created the modern Mexican. He delves into his historical replays with witty insight, carefully ripping apart the sacred past with tongue in cheek imagery that is funny and thought provoking at once. After reading some passages you will go back and read them again for the sheer eloquence and beauty of the masterful use of language. Fuentes says things in such a way that even things that should offend you are so profound in their simplistic articulation that you have to chuckle. Fuentes delivers his message in suttle ways but with an impact that gets under your skin, enveloping and seducing you in his recreations that are colorful and walk off the pages taking you on a wonderful journey as only he can. Even tough the stories are unrelated they somehow feel like the greater part of the whole. I found all the stories to be different, completly entertaining with the exception of one. This is probably my own personal taste but I had trouble getting into &quot;The Two Numantias,&quot; quite possibly because of my not being as familiar with the subjects. However, when Fuentes is talking about La Malinche, Cortes, Chapultepec, Cortes , the Spanish conquerors and the Aztecs, often in hyterically hyped imagery, the results are as familiar as frijoles and tortillas. Carlos Fuentes often writes in a hyper sexual mode as is evident in &quot;Apollo and the Whores&quot; where the sexual escapades are rated xxx but have an erotic texture that somehow make them less raw; besides his hilarious and outrageous narrative dominates and makes you laugh at the outlandsih scenarios. This book of five short stories is definitely recommended for someone not familiar with Carlos Fuentes. As one of Mexico's most brilliant and prolific writers, Fuentes demonstrates why he is one of the best Latin American writers. If you are unfamiliar with Fuentes this might be a good place to start since the stories are short and give a good indication of his writing style; if you don't like a particular novella you can always skip it. However if you do like Fuentes and want to read more than I would recommend &quot;Christopher Unborn,&quot; &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz, &quot; &quot;The Good Conscience,&quot; or more recently the epic books &quot;The years With Laura Diaz&quot; or &quot;The Buried Mirror.&quot; I'll end this review or suggestive prodding of you to read Carlos Fuentes by borrowing verse from a Fuentes scene involving two singers, one singing in Nahuatl another in Castilian.&quot;We've only come to dream, and the words flow far from the valley, into a distant sea where the silent rivers of life come to a halt. The narrative continues and the singing ends without ending: &quot;My flowers will never end,My songs will never end.I raise them up,I am only the singer.......&quot;"},{"Title":"The Orange Tree","review":"The Orange Tree is a book of unusual beauty. Fuentes, once again playing the historian, presents a reiteration of Latin American history which is utterly convincing as a piece of pure mythology. This perhaps lies in Fuentes' uncanny ability to assign either perfect charm or horrifying ugliness to so much of what he describes: the spectacular fall of the Aztec Empire; the complex seige of a Spanish city by the Romans; the dreamlike arrival of Columbus to a ambivilant paradise.The five novellas of The Orange Tree offer the reader voices which seem to speak from beyond life and history. We are presented tales of death and suffering in a context so huge, so ambitious, that Fuentes has destroyed the barriers of history and constructed a reality all his own. The lavishness of his vision is hypnotic.Read this book with abandon; allow its mythology to consume you."},{"Title":"Engineering Circuit Analysis with Replacement CD ROM","review":"I thought it was pretty good in terms of keeping the reader involved and encouraged.

The authors make the mistake of teaching the language in its romanized form, rather than introducing the Korean alphabet--Hangul--from the start. The Hangul alphabet is very easy to learn, and trying to teach Korean without introducing the words in Korean script is a serious, if not fatal flaw. The lack of a cassette guide is equally troublesome. Instead, I would recommend &quot;College Korean&quot; by Michael Rogers, Clare You, and Kyungnun Richards; published by the University of California at Berkeley."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Korean: A Complete Course for Beginners (English and Korean Edition)","review":"This is a great book in many ways.

It's absurd).The authors should re-release the book and scrap the romanisation, COLD TURKEY. Instead, package the tape together with the book and sell them as a unit, so students can learn the proper Hangul pronunciation that way.At the moment, I would say that the &quot;Korean Through English&quot; series (Hollym) surpasses this book.

Wilson is a most gifted writer with wonderful theological insight. I appreciate his taking high theology and organizing it into &quot;stories&quot; or narrative format that makes it easy to understand. The book is a perfect tool for the student or the non-Christian who genuinely desires to know God better. Wilson presents intriguing transitions for his subject content that alone educate and enforce proper doctrine. The subjects are precise, well-organized, and written with great informative skill. The book is not exhaustive, but enough to present the Jesus of the Bible in a conservative, honorable, and dynamic way that will leave any reader longing to know Him and Christian faith intimately. It is impossible not to see the core of Christian religion--Jesus--in a refreshing perspective after reading this book."},{"Title":"God So Loved the World: A Christology for Disciples","review":"One of the features of this book that really caught my attention was the handling of the Kingdom of God as it realtes to believers in Christ. Permeating a decent study of Christology is the theme that we are living in a pseudo reality. Jesus Christ is calling us out of it and into the Kingdom of God. Do not expect to find anything like a comprehensive presentation of Christology in this book, but you may expect to find a brief but intersting look at some of the central issues surrounding Christ, as well as practical suggestions for applying what was gleaned from those applications to your life."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"I'm a little bit of an oddball in that I've been making pies and tarts since I was in High School, and basically learned how through this book. The basic recipes for pie and tart crusts and glazes, found at the back of the book with step-by-step illustrations, have become indispensable favorites of mine. Martha is a big advocate of using a food processor to ensure that chilled ingredients stay that way, ensuring a tender, flaky crust that's fast and reliable, and I couldn't agree more, especially if, like me, you're working in an unairconditioned kitchen. The recipes for pastry cream and lemon curd are superb. Rather than using specific recipes for tarts, I usually bake one of the crusts (pate brisee, pate sucree or sucree extra or nut), use the recipe for pastry cream found in the recipe for the blackberry tart, and add my own fresh fruit and one of the glazes. Among the individual recipes, the apple raisin pie is a favorite I make every Thanksgiving, the Tarte Tatin is great, and I especially appreciate the recipes using Italian Prune or Friar plums, available in late August / September, my favorite fruit for pies and tarts. I just ate a Pear Frangipane tartlet this weekend, and was pleased to discover there was a recipe for it in this book, and look forward to making my own. One of my only complaints is that the recipes seemingly all use different-sized and shaped pie and tart tins, with no easy formulas for converting recipes to fit what you're using. Also, there's no recipe for a classic pecan pie. However, this book is a classic Martha Stewart effort, with the beautiful photographs and consistently high standards that go with that; it certainly has stood the test of time in my kitchen."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"Boy, to read some of the more negative reviews, it sounds like no one has any common sense when it comes to substituting ingredients. Come on, if something calls for winter banana apples and you don't have them, just use a variety you have access to! Same with the fraises, just use strawberries, same with Meyer lemons, etc. This book is good because it is so well illustrated and you have an idea of what your creation ought to look like, it is good because it provides several examples of what to do with each fruit where appropriate, and the pastry recipes and glazes work. The fact that she has an entire section devoted to apples is a good sign and should inspire bakers rather than freak them out. If you're unsure in the kitchen, DON'T start with pies and tarts, stick to cookies and quick breads until you have those mastered. If something looks complicated, either don't attempt it or make it less complicated and omit the chocolate leaves or roses, don't braid the edging on the crust, just do what is comfortable. Just because Martha Stewart has made her life out of domesticity doesn't mean she has an exclusionary agenda and that this book is merely an example of someone with endless means and access to ingredients. If that's how you feel don't buy her books only to criticize them."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"Well, the illustrations in this book are beautiful and Martha's pie crust, as well as her lemon curd, are absolutely the best, but the pies and tarts in this book are simply the worst I've ever tasted! Really, I've tasted kindergarten paste that had more flavor than these recipes. As a seasoned baker, I do know how to substitute ingredients and add more spice, but why should anyone have to? And what about those who can't? After all, the book is not titled, Martha Stewart's Exotic Pies and Tarts for the Experienced Baker Only, however, it should be. What good is a book if most people really can't use it? Yes, I can make all those lovely grape clusters, leaves and tendrils that adorn Martha's Concord Grape Pie, but I think most people are really looking for something a little more basic. Okay, final analysis: if you're looking for the out-of-the-ordinary (and the tasteless) then buy this book. If you just want some great pie and tart recipes, try The Pie and Pastry Bible. You won't go wrong there."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"I've tried at least 7 pies or tarts from this book and found the crusts, contents and compliments consistently excellent. Mom will not return my copy!"},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"This book is perfect. The recipes are basic, unpretentious and they look and taste like a million bucks. I got \\"Pies and Tarts\\" from Amazon years ago and it's been a favorite since. Friends have borrowed it so much that it's falling apart.Stewart's approach is that fruit pies should taste like fruit. They should be easy enough for everyday dining and they should make the most of whatever's freshest and in season. The recipes use a minimal amount of spices. The philosophy is one of restrained, everyday elegance.The pies here are intended to be shared with friends and family, so there is some focus on presentation and decorative treatments. The fruit itself is showcased in most of the recipes. For the bottom crust plum pie, the crust is just folded inward around the edges leaving a mostly open face, which shows off the plum filling. It's rough, but beautiful.The all-butter pie crust recipe is the star of the book though. Probably the definitive pie crust, period. The section is generously illustrated with photos so you can see the different stages of preparation, rolling and wrapping. If you've never had a handmade all-butter pie crust, it's completely different than anything you can get at the supermarket.For traditional recipes with lots of whole fruit, this is a great volume to get acquainted with the essentials of pie making.My favorite is the green tomato pie - with a little ginger, raisins, lemon and cinnamon. It's gooey, light and surprisingly delicate. I let the tomatoes drain for an hour first though, otherwise it comes out too liquid."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"Martha's pies and tarts are the best recipes I have ever tried.

They are not for the faint of heart, those who do not wish to practice, or for those who wish to use cheap ingredients. If one wants to bake a pie, it is going to be the satisfying WORK of love, just as is playing the piano. And both require practice. For those who don't want to put that time and money into their life's satisfactions, buy frozen pies and CD's.

Savory recipes are also included. I'm buying a copy for a friend who is a baking newbie- I think the clear directions and inspirational photography will lure her to the oven more often."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"I love how Matha Steward uses real ingredients, real butter real spices and real fruit, yet most of the ingredients are practical and inexpensive, with a few exceptions. I believe she uses both recipes from friends and family recipes that she made growing up, so a lot of these recipes have probably been baked and for decades before that book was published. One reviewer said the fillings were bland, but Martha Steward does use adequate spices and flavorings in my opinion, although after reading her review I would like to have Levy's Pie Bible too. I think Steward just does not like to make the pies too sweet, but I think her belief is that with good ingredients you do not have to; she likes the nice flavors that come from nature. The pecan pie recipe is not as sweet as some but I think she found a good balance; sweet enough for the sweet tooths and not too sweet for people who do not like things very sweet. I think she likes a more gormet pie recipe that is not so sweet. (If you want a sweeter richer Pecan pie recipe, I've had great results with the recipe from \\"The Joy Of Cooking,\\" 1960s edition)I like how Steward uses an all butter crust. Most pie crust recipes using all purpose flour call for all vegetable shortning and even though her recipe calls for regular all purpose flour it is still flaky enough with all butter. Its also helpful that she mentions other types of shorning you could use in place of or in place or part of the fat for a more flakey crust. I've also tried her recipe with a stick and a half of butter and quarter cup vegetable shortning and had good results. She really explains well and has some unique ideas. The only think I found was that the pie recipes might be better off halfed, as the proportions are generous. Also, I know substituting ingredients is common sense, but she should still say how to do so. For example, where it says vanilla bean, I use a tbsp of vanilla, but some people might be confused by that. She does usually tell you how you could substitute though. For her keylime pie, she says how you could use any lime. This is a book that makes everything completely from scratch though, which I like, but you may or may not find it time consuming, depending on how much you like to bake and how much time you have to do so. Still I suppose you could always use it for holidays. The only recipe that I am not sucessful with every time is the lemmon meringue, and that is my favorate. For some reason, I always mess up on that, but I could always do the keylime. My favorate recipe is her fudge pie (I've never made the cream aglaise with it, but its nice by itself). Its very rich and creamy, but its a nice treat to have once in a while. Also, since most of her pies are not loaded with sugar, are natural and are not too rich, they are a lot healthier than most store baught pies I think. If you eat a small pies in monderation I think they are even fine to have often (okay easier said than done, but if its halfed you wont have the opportunity to eat a lot if it)."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"I just purchased this book last evening. I received 3 of Martha's pie pans for Christmas and was looking for some new pies to try. So far the recipes do not look too difficult, they do look time consuming, but that's ok, I enjoy baking and trying new things. My only concern is that some of the ingredients are not going to be available to me.

I think that our generation needs to learn how they can make things themselves instead of relying on others to make them. However, I am very disappointed in almost every single recipe that I have tried to make from the Martha Stewart cookbooks. This particular book calls for some hard-to-find ingredients with no options for the people who can't find or obtain them.I realize that the people who bake these pies and tarts for the book are professionals and have had a lot of food styling done to them but what the average person is capable of making at home is no where near what you see in the book.It seems this book was printed as another tool to promote the Martha Stewart organization. It was not done to help the average consumer, like it seems the MS organization is portraying itself to be. This is a very disappointing book."},{"Title":"Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts","review":"My roommate (the baker of the household) owns this book. After making three different pies using Ms. Stewart's recipes, he has sworn off of this book forever. Sure the stuff looks great, but if it tastes like nothing, then what good is that? Her recipes use hard-to-find ingredients, and are not very well seasoned; one squash pie called for ground ginger as the only spice, and it was horrible - kind of like bland soap!

Hastings addresses the overlapping fields of sex therapy, sex abuse recovery, and sex addiction recovery, noting how therapists in one field may have only passing knowledge of the others. Hastings continues her championing of liberation from shame as the key to growth in all of these related areas. As she succinctly writes, &quot;shame needs to be elicited so that it can be discharged&quot;, and examples of this approach are abundant. She makes good sense in describing the unhealthy culture in which our repressions and addictions take root. &quot;Healing sexuality is far more than healing sexual problems&quot;, and the author gives numerous examples of distorted thinking and goals in sexual expression. Helpful analysis of flirting and jealousy highlight the maturity of Hastings' approach. Sometimes this book seems directed for clients, other times for therapists. The specific chapters detailing clinical issues (countertransference, arousal in the therapeutic setting, limit setting, therapist self-exploration and healing, for example) make this a particularly useful book for all counselors. There are quite a few case vignettes and examples of therapist questions to use with clients. A solid and admirable work that will benefit many therapists and the clients they serve."},{"Title":"Treating Sexual Shame: A New Map for Overcoming Dysfunction, Abuse, and Addiction","review":"Well written and readable with good case vignettes and courageous use of the writer's autobiography. It is apparently directed at other therapists but offers some embarassingly (now why did I pick that word?)elementary information about such matters as anatomy, so that at times she seems to be addressing a general readership. She is uncritical about some of her sources eg &quot;Acupuncture directly works on the energy channels&quot; and disdains statistical evidence. There is an index and references but no attempt to completely review the literature and other viewpoints are dismissed without full evaluation. On the whole I would recommend it to anyone working in the field but would want a neophyte to read a few other rhings."},{"Title":"Treating Sexual Shame: A New Map for Overcoming Dysfunction, Abuse, and Addiction","review":"I was expecting a book that would be more detailed.

Shame, we are discovering, is playing a much larger part in our lives than we had currently estimated.I was hoping this text would have some examples of the latest findings within the field of shame research, but I was disappointed.I do not consider this author an authority. I consider this author a writer of popular culture.... I found many of her comments to be shame-based.

It seems to be marketed towards working mom's but I am a stay-at-home mom with 3 kids under the age of three (we have a part time nanny) and I still felt as though I related to every word in this book. It is written with hilarious wit -- some parts truly hit home and were so funny that I actually marked the page to read again in the future just to give me a laugh. The book brings to light all the things that as a mom (working or stay-at-home) overwhelms and worries us as we try to stay sane while caring for our children and hiring help to give us \\"a break\\". The best is that the book points out the comedy and humor in all of it along with exploring the working relationship we have with our children's nanny's/regular babysitters.If I had to find something \\"bad\\" about the book -- it does seem to get a little wordy in the middle and the author seems to loose the wit and humor that got me pouring into the book. It also occasionally paints a stereotypical portrait of working mom's on the extreme side. For example -- the author states that when she took her kids to the park, even though she really didn't want to, she didn't know how to push them on the swings resulting in the youngest falling off... I thought that seemed at tad bit exaggerated. But when the book comes to a close the author picks back up her great wit and humor, leaving you smiling. Definitely read this book!

While no nanny is perfect (though she must be a million different things), neither is any mom. I am confident now that together with my husband, our nanny and I will raise my son with love and laughter.

I had a strong idea that I wanted to raise my own (taking time off of my career), and this book confirmed it. There are pros & cons to a career hiatus, and this book illustrates it...again and again."},{"Title":"The Perfect Stranger : The Truth about Mothers and Nannies","review":"I wanted to read this book after reading a review in O Magazine. The topic was of interest to me but I thought the book would be more along the lines of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". This book is really a \\"how to...\\" for new mothers who will have a Nanny working for them. While well written and informative, the mindset is disturbing.I should say that I am about 10 years older than the author. I am a professional (nurse), educated woman with 3 children ages 20, 18 & 15. I was a stay at home mom (during the week) when my children were young. I worked weekends & holidays to help out financially while they were small. Now that they're older (2 away at college) I work as a school nurse and I teach a parenting class for expectant couples. I should further say that my work has always been a \\"job\\", not a career because my work does not define me. Here's what bothers me about this book and this mindset in general.First, while some of the book reviews for The Perfect Stranger mention it being a guide for women who have to return to work, some for financial reasons -(those women probably couldn't afford a nanny) - The book actually speaks mostly to professional, career women who are returning to work for their personal fulfillment. (Needing to work so you can afford to live in Manhattan, summer in The Hamptons and buy $75.00 baby dresses is not financial need).Next, and more troubling, is the mindset of the author and the mothers she interviews for the book. The proper lip service is paid to being a mother, caring about the child, loving the child but the actions of these women speak louder. At several points in the book, various mothers are quoted as saying how important it is to find a nanny you're comfortable with because after all \\"they are watching your most valuable possession\\" like it's a purse. In fact, as I read, there were times I thought if you substituted the word \\"child\\" with \\"puppy\\" this sentence would read the same. EX: \\"For a while, when I (mother) would walk in, Emma (baby) would want to stay with Gloria (nanny) if Gloria was holding her, and that was hard, a little bit. But I didn't get overly distraught; I knew Emma was like an amoeba, and she was happy being in the warm arms of whoever was holding her\\". This is a mother talking about her baby! These same mothers express dismay at the realization that they are paying someone to love their child.(Most nannies are making minimum wage). There appears to be a lack of trust, or is it realization, that no matter how much you pay the nanny & no matter how much the nanny does love the child, she can't really love them like a mother would.There are examples of the use of nanny cams where one mother catches her nanny stealing large sums of money from her husband's stash, and she actually hesitates firing her. \\"You rely heavily on this person, and you don't want to go through the pain and agony of finding a new nanny\\". The author speaks about her own guilt when she traveled extensively and she \\"worried about the toll it was taking on the kids\\". But all was well when her 5 year old presented her with a picture he made when she was gone with the headline \\"The Advenchers of Mi Mom\\". The author was pleased it didn't say \\"Mi Mom, The Sellfish Absunty Bich\\". Astounding! As if it was the child's job to make mom feel better. She speaks of her choices \\"because those couple of hours a day (plus entire weekends) I do see my kids are delicious, as soul-feeding and character defining as work could ever hope to be\\". She mentions the rhetorical question 'why have children if you're not going to raise them?' but she never answers that question. It is the question all of us who have raised our own kids would like answered.The guilt we all feel for the choices we make as parents is based in us knowing, in our core, that what we're doing or have done is wrong. Babies need their mothers, as do children and teenagers and even grownups. When you \\"choose\\" to have a child the focus is suppose to shift from what's good for ME to what's good for the child. I could not find one example in this book where that principal was being played out consistently. The mothers total focus was on themselves. Hire someone to do the day to day mothering, provide the money to buy every \\"thing\\" a child could want and get to call yourself a mother. Not bad.What these children are missing out on will become apparent the older they get (but I have a feeling mom & dad will blame the nanny). Babies & children need stability - maternal/infant bonding is essential to that child being able to establish bonds later in life - yet many of these women dismiss the nanny on a whim as if it will have no effect on the child. What these mothers are missing out on is something you can never get back. All the things that are in the day to day \\"job\\" of parenting (and it is extremely hard work)are what makes you a mother.I find it disturbing that so many parent's see children as adornments and not people. During the classes I teach the question of \\"how do you get your life back?\\" is asked repeatedly - and these people haven't even had the baby yet. As a school nurse I see daily reminders of the neglect of children - no baths, no breakfast, lack of sleep, kids begging for attention, sent to school sick because mom & dad had to work - and this is at a wealthy, private school not an innercity school. Working women will continue to try and kid themselves that hiring someone to raise their child is just a \\"choice\\" and it doesn't really matter who raises the baby, as long as someone does, but they're incorrect. The ability to leave your baby with a virtual stranger speaks to a lack of bonding on the part of the parents and the more you do it, the easier it becomes.A few years ago someone described parenting to me this way \\"it's like a bank, you make deposits then you get the rewards\\". In almost 21 years of parenting I find that to be true. You reap what you sow and it really is all \\"quality time\\"."},{"Title":"Greece 1971","review":"This is such a beautiful book!

V. Morton's books I've read, although I own one or two others. I suppose I must be slow on the uptake or too busy reading other things, not to have read further. This book was five stars all the way. I've still got the taste of the dust in my mouth.Being something of a neophyte in matters pertaining to modern day Israel or ancient Palestine, or vice versa, I was thrilled to find myself in the hands of a gifted travel writer on this first armchair journey to the Holy Land. Morton knows how to, how shall I say it, maintain a religious sense in his work without allowing the reader to detect just how religious (or irreligious) he is. It's quite clever. Anyway, there is much biblical reference, almost always referring to the geography through which we pass, or the local architecture. For instance, his description of the Temple fascinated me. I must say it gave me a hankering to go to that part of the world, which is partly what a good travel book ought to do, methinks. Otherwise, I just enjoyed the writing. Very rhythmic, fluid text which is easy to read and tends to sweep one along, almost inexorably. I really shall have to dig out my other Mortons (on the British Isles) and have a go at them. Great read if you can find it, which shouldn't be too hard: he was a very popular and widely published author in his day."},{"Title":"In the Steps of the Master","review":"H.V.

I'm tempted to say now that things in the Holy Land may have changed more in the 73 years since this book was published than they had in the nearly two millennia since the time of Christ. Twenty-first century Jerusalem, in particular, is a very different place from the dusty settlement Morton describes. No one, I think would mistake \\"In the Steps...\\" as a particularly relevant guidebook today. And yet...There are elements of the Holy Land that maybe never change, and most of the holy sites Morton visits -- certainly the more significant ones -- are still accessible to the modern pilgrim or curious tourist, and the shape of the land and the setting of Jerusalem or the Sea of Galilee remain as Morton describes them.That, I think, is the real value of this book. Morton is an excellent travel writer, and anyone who appreciates well-crafted descriptive prose is in for a treat with (I'd venture, based on the two volumes of his I've read so far) most anything he's done. As I noted in my review of \\"In Search of London,\\" Morton seems equally at home describing both the modern condition and the history of a place. Add to that, in this case, his facility with Scripture and his skill in pulling relevant details out of the Biblical narrative, and this becomes a great way to prepare for a trip and/or to assess what you've seen.The several modern guidebooks about Jerusalem and Israel I read were good for details.

Morton's \\"In The Steps Of the Master\\" when you have, at least to some extent, traveled in Morton's own steps. This gifted 20th century travel writer writes like a painter--you can see what he is writing about as clearly as if you were there too. His knowledge of the complex history of what many people call the Holy Land seems encyclopedic, and it seems he has visited all of the sites and taken you along. His encounters with the many peoples of the Palestine Mandate--for he wrote this book before the foundation of modern Israel-- are memorable. The people he hears from range from the Zionist who sees his people's salvation in tractors to the ultra-Orthodox Jew who trusts only in God. There are many non-Jews as well, memorably including a British police officer (and his English setter dog) who Morton meets in 100-degree heat in Jericho, well below sea level. Temperature or no, the officer plans to go shooting with his dog. Back home, tweeds were what one wore to go shooting; so tweeds it is here, too.This is one of the funniest passages in the book, although its subject would have seen nothing funny about it. It helps one understand the British Empire a bit better; people who would not pass out while wearing tweed in a desert landscape are a hearty stock. Perhaps, since Britain's imperial heyday, they have weakened.I have no trouble giving this five well-deserved stars."},{"Title":"In the Steps of the Master","review":"H.V.

Nothing particularily about Bill's life stands out about the book as it is all very interesting. Bill did separate from his wife of twenty-some years in 2005. The book goes into a lot of detail on his father's coaching career."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, especially given David Halterstam's track record of in-depth exploration of his subjects. I am interested in football, coaching, success, and ways to motivate and educate. Unfortunately, this book falls short of the mark. It reads more like a fan's guide to a coach's family background than it does an examination of Bill Belichick's unique methods of achieving victories on the football field. Indeed, Belichick's apparent limitations in the personality/charisma department would seem to lend themselves to detailed exploration of how he has done what he's done with the New England Patriots. But if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to wait for another author to take up this subject. Halberstam's work disappoints."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"As always Halberstam thoroughly researched his topic and provided an informative and interesting book about an individual who has fascinated NFL fans for several years.

The trajectory of Belichick's life goes something like this: son of a coach, never wanted to be anything but a coach, surrounded himself with others who wanted to be coaches, became a coach. There just isn't much else there, and without additional insight into his personality, the book is basically an extended version of Belichick's resume. Halberstam's writing is, as always, very readable, but the editing of the book seemed a bit weak. There are several sections that are repeated almost verbatim in different parts of the book. Perhaps when the subject is as dull as Belichick, one has to repeat what few good anecdotes are available to try to make the book more interesting..."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This Halberstam work reminds me of John Grisham's Bleachers.

The first part of the book on the early years of Bill Belichick is way too long and uninteresting. I feel that much of this material was included because Bill wanted his father Steve to be more remembered and appreciated. For the reader it made that part of the book too long and uninteresting. Also the book is a bit dated now seven years after it was written and thus it does not include a lot of more recent events and challenges. I did get a good appreciation of Bill's work ethic and knowledge plus how he chooses players with skills and to remain under the salary cap. In looking at the acknowledgements I see there was practically zero contributions to the book from his players and this was probably a rule that Bill set-up for the author to do the book. How can you do a book about Bill Belichick without interviewing Tom Brady? It cannot and should not be done that way. Bill is still in the middle of his continued accomplishments, I hope that someday a bigger and more comprehensive biography of his life will be done with greater cooperation from Bill."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Bill Belichick is respected, not loved, in my neck of the woods. I know it is different elsewhere. Far and wide he is loathed. He is depressively catatonic in most press conferences, and his conspiracy to surreptitiously video the New York Jets has definitely gone down on his permanent record. But even his critics give him great measure as a football coach. Here I agree. I'd say I have never seen a coach so able to prepare his team for games yet at the same time be so able to adjust at half time to whatever the opposition had going for them. [As I kid I grew up on Lombardi - I just don't remember that many games when they didn't dominate from the start. Mind may play tricks.]In David Halberstam, Belichick met a well versed and able biographer. A bit slow and turgid and perfunctory at times, but most of the artifice was used to gain good narrative. Halberstam's \\"The Education of aCoach\\" gives you a great view on the inner game of football, where scouts roam from game to game, and assistant coaches wander from town to town, like rambling blues men.. or Fuller Brush men.Halberstam's depiction of the lives of professional and college assistant coaches in the \`60s and \`70s, when football was far less central to the public life, is moving. Belichick comes out of this antecedence.The life of the sports plugger described starts with B's father, a Navy asst. but a true scion of the cult of football. It proceeds with Bill as he uses his brain to go from nowhere (the Colts, the Lions, the Broncos, the Browns) to the top ( the Giants, Jets and Patriots). B is too enigmatic to ever emerge from the pages of a book. But he does love football, and shares enough with the author to form a touching tome.Along the way, a good bit of fatalism. \\"The more you can do, the more you can do*\\" is the motto - I think a closeup of Belichick letting go of a long time stalwart might have been leavening. But the author did well to get as much of the underside of football heroics as he did.Where the book begins to fade is when the story gets good - when the Patriots win three Super Bowls. The timing is just not right on the routes on this part of the book. It is tough. Because it is hard to avoid over dramatization in short format.What was it that made Tom Brady special? \\"Determination to excel, high intelligence, inner toughness.\\" Probably true. Just not good copy. And the first Pat's SuperBowl win, in these pages, is all about Brady, when in fact, there was a full team around him, defensive and offensive. The story compresses too much. {Funny thing, though, here, in 2012, Brady is the last player left from those teams.} But the probably value is that Halberstam did some real digging: the stuff before the Super Bowl years is the stuff that - most of us - don't know.No, Belichick is not colorful - hence the picture chosen to accompany story is Johnnie Unitas in the Colt's hedays. But Bill is thoughtful, and interesting general.The buildup of \\"The Education of a Coach\\" is well paced, but the climax is anticlimactic. My guess would be that anyone who likes football books, but who is not irretrievably put off by Belichick would like it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"The biography of a great football coach can be a yawner. But not when written by David Halberstam. This short study of two men, Steve Belichick, Bill's father, and Bill Belichick, the current Head Coach of the New England Patriots gives the reader deep insight into two men who eat, sleep, and breath football, and into the craft they have chosen. This biography inspires deep respect for father and son; their integrity, their professionalism and their commitment to the sport and the teams they coached. But the book does much more than make the reader feel good about a pair of sports heros. This book brings the reader into the inner sanctums of professional football, into the film review room, into the team meetings, onto the playing field and into the huddle where the reader learns the intricate craft of coaching and playing, and the multiple skills that makes the game so exciting to watch, play and coach. This short text is a lesson in professionalism, and a training manual for those who wish to explore the complexity of the game, and how to watch it with an understanding the average fan has great difficulty in acquiring.For every fan of the game of football, whether a supporter of the Giants, the Colts, the Cleveland Browns the Patriots, or the Navy eleven, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"As an avid Pats fan, I was hoping to learn more about the comraderie and strategy of Coach BB and his Pats organization, including Mr. Kraft. Instead, there are alot of pages devoted to Bill as he grows up the son of a coach, his days in college, his relationship with Parcells, and the debacle he went through in Cleveland. His Croatian roots & work ethic shine through, as does his supreme preparation and confabbing with Ernie Adams, his longtime friend & adviser. Still, it leaves a fan wanting to know more about the many personalities & difficulties worked through when NE won 3 out of 4 Super Bowls."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This is the second book I have read about the Patriots, the first one was Patriot Reigns read my review). I recently became a Patriot fan coming from New York, it was extremely hard. So, I started to read up on the team. I always admired Belichick from afar. I thought he was a little weird but brilliant and a sort of grumpy old guy.But the more I learned about him ,the more I liked him. And the Patriots are an extension of his personality. The things I greatly admired about Belichick are: his preparation is beyond comprehension- like when he interviewed for the Cleveland job, he took binders with him to the interview, a one year plan, a two year plan and so no and a overall plan to win the Super Bowl.When coach Weis left for Notra Dame , he was preparing for it the last 2 years - in his world nothing happens by accident, you prepare for everything, he is never surprise because he is prepare for all occasions. And He is the anti-thesis of the TV coach or as David Letterman said, he looks a sherard sheep man. He is serious and has the absolute dedication to his craft. HIs work ethics are legendary, he is a workaholic and in his system there is no such thing as entitlement but a system of meritocracy, you earn what you get.What not to like.The book is very well written, I thought it was going to be dry and boring but it was anything but. I learned so much about Belichick, his father , the scout that taught him at an early age how to break down film. His high schools years where he play football but everyone knew he was not all that talented and his prep school and college years where he played center.What I got from the book is that here is a man who from the very beginning knew what he wanted to do, there have been so many cases where children of sports or entertainment or whatever didn't not want to even touch their parents vocation because of wanting to create their own path but Belichick loved, breath and live football and with the glory came the consequences, the book said that after 28 years ,he got divorced from his wife.I loved the book because it shows where he started, at eight years old with his dad going to games and scouting and his various experiences especially his love-hate relationship with Parcells a real ahole) who mock Belichick and nicknamed him Gloom and in front of everyone told him that he will never be a coach not today not tomorrow or ever. After three Super Bowls, I bet he is eating his words.Belichick terrible and valuable experience in Cleveland where he became one of the youngest coaches and got fired. His lessons were great: too be more media savvy, to be more patient and to make sure that the owner was on board, with the Patriots owner Robert Kraft gives him carte blanche to run the team as he sees it and the results speaks for themselves.The book touches upon Brady and how the union was perfect, with Brady- Belichick is a genius and Brady- Belichick is a superstar, if fate didn't put them together, I guess the history book would have been different, Brady is also a very interesting person who out of nowhere became this elite quarterback, the book goes into that . I could write more but if you interested in reading about someone who is a poster child for what America is about-Belichick is it: hard work, preparation, no glitz just what you see is what you get, total dedication to craft and passion about work, that is Belichick and David Halberstam did an excellent job of capturing him.On a side note, I admired Halberstam too from afar and always wanted to read one of his books, is sad that he died in an auto accident, he was truly a very rare individual, an intellectual who loves and wrote about sports so beautifully. He will be truly miss."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"While I'm an unabashed Patriots fan, I was hoping to read more about Belichick's time with the Giants and his first head coaching stint with the Browns. Halberstam does a decent job discussing Steve Belichick, and how he handed on his love of coaching football to his son. The book then goes into decent detail of Belichick's time at Andover. From there though, the book becomes uneven, glossing over some details when he was an assistant coach. As another reader mentioned earlier, I would have liked to read more about Belichick's interactions with not just Lawrence Taylor, but also other Giant defensive players of that era. Still, it was an enjoyable read overall."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Books talks more about his life and not so much as how he breaks down X's and O's."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I'm not sure what the book's intention was, but be prepared to read more about life events instead of football related events.

After all the accusations,both accurtate and inaccurate,the book offers an insight into the man who has accomlished so much. Those who hate the team, hate the coach,love the man, and/or love the team should read this book to gain an understanding of Belichick and the pressures of being a successful head coach in the NFL. It's interesting to read of the people behind the man both in the past and today. Looking at the run the Patriots made in 2007 and the super bowl loss, one has a greater apprecciation of the accomplishments and failures of the man who created a true \\"team\\" after reading The Education of a Caoch."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"\\"The Education of a Coach\\" ranks towards the top of the genre I call \\"sports profiles,\\" because writer David Halberstam chose to focus on football and coaching, rather than on Bill Belichick's personal life.This authorized biography contains the usual background that includes Belichick's childhood with special emphasis on his father, Steve, who was also a football coach. It was Steve who allowed his son, Bill, to help him break down game films for the Navy football team when the youngster was still in elementary school.From this early beginning Halberstam examines the younger Belichick's career and those mentors who influenced his thinking and strategies. While making this run through Belichick's career Halberstam breaks down the coach's strategy for a few big games. As a St. Louis Rams fan I enjoyed the dissection of Belichick's ideas for shutting down Marshall Faulk in the Super Bowl.The Education of a Coach does not allow the reader to see much of Belichick outside of his persona as a student of football. Though Halberstam writes in some depth about Navy coach, Steve and his family, there are very few sentences relating to the family of the Patriots' coach, leaving the reader to wonder if Coach Bill has any kind of life outside of football. (My guess is that this omission is at the insistence of the Patriots' coach.)If you enjoy football, you will probably like this book. If you enjoy the personal details that often provide filler for such profiles (such as this player likes to eat waffles and spaghetti every day of training camp and loves the smell of a dead skunk), you will likely be disappointed by Mr. Halberstam's efforts.\\"The Education of a Coach\\" does not put a human face on Bill Belichick, but it does relate some of his philosophies on what it takes to build a winning football team."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Once again, David Halberstam displays his gift for getting to the heart of the story. This book is a terrific--and rare--look into the life and work of a man, Bill Belichick, who has achieved remarkable success in a field known for its parity. But rather than focus on X's and O's, as football books tend to do, Mr. Halberstam dives deeper into the story, including a brief history of the Belichick family, the scouting prowess of Mr. Belichick's father and many other insightful anecdotes. And as an added bonus, Mr. Halberstem actually discusses Mr. Belichick's right-hand man, Ernie Adams, a man whose presence is shrouded in mystery--even among Patriots players."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"When David Halberstam stops writing about sports--God delay the day--he will go down as one of the great English-language sportswriters of all time. Rarely does a writer on serious topics, and he writes on sport as a most serious enterprise, excel in such varied genres as political history ('The Best and the Brightest') and sport.This first deployment of the author's considerable skills on American football is the literary equivalent of a successful Hail Mary pass. Offered late in the game with but perhaps one chance to win the battle, a high-risk throw is tossed into the air with the hope that somebody down there might make the unlikely victorious grab.The reader does.Bill Belichick, the now-legendary head coach of the New England Patriots teams that dominated the NFL at the midpoint of the new century's first decade, comes under Halberstam's gaze. This cerebral, obsessively disciplined anti-celebrity with his passion for building a team on good value from the ground up is not at first glance a compelling subject for a professional biography. Yet Halberstam's gift is for discerning just how a key persona decided to move against the grain of a profession's received wisdom without necessarily calling attention to his methodological heresy.Quietly building up 'Belichick University' while traversing the serial failures that are the calling card of professional coaching and coaches, Coach Belichick built a different kind of team and did the Thing that can almost not be imagined: he changed the NFL.As he tells the story, quickly convincing his reader that it is a fascinating tale that merits his readers attention even as civil wars, terrorist alarm, and global warming conspire to argue that sport is an irrelevance, Halberstam scatters observations and knowing turns of phrase that leaders of any profession are likely to find invaluable.Even if you thought the Patriots were a missile defense system, read this book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I bought this book because I lived in Boston during the time of the by-now-fabled Patriots season when Brady subbed for Bledsoe during the 2001-02 season. I watched with some fair amount of panic, hopefulness, and wonderment as Brady wobbled a bit in his first few games and then hit a stride that he's rarely lost pace with since then. (Except their woefully sad end to the 2006-07 season, with their loss to the Colts because their \\"Wait until the end and win it\\" strategy finally fell short against the more consistently strong Colts.)It was clear to me then that the Belichick-Brady-Kraft Family-Patriots thing was something pretty special for Belichick to keep Brady in even after Bledsoe was well enought to play again (taking quite a chance with the fanatical sports fan-dom that exists in New England), keep the team focused, and win the Super Bowl that year.I knew it was a matter of some basic things like a really good coach, a really good team of players, and a really smart quarterback who didn't get mentally or emotionally rattled all that much. And an owner who let the coach be the coach (unlike the situation in Oakland, where I now live).But I wanted to know what really went on behind-the-scenes and in Belichick's mind to make all this happen. How in the world did he do all that in 2001-02 and since then??I don't disagree with the reviewers who have shared their reviews before me. Yes, the detail and history on Belichick's past, including his amazing father, are great. You get some sense of who Belichicck, the man behind the work, is--about as much as you would get with a man who's as quiet, humble, and private as he is about his internal life and family. You'll get some sense of Belichicck's work and training in the context of the college and NFL worlds. You'll learn about the in-depth, mind-reading like talent of a man who can easily read the defense but without ever losing sight of the offense.But you won't get any sense of the leadership skills in the man. Or how he worked with Brady and the rest of the team to keep them focused in 2001-02. Or how, through a long and grueling season, he keeps everyone focused enough to perform at such high levels of play. And that's what I'm really interested in, as my work involves organizational development, training, and group dynamics. The book is also pathetically short on details of the seasons after 2001-02.Ultimately, the book is strong on the past and pre-Patriots days of Belichick (although still not sufficient in describing the dysfunctional but functional relationship between Belichick and Parcells; but, then, who could ever do that?!). The weakness and lasting detraction is the omission of true insight and stories into Belichick the man/coach and sketchy descriptions of post-season play by the Patriots. It's like the Cliff's Notes version. I hope one day someone else will be able to more fully capture the mind, heart, and commitment of Coach Belichick."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Good book about how Belicheck became Belicheck, his coaching experience and a few good stories about the Superbowl victories with NE and the Giants. I would have liked some more information about his relationships with Parcells, Mangini, Crennel and even Pioli."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"The first half of the books reads like Genesis. The book starts out with Belichick's father and takes us through every job he ever had and introduces us to every other coach or scout he worked with or knew. The process is then repeated with Bill himself. Once all the begats are over, the author finally starts to talk about Belichick's ideas and philosophies. Here is where the author really misses. He doesn't convey or even seem to understand what makes Belichick an exceptional coach."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Halberstam does a nice job explaining how Bill Belichick became a great coach and what drives him. In light of the passing Bill's father Steve, this book is a tribute to his father, a great coach and strategist and what Bill picked up from his father on how to win. Most people think of Bill Belichick as part of a Bill Parcells coaching tree. But this book explains that Belichick is the Paul Brown to Parcells' Lombardi and how Belichick built relationships and learned to build an organization on his way to becoming a coach that wins games by breaking down an opponent as opposed to imposing his will on the opposition.I would have given the book another star had it gone more into Belichick's personality. But Halberstam told sportsradio WEEI hosts that Belichick did not want this book to be about an ego trip for him. It's too bad because Halberstam never caught Belichick with his guard down. You have to think that Belichick really doesn't want anyone in the public to know him too well. It's almost as if there is an ending waiting be written. You don't find out about Belichick's relationships with Charlie Weis, Tom Brady, Bob Kraft, et al.Still, it's a great read. You do get enough to understand the contempt Belichick has for Art Modell and an understanding of why he left the Jets and Bill Parcells to go to New England. His decisions, his confidantes, his championships all make sense after you read this book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"5+ starsJoan Vennochi, a political writer who rarely writes about sports said this of Bill Belichick. \\"Belichick, she noted, wasn't 'glib or glitzy'. At press conferences he sometime seems a little goofy and is often way too grim. But he is a leader without the swagger, selfishness, and pomposity that so many men in business, politics, and sports embrace as an entitlement of their gender and posture.\\"This is not just a book about a man, or just about a coach, or just about a game, or just about football. This is a book about a man, who is a coach, who happens to love football, and the manner in which this man leads his life. David Halberstam, who has written his twentieth book, the last fourteen of which have been best sellers; and the last six, based on sports, has written the coach's coach book in \\"The Education of a Coach\\". He has been able to dig deep inside of this man, Bill Belichick. The man who has come to be known as the best professional football coach of our era. And, the fact, that this man coaches the New England Patriots, is the icing on my cake.Bill Belichick is the son of a man who is known as one of the best football scouts of his time. Steve Belichick has molded his son to not only follow in his footsteps, but to lead the way. Steve taught his son to break down a football film so acutely that he knows, understands, and can recite to memory every play made in that game or any game. Bill grew up loving the game of football. He went on to Andover where he met his best friend, Ernie Adams, who, to this day works with Belichick. Together, they have the bid on the history of and every play ever made in football. Why is this important? Because you can pick apart every mistake and every nuance of the opposing team. That is one method Belichick uses in his winning team. The Rams/Patriots game that won the Patriots their Super bowl, was according to ESPN's Ron Jarowski, the best coached game he has ever seen. \\"Belichick, he goes on to say, is the best in the game today, maybe the best ever\\".Belichick is known as a quiet man, too quiet, not at all flamboyant. Dressing in gray, trying to be as private as he can be. Difficult, as the media first thought. Hard to draw out. A star who did not want to be a star. Unfortunately, 40 million people wanted to know all about him, and the team he coached. His life is football, and he dedicates most of his waking hours to that job. He has his best friends as his coaches. They are the \`Best and The Brightest', as the author of this book would so eloquently say.In 2005 Bill Belichick and his wife quietly separated after more than 20 years of marriage. They have three children whom Belichick loves and spends as much time with as possible. But somewhere, the game of football became too much for the family and now Bill is alone. Known as the best football coach in this time, compared to Lombardi and Landry, his name will go down in history.David Halberstam has brought knowledge and the power of football to this book. He tells us how one man was able to build a team from practically nothing, to win a Super bowl in two short years, and then go on to win 2 more Super bowls to give us a glimpse of this genius. We learn how luck has played a part in this history. The luck of drafting Tom Brady. How Tom plays the game, and how Tom Brady has become one of the best quarterbacks of his era. How has this man built a dynasty, and the Patriots may be called a dynasty. How the old work ethic from the western, steel mills of Pennsylvania has played a large part in the growth of this man. His background, his culture and the \\"stuff\\" that helped to shape this man. A brilliant book, one every sport fan should read. Insight into the working mind of a man who is on his way to becoming a legend.Steve Belichick died this fall. His son took one week to mourn, then back to football. Afterall, that is what life was about for both men.Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Considering the oustanding work Halberstam had done with The Teammates and Summer of '49, I was highly anticipating this release since first hearing of it months ago. And while it turned out be enjoyable, I just feel like there's so much more that could have been explored or explained.The first part of the book dealing with Bill's dad, Steve, was the part that I found the most interesting. I knew that he's always been considered a superior scout, but it was great to see how he got to that point. Same goes for Bill's entry into the coaching ranks, and the preparation he did even before then to make himself into the great coach he would eventually become.Where the book fails, in my opinion, is in its exploration of relationships. It talks somewhat of the Parcells-Belichick relationship, but there seems to be a lot left unspoken. Same with that of Parcells and Kraft, or Belichick and his current coaches, or even guys like Weis and Crennel who only recently left.Halberstam has given what I believe is a look at only one slice of Belichick's life, and there still seems to be room for a more complete look at this great coach. I'd like to hear more first-person comments from other coaches, former coworkers, and current or former players.I definitely recommend this book, both for the look at Belichick and because Halberstam is a pleasure to read. However, don't expect to learn much about the coach himself, as that will likely be left for another book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"One of today's great authors, David Halberstam, has written a gem of a book detailing the \`process of becoming Bill Belichick,' one of the best football minds ever in the National Football League (NFL). Belichick is the head coach of the New England Patriots NFL team and the winner of three Super Bowls.Halberstam tells us that Belichick entered the world as the son of a lifer. He was the son of former Navy football coach and scout, Steve Belichick, who was once considered the preeminent football scout in the country. His father, however, never made much money and never enjoyed much fame outside the \\"hermetically sealed\\" world of coaching. And he lived (as did the family) with the special uncertainty of a coach - a world without guarantees. Steve felt the job of a good coach was to encourage a boy's better self, to let his confidence grow and to do it ever so gently.Bill Belichick, well beyond his years in understanding football, went on to Weslyan, a small college in New England. While he played football, he had difficulty, as his size and lack of speed worked against him. He also played lacrosse and enjoyed it immensely, mostly because he admired the coach. The coach had no real knowledge of the game but knew exactly how to handle his players and how to listen to them and use them well. He learned then that players respected coaches who could help them play better and who knew things they did not know. Respect did not flow from a loud and commanding voice, but rather knowledge.\\"The Education of a Coach\\" also details Belichick's early years in the NFL. When he entered the league, he had been a young man teaching older men. He needed to prove to them he was an authority figure so he remained more aloof and more authoritarian than most coaches or teachers working their first jobs. And since he was not imposing in physical terms, he would have to make up for his size by dint of willpower. He was most comfortable with a stern game face - being serious and completely disciplined. Many wondered if there was a time when Belichick ever laughed and relaxed.Over the years, the back-channel word on Belichick was that he was a brilliant coordinator but doomed to be that and nothing more. When he got the New England head coach position, Belichick knew that this might be his last best chance.Halberstam details key relationships and turning points in Belichick's career including the complicated relationship he had with Bill Parcells, one that was beneficial but different for both men; a defining moment with the Giants Gary Jeter when Jeter issued a challenge to a young Belichick, with Belichick granting his wish to Jeter's regret; the impact of Al Davis' rating players everyday to keep both players and coaches alert allowing no one to rest on the past; and many of uncommonly talented men who had been wonderful teachers.Belichick is driven by brain power and by his fascination with the challenge that pro football represented to the mind of the coach as well as the bodies of the players. And, along the way, Belichick, a lifer, has always understood and taught that residence at top was a product of good fortune as well as talent, planning and willpower.Those interested in Bill Belichick, the emergence of the New England Patriots as a NFL powerhouse, leadership development, or professional football will thoroughly enjoy \\"The Education of a Coach.\\" Halberstam captures this and more."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"David Halberstam is one of America's finest journalists. But he's not on top of his game here. A pity: The Bill Belichick story is amazing. The New England Pariots coach has defied the zeitgeist and put together a genuine team at a time when sports are dominated by superstar egos. He has built a dynasty in an era of tepid parity - when last season's Super Bowl contender is gutted by free-agency and misses this season's playoffs. He is bold and innovative in a sport where most coaches favor cover-your-butt tactics. As an Indianapolis Colts fan, heartbroken almost annually by Belichick's genius, I was looking forward to learning how he does it. And Halberstam (whose The Breaks of the Game is my favorite sports book) seemed the right choice to tell the story. But \\"The Education of a Coach\\" fell well short of my expectations. Halberstam skims the surface instead of digging deep and sometimes makes odd authorial decisions. In writing about Belichick's disastrous tenure as Cleveland Browns coach and his unpopular decision to bench QB Bernie Kosar, for instance, Halberstam neglects even to tell which quarterback replaced Kosar. And yet he feels it necessary earlier in the book to take a gratuitous swipe at a 1950s Nashville Tennessean sports columnist whose role in the Belichick saga is peripheral at best. He barely mentions key characters such as Belichick assistants Romeo Crennel and Charlie Weis - and touches only briefly on the young acolytes who are graduates of \\"Belichick University.\\" Throughout part of the book, Halberstam cuts back and forth between the story of Bill Belichick and the story of his father, a legendary coach and scout in his own right. But the time-fractured narrative is confusing and repetitive. Sometimes you get the sense that Halberstam doesn't really understand football. An anecdote about a \\"chop block\\", for instance, is almost incomprehensible and made me wonder if Halberstam knew what he was talking about. There's still plenty to like here. I especially enjoyed a mini-profile of Belichick's buddy and assistant Ernie Adams - a true football nerd (like Belichick) who as a teenager once barged into an opposing high school team's locker room after a game (still in uniform) to get the coach to autograph a copy of \\"Simplified Single Wing Football.'' Bill Parcells emerges, as I long suspected, as a complete (but talented) jerk, whose relationship with Belichick was painful but mutually beneficial. Halberstam also does a good job describing the treacherous politics of coaching football - and how even the best coaches can be undone by events over which they have no control. Overall, this book gives you a good general idea what makes Bilichick so successful. What's missing are the detailed anecdotes and authoritative writing that usually are Halberstam trademarks."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"First of all, a personal note: as someone who's been watching the Patriots religiously since age 11 (the not-so-glorious, mercifully short-lived Rod Rust era), I probably can't lay much of a claim to objectivity when reviewing this book. But, I'm going to try it anyway, so you may want to consider the source.Now, that having been said, David Halberstam's The Education of a Coach is one monstrously enjoyable and interesting read. Centering around current New England Patriots coach and three-time Super Bowl champ Bill Belichick, it's not so much a biography as an examination of what's propelled one man to the top of the notoriously difficult profession of football coaching. Halberstam hasn't set himself an easy task, as The Education of a Coach is a book about a football coach that clearly aims for a much larger audience than fans of the sport--hardcore football freaks will occasionally have to put up with explanations of relatively basic concepts like blitzing--but it's still worth reading for all the insight that Halberstam brings to his subject. He's not so much examining the nuts and bolts of football, as there are plenty of books you can already turn to for that; nor is Halberstam aiming to provide a complete summation of Belichik's life in the sport, as several years of his career (notably his tenure with the Jets) are more or less glossed over. Rather, what Halberstam is going for is a view of the qualities that allowed Bill Belichick--who never played professional football and had a mediocre stint as coach of the Cleveland Browns before taking the Patriots' head job--to succeed where so many other smart and dedicated men had failed.One of the best qualities of Halberstam's sportswriting is his ability put everything he writes about into some sort of larger context, and The Education of a Coach is no exception. By now, everyone who's paid attention knows that Belichick's father Steve had a profound influence on his son's career path, so the book starts in Steve's formative years, allowing the reader to get an idea of the experiences and ideals he passed along to Bill. There are sketches of some of the other key players in Belichick's coaching life as well--longtime assistant Ernie Adams, Giants mentor Ray Perkins, and of course Bill Parcells and Tom Brady most notably--but again, all of the biographical details feed into the larger purpose of illuminating the harsh realities of modern-day pro football and the staggering demands placed on its coaches. Football, especially now, and especially at the professional level, is a game of contrasts: the influx of black athletes starting about fifty years ago and intensifying since has made the sport faster, tougher, and harder-hitting, but at the same time it's acquired a level of sophistication that would've been inconceivable back in the days when football was little more than a glorified brawl. Pro football is now in an age where 300 pounds isn't even considered heavy at some positions, where a quarterback like Michael Vick can be the fastest guy on the field *and* toss the ball 50 yards with a flick, and where coaches sleep in their offices as a matter of course. In other words, the job of a coach has become professional in every sense, with those who climb to the top of the ladder pretty much obligated to devote their lives to little else.What Halberstam especially tries to hammer home is the way Belichick, against the backdrop of football's geometric growth in terms of complexity and precision, managed to create a team that could function as a cohesive unit, especially given all the pressures in the direction of mounting individualism, namely big-money contracts and incredibly saturating TV exposure. Now, Halberstam does overstate his case somewhat in trying to posit Belichick as a uniquely successful proponent of the team concept--the last three NBA championships have been won by the Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs, who are also known for their unselfish ethic--but his lengthy illustrations of Belichick's successes (and failures) as a coach still go a long way toward illuminating what goes on behind the scenes in pro sports. In the later chapters, Halberstam finally gets to the philosophy that enabled Belichick to turn the Patriots into a dynasty in an era where the NFL does everything it can to discourage extended dominance. Not only does Halberstam address some of the team's more effective in-game strategies (the kind that made the Patriots seemingly the only team able to regularly stop Peyton Manning, this year's game notwithstanding), but he describes in depth the New England organization's emphasis on getting the kind of players who coud be relied upon to carry out those strategies. Granted, many of the most important contributors to the team's current run--Willie McGinest, Ty Law, Adam Vinatieri, and Troy Brown among them--were carryovers from previous regimes, but what's most notable to Halberstam is how these players were made to mesh with new additions, many of them castoffs from other organizations, to create an efficient, businesslike group that valued the end result (namely winning) above all else.What enabled Belichick to become such a stunningly singular success in such a challenging field, Halberstam discovers, is the rare combination of a mind ideally suited to coaching, a background ideally suited to developing that mind, and an obsessive work ethic ideally suited to making the most of his intelligence and training. Belichick followed a career path many of us normal people would consider insane-despite a degree from Wesleyan that clearly provided him with plenty of options, Belichick spent his first few years after college on the bottom rungs of the professional football ladder, working long hours at unpublicized jobs for little (if any) pay. But as Halberstam makes clear, even at that early point Belichick demonstrated the incredible memory, adaptability and attention to detail that eventually put him on the top of the NFL's coaching heap. Belichick has earned a reputation as the most analytical of coaches; Halberstam shows a similar gift for analysis by putting into perspective just what such a description implies and what's necessary to achieve it in the first place."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I picked this book up with great expectation which initially was met. And I learned a great deal about the man and some quite inteesting anecdotes. However, the more I read the more irritated I became with the many repetitions, some revisiting the same scene within pages.I think Halberstam has produced a very good draft against the standard I expect from him. Either his editor was asleep at the switch or he rushed the project. In either case, I don't think it serves his subject well and certainly does not reflect the discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail which are hallmarks of Coach Belichick."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I don't normally read biographies of recent championship winning coaches because usually they are puff pieces to allow the coach to cash in while he is still hot. When I saw that this book was written by David Halberstam however, I decided to risk it. To mix metaphors, this was certainly not a home run for Halberstam. My main criticism of the book is that Halberstam seemed to fall in love with Belichick and portray him as a super genius even from his earliest coaching days. This grows tiresome quickly. The back story about Belichick's father is interesting but he too is portrayed as some football savant. There is very little to balance the love-fest, but fortunately the book is well written, as you would expect from Halberstam, and short enough to hold your attention."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This is the same author that wrote the \\"Best and the Brightest\\", a book that I read decades ago, that is even more compelling today in view of our country being stuck in Iraq, which is not all that different than Viet Nam. That book was the story of the men that John F. Kennedy chose to accompany him on that magnificent journey of a 1000 days, a journey that ended in the sad destruction of Lyndon Johnson's administration. Whatever subject Halberstam chooses to write about becomes compelling after reading just a few lines of the book.Here he tackles the subject of Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, and how this man has created a sports dynasty in an age where all the rules were designed to discourage such a creation.The author's words flow like poetry. Even if you are uninterested in the subject of the book, it is still compelling. There are a number of reasons to read a book like this, which may be far removed from your own area of expertise, and even normal interest.Great learning sometimes involves people going outside their expertise. In doing so, it can make for great discoveries, and finding a fascinating idea or concept that a person would never think of for themselves in their daily work. Whether that work is being a Nobel Prize winning researcher in string theory, or a gent that builds cars, the bottomline always seems to be the same. These people can then bring these new ideas, and learnings into their own circle of competence, and appropriate it for what it is they are doing on a daily basis.In this book, you learn about getting the edge on your fellow competitors. You learn about dedication, focus, and execution. We may talk about execution in business, but in business or government, it might take years before you know the results of the project you are working on. Not so in the world of sports. You make an adjustment on a football team like Coach Belichick, and you might know in 30 seconds if you look STUPID.Usually wherever I am I have a selection of books with me. I read on average, about a book a day. Fortunately, my work allows me this luxury. Actually when I think about it, I am better at my work for the reading than if I did something else. This is probably true for you also. We read because we are compelled to read. I read the Education of a Coach while flying cross-country, and literally couldn't put it down, that's how Halberstam GRABS you as a reader.What is absolutely fascinating to me is Coach Belichick learning at his father's knee about football. The father was a scout who really did not make it as far as he should have in the world of football. He did have a studious and willing son who is the subject of this book. The child was desirous of learning everything his father could teach him. I am reminded in many ways of the relationship that Tiger Woods had with his own father.Just listen to a few words that Halberstam writes of the values that the father instilled in the son, \\"You worked hard. You saved. You did not waste anything. If possible, you grew your own food. You did not complain. You did not expect anyone to do anything for you. Discipline was not so much taught as it was lived, as an essential part of life for which there was no alternative.\\"This is reading folks, compelling reading. Learn how a masterful football coach learned the game, and taught a team how to play the game. This is the real thing, and Halberstam is at his best, when writing about what's real. You will love this book, even if you don't like sports.Richard Stoyeck"},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I bought this book primarily because it was on sale. I like reading books about NFL coaches in general because their stories are extremely interesting and often hold some interesting life lessons. One of my previous reviews was a brilliant biography on Vince Lombardi. This was not that.I had the feeling that David Halberstam wrote this book to fulfill a publishing contract. It seemed at times scattered and uninteresting. I know that Bill Belichick is considered to be a personal and not so exciting guy, unless maybe you engage him in a discussion about football. This book embodied that for sure.It took a while to finish this book and in fact I dropped it to finish another more interesting book then picked this guy up and struggled through. There are some points of interest but frankly that is what squeaks it out a 3 stars, really it should be 2.5. I recommend this only to hard core Patriots and Belichick fans and maybe to people who like to read stories about the NFL but be warned it's not well written."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"That this hagiography takes on such an unworthy human as Belichick is bad enough; that is serves as one of Halberstam's last works makes it a dark stain on the career of one of our greatest investigative journalists. Belichick cheated in his marriage by carrying on an adulterous affair with a married member of his front office staff; cheated his team by forcing injured players like T. Johnson to play after having a concussion (and thus probably caused brain damage); and cheated the game by \\"Spygate.\\" For those who say that every team cheats, I say that no other team has ever been accused, let alone caught doing such a despicable practice. And, of course, the proof is in the pudding - his supposed \\"perfect team\\" led by Saint Tom Brady, has not won a Super Bowl since...Halberstam's legacy has been tarnished by his having produced such a poorly investigated, Scholastic Reader-level project and he and Belichick's father (who by all accounts was an honorable and respectable person) must be rolling in their graves to see what a low-life, despicable person the subject of this book truly is."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I consider Bill Belichick to be this era's Bill Walsh; all-emcompassing genius combined with non-stop work.I wish that this book had covered Bill Belichick the man; not an idealized version.The book is basically is a big, long, suck-fest for Bill Belichick. But there is some interesting tidbits in there. One thing that did not get into the book is anything that could possibly show Bill Belichick in a bad light.Like his little games he plays with the injury list.Like the phantom injuries his players come up with when defending against the Colts no-huddle offense.Like the tantrum he threw on National TV (8 Nov 05) where his team was getting blown out on Monday Night Football and he threw the red replay flag onto the field just to stop the game and get a free time-out. When advised that he would be penalized for throwing the flag without actually asking for a review - he then asked for a review of a play that was not questionable at all. This wasted about four minutes of National TV time."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I read this book. Decent book about football, BUT...In September 2007, it was found out that the Patriots had been illegally videotaping the sidelines of opponents. This is illegal in the NFL, and Patriots coach Belichick knows it. It basically is not just a violation of the rules of the NFL, but also is a violation of trust. It violates the NFL and the team and all fans and players. The NFL should take back the three rings the Patriots supposedly \\"earned\\" in their Super Bowls. This team is just a bunch of criminals in my view. They have deceived us all. I personally think that this massive breach of trust (using the word \\"Breach\\" brings to mind another deceiver, traitor Hanssen, who sold out the U.S. and the FBI). I am not saying Belichick is on that level, but what he did was a massive breach of trust. If the NFL in 5 or 10 years has lost out on its status as a \\"clean\\" game, and \\"America's game\\", we know who to thank: Belichick and his Patriots. I hope he is in prison by then. Hopefully a federal supermax. From now on, I hate this team. I hope they lose every game. Go Colts (and whoever is playing the Patriots) ! [by the way, Patriot fans: last year, you guys cheated and you still couldn't beat the Colts - a team that is far superior to you guys, morally. Think about that one !].BTW, I know the argument that \\"everyone does it\\". But it is not correct, because \\"everyone\\" didn't videotape it the way the Pats did.

After reading this book, I'm further convinced. I also understand his personality better, too - why is why who he is, a man with not much personality.The story of his dad Steve is just as interesting as Bill's football career. How father-and-son are so alike and so knowledgable about this game, is explained well by the book's author David Halberstam. Yes, that's the famous Pulitzer Prize-winning author.To be honest, Halberstam is definitely biased for Belechick. You have no problem seeing how much regard he has for both he and his father, so this is not as objective as it could be. In Halberstam's eye, the Belechicks can do no wrong. The parts about Steve, I thought, were the most interesting segments of the book, along with the comments about what happened in Clcveland when Bill coached the Browns.Despite the fanboy attitude, overall, I thought it was a good portrait of a unique man. This is not your run-of-the-mill coach; he's different, and the book will explain why. As a \\"character study,\\" alone, I found it a pretty entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I read this book several years ago, and reread it recently after reflecting on the \\"Spygate\\" drama of the past year. I found the book very insightful the second time around. David Halberstam was an incrediably gifted writer who was able to truly get into the mind of his subjects, and this book is a great example of that. He starts by offering insights into Belichick the boy, and how his formative years, watching his father working for Navy, helped mold the man who heads the New England Patriots today. It offers interesting insights into Belichick's mindset when he participates in his always vague press conferences, his secretive manner, and why he is both respect and hated by his players and his peers. Fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I know I bought this used so I did not expect the book to be perfect."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I think this book provided me (at least) with an excellent background of Belichick, effectively filling in the parts about him I didn't know about. I've been a strong Pats fan since Kraft bought the team.While this book did contain a lot of factual material, I feel it suffered from \\"Fluff Stuff\\" or excessive rants about Belichick and/or his coaches, influences, etc. If you removed the \\"Fluff\\" I think it would be down to about 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"David Halberstam's latest masterpiece allows readers into the life and times of New England Patriot's head coach Bill Belichick. Halberstam elegantly captures the nurturing bond that Belichick shared with his father, the passion for football that he developed as a youth and the determination that drove him to 3 Super Bowl championships. This is a must read for all sports fans."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I've read several of his books (although this was my first sports book of his) and I highly enjoyed them. Maybe it's because the subject is just not a very interesting person, but this book is just terrible. He tells us material that contributes nothing; who cares about about his grandparents and his wife family? He also gushes about the subject and his family. Is everything really so great? It's as if he chose an average person at random and wrote a biography about him. The average person doesn't lead a particularly fascinating life and the resulting biography would be dull. Just because he is a success as a coach doesn't necessarily make him a good candidate for a biography."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"\\"The Education of a Coach\\" by David Halberstam is a decent biography of New England Patriots coach Bill Bellichick. It is not the most engaging read, but there is a consistent charm the author uses throughout to convey the personal and professional attitudes and beliefs of the most renowned football coach of the present day.This book is perhaps not as insightful or entertaining as other Halberstam books such as \\"Summer of 49\\" or \\"The Coldest Winter.\\" Part of this can be attributed to the fact it was written while the subject was still in the midst of his career. There is nothing in the book about his professional career that isn't common knowledge for sports fans. That is not to say that the writing is boring, but it doesn't carry serious revelations about Bellichick's incredibly successful career.For a New England Patriots fan there is not much new information, but the author's description of Bellichick's career in total is pretty good and consistent with the title. Halberstam was definitely attempting to show the progression of a wildly successful career from humble origins to international recognition. In this regard the book has good continuity, although there were a few stylistic choices that I didn't particularly enjoy.The beginning of the biography seemed to jump around to multiple different eras. Halberstam goes from Bellichick's father Steve and his formative years to Bill's run in several consecutive Super Bowls. I could see that the author was trying to break up the format of a traditional biography in his use of temporal transition. This was not poorly written, it is only that I prefer a linear format opposed to one that is scattered.Although this was a bit confusing for me, I still enjoyed the main points concerning Bellichick's family and the coaching tradition that was passed from father to son, and all the values that go along with it. In that aspect the book is as much about football as it is about work ethic and general attitudes towards life.As the work progresses, it becomes much more linear and shows Bill's rise through the sports world.This was quite interesting and gives a good picture of the networking and intense labor professional coaches put into their jobs. It was slightly confusing in the way there were so many transitions as Bill moved from team to team. This was informative for me, and also showed the reality of football life in regards to the term \\"football gypsy.\\"The segments with the New York Giants and Patriots are probably the best part of the book, although they do not show any astounding revelations, as Bellichick is quite a private person, especially since he is still coaching in the NFL and was not likely to divulge any secrets of his success. A fairly entertaining book, but slightly under some of the authors other classics."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"David Halberstam is best known for his award-winning history narratives on the Viet Nam war(Best and the Brightest) and Korean War (The Coldest Winter). However, Halberstamhas written some eminently readable books on sports. His writing is characterized by in depthanalyses of the key personalities of his topic be it history, politics, or sports.Education of a Coach is only 270 pages. It is about Bill Belichik and pro football.And, in the Halberstam style of writing, it starts with an engrossing story about Belichik'sgrandfather, an impoverished, illiterate Croatian immigrant who leaves his wife andfamily to find work in America. The immigrant becomes a coal miner and his sonbecomes a respected college football scout. The grandson, Bill, is a good football player,high on intelligence and passion for the game, but low on talent and speed. Footballinjuries at a small college (Wesleyan) prevent him from going any further as a player.But he loves football, and persuades Ted Marchibroda to take him on as an unpaidassistant to review football film for the Baltimore Colts..This book is really about the football coaching fraternity and Bill Belichik's extraordinarypersistence in learning the game. Low pay, humiliation, failures are an essential part of hiseducation as he slowly ascends each level of the football hierarchy. You see how hard he worksand you are silently rooting for him to succeed. The core of this book is Halberstam's depictionof Belichik's uncanny ability to analyze the opponent's offensive weakness. His patientabsorption of football knowledge comes from established coaches and teachers. He learns whatset George Allen and Paul Brown apart from their contemporaries - their exceptional attentionto detail. And then he is shaped by his own experiences and failures. These insights would beoverlooked by most sports writers. After all, Belichik is a colorless, low-key and unlikeableintrovert and any book about him alone would be boring. But Halberstam's book is far from boring.Personal glimpses of his stormy relation with Bill Parcells, Lawrence Taylor's impact on footballstrategy, and the rise of an unheralded Tom Brady are well-known to most pro football fans.Football junkies are attracted by the glitz and glamor of pro football. However, there is littleglitz and no glamor either in this book or in Bill Belichik. Yet it remains an absorbing book forthose who want to understand why some football teams are consistent winners. The average fan isfascinated by the outrageous personalities of the player celebrities and the intoxicating elixirof following a winning team. The complex mechanics of the game, the arduous preparation in gamestrategy,and the system that is devised that leads to a winning team will be too deep forimpatient fans. The missing ingredient that I wish Halberstam would have discussed in more detailis the chemistry between Belichik and his players.When Belichik finally gets his chance as head coach of the Cleveland Browns, he fails, and he failsbadly. He returns to the New York Jets under his last previous head coach, the volatile Bill Parcells.Parcells became furious when Belichick, his defensive assistant, overrules him andcalls a blitz thatParcells opposes. When the blitz works, Parcells lets go. He yells at Belichik over an open microphone,shocking everyone who hears it. \\"You're a genius -everyone knows it, a goddamned genius. But, that'swhy you failed as a head coach - that's why you'll never be a head coach --- some genius.\\"But, Belichik gets one last chance when the New England Patriots give the head coachingjob to him in 2000.. At age 47, he hand-builds a team with no obvious stars, but whose playersare intelligent, teachable, and can function in the Belichik system in which the individualis subservient to the team. The under-appreciated part of the book are the young assistants that hegrooms (and who are now emerging into the upper echelon of coaches and general managersin pro football.) Two years later, to everyone's surprise including Belichik's, the New England Patriotswin the Super Bowl - their first ever - by upsetting the St Louis Rams who were heavily favored by 2touchdowns. And he knows and his coaches know that his team wasn't that good.As the game ends, Belichik hugs his longtime friend and assistant coach Ernie Adams and blurts\\"Can you believe that we won the Super Bowl with this team?\\"Ron Jaworski who analyzed the film after the game, called it the greatest coaching job that he had ever seen.By 2007, after 3 Super Bowls and one 16-0 season, Belichik's reign in New England has been labeled a DynastyYou have a front row seat as Halberstam lays out the Education of a Coach."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"As a biography of Belichick this book is a decent read. As a vehicle for showing the often unseen world of NFL coaching and its pressures is what I believe sets this book apart from a simple biography of the man.Halberstam shows how critical it is for aspiring coaches to build and keep relationships with others in the football business. Jobs are often gotten, perhaps most often, due to connections made early in ones career. Belichick had a huge advantage over many in that his father was already a successful coach well thought of by football insiders. This inside connection to the game allowed Bill to be given a chance when many others would not have gotten the opportunity.Bill made the most of his chance with hard work and intelligence but his rise faced many obstacles, especially spending several years working for Bill Parcells and enduring that mans immense ego and sarcastic and often insulting and bullying behavior.Belichicks rise to the pinnacle of his profession is a wonderful study of an intelligent mans rise to the top. Halberstam exposes, warts and all, a coaches nomadic and pressure filled life."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"An excellent book that I'm grateful to have read. The beginning chapters on Belichick's father and his son's early development into a 'football geek' are esp. interesting. It's easy to see where his work ethic comes from, and how the greatest mind in football came to be. Halberstam, may he rest in peace, skillfully created a fascinating portrait. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I am not a big Bill Belichick fan, never have been, but I do appreciate how he gets grown millionaires to buy into his concept of the team and get results from getting players to \\"play their roles\\". and so I decided to read this book. It's not the greatest sports book ever but its not bad either.The book is not a juicy expose that have become so popular in non fiction today, but that probably has more to do with the fact that their int any juicy secrets to the Belichick story. This is a story of a man that was destined to coach, the son of a collage scout who was breaking down film at the age of nine. who was working for nothing with the Colts, right out of collage.This story is a story of a man who put all his eggs in one basket (coaching) and through hard work, talent and a no nonsense approach to the game made it pay off."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I usually read football books because I like to read about the X's and O's of the sport, but this book was more about the human and business side of the sport. I gained an insight and appreciation for a football coach's life and the struggle to survive in the coaching business. This book \\"The Education of a Coach\\" is the story of a coach who did survive and succeded at the highest level of the sport--winning three Super Bowls in 4 years. This book gives more than a biography of the coach's life but it also teaches many usefull life lessons. Who better to learn from than someone who knows what it takes to be successful and a winner."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"David Halberstam has written a book for those who watch football only one Sunday each year -- Super Bowl Sunday. Serious fans of NFL football will not find much new in Halberstam's book. Most of it has appeared in one fashion or another in Sports Illustrated or on the air during game commentary.Halberstam's book seems geared toward the elites who view football as a sometimes amusing diversion. The tone is condescending. The simplest football terms need explanation. At one point, I thought to myself, \\"Did he write this book for the British?\\" It's too simple by half even while trying to make Belichick appear the genius. If he's such a genius, let's get some real insights about football.Nonetheless, it rates three stars because of Halberstam's writing and his obvious access to his main subject, Bill Belichick. Halberstam's writing flows, and this is a very easy read. Set aside an evening or two at most. Belichick is treated very well in this book and actually seems to deserve it.I expected more insights into individual players and opposing coaches and perhaps more on in-game situations. There is little there, and hard-core fans will be disappointed. But Belichick's character is revealed. He is a man of character, but he's no character. There are few light moments in the book.Overall, I would suggest David Mariniss's \\"When Pride Still Mattered\\" if one wants a more fulfilling look at football and at a coach, Vince Lombardi. Belichick is on his way to being considered in the same group of great coaches as Lombardi, Noll and Walsh, but he's not quite there yet. Halberstam's book, while enjoyable, doesn't quite live up to that level of excellence."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I'm not that big a football fan, but I very much enjoyedTHE EDUCATION OF A COACH BY David Halberstam . . . itis the story of Bill Belichick, the phenomenally successful coachof the New England Patriots.Halberstam has long been one of my favorite authors, havingwritten several best sellers on sports . . . he is also the winnerof a Pulitzer Prize for is early reporting from Vietnam.This latest effort impressed me because it lived up to itstitle; i.e., it really gave me a feeling for what it took forBelichick to become the coach that he has become . . . hehad his share of setbacks along the way, and they allhelped him grow--both as an individual and leader ofwhat has become a modern dynasty in professional sports.I also came away with an idea of what it takes tobe successful on such a level: the ability to work virtuallynon-stop . . . if you think you work hard at what you do,you'll think differently after reading EDUCATION.The writing almost caught my breath in spots . . . it isthat good . . . among just a few of the many memorablepassages were these:In a world where attention to detail was probably as importantas sheer brilliance, where the people who took care of the tiniestdetails tended to be rewarded for it, the little details added up untilthey represented significant differences. He was the king of Post-itnotes. Nothing slipped through the cracks with him. In attentionto detail he was a lineal descendant of some of the mostobsessed men in America, those great NFL coaches--mostnotably George Allen, who coached successfully in bothLos Angeles and Washington, and among whose otherpeculiarities was the fact that he seemed to eat nothing butice cream. \\"I think he likes it because he doesn't have tochew it, and it doesn't take any time,\\" he wife, Etty, oncesaid. \\"Chewing it would take his mind away from football.\\"By the time he took the job as head coach of the Patriots, he hadfinally learned how to delegate a good deal of the work, but he heldon to the most elemental job of all: looking at film. It was as if ajournalist managed to become CEO of a great newspaper and thenannounced that in addition to running the paper, he would continueto function as the paper's police reporter; or a great general, havingbecome chief of staff of the Army, announcing he wanted to serve asthe point man for a rifle platoon as well.He [Ernie Adams, another coach and a serious amateur historian]thought the intensity under which the same was now played and thedegree to which the intensity separated players and coaches fromeveryone else, even those dear to them, was, in some way, likecombat, in that you simply could not explain it to anyone who hadnot actually participated. \\"My wife has a question she asked meevery year for ten years,\\" Bill Parcells said back in 1993 when hewas still married, \\"and she always worded it the same way: 'Explainto me why you must continue to do this. Because the times whenyou are happy are so few.' She has no concept.\\""},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Anyone who enjoys professional football and has followed it over the last 30+ years will really enjoy this book. Those who have coached at the college level (or, if you live in TX, at the high school level) will love it as it illustrates the kind of obsessive preparation and dedication that most of us watching from our armchairs can only speculate about. The book chronicles not only Bill Belichick's and his father's coaching careers, but, as a byproduct, it also offers glimpses into the colorful, embryonic stages of the NFL.If you're a true N.E. Patriots fan, you will devour this book, as I did. I couldn't put it down. But I also think that any sports fan will appreciate Halberstam's brilliant writing (nothing new there) and the story of unique man who was almost literally born and raised to become a great head coach in the NFL. After you read this, you will gain a new level of appreciation for the kind of incredible time and effort that is required in order to become (and continue to be) a successful coach in the NFL. While the details of Belichick's trials and tribulations throughout his journey make for a great read, learning more about the strained but productive relationship he had with Bill Parcells is well worth the book's price.David Halberstam adds another masterpiece to his collection."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This book is a must read for any football fan or anybody with the responsibility of leadership and management...or somebody like me who likes to read about enigmatic people.This book is about Bill Belichick. A man who is one of the great leaders in team sports and how he accomplishes his feats in the most unassuming of ways.If it was up to Belichick he would never tell us a word on his work, but Halberstam somehows gets us to understand the man and his methods. He illustrates in great prose how this very complex man became who he became.When you get near the end of the reading, it begs to ask the question of whether Bill Parcells could have won two Super Bowl Championships without Belichick and therefore pays the greatest compliment to the most brilliant of sports coaches."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I looked forward to reading this book and ordered it from Amazon before its publication date. My first surprise upon receiving it was that it's smaller, shorter and less substantial than I had expected. I was hoping for a more literate book about Bill Belichick than Michael Holley's \\"Patriot Reign\\" which I found fascinating but thought was very poorly written.As a Patriots fan, I very much enjoyed reading \\"The Education of a Coach\\" but I can't say I learned very much from it, because most of the \\"inside\\" stories about the Patriots I had read or heard before. The most worthwhile part of the book for me concerned Bill Belichick's father's background and his immigrant story, which was very interesting.It came as no surprise to me to read in his acknowledgements at the end of the book that the author is a life-long Giants fan. This is a book that tells the story of Bill Belichick's career as though he achieved his greatest success as the Defensive Coordinator of the New York Giants in the 1980's, when evidently they must have been the greatest team in the history of the National Football League. Never mind that Belichick achieved more success with the Patriots and that the players he coached in New England were better than the players he coached in New Jersey: the history of the NFL is all about the Giants.I got the impression that Halberstam, having interviewed Belichick for this book, was determined to publish something but did not have the time or interest to produce a complete work. He has a very unfortunate tendency to tell us things without showing us (for example, he tells us that Bob Kraft and Bill Parcells had a \\"difficult\\" relationship but he never illustrates their relationship), or when he does show us something he doesn't expound on it. On at least two occasions he says something like \\"for some reason Belichick did this\\" without exploring why Belichick did what he did. It seems to me that if you are going to write a book about a coach, you might want to explore why the coach might, for example, occasionally try to motivate his team with an emotional speech before a game.There is an error in the text on page 212 which should have been caught by proofreaders, unless we think that Halberstam really meant to describe Terry Glenn as a \\"player that [Bobby] Grier had wanted who had caused no amount of coaching heartache...\\""},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Reading David Halberstam's acknowledgements in the book \\"The Education of A Coach\\" before acutally reading the book, will give the reader a good idea of what he's in for; Bill Belichick hero-worship. I was looking for a book on Belichick because I know he was a student of the game, with no real playing experience, and he became tremendously successful in his industry. I was looking for something tangible to take from the book; an opportunity to learn from Belichick's methods and his way of creating and running a winning organization. Instead, Halberstam, who admittedly idolized Belichick before writing the book (before even meeting him personally), offers only a brief summary of Bill Belichick's life from birth until the latest Pats Super Bowl. Bill Belichick's flaws and mistakes are excused away, or blamed on others, and his successes are credited to him unconditionally. Two examples of this are Halberstam's excusing away Belichick's failure in Cleveland by blaming the media, the fans, and the ownership, and not by fully examining the way Belichick dealt with LT as a defensive coordinator with the Giants.The second case, with LT, has a few pages of text devoted to it, but it reads like a Dick and Jane book. The problem is explained, but the solution is not, as a reader this bothers me to no end. In summary the author only states that if a similar problem with a player arose in the future, Belichick would address it immediately, how is not explained.Unfortunately, a good author misses a chance to write a great book on a very interesting man. Dissappointing at best. Why David Halberstam? Why!?!"},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This book probably took David Halberstam only a few more hours to write than it took to read it. A thin volume, it nonetheless is worth the price of admission. Belichick is an interesting character, as is his father, who was an assistant at Navy for many years.I would have liked to read more about the x's and o's, however. I think this book was written for Halberstam's friends on Nantucket rather than for serious fans of pro football. This is beach reading for those who think of football only if in they (a) live in Washington or New York, (b) the Redskins or Giants are doing well, and (c) they need to be up to speed for the cocktail hours.If you want a truly great football biography, buy \\"When Pride Still Mattered\\" by David Maraniss. That story of Vince Lombardi enthralled even this die-hard Viking fan."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Coach Belichick is so good that I doubt if he will be fully appreciated and understood in his own lifetime. His intense reluctance to share his private thoughts and experiences makes that lack of appreciation and understanding even more likely.Since coach Belichick began heading up the New England Patriots, everyone has become familiar with his one game at a time attitude and approach. Due to the publicity associated with the recent passing of his father, coach Steve Belichick, everyone has begun to sense that the real dynasty in New England began with coach Belichick's father.Recounting the early years of coach Belichick's education and start in coaching reveals a lot that I didn't know before, and I appreciate Mr. Halberstam's efforts in that regard. But I was shocked to see some of the more obvious omissions in that dimension. For instance, both Belichicks found lots of wisdom in football books. While that aspect of their learning is referenced here, I learned more about that part of their approach from a brief television profile where coach Belichick was interviewed recently than from this book.It's pretty clear that Mr. Halberstam doesn't know very much about football. As a result, you get constant references to game preparation such as watching and rewatching films . . . but not much beyond the mere recounting of the intense effort. Everyone watches films intently now. How is coach Belichick different in his methods? It isn't spelled out.The descriptions of coach Belichick's time in New England could have been written from daily newspaper reports. There's not much value added by Mr. Halberstam.Because others were willing to say a lot more about coach Belichick than either the coach himself or his colleagues were, this book is primarily about others' impressions of how coach Belichick learned and what he learned. I found those observations to be very superficial in most cases.I attend as many open practices by the Patriots as I can during training camp. Anyone who came to three or four of those practices could have added a lot of depth to this book. I suspect that Mr. Halberstam was working in an air conditioned library somewhere rather than attending those sessions during recent summers."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Shortly before he passed away, I had a chance to meet David Halberstam. We discussed an assortment of his books. Long ago, I read \\"The Breaks of the Game\\" where he followed the Portland Trailblazers the year after they won the NBA championship. The underlying thesis of the book is \\"nothing recedes a team more than success.\\" I asked him whether Bill Belichick was aware of that pitfall. He assured me he was and recommended I read \\"The Education of a Coach.\\" The book provides wonderful insights into the thinking and background of Bill Belichick. I came away with the belief that Bill Belichick and I have more in common - humble upbringing, immigrant grandparents, the importance of education, and loyalty to friends - than I would have ever guessed. And yes, Coach Belichick is acutely aware of the pitfalls of \\"resting on your laurels.\\""},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"\\"The Education of a Coach\\" is not only about how Bill Belichick came to win three super bowls in four years, but the people that helped shape his career along the way, notably his father Steve. The book talks about Steve's years as a coach and how Bill was involved with football from an early age. The book also talks about Bill's involvement in football in school, his first job in football, his time with the Giants, his disastrous stint with Cleveland, and of course his current stint with the Patriots. The book also touches on his relationships, for better or worse, with football insiders including Bill Parcells, Ernie Adams, and Scott Pioli, among others.As the title suggests \\"The Education of a Coach\\" is more about Bill Belichick the coach than Bill Belichick the person. There are glimpses into what makes him tick - his quest for privacy, why he doesn't do well with the media, why he treats all his players as equals - that make him even more interesting. But much of his personal life - his marriage and later divorce, his children - are barely mentioned. But that fits the way Belichick is, a very private person. And what is at the heart of this book - Belichick's football life - is fascinating. Some readers may be disappointed that there's not more about his family, but once you've read the book you realize that football is Belichick's life.Because \\"The Education of a Coach\\" was written in 2005, there is, of course, no mention of \\"spygate\\". It's hard not to think about it while reading the book and it was interesting to read about Belichick's preoccupation with studying football film. It's something he started doing at a young age with his father and is, to me anyway, one of the most interesting aspects of his character.Love him or hate him, Bill Belichick is one of the most talented and complex coaches in football. \\"The Education of a Coach\\" is a good glimpse into what made him one of the best coaches in football today. Well done."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This is a solid book if you want to know the basic facts about the career of one of football's most brilliant but enigmatic coaches. That said, for the unique access to Belichick that Halberstam got, there's not much here that's particularly revelatory. We learn a lot - probably too much - about other coaches and football men who have influenced Belichick (most notably, his father) and there are a lot of digressive (and lengthy, for such a short book) mini-profiles of people who don't play a critical role in the story. Consequently, the book has a padded feel.Football lovers are also probably not going to get much out of this book, since Halberstam doesn't really get into the nitty-gritty of Xs and Os or provide any in-depth looks at the big games in Belichick's career. That said, he does give you a good feel for what Belichick is like and how he learned from his mistakes to build a phenomenally successful football franchise with the Patriots. Halberstam also gives a pretty fair-minded portrait of Belichick's ill-fated tenure as head coach of the Cleveland Browns- showing how Belichick was thrust into a difficult position in an organization that was a bad fit for him, but unnecessarily aggravated the situation with his surly temperament. Still, many readers will want more - more insight into how he coaches, more analysis of his intricate defensive schemes, more probing into Belichick's conflicted and fascinating relationship with Bill Parcells.A book worth picking up for those wanting a basic portrait; junkies should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"This book chronicles how Bill Belichick got to where he is today, which is the only head coach in NFL history to win three Super Bowls within four years. It answers how he began, what his learning process was, who taught him and what his influences were. Also revealed are the loyal and dedicated individuals Belichick has surrounded himself with. The book is easy to read, stemming from the exceptional quality of the writing. It is fact-based, and rich in history. Halberstam sees beneath the surface of things. How fortunate for us."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I hate to pile on a fine author when the time has passed when he can redeem himself but I concur with all the negative reviews with one exception--I don't think the book's lack of appeal can be written off as due to the fact that Belichik is a boring oaf. He is that on the outside, but there's a lot more than that inside and the author just did not dig that out. The problem with the book is that there is minimal \\"inside\\" information - a little more detail about Tom Brady's development than maybe you know, and a good explanation of just how feared a player Marshall Faulk was, but that's about it. The title suggests that the subject matter is limited to the sort of background biographical stuff so maybe we should have seen this coming, but this is really little more than an expansion of the bio you might find on the Patriots website."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Loved this book. I flew through it really fast! Spoiler alert.... he's dreaming it all after the super bowl loss to the packers. Go packers!!"},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"We get plenty of stories in The Education of a Coach. We get a glimpse into the interior world of coaching. We get the \\"politics\\" of management and owners. We get intimate portraits of everyone from Steve Belichik (Bill's father) to Ted Marchibroda to Bill Parcells. We get lots of soft-core football gossip with no real point. What we don't get is any strategic or personal insight into why Bill Belichik is a three-time superbowl winner.Halberstam seems to enjoy repeating that Belichik is recognized as a defensive genius, but don't hold your breath waiting to find out why. By mid-book, the reader begins to realize that Halberstam doesn't explain why because HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY. He hasn't taken the time to figure out the xs and os and what they mean, which is extremely unfortunate for his readers, because that's where Belichik's greatness (and secret) lies.Preoccupied with gossip, Halberstam never even comes close to identifying Belichik's innovation in the way professional football is played. He fails to notice that Belichik broke away from dependence on the highly individualized (and expensive) physical skills of superstar role players and into an extremely fluid system that depended on each member's ability to intelligently and independently \\"read\\" and react on the field. In other words, Bill Belichik not only reinvented the notion of team, he created a team in his own image, a team of coaches. The deceptive formations, hyperactive linebackers, and interchangeablility of players all stem from the core strategy of on-the-field decision-making. Developing this strategy amidst a fierce and powerful culture of superstar coaches, players, and managers is what makes Belichik a great NFL coach, whose story deserves to be told. Belichik 35, Halberstam 0."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Belichick is one of the most private, guarded sports celebrities, and it seems logical that it would take a writer of Halberstam's credentials to get him to open up in the least. While Belichick doesn't appear to give the author a lot of direct material, the master reporter goes out and gets it, covering Belichick's early life, his time as a high school and college player, and then his rise from a Colts assistant who studied film and wasn't paid for it, to the heights he's achieved now.Along the way, Belichick learns the lessons that make him such an effective coach. From his father, a Navy assistant coach, he gained an appreciation for hard work and an understanding that coaching was largely an unglamorous profession, but those with a passion for the game would get their own reward from it. He also learned to study film -- playing it back again and again to see a greater view of the game. From his high school football coach, he learned that the coach needed to be an authority figure, lest he lose the respect of his team. From his prep school coach, he learned how to balance a roster and bring new players into the fold (Andover had four-year students mixing with one-year, postgraduates on its team each year). He learned how to handle different types of personalities. In college, he honed his skills at critical thinking and problem solving at Wesleyan University (a rival of my alma mater, Bowdoin). And on his ride through the NFL, he learned that he could be himself, a passionate and intelligent man, and players would respect him for it and realize that he would help them be successful.Ironically, Belichick seemed to gain the least from the man whom he worked with the longest, Bill Parcells. The two had complementary skills and temperaments, but mostly each realized he needed the other for success. It was a professional relationship and it eventually had to end. Belichick learned how to be a head coach the hard way in Cleveland, where he struggled, and then ultimately succeeded in New England, where he has a supportive, smart owner, a protege in player personnel and several among his assistants, a team cast in his image, and a quarterback who shares his burning desire to win and be a team player.Somehow I can't help but think there's more to be written, because Belichick is so reticent. But this book is a quick read and a fun one. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"The Education of a Coach is a mini-biography of New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. It is a well done, exploration of a man many consider to be the best coach in the National Football League today. The book is written by David Halberstam, a journalist turned writer who is considered one of the best. Nonetheless, at times it seems oddly uncomfortable and awkwardly written. I suspect this may have to do with Halberstam's unfamiliarity with the game. This drawback sometimes makes the book and his descriptions of football a bit clumsy. The copyediting is also poorly done as there were a number of typos in the book you wouldn't normally see. Nevertheless, I found the book to be a fine effort and a book football fans will appreciate.Bill's father, Steve Belichick, was a football coach and scout for Navy most of his adult life. He eschewed the fame, control, and money of seeking out the head coaching job to ensure stability for his family - knowing that the life of a head coach is often one of the vagabond, constantly being run out of town, sometimes unfairly, when things go awry for a team. Many in the profession consider Steve Belichick to possibly be the greatest college scout of all time while at Navy. He was recognized to be a master at breaking down game film into its component parts.And that is where Bill Belichick was introduced to football. Bill would often spend time with his dad to help and learn how to break down game film, which started a long education into not just football itself, but the little nuisances of each position, as well as understanding the big picture of how to put the pieces in motion on offense and defense to make a play successful, to win games, and to win championships. Better yet, young Bill got to hang around players on what was then a stellar powerhouse Navy team. Imagine playing catch with Roger Staubach as kid?Thus, young Bill had an intense football education as a young boy and grew up with one thing in mind - eventually being a football coach himself. Athletically Bill was not bad but he didn't win the genetic lottery either. So he went off to prep school at Andover and ended up at Wesleyan for his college years where he played offensive lineman on the football team. But what he did mostly was diagram plays and obsess about football and football strategy. There he met his life long running mate, Ernie Adams, and odd behind the scenes football genius who works for Bill Belichick in various capacities to this day.After college Bill paid his dues to get into the NFL coaching ranks by taking an unpaid internship with Ted Marchibroda and the Baltimore Colts. Belichick's natural football genius ensured he would move up the ranks.Of course almost everybody knows of Bill Belichick's long history as the defensive coordinator of Bill Parcell's New York Giants, New England Patriots, and New York Jets teams. I would argue that it was the team's defense and Belichick's coaching and strategies on that side of the ball which truly won two Super Bowls for the New York Giants, but I digress. Those years saw Belichick become known as one of the best defensive coordinators in the game and the opportunity to be the head coach of his own team arise.Bill Belichick was head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 1991-1995 but his tenure was not a successful one. Belichick had many quirks such as being very secretive about players and their injuries, being so reticent and boring with the press where it almost appeared pathological and lastly, his reputation as being a doomsayer. While he was the head coach in Cleveland, bad teams and poor decisions only increased with time. Without going into the nitty-gritty details, Belichick handled situations poorly, especially with the press. The worst was the beating he took for demoting QB Bernie Kosar, a local hero, out of the starter's role. After a losing lame duck season when Cleveland was moving to Baltimore, Belichick was fired. His tenure at Cleveland was so dreadful that there was a possibility of never getting another chance at a head coaching job.After spending time as defensive coordinator with the New England Patriots and the New York Jets, the opportunity finally did arise. It was a strange set of circumstances to be sure - what Jets or Patriots fan could ever forget the bizarre press conference where Belichick resigned after less than a day as the head coach of the New York Jets and Bill Parcels? Belichick wanted to be his own man and knew that Parcells, as a Jets team executive, would really be calling the shots.And thus Bill Belichick, having impressed Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, with his stint as defensive coordinator, hired Bill Belichick as the head coach. And the rest is history."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Like an all-star game, The Education of a Coach is replete with famous names and high priced talent, but fails to completely satisfy.Perhaps baseball is a sport better given over to prose than football. Perhaps the funny bounces on the diamond and in the outfield, the lack of a clock, and the infield fly rule simply make baseball a less linear game, but Halberstam's baseball books are simply better.The Belichick saga is straightforward. Dad is a great coach with superior understanding of the Xs and Os. He passes his love for football systems and schemes to his son. He passes his many football industry connections to his son. The son executes with a passion for detail. He stumbles in unfortunate circumstances in Cleveland, tries again briefly in New York, and finds success in New England. A son of a working class, immigrant family prospers in the end.It's an okay tale, but might have been far better were more locker room stories, more plane trip stories, more anecdotes served. The single best story, that of a summer camp bet between Belichick and Matt Light (could the offensive lineman field a punt in a high pressure situation?) is brilliant and illustrates precisely what drives a coach. We are left wanting more.As a catalog of old-time football names (Paul Brown, Roger Staubach, Ted Marchibroda, Al Davis, Vince Lombardi, and even West Point's Tom Cahill) Halberstam shows off his research. He also interviews a wide swath of notable footballers, sportscasters, and analysts...Ron Jaworski has spot-on commentary...but the results are boringly consistent. Belichick as intrepid disciple. Belichick as hard worker. Belichick as genius coach and mentor. Admirable certainly, but there is not a lot of spice or sizzle. A book about George Allen, or Hank Stram might have been far more entertaining.Nevertheless, it filled the void for this Patriots fan whose team was knocked out in Round 1 this year."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Bill Belichick is an intriguing person as he combines success with ambiguity, resulting in a fascinating yet mysterious subject. The Education of a Coach details Belichick's life from his early influences handed down from his father, his interest in analyzing game film as far back as high school, and his climb up the ranks of professional coaching.Halberstam is a fantastic researcher, discovering an abundance of details about Belichick's life and coaching from countless sources, including discussions with personnel that Belichick generally leaves off limits (such as Ernie Adams). Unfortunately, the writing is often dry, humorless, and dull, presenting itself more as a research piece than an enjoyable biography. Even as an enthusiastic Patriots fan, I found this book very tedious at times. Belichick may be dry and sheltered himself, but Halberstam could have improved this book significantly by adding a little more expression within the pages.True to its name, this book includes much of what resulted in Belichick's football education. If deeply curious about his rise in the NFL as well as his influences, associates, and mindset, this book will include what you are looking for. If you are expecting to get a good idea of the genius behind Belichick's game plans however, you will be disappointed, as Halberstam delves into nothing deeper than disguising defensive coverages and Belichick's preparation for QB styles."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Halberstam set a very high standard for himself -- in his sports books as well as in his political books. The \\"Summer of 1949\\", for instance, was particularly well researched and written.This book lacks the depth of \\"1949.\\" There is little digging into player reactions. Instead of demonstrating character through anecdotes and understatement, Halberstam keeps hitting us over the head with his point about how great Belichick is about \\"breaking down film\\" & etc. What in the heck does that really mean? There is very little detail here.Of course, Halberstam's worst effort would count as someone else's best work. Halberstam is at his best in describing the Parcells/Belichick relationship; the character of the great Giants' teams; any why Brady was the superior quarterback to Bledsoe. Belichick's coaching genius does come through in the description of his approach to all the super bowls. And Belechick's notion of team, building interchangeable parts, and working with the salary cap are explained quite well.On the whole, though, we are continually told how great Belichick is without really giving much insight into his soul as a man or even as a coach."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"I enjoyed this book. Halberstam gives us insight into a great coach. Halberstam gives insight without getting bogged down into the game by game summary that bores me. The topics that I wanted to explore were how he became an NFL coach, what he learned from his failure in Cleveland and some insight into the championships in a NFL with rules written to prevent dynasties. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"When someone brought this to my attention as an interesting read I was open more to reading David Halberstam than reading about Bill Belichik. I had never read Halberstam before, and his ability to synthesize his research, his subject and his own perspective is seamless. But it makes me want to read his other works, because his subject, as successful as he has been, as driven and passionate as he is about football, is not really compelling. What Halberstam is able to express could have been done in a long essay, instead of a short-ish book. But if you are a coach in any sport, this makes sense to read, if only to understand and/or be reminded of the enormous focus and attention to detail that success requires. I found it ultimately ironic that Bill Parcells and Lawrence Taylor still seem to overshadow Belichik with their distinct personalities. That speaks to the private, guarded nature of Belichik, an aspect that has been essential to his success as a coach, but not as a public figure."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"If youare a Bill Belichick fan, a Patriots fan, or a football fan (in that order) you will enjoy this book. Very detailed. Halberstam is a terriffic writer. Only he could dig this deep into the life of an otherwise (forgive me Pats fans) boring guy and piece together the journey of his life, his upbringing and his experiences which prepared him for the pinnacle of football success.Bill Belichick is without argument the best coach in the game today. He is among the best ever. This book helps us understand why. It may be mildly interesting to a non-Football fan, but the level of detail may prove to be too boring for a non-fan. As a fan of Belichick and the Patriots... this book is among the best sports books (among many) I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Education of a Coach","review":"Bill Bellichik is acknowledged as being one of the greatest coaches ever, a 'genius'. This book, is not really what I was looking for. I bought this book hoping to see the inside of SPECIFICS, what did Bellichik do to outsmart offenses as a Giants coordinator and Patriots head coach, specific game planning from historical wins in 2001, 2003 and 2004. When it comes to schemes, strategy and tactics, this book is basically just retelling what most fans already know, about the Giants, how he conceded the Run in 1990 superbowl against the Bills to stop the pass.What this book really is than is a Biography of Bill Bellichik, spending alot of content on his father Steve, an assistant coach who revolutionized Scouting opposing teams, writing a book that has become standard among coaching and is also available on Amazon. \\"Football Scouting Methods\\". In this, it succeeds, and you come away understanding how Bill became what he became. Many people hate Bill, but that's usually because he beat your favorite team, he's just about knocked every great team in the AFC of the past 11 years out of the playoffs or playoff contention at least once, and taken a Superbowl ring from the Eagles, Rams and Panthers. More recently, he's lost in the superbowls and postseason, but that's the game, opponents are using the science of film study his father had written so succintly about to completely analyze and study everything hes done the past decade and develop game plans to stop it.What I really wanted, was a book diagramming these plans and execution in specifics, for those of us who have moved beyond fantasy stats of player yards and sacks to show how the chess pieces were used to maximum effectiveness. But Im probably in the minority.If your a Giant or Patriot fan, you'll enjoy this book. Why Giants? Theres alot of treatment about his Giants defenses, and because Giants are 3 and 1 against the Patriots including 2 superbowls, there isnt the sort of hatred the typical Jets fan feels for the coach who has beaten them so many times in 12 years, Patriots success depends on winning the division the Jets share, which means beating them at least once every season."},{"Title":"A Tangle of Roots","review":"A touching tale of how a baby born to a single girl and given up for adoption can have a lasting effect on the lives of the mother and those around her as she tries to get on with her life.

I had previously read the excellentA Dragon Apparent: Travels in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnamconcerning his travels in Indochina in the early \`50's, during the war for Vietnamese independence from French colonial rule. I've had a deep and abiding interest in Burma, alas sometimes known as Myanmar, visiting the country four times in the \`80's. When I discovered that Lewis had written a travel book on the country, based on his travels in the early \`50's, I considered it an essential read.Although the central authorities were discouraging, they did not give an absolute \\"no,\\" so Lewis was able to travel throughout most of the country, when there was considerable fighting due to separatist groups, a condition that exists today. He took a boat from Rangoon to the \\"deep south,\\" Mergui, via Moulmein (of Kipling fame). He describes his departure thus: \\"There was a lassitude in the air propitious to the embarkation upon a voyage to decaying southern ports.\\" He manages to return to Rangoon by air, and then on to Mandalay (whose only \\"romantic\\" part is its name.) From there he travels by jeep to the former British hill station at Maymyo (I probably took the same WW II jeep as he, some 30 years later). Perhaps half the book is centered on his experiences in the northern Shan States, between Lashio and Bhamo, including the market held every five days at Nam Hkam. He manages to reach the far northern town of Myitkyina, famous for the jade found nearby. He returns to Mandalay by boat on the Irrawaddy, and on to Rangoon by train, despite the fact that the middle section has been destroyed by rebels.He writes with immense descriptive power, knowing the names of the birds and flora. He is also insightful into the human condition, with meaningful descriptions of the personalities that he encounters. And he studied his Burmese history before arriving, describing aspects of rule of various Burmese emperors, such as Bodawpaya (the Burmese Ivan the Terrible) dealing with such paradoxical issues that in a country where the killing of many animals and noxious pests is frown upon, or outright forbidden, the Emperors would bury people alive to protect bridges and palaces. Some of his trenchant political observations: \\"The difference between common piracy and empire-building is a matter of scale and success.\\" And one that resonated with my own experiences: \\"Although the classic English traveler is spurred on in almost all cases by nothing more sinister than an extravagant curiosity, it has been hard at the best of times for others to believe that he is not an agent of the Intelligence Service...\\" His conclusions also resonate, at least for that period, if not for today: \\"I state here my sincere belief that the average Burmese peasant working his own land, lives a fuller and happier life, and is a more successful human being than the average Western factory hand or office worker.\\"But I had several problems with the book. Save for one powerful passage on the attempt of 20,000 to flee into India ahead of the Japanese in WW II, he mentions the impact of the war on the country minimally, and it was a devastating event for them. Likewise, he was light on the actual impact of British colonial rule, discussing in greater detail the invasions by the Mongols, and the Chinese. He never mentions the experience, and book written by a former British colonial officer in the \`30's, George Orwell. Emma Larkin did justice to Orwell by writing a book on the places he lived. Finally, and most stunningly, he never mentions Pagan! The ultimate tourist destination for any Burmese visitor.Fortunately I was able to visit Pagan thrice; Lewis however had the time, and \\"guts\\" (or stupidity) to risk traveling in unsafe areas, and seeing so much more of the country that was \\"off-limits\\" in the \`80's. Overall, a very good book for any traveler. Sadly the conditions he describes in the 50's are largely still true today, unlike the ones described in \\"A Dragon Apparent.\\" Burma remains an enormous, open-air, history museum.Finally, Eland Publishers deserves much credit for keeping this book, as well as numerous other travel books in print."},{"Title":"Golden Earth: Travels in Burma (History & Politics)","review":"I read this book in preparation for a trip to Burma that I was embarking on.

The book seemed to drag on and on through the middle with little surprises here and there, but the surprises still made it worthy enough to wait until the big surprise in the end. The ultimate transformation of the king of the planets would open up the door for its much better sequal 2061. However, 2010 is still worth the time taken to read it, and still makes a much better science fiction book than most.

It introduced many unusual twists on space flight, extra-terrestrial intelligence and the relationship between humans and intelligent machines. This book is a worthy extension of that story, answering many of the questions raised in \\"2001\\", yet generating many more in the process.In this sequel, it is determined that the orbit of Discovery is decaying rapidly and the planned U. S. mission to the spacecraft will not arrive at Jupiter until Discovery has already made contact with the planet. Therefore, a joint U. S./Russian crew is placed aboard the Russian craft Leonov and they depart for Jupiter. The crew is well trained and they believe they are prepared for all eventualities.A Chinese mission blasts off and by using all of their fuel, manage to arrive at Jupiter ahead of the Leonov. They then land on Europa in an attempt to refuel by tapping into the liquids under the ice. However, they are destroyed by an indigenous creature that is just following its' mindless phototropism.The crew establishes contact with Discovery and is able to restart HAL. His bout of digital insanity is explained and the crew explores the vicinity of Jupiter, including the monolith. They learn very little about it until David Bowman reappears and tells them they must leave. Using Discovery as a booster, they are able to blast out of orbit and enter a course back to Earth. Once they have left, changes take place and they understand some of what the makers of the monoliths planned.No one writes about enigmatic aliens and their artifacts better than Arthur Clarke.

It's hard to argue with success--the movie made a bundle, as did the book. That said, 2001 was boring, both on screen and on the page. Kubrick might have been better off making Childhood's End into a movie, or &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth.&quot; As a story, 2001 suffered and left too many questions unanswered as it moved from &quot;the dawn of man&quot; to the appearance of the Star Child. 2010 picks up where 2001 leaves off, and takes us into the far future.I'm about to reveal some plot points, so stop here if you haven't read it yet or read at your own risk. In this sequel, we find out more about the Star Child's role, the purpose of the Monolith, and what the Monolith was doing out by Jupiter. Drawing on the &quot;Voyager&quot; probe data, Clarke's descriptions of the Jovian moons are detailed and believable. He makes an excellent case for the next probe to the moon Europa, as he takes a good shot at describing life under its ice cap. Clarke even manages to take a shot at geopolitics and the tension between the US and USSR. Fortunately, perhaps, that part of Clarke's novel became outdated by 1989. In any case, the pace of 2010 is brisk, the characters are livelier than many others in Clarke's books, and the &quot;sense of wonder,&quot; high concepts, and technological wizardry are all there. If you had wished that 2001 had been better or more clear, Clarke grants your wish.Some additional thoughts after rereading 2010:I reread 2010 in two days. Mind you, based on the cracks in the binding, I've probably read the book quite a few times, so I was anticipating what would come next. However, what comes next was usually fun and easy to read. Not all of Clarke's books are easy to read, but this is one of the better ones, both as a reading of characters and in its explanations of unfamiliar scientific phenomena.I wrote a paper about 2010 in college, which focused on its politics. The novel, unlike the movie, shows a friendly rivalry between the US and USSR. The movie showed nothing of the kind, and indeed fed on the hostility between East and West. While Clarke is perhaps a bit too forgiving of communism, he at least manages to make his Russian characters seem warm and human, unlike certain Cold War-era films I could mention.Clarke also made such a convincing case for the possibility of glaciers and (then) life on the Jovian moon Europa that articles written about potential life today surprise me not at all. He also makes use of potential life forms in the clouds of Jupiter, which he first portrayed in his novella, &quot;A Meeting With Medusa.&quot; Indeed, Clarke almost has the Star Trek belief in life everywhere, even Io, the most volcanically active bodies in the solar system.Finally, he manages to encompass much that was in 2001, and surpass it. We get a good summary of what happened in the first book/movie, and then we are given an amplified version of what happens next. I really, really enjoyed this book, and was glad to read it again. If you didn't understand that &quot;blockbuster&quot; by Stanley Kubrick, this book makes it all clear. And surprisingly, the movie version does almost as good a job.You'll find yourself saying, &quot;My God, it's full of stars!&quot;"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Most times when authors write sequals to their original stories, they are generally not very good, but Arthur C. Clarke made the rare exception to that with this book. 2010 is a worthy sequal to 2001, we finally learn why Hal went nuts and how the Monolith plays an important role in the fate of planet Jupiter, also HAL finally becomes part of the Monolith and joins Dave Bowman to continue the work begun millions of years earlier in the destiney of mankind"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010 is the second book in a series of four.

I read this book shortly after the real Tsunami in Sri Lanka, and was totally taken aback and thought to myself,\\"Holy cow! What are the odds of Clarke saying a Tsunami in the year 2005, when he wrote the book in 1982?\\" He even wrote this book in Sri Lanka, were the blunt of the wave hit.So anyway if you want to read a gripping science fiction novel, this is the one for you. Also this book is for anyone wanting to be completely freaked by the similarities between the novel and real life."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"clarke is great at putting a twist of horror and poetry into the universe unfolding around us in his trilogy of 4 books. i loved 2001 the best but the next two were worthy reads."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"It is rare that a sequel is accorded as much credit as the first book in a series. This book is one of those rare events. Like my review for 2001, I do not choose to re-hash the plot or repeat what other reviewers have said. I just want to add a few thoughts.1) The focus of 2001 was Saturn -- a focus which did not survive even into the movie. 2010 is more of a sequel to the movie than to the novel.2) The character focus is shifted to Dr. Heywood Floyd -- an important but relatively minor character in the first book, but essential in making this book &quot;work&quot;. The side-plot which concerns the effect a multi-year space voyage has on his marriage demonstrates a real problem which will have to be addressed when such extended space travel become possible.3) Like in 2001, it is interesting to see the &quot;Cold War&quot; politics from a distance of several decades. Things sure turned out differently than Dr. Clarke expected, didn't they?!4) Several &quot;loose ends&quot; are tied up in such a manner as to give the reader a view into the development of David Bowman from &quot;childhood&quot; to some level of maturity -- as well as the discussing the emotional needs of someone who has suddenly found himself to be (more or less) immortal.5) Again, Clarke's &quot;theology&quot; comes through -- even more developed than in 2001. It is a theology based entirely on secular humanism and the evolution of Mind -- if necessary, to the exclusion of all else. But like the previous book, hints of transcendence still manage to shine through -- a terrifying notion for the true humanist! One begins to wonder if Clarke is trying to convince himself as well as the reader!Regardless, an excellent read and a good follow-up."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Another great read. Couldn't put it down. There are some continuity inconsistencies (in the 2001 the Discovery was abandoned at Saturn, but in 2010 it is found orbiting among the moons of Jupiter) but Clarke maintained that each of the four odyssey books takes place in a parallel, yet slightly different, universe."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Years ago I read 2001 and recently decided to re-read it and follow up with the rest of the series. 2010 does not follow exactly from 2001. I am not going to give anything away, but if you are a purist and want utter consistency you will be perturbed. The book is an easy read, the character development is pretty good, but what keeps your interest is the plot.

What's the connection between the two, besides the the obvious?After reading 2010, 2001 reads more like a prequel than it does a stand alone one-off novel about the monoliths. The plot is just awe-inspiring becasue of the trip around the Jovian moons, their landscape and even the life on the moons. Reading the details given of Jupiter with its gas-cloud atmosphere, always reminds me of reading my favorite book - The Algebrasist by Iain M. Banks. The descriptions are atmospheric, dreamy and surreal. It's a wonderful journey to the Jovian system... and there's a good story behind it! The middle and end of 2010 are much more readable and sensible than the ending of 2001, which was silly to read."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"With this sequel to &quot;2001&quot;, Arthur C. Clarke proves, yet again, why he is at the top of his game. This work, bringing back Heywood Floyd, along with a group of new characters, along with the evolved Dave Bowman and the monolith once again catapults us into the fantastic. This book is on my shelf along with: Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The first book was so good in my opinion that reading the sequel was a must (especially since I liked the second movie so much more than the first). While that is my opinion about the movies I think that my opinion of the books is almost the reverse. The book continues the tension of the first and even increases the mystery. By the end of the book I would have thought the next one would really hit a home run and start answering some questions (the ones I thought would have been answered in this one)."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Although it is a good book, does not equal the first one (2001).I recommend reading first 2001, cause this book creates the questions you want answered in this second part (and not all of them are answered yet).2010 shows wonderful views and sights of space, specially Jupiter and its moons, that alone makes reading worth it, but, as I said above, it is more enjoyable once you read 2001."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"A) This book ruined the movie for me (I can't imagine anyone who read the book liking the movie...but then...).B) The drop through the Jovian atmosphere, life on Europa (go Richard Hoagland) and the ultimate fate of Jupiter are all amazing (the fact that 1 1/2 of the 3 don't appear in the movie helped to doom it to me).C) I've probably read it 15 times, and I've enjoyed it each time."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Having recently rewatched the under-rated Peter Hyams adpatation while also reading a book of Clarke's essays, I was inspired to read this. Clarke is one of the most accomplished and intelligent science fiction writers around, a man whose work is very heavy on what's possible and thankfully light on psuedo-science. But this book, while very entertaining and readable, lacks very much in the way of tension. Oddly, adding the now-dated Cold War subplot to the film was what this book needed to really move.Is it fair to compare book to film when each has a slightly different goal? Probably not, but the film points out that Clarke is a science writer as much as he is a fiction writer. The meticulous care he takes with facts slows the book down in a few places, and lack of tension creates as happy a family aboard the Leonov as you could find on the Enterprise. Clarke is such an utopian that his world could be a little duller than we would want for fiction.That said, this is still a fun and intelligent novel which offers a realistic vision of the future, and which helps make some sense of the incomprehensible final 15 minutes of Kubrick's bizarre masterwork.. What's more, I might even try to read the original 2001 novel to see if Clarke can do with words what Kubrick fails to do with 3 hours of slow-moving pictures."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2001: A Space Odyssey was written at a time when the outer planets of our solar system were only known as fuzzy discs, and their satelites as tiny dots of light. Arthur C. Clarke had to rely on his imagination to create the evocative outer solar-system vistas of 2001. This all changed when the Voyager probes flew past Jupiter in 1979, and the world marveled at the magnificent views of the Jovian system they beamed back to Earth. The dynamic, colorful atmosphere of Jupiter itself, the newly discovered Jovian ring system, the active volcanoes of Io, and the icy worlds of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto inspired the imaginations of millions, including Clarke's. It was time for Clarke to write what his fans had been waiting for for over a decade: a sequel to 2001 that would finally answer the many questions that 2001 had left unresolved, among them, why did HAL fail, and what happened to Dave Bowman?Often, sequels turn out to be little more than just dull rehashs of the original work, but not this time. 2010 is as fresh and breathtaking as the first part, and, as we have come to expect from Clarke, is packed with surprises, plot twists and awe-inspiring revelations. The technically sophisticated reader will enjoy discussions of orbital mechanics, as well as richer character development and more complex social interactions than those in the previous work.To my knowledge, this is the book where Clarke started to add gay or bisexual characters on a regular basis, and I cannot praise him enough for that. In the early 1980s, a bold statement like this took courage and moral integrity, and by making this statement, Clarke established himself as a social visionary, as well as a scientific one.Unlike the movie adaptation, 2010 is a worthy successor to 2001, and a must-read for anyone who has enjoyed the original novel or movie."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This book is the sequel to 2001: A Space Oddysey, and is, in my opinion, a superior book. First, to clarify: this is not a sequel to the novel 2001, rather it is a sequel to the movie. If you do not watch the movie you might get lost. This book is superior to its predecessor because of its pacing and greater level of wonder and suspense. While 2001 grabbed my interest, it moved a little slow. 2010 starts quickly and doesn't stop until the last page. This book begins with the launch of LEONOV, a Russian Space Ship with an important mission: to rendezvous with DISCOVERY and find the invaluable information contained in its computer banks. There is trouble from the start: a Chinese vessel has beat them to Jupiter, presumably to view the invaluable information for themselves. The vessel is destroyed on Europa, a moon on Jupiter. Meanwhile, Dave Bowman, now a being of pure energy, returns to Earth, effectively as a probe, to find out about the planet. He makes contact with an old girlfriend and his mother, then he returns to his old ship, DISCOVERY. I could not stop reading this exciting and compelling novel and cannot wait to read the final two of the series, although I have heard that they are subpar."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This book was much better than 2001!

Still, the inconsitencies between the two novels can be forgiven, and there's a lot about this book I truly love.There's much more room here for interaction between various characters than in 2001, and the American/Russian dynamic is both intriguing and entertaining -- and surprisingly optimistic from a Cold War writer. If the sweeping, universal themes of 2001 by far outmatch the climax of 2010, the simpler theme of life coming of age on another world hits a little closer to home. Clarke's surest move is in not attempting to duplicate the lonley and mysterious atmosphere of 2001, which is what really made that book for me -- instead he maintains a clearer, more obvious tone, but one that works better for this novel.The book only falters seriously in the fourth part, when the author becomes seriously sidetracked by the chemical composition of Jupiter. No offense to Carl Sagan, but I DON'T CARE! Still, it doesn't go on long enough to drive the reader away from the book forever, so it's forgivable."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"In the sequel to 2001: A space odyssey, we once again meet Heywood Floyd. However, all the other astronauts are new characters, and one quickly notices how original and colourful they are /while still remaining fully realistic).There's the commander, Tanya Orlova. Dr Chandra, who constructed HAL 9000 and has stronger feelings for it than for people, Walter Curnow, an anthropomorphic personification of the word \\"jolly\\", and many others.And it is their task to go and investigate Discovery in their fine vessel called LEONOV. But strange things will happen...This is an incredibly good book. It is well-written, and it is obvious that Mr Clarke has used the book medium in a way impossible with other works."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"A derelict spaceship, a homicidal computer, an enigmatic relic of non-human manufacture that may be the doorway to the other end of the universe and the key to both man's past and his future. These were the pieces of a puzzle deliberately left unfinished at the end of \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\" and much of the reason for that book's classic status. Clarke had a nearly impossible mission: how to follow up and flesh out the mystery while preserving the story's critical air of the enigmatic. Improbably, he succeeds.Nine years have passed since all contact failed with the USS Discovery. Sent to Jupiter to follow a radio signal beamed there by a mysterious monolith found on the moon, the Discovery all but vanished into mystery. No man built the monolith, and none could have left it buried under the Lunar crater of Tycho. And none of the scientists could know that another monolith, as depicted in the prolog of \\"2001\\", appeared in Africa over 3 million years earlier, ushering in the dawn of human civilization. Before reaching the recipient of the monolith's message, disaster strikes Discovery: HAL-9000, the chatty super-computer running the ship, turns homicidal, killing three astronauts in suspended animation, dispatching another to an almost certain death in space, and nearly killing off Dave Bowman, the mission commander. Bowman survives, but only by un-plugging Hal. Truly alone, Bowman rendezvous with another monolith, and vanishes through a stargate. Emerging on the other side of the universe, he finds himself altered into something new by the creators of the monolith, an advanced race of thinkers that has found nothing greater in the universe than the sentient mind.Knowing little more than the deaths of the astronauts and the \\"death\\" of Hal, Americans have spent 9 years feverishly working to complete \\"Discovery 2\\", only to find that they'll be beaten to Discovery by a Russian ship, the Leonov (nee Titov). Magnanimously (also to avoid any hint of space-piracy), the Russians invite Americans to accompany them. Along for the ride is Walter Curnow, a friendly bear of a man who knows Discovery's systems inside/out; Heywood Floyd, a minor character from the last book; and Dr. Chandra, referred to in \\"2001\\" as the father of Hal. Getting to Discovery, they will have to bring Hal back to life if they have any hope of cracking the 9-year old mystery. In the mean time, the man known as Dave Bowman must learn why he has been sent back to his solar system. Reaching the orbit of Jupiter and its moons, the Russian/American team finds Discovery and the larger monolith in which Bowman disappeared, but also finds their answers are elusive.This was a great book. Clarke brings surprising depth to the dangers of space travel, the emotional pitfalls of artificial intelligence and the search for intelligent life in the universe. Clarke develops a sub-plot involving a Chinese ship, one wisely junked for the movie, but quite effective here. In short, and without spoiling things, Clarke builds on the house-of-cards of his last book, without bringing it down. Neither of the follow-ups could touch this sequel."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010: Odyssey Two has great depth but fails to live up to the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey.Even though Clarke still raises profound philosophical questions, creates a broad story and keeps proposing believable fiction he's somehow lost his touch on this one, in this book I didn't really felt the panic and the awe I felt on 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are some big lagoons between the really good parts and they don't allow the book to reach a crescendo. However the book is *not* boring at all it does takes the story a step further and Clarke's imagination and his point of view on the cosmos continues to be really interesting. Definitely worth reading if you liked the first installment, just don't expect it to be a masterpiece like 2001 was."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010: Odyssey Two is a very good book. It is not, however, of the same caliber as 2001: A Space Odyssey. 2001 is a thought provoking, philosophical novel which raises issues such as the nature and origin of mankind, the difference between man and artificial intelligence, extra-terrestrial life, etc while 2010 mainly deals with war and the nature of politics (not quite as interesting to me). I would recommend this book to any true science fiction fan but don't expect it to be as good as 2001."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Wow. No way a sequel to one of history's best sci-fi novels, one of history's best movies, can be just as good, just as engrossing, but 2010 absolutely is. Clarke returns us to the bizarre frontier town of Jupiter, with the monolith floating in orbit so quietly you can hear yourself go mad. Instead of conflict between man and machine as in 2001, there is an uneasy tension between Russians and Americans (although without the Cold War hints of the movie version). Personal conflict serves to distract you until Clarke can slip in the most outrageous, mind-blowing, enlightening, and downright uplifting :) climax of any work of fiction, written or performed. If you haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, I won't ruin it for you, although I will recommend watching the movie first, which I prefer for it's better sense of timing and suspense. As usual, Clarke injects some first class science into his fiction, skirting the edge of real and unreal so skillfully you can't help but be carried way by this world which was supposed to have been happening this very moment."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This book is awesome, a great sequel to 2001:A Space Odyssey! Extremely scary, suspensful, exciting, and interesting, this book is a great read! This book is about an expedition to reach Discovery and, if possible, to bring it back to Earth.

Clarke is my favorite science fiction writer and I enjoyed spending more time in the 2001 universe but, in a very real way, there should never have been a sequel to 2001. 2001 ends with the next evolutionary leap for mankind. This book - and all the others that follow - are merely an anti-climax and they belittle the importance of the first book. I don't think that Clarke himself understood the importance of the first story. All the successive books make you think, &quot;Well, what was the point.&quot; All the Starchild can think of doing in this story is to start creation all over again on Europa. Why? What's the point? What about Earth? Clarke sidestepped all the important questions from the first novel for the rest of the series. I mean really, who cares about character developement? Also, an annoying trait that he has is that each novel disregards what happened in each of the previous novels: in the first book, Bowman goes to Saturn, in the second, we pretend that it was Jupiter so it can be more like the movie. In the end, this book turns out to be a pleasant but forgettable read. I do not view the events described as what &quot;really&quot; happened after 2001. I think the Starchild could have come up with a few better ideas."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"If you enjoyed 2001, then you will probably like this book as well.

There were also some new interesting concepts introduced, such as the von-neumann machine. Furthermore, the fact that this book was written about 15 years after 2001, allowed Clarke to make an outstanding description of the Jovian Galilean satellites.The end of 2010 made me rush to buy 2061 to see how Europa would become habitable and what happened to HAL, but unfortunately, this time my expectations were not 100% fulfilled."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"In what Carl Sagan refers to as &quot;a worthy successor to 2001,&quot; Clarke once again takes us to the outer reaches of the solar system for a rendezvous with the mysterious monolith orbiting Jupiter.

Congratulations, Mr. Clarke, you've done it again."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"There is not doubt that 2010 is the greatest of all the Space Odyssey Series. The reason is really because here it is a space race, mixed with discovery and intrique. The characterization is better than any of the others books. Instead of just a Frank Poole, Indra Wallace, Dave Bowman or Hal you have a plethora of characters with defined personalities. They include the almost insane Chandra, the genious but realistic Curnow, the powerful captain Tanya Kirbuk, a Heywood Floyd out to redeem himself at the cost of his family and even a Dr. Chang of the Tsien willing to aid scientific &quot;discovery&quot; even in the last minutes of his life. The Chinese are also decribed well by Clarke. The Chinese military tactics in modern times have used massed, risky human wave assaults like in Korea which risk life and waste it without remorse. The same is true of the Tsien, it is sent to beat the Leonov and see Europa at the cost of everyone on board it. It even is meant to be rescued at a later time again at the cost of a hybernating lost years crew. Even in a space race the Chinese government tactic of wasting life is fully explored and perfectly analyzed by Clarke. Clarke is also quite realistic in his predictions, almost like a 21st Century HG Wells or Morgan Robertson. This is seen first by Clarke realizing in his book that many nations have nuclear weapons by now not just China, Britain, the US, France, and Russia. When he wrote it in the early 1980s these were some of the few countries that had nuclear weapons but Clarke predicted many more would get them but never use them. Look what has happened, now today India and Pakistan have nukes. Other countries near developing them or already allegedly possessing include Israel, South Africa, North Korea, Iran, and even Iraq. Japan is capable of making them and Ukraine and Khazakstan had them. Clarke predicted almost 30 nations would have them in 2010 but never had used them. This prediction has held so far. Insight as good as Nostradamus'. Clarke's book, as many have said (and I concur with) has went beyond fantasy or even pure science fiction to be a book more like science fictional fact. You can see this in his atomic Sakarov drive and the rotating section on the Alexi Leonov. Perhaps the only thing I think the movie, which was good, excelled over Clarke was the appearance of the Bowman Starchild (Halman in the future) to Floyd. In the book it is just a cloud of dust forming in Bowman's human face but it is more intricate and curious in the movie as he shape and age-shifts. The movie should have shown more American and Russian unity than the movie ever tried to. The exploration in Bowman the Starchild is much better in the book and helps you learn more of the mystery regarding him on later revealed in 2061 and 3001. Finally, the aspect of using the Chinese as the villians may not have fit in then but it rings true today with the Chinese the major rival superpower of the US. The Chinese are a good villian to focus on as a nation who will waste everything to beat the prepared Russians and adept Americans. This is excellent and makes the best villian of any of the other three books, that includes a psychotic HAL (2001) and a melgomaniacal Nazi play god Monolith race (3001). The Chinese are very human appealing villians in it. They must be beat or they will steal Discovery, find life on Europa first, and maybe their negligence will endanger Earth itself. Europa today is still the best harbor for life outside of Earth in Sol's community. Even if it is walking sentient trees like in the Space Odyssey Series. Man does not yet have the tools to get to Europa and drill through its ice to look for aquatic life on Europa's sea vents but perhaps by 2061 or 3001 or 30,001, will have it. Clarke's book has inspired a whole generation to explore and learn about Europa, Jupiter, and Saturn; the majesties of the Solar System. To quote Dr Floyd in the movie when we meet the Europans, &quot;I think they will be our friends.&quot; That friendship should it ever occur with Europan sponges or fish was inspired completely by Arthur C. Clarke in 2010: Odyssey Two."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This book leads up to one thing: duh, the ending. But it is well worth it. It is one of the greatest I have ever read. If you read 2001 and liked it then you will definitely like this."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"\\"2010 - Odyssey Two\\" is a strong sequel to Arthur C. Clarke's renowned \\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\\". The story is well-crafted and the plot moves briskly, which makes for an enjoyable read. It's not deep on character development, and the action is infrequent, but delivered smartly and purposefully to provide the fuel for an interesting plot, expansive exposition of space, and exploration of key themes.Like the first novel, Clarke crafts his story and writing very deliberately to create a heavy and epic atmosphere. His primary theme revolves around evolution, and builds upon the mythology he created in \\"2001\\" by expanding on the role played by the unseen aliens in planting and encouraging life throughout the universe, including Earth and elsewhere within our own solar system.He spends just enough time on backstory to refresh readers on the salient points from the first book, but more importantly, provides a legend (within one of two foreword's/author's notes in this specific edition) to where the author followed storylines from his original novel, or from the famous movie which contained slight modifications.And yes, Clarke provides satisfying answers to many of the questions left without conclusion in the first book and movie.Clarke returns Dr. Heywood Floyd in this space-traveling saga, but this time in the lead role. He and two other Americans join a Russian crew aboard a starship headed to Jupiter to connect with the presumably abandoned and derelict 'Discovery', obtain information about the Monolith and find out what happened to lost crewman Dave Bowman.Dr. Floyd is a strong lead and the most three-dimensional of all characters in the story. His motivation for leaving his family on the very long journey: \\"Four men had died, and one had disappeared, out there among the moons of Jupiter. There was blood on his hands, and he did not know how to wash them clean.\\"The trademark of great storytelling is the ability to convey ideas and themes through demonstration rather than outright telling. As a reader, I'd rather come to understand a characters' nature and motivations through the demonstration of certain behaviors and backstory, rather than be spoon-fed and literally told of one's characteristics. Clarke does a nice job of layering on the flesh of Dr. Floyd early in the story, and continuing to build as the plot progresses. None of the other characters on board the Russian craft are more than two dimensional, which increases the focus of the novel on Floyd, Star-Child/Post-Human Dave Bowman, and perhaps the story's central character: Jupiter and its moons.Among the Americans is Dr. Chandra, the parent/inventor of HAL9000, the 'Discovery's' near-sentient ship-computer that killed its original crew, which led Bowman to decommission its' cognizance. Chandra plays a key role as he works to restart HAL with the hope that he can help guide the ship back to earth, but also to shed light on why it developed the compu-psychoses that led to its' violent behavior. Chandra is drawn as the lovingly patient and near-obsessed parent focused on nurturing his lost child. The relationship between Chandra and HAL generate some terrific scenes throughout the book as HALs personality reemerges, including the first time it awakens from it's 9-year-long sleep: \\"Good morning, Dr. Chandra. This is Hal. I am ready for my first lesson.\\"Dr. Floyd notices and comments on Dr. Chandra's work: \\"...to watch the steady regrowth of Hal's personality, from brain-damaged child to puzzled adolescent and at length to slightly condescending adult.\\" \\"(It's like) disturbed youngsters were straightened out by all-wise descendants of the legendary Sigmund Freud! Essentially the same story was being played out in the shadow of Jupiter.\\" The Chandra-HAL relationship creates tension within the plot as the crew can never fully trust HAL following his behavior in \\"2001\\".\\"2001\\" concluded with the Monolith's aliens shedding Bowman of his human form and 'raising' him up to a being that needs no real form, but exists as pure energy. This evolved Bowman returns in \\"2010\\" and acts as Clarke's guide to Jupiter and it's moons. He uses Bowman's exploration as a means to delve into the physical nature of those celestial bodies and postulation on what life could exist in those extreme environments. The exposition is detailed and written with a poetic flourish.Bowman is the evolutionary result of the experiments performed on the pre human man-apes by the Monolith millions of years ago, and famously portrayed in the original movie. In \\"2010\\", he becomes aware of how the alien beings introduced life and evolution throughout the universe, and monitor their progression over millions of years. These aliens are, for all intents and purposes, God.Clarke writes that the aliens, \\"...in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields of stars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.\\"More ominously, he continues, \\"And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.\\""},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"It was almost impossible for Arthur Clarke to follow 2001. Anything was going to be a disappointment to some. But he had invented something great -- the black monolith.2010 is good. It does begin a kind of \\"technolgical-ization\\" of the monolith which I have to admit bothers me a little bit. The monolith to me was the unknowable. Something unmeasurably beyond our ken. It's an interesting struggle between the compulsion to explain and the original idea of the inscrutable monolith. If he continued to write about it, he was going to have to reveal something about it.Here Clarke doesn't go too far. The monolith clearly has an intention behind it, and it is described as a kind of \\"swiss army knife\\" of incomprehensibly advanced technology. As that intention is revealed here, its creators take on almost godlike roles. Clarke had touched on the relationship between religion and technology in Childhood's End, and I think he (rightly) never resolved the tension.All that said, this is a fun read, as are all the books in the 2001 series. It's rare that someone invents a concept so compelling and fertile as the black monolith, and I would read anything Clarke wrote to develop it."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I was just a little kid when this title came out in 1982. I remember thinking at the time that 2010 seemed like such a long ways away. Now we're finally here, so I decided it was finally time to read this novel.I heavily admire Arthur C. Clarke, who was obviously a highly intelligent man with a great imagination. As a storyteller, however, he fell short in many respects, and those shortcomings are clearly evident in 2010: ODYSSEY TWO. Most notably, this novel's characterization is painfully weak, and most of its scenes lack any sense of drama and emotion. In the end, I found this book more thought-provoking than moving.Still, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO is an intellecutally engaging novel, and after a very slow start, it eventually builds up to a exciting, satisfying conclusion. This novel lacks the depth and mysticism of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but it contains a lot of interesting information about science and space travel. It's also quite fun to compare Clarke's vision of 2010 with the reality we face today.Overall, this book is worth your time, especially if you enjoy science fiction. But if you're new to Arthur C. Clarke, my advice is to first read CHILDHOOD'S END or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY -- those are generally considered to be his two best novels."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"In writing 2010, Arthur C Clarke had to decide if he was going to sequel his book or the masterpiece that was the movie. He chose the movie and does indicate this before starting the story. The difference here is that 2001 the novel had the stargate on the Saturnian moon, Iapetus. Instead he writes as if the first novel followed the movie completely with the stargate orbiting Jupiter.The book 2010 is very similar to the movie except for another ship from China landing on Europa and discovering life there just before the \\"Leonov\\" russian ship arrives in orbit. The \\"Tsien\\" the chinese ship discovers a creature from the ocean on Europa. It's too bad the movie did not include this as i think it would have made great cinema. There are some other chapters on Dave Bowman coming back to earth, visiting an old girlfriend and his mom in a nursing home. I really enjoyed the book as Athur C Clarke is so good at helping us understand the real science behind the story.

Grade: A"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Despite the introduction of new material and mind-boggling imaginings there is no way this sequel can top the original. Once the idea, the plot, the germ of the story has been let out of the bag, it is extremely difficult to capture that initial excitement and even euphoria.The ideas of our &quot;new&quot; sun, the further adventures of Bowman, the exploration of life elsewhere in the Solar System - all of these are developed well. Of course, as in all Clarke books, it is the lack of character development that is crucial. In order to overcome this shortcoming the story itself must be dazzling as it was in 2001. 2010, though, could only exist on the shoulders of 2001 and for that reason deserves a '4' instead of a '5'."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"... but not as good as 2001. Although the story was very interesting, I could not get involved with the characters. This was especially painful because the main character's nonchalant acceptence of events really takes the impact out of key plot points. However, Clarke manages to find ways to make up for this lack.The science of this book was obviously well researched and, in many cases, is still applicable today. This adds a reality that much of the science fiction of the past years lacks. It really adds to the story.The story itself is a pleasure to read. Many questions raised in the first installment of the series are answered in this book in such a way as to increase speculation instead of quell it. I am very fond of his choice. Clarke appears to really want his readers to think about what they read, and I enjoy that opportunity.I don't agree with the author in that he chose to remain loyal to the movie instead of the book. The location is changed and I find Saturn much more interesting than Jupiter. However, the story flows freely from one to the other, and anyone who has read or seen either the book or the movie will find no trouble accepting this book.Although I don't like everything in it, I enjoyed this book and have no trouble recomending it."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This isn't the best book i've ever read, but I liked where Clarke took the storyline.

I would recommend this book if you are interested in the storyline, but I don't recommend reading past this one. The last two are a waste of time, and don't add to the story whatsoever."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"&quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; is one of the best works by Arthur C. Clarke.

But at the same time, new questions are stated. It also shows you the life in other planets. Now I know why Sagan quoted it as a very greate read (any one who has read it knows why).

A most read !"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"- Attention: Spoilers -If you find yourself captivated by the mysteriousness of the universe clarke and kubrick created in 2001, then DO NOT read 2010. Having been a fan of 2001 since childhood, I decided to commit myself to reading the books. When I began doing so, an aura of &quot;untouchable coolness&quot; surrounded the 2001 universe. This feeling was shattered by reading the books, especially 2010 and 2061. THe movie 2010 retains the omnipotent mysteriousness of the monolith, the characteristic of the 2001 universe which I feel makes it so great. There are a number of things about this book which annoy me. The first is Clarke's annoying tendency to spoonfeed the reader incredibly dumbed down, and often very corny, explanations for each major event in the story, which never fail to destroy the sense of awe which pervaded the movies. This is obvious in many different parts of the book, but reaches a fever pitch in the end of the book, with statements along the lines of - &quot;wait a second - i think jupiter just turned into a star!&quot; and &quot;I think the monoliths just might be the &quot;swiss army knife&quot; of the galaxy. I almost could not bear reading the final chapter of the book, an unbelievably corny depiction of the thoughts of europan explorers in the year 20,001 on their place in the universe. Clarke also has a tendency to &quot;pitch&quot; scientific ideas to the reader, for no apparent reason, launching into what is essentially an essay on one of his pet topics. The example which sticks out is the &quot;von neumann&quot; mahcine, which served no purpose in furthering the story, but could have had a place in a collection of speculative essays. And lastly, Clarke seems to believe that everyone in the world is part of the scientific community, and that everyone will be able to relate to his nerdy scientist's sense of humor. I find this very annoying. wrapping things up here, I have nothing but the utmost respect for arthur c. clarke as a scientist, and scientific essaysist, as well as his ability to relate science to the reader. However, I think he should stick to the realm of writing essays, and not writing fiction."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Chapters 1-5 (Leonov)The first five chapters were not very interesting. It basically spoke about how they had created a computer similar to Hal named Sal. They also spoke of news that the people on the first spaceship Discovery were killed and gave assignments to those who were supposed to go back up to Jupiter to find out what went wrong with Discovery.Chapters 6-11 (Tsien)The next six chapters focused on the mission to Jupiter. This chapter also spoke of how the Chinese had created a ship that no one knew was a spaceship until they launched it because it was being built in space. It attempted to land on Europa and something of a different species destroyed the ship Tsien. The crew on board Leonov found out that there was life on Europa from a message received from the only survivor of the Tsien explosion.Chapters 12-21 (Discovery)These chapters discuss how the crew finally makes it to the ship Discovery. They get there and attempt to get Discovery back and running. They get things started up on the ship, and fix Hal. However, Hal remembers nothing from the past and his rehabilitation begins.Chapters 22-29 (Lagrange)These chapters discussed more of the exploration of Discovery and more of the rehabilitation of Hal. This also goes more into depth of what takes place on the ship Leonov. It also gives you more of a description of the characters and their personality traits. They also discover something strange heading straight for Earth.Chapters 30-41 (A Child of the Stars)These chapters were very confusing for me. They would begin speaking of things that were taking place on Earth and then they would hop to Discovery and then to some supernatural human. It also seems to be speaking of strange types of creatures on Europa or Jupiter. They also make it seem like a member of Discovery is still alive.Chapters 42-49 (Devourer of Worlds)One of the members of the ship Discovery returns as a ghost and speaks to a crewmember of Leonov. He tells them a very important message but doesn't explain himself. Then Big Brother vanishes and the crew begins to believe the message sent by the ghost. They find a way to get back to earth earlier.Chapters 50-55 (Lucifer Rising)This is a very interesting chapter and explains everything to a full extent. However I won't ruin the ending for you!

Clarke expanded the plot lines of his 1968 speculative classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey into a trio of sequels, having, unfortunately, no specific direction or new ideas with which to propel the series. 2001's first unnecessary follow-up, 2010: Odyssey Two, brings back many interesting facets from its predecessor: More information is given on HAL, the onboard computer of the mission, Discovery, whose malfunction had deadly consequences in 2001; new developments occur in the international space race; David Bowman reappears in his star child form and some more big, black monoliths show-up. But the novel lacks the definitive direction of 2001. Half a dozen plot strains swim around but none answer any important questions left unanswered in 2001 or greatly spark the reader's interest.

I didn't like the idea of Jupiter becoming another sun, making it constant daylight on Earth. To me, it just sounded like something a 3rd-grader would think of.

The Russian and Chinese elements brought out international as well physical problems and questions. With the destruction of the Tsien, It became apparent that Europa was going to be a focal point of the novel. I saw that there would have to be something more than observations and recordings as the first third of the novel presented.

And then I thought, we aren't even close. We are no closer now, in 2010, to manned flight to Mars or Jupiter than when Clarke wrote this novel three decades ago.And it is sad.But Clarke makes it feel so tantalizingly within reach. This story is not like Star Wars or Star Trek, with spaceships zooming around with laser cannons and light speed. This is realistic, science-based science fiction, with all the complexities that physics and biology impose on us, but also making it feel so achievable. So I look up at the moon and think--a moon base? Manned flight to Jupiter? Why not?That said, I took away one star for one thing that annoyed me. Clarke admits in the introduction that there are differences between 2001, the novel, and 2001, the movie. The most significant is that in the novel, David Bowman meets the giant monolith at Saturn, not Jupiter. However, in this book, the sequel, we find Discovery abandandoned at Jupiter, and the giant monolith (Big Brother) floating in space nearby. Clarke's sequel is to the movie. I have both seen the movie 2001 and read the novel, and Stephen Pletko's review below correctly predicted my rating."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Earlier this year I made a vow to read all of the Space Odyssey books before 2010. I'm very glad I could revisit this particular book which I read halfway as a teenager. The movie version is one of my favorite science fiction films of all time.2010 has more action and dramatic tension than its predecessor. Clarke really got it right this time. Contrasted with the characters from 2001 Floyd, Curnow, and the other Russian and American characters seem more like real people with real feelings. There is a scene involving a Chinese astronaut stranded on the Jovian moon Europa that is particularly heartbreaking. There is also a payout where we learn more about Bowman's transformation and he too seems a more complex feeling creature in Odyssey Two.I'm a big fan of hard science fiction, where all of the futuristic content can be backed up by solid science or speculation on future technologies. Here we are presented with a story where orbital physics, propellant use and launch windows are major plot points. You won't get that in Star Wars or Trek. It is also interesting to me that this is a sequel to the movie version of 2001 : a space odyssey rather than the print version, as the location of the second Monolith is Jupiter orbit rather than on a Saturnian moon. It is interesting to compare 2010 to its own movie version. The movie revs up the plot more by making the Monolith more sinister (it takes the life of a cosmonaut) which always kind of bothered me because it didn't jive with the relatively benevolent motives of the finale. Also, the book amps up the Russian-American political tensions back on Earth with a steadily escalating blockade and nuclear war. Politics just doesn't interest Clarke too much beyond some subtle needling that you would expect from a cosmopolitan man of science who is used to working with experts from all nations. As with 2001 it really helps to read the book to get a clearer glimpse of the alien intelligences involved. I highly recommend Odyssey Two."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"amazing sequel to 2001. This edition is the perfect size, bound very well. If you liked the movie or the book, you will enjoy this sequel. Whereas 2001 can be read as a companion piece to the film, this book stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The first sequel to Clarke's stunning Space Odyssey series, 2010 takes us on a second journey to the distant Solar worlds. In a retroactive change, instead of Saturn, Discovery One is now floating around Jupiter.Floyd, from the first book, as well as Chandra and several soviet cosmonauts, set off on a journey to Jupiter to investigate what happened to Bowman when his transmissions ceased.It is here that they discover more than just an abandoned space ship. They discover an event that will change the Solar system as they know it.This book brings more insight into the Star Child, as well as a glimpse into extra terrestrial intelligence. Clark is able to write convincing characters dealing with plausible science problems, and his books never cease to be entertaining.I recommend this book to you if you enjoyed the first one, 2001: A Space Odyssey."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"If you liked 2001 A Space Odyssey, then read 2010 Odyssey Two...a very worthy successor. One of the more intriguing science fiction novels I think one could imagine...yet conceivable!"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I am writing a review for the movie under the book category because although I bought the DVD of the movie from Amazon years ago the DVD seems to be no longer available. I read the book too which is also good but I strongly recommend that you find the DVD too from somewhere and watch it.If you watched 2001 A Space Odyssey and liked it you are very likely to like 2010 the year we make contact as well, which like 2001 is also based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke. If you haven't watched 2001 watch it before you watch 2010. Because the latter continues the Odyssey where 2001 left off. In fact the two movies can be seen as a single movie if watched in the proper sequence i.e. watch 2001 first and then watch 2010 a few days later. 2010 came out about 15 years after the movie 2001 was made in 1968. You can see my separate review for 2001 elsewhere.2010 is not the type of science fiction for people interested in Alien and Star Wars type of space - horror movies. There are no monsters attacking human beings nor any warring spaceships blowing each other up by shooting lasers and missiles in 2010. It is not a horror nor Star Wars type of science fiction. On the other hand people who are interested in astronomy, extraterrestrial intelligence, science facts such as the General Theory of Relativity, the meaning of human existence in the universe are likely to enjoy the movie. Science fiction has to be believable to be of good quality. In this regard 2010 is of top quality. The viewer is not only entertained through high quality cinematography and acting but is also led to deep thinking about cosmology and philosophical matters mentioned above. There is no need to be knowledgeable about astronomy nor physics to enjoy the movie. Curiosity about the subject matter is enough. The story is based on a sound knowledge of science facts about astronomy. The deceased science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke has written excellent novels by the same names and both movies are based on the novels 2001 and 2010 are equally good.I also read the books by Arthur C. Clarke and I recommend that you read them as well. There are some differences in the stories in the books and in the movies but these are minor. I don't want to explain what happens in the movie 2010 because that would take away some of the excitement for the viewer if he / she knew what is going to happen in advance. There is a lot of mystery and suspense in the movie but as I said before no crap like in the space movies where aliens attack humans or space ships that shoot and blow each other to pieces."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"+++++This 1982 book (that consists of 55 chapters plus an epilog), by Sir Arthur C. Clarke (who \\"said for years that [a sequel] was clearly impossible\\"), is really a hybrid book since it attempts not only to be a sequel to his previous novel (\\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" published in 1968) but also attempts to be a sequel to the 1968 movie (also called \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\").In this novel, a joint Russian-American space mission is sent to the planet Jupiter (on the spaceship called \\"Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov\\") to try and discover what happened to the previous American spaceship (called \\"Discovery\\") that was sent previously in 2001. As well, Leonov's crew is \\"to locate the alien artifact [also called the monolith] encountered by Discovery, and to investigate it to the maximum extent possible.\\"Because this book attempts to be a sequel to the previous novel and the 1968 movie, it appeals to four different types of readers:(i) those who have not read the previous novel and have not seen the 1968 movie(ii) those who have read the previous novel only(iii) those who have seen the 1968 movie only and(iv) those who have read the previous novel and have seen the 1968 movie (as I have).Each of these four types of readers will probably rate this book as follows:(1) Those who have not read the previous movie or have not seen the 1968 movie will enjoy this novel. Reading the previous novel or seeing the 1968 movie is not needed to understand this novel. There is good character interaction and there is both known and speculative space science throughout. (Examples of speculative science include the idea that gas giant planets such as Jupiter may have diamond cores and there may be aerial life forms in Jupiter's atmosphere.) There are excellent descriptions of Jupiter and its moons (especially of the moons Io and Europa). As well, this novel's climax (that occurs in chapter 52) is exciting and unexpected.These readers will probably give the novel a 5 star rating.(Note that these positive comments will apply to the other types of readers indicated below.)(2) The reader who has read the previous novel only will notice some differences that interfere with the continuity from the previous novel. For example, Discovery is no longer orbiting one of planet Saturn's moons but is now orbiting one of Jupiter's moons. (No explanation for this is given.) Instead of the monolith being on one of Saturn's moons, it is now in orbit around one of Jupiter's moons. (Again, no explanation for this is given.) As well, the mystery and awe of the previous novel is replaced with the straightforwardness of this novel. Many of the questions left open in the previous novel are now answered.These readers might give this novel 3 1/2 stars.(3) Fans of the 1968 movie will have a stronger sense of continuity after reading this book than those who have only read the previous novel. However, they may not recognize some of the dialogue that was said to exist (since it appeared in the previous novel only.) The overwhelming mystery and awe of the movie is replaced with the straightforwardness of this novel. However, many of the questions left open in the movie are now answered.These readers will perhaps give this novel 4 stars.(4) Those who have read the previous novel and have seen the 1968 movie might be a bit confused since they have to contend with what has been said in (2) and (3) above. But with some reflection, they should be able to sort out this confusion.Possible rating by these readers: 4 stars.As mentioned in (1) above, there is quite a bit of true and speculative space science throughout this book. Thus, this book would have different appeal to yet two more types of readers:(5) Those without space knowledge. Such readers, I believe, would find this novel fascinating.These readers would probably give the novel 5 stars.(6) Those with some space knowledge. These readers would also be intrigued with the novel especially the speculative space science. However, they would be very dissappointed with the novel's climax (in chapter 52). For this climax to occur, there would have to be sufficient mass (which there isn't). Further, if this does occur (and it does in the novel), the novel would have to abruptly end since the spaceships (Discovery and Leonov) and Jupiter's moons would be instantly incinerated.Possible rating by these readers: 3 stars.The average of the above six ratings is 4 stars.Finally, there is the 1984 movie called \\"2010: The Year We Make Contact.\\" It is a straightforward, traditional science fiction movie. You don't have to read this book to understand this movie.In conclusion, this novel as Carl Sagan says is \\"a worthy successor to 2001.\\" It appeals in different ways to different people.+++++"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I reread this novel for the third time recently and enjoyed it every bit as much as I had the first two times. 2001 is more famous and the movie is far better known, but 2010 is my favorite sci-fi book outside Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama.My interest in learning about our solar system exploded after reading this novel. It is incredibly intriguing, you can visualize Jupiter and its moons up close, but you really are just dying to see them yourself. I feel like its such a tease, this is as close as I will ever get to experiencing the king of our solar system.The descriptions of Europa are still highly accurate and you can't help but wonder how true the novel might really be. The ending was fantastic and quite unexpected, I really didn't see it coming.What makes 2010 great I guess is the pacing. If there is any semblance of a &quot;slow&quot; part, it would be the beginning. After that the novel takes off and cannot be put down.Best of all, 2010 does not have any of the mindbending trippy stuff that was at the end of 2001. I was quite thankful for that.2061 and 3001 are also good reads, but it is 2010 that stands above the rest in Clarke's spectacular four part odyssey. I doubt that you'll be disappointed, and if you liked 2001, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"In the background of 2001, Clarke introduced us to an advanced civilization that helped Earth's \\"dumb\\" apes evolve millions of years ago into modern humans by teaching them how to kill prey. I'm fascinated by these mysterious characters lurking in the background. They, like us, evolved from ocean slime, then into intelligent, self-aware carbon-based beings like us, then into living machines, and finally into organized states of energy. Then the reader is suddenly translated into modern times. Humans, developing powerful artificial intelligent life, are at the cusp of taking the next evolutionary leap. This, post-Darwinian evolution, is what 2001 is REALLY about. 2010 continues the devlopment of this theme when we learn of the \\"lost\\" astronaut's fate. He has been \\"ascended\\" by the avanced beings into a being of energy. Still, the topic of what post-Darwinian evolution might mean to us in the near future is not really developed at all.On the other hand, a book I recently read and strongly recommend, Beyond Future Shock by Alaniz, picks up where Clarke coldly left off. Like 2001, it is a strong science fiction book. Starting in WWI, tracking the lives, romances, struggles and triumphs of several infant Germans who will live through WWII, the Cold War, and into the age of youth cocktails when these \\"kids\\" are in their late 90s, Alaniz tracks the science behind the coming transhuman age with masterful, subtle \\"Clarkian\\" writing. He also tracks the potential perils, and the problem of Luddism and religion versus science. As you sink deep into Alaniz's powerful imagery, you will find yourself thinking about mankind's various potential fates in the coming few decades: some horribly dystopian some reasonably utopian. Singularity (read the new book by Kurzweil) will soon be upon on us.For me, Alaniz has finished with genius what Clarke only touched upon in 2001. I am fully sastisfied at last.Paul"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Reading the sequels to 2001 is a painful experience, and this one is the best of a bad lot. As a stand-alone novel, it actually has considerable merit. Clarke still shows a powerful and provocative imagination, and the events that unfold still manage to fill us with wonder. However, this is achieved at the cost of demolishing other, more central wonders, for no better reason than to service the plot.2001 was a supremely intelligent work. I don't mean that it was written in intelligent sounding phrases or possessed the convolutions that pass for intelligence among the sophisticated. I mean that it respected our intelligence. It gave us room to reach our own conclusions. It never channelled our thinking along furrows already ploughed into the mental landscape. The most important skill that a writer can cultivate is to reveal just enough to provoke thought, but to respect the reader enough to leave the actual thinking to us.Therefore, the star-child's actions were left for us to interpret. The reason behind HAL's mutiny was left to our imagination. The nature of the mentor race was left to our own speculation. Most importantly, the ways in which humanity would change in the wake of the star-child's awakening were left to our own musings. We were left with a sense of awe and something akin to a spiritual awakening. Would we become a better race? Would we leave our earthly cradle and join a cosmic community? Would our focus change from an ingrown provincialism to an outreaching cosmopolitanism? For that matter, did the star-child rid the world of its orbiting nuclear weapons to give the human race a fresh chance, or did it destroy humanity because we were beyond redemption?This is the essence of good science fiction: to leave us with lingering reflections long after the final chapter is finished. How discouraging then, to have the mysteries laid bare, and our own reflections directed along the confines of some dried up mental riverbed. 2010, for all its cleverness, punctures our imaginings. The star-child turns out to be a mediocre messenger boy, the progenitor race is arrogant and aloof, and humanity doesn't change at all.Certainly, there are other imaginative developments to replace these, but do they really belong in the universe of the original work? The developments in 2010 could easily have been written for an independent novel and the result would still have been pure Clarke. Here, the wonder of the present work is achieved by destroying the wonder of the earlier work, and this is a bad trade.If you don't care about the earlier novel, you won't be disappointed by the developments in this one. The plot, themes and imagination are all up to Clarke's usual standards. But if you are like me, you will find the reading experience greatly diminished by the realisation that these achievements were made at the expense of a higher and more inspiring vision."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This very engrossing sequel to 2001 once again brings us to the distant planet of Jupiter (now the second sun in our solar system). Although most sequels do not measure up to their predecessors, 2010 exceeded all my expectations for a follow up. I was taken to the outer reaches once again through the wonderful prose of Arthur C. Clarke. I felt like a child again full of wonder and imagination as I read this book! After a while, the printed words became a blur and it felt as though I was actually there experiencing the thrills along with the explorers! Thanks Mr. Clarke for giving me my imagination I thought was lost after I &quot;grew up&quot;. I guess youre never too old to imagine! To all who have enjoyed 2001 or any other SF work, you will definately enjoy 2010: Odyssey Two!"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010 brings the approach of a second Cold War between the United States and Russia, and at the same time, a problem is raised when the Discovery's orbit is decaying and risks a crash on Jupiter's moon, Io. Heywood Floyd, the director of the Discovery mission in 2001, is sent on the Russian ship Alexei Leonov to help stabilize the doomed space station. His other mission objectives is to solve the mysteries between HAL 9000's malfunction and the status of David Bowman after the encounter with TMA-2, or Big Brother, a gargantuan version of the monolith found on the Moon. And even more questions develop when the Chinese ship Tsien comes in contact with life on Europa.The characters are very believable, with a few good lines from Max. &quot;'Not to worry,' said Max cheerfully. 'All that will be gone when you wake up. It's--what do you say?--expendables. We'll eat your room empty by the time you need it. I promise.' He patted his stomach.&quot; (pg. 31) The plot develops quite rapidly, with strange new conflicts in every section. The author also gives excellent descriptions of what could be true behind many planets' and moons' secrets. &quot;The core of Jupiter, forever beyond human reach, was a diamond as big as the Earth.&quot; (pg. 190)Clarke tells the story very well, and everything seems to flow evenly, quite the contrary to my expectations. This book is never boring, and will keep you reading until your eyes bleed (or you finish the book, which ever comes first). The ending is not at all sudden, and it leaves the story wide open for more. Of course, Clarke has taken advantage of this fact in the sequel 2061, but that's beyond this review. This is a must-read for any Sci-Fi fan."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"In every way, this book is worthy to succeed the masterwork2001: A Space Odyssey. That is quite a rare thing, considering the hype and standard that its predecessor set.Like the predecessor, this book is prophetic. In 1980's, only had the single-shot Apollo-Soyuz mission to build on. Now joint Russo-American spaceflight are standard operating procedures. But that is the job of science fiction--to blaze the trail.I was surprised how well this book read. Either Clarke's style has improved immensely since penning or he is free to tell his own tale without the obsessive-compulsive perfectionist Stanly Kubrick constantly nit-picking, as described inThe Lost Worlds of 2001. Maybe it is a little of both. Either way, this book was a breeze to read. Really, this book wanted to be read.There are several discontinuities, however, that let me down. Not just the flip-flop of Saturn to Jupiter. Nor Clarke tweaking the story to bring it scientifically up-to-date--in fact, I appreciate him doing this.The greatest strength of the \\"2001\\" books is that they take current science and take it a few steps into the future. So unquestionably you are getting science fiction, but it is realistic enough that you feel that NASA could announce any one of these programs in the next few months. As the blurbs on the flyleaf of the original run of 2001 said, , \\"You are commander of the USS Discovery . . .\\" It felt exactly like that!The plot was squishy at times, and if Clake had done one or two more reivison, I imagine he would have gotten closer to the film version2010: The Year We Make Contact, which had the better plot and plot twists.But what bothered me are the changes that are really retroactive continuity changes. For example, Bowman is no longer the godling Starchild, but something less. The analogy of \\"pet dog\\" and an ever-present \\"leash\\" (Ch. 38) are a far cry from benevolent Clindar of the early drafts found in \\"The Lost Worlds of 2001.\\" Remember that Bowman is a mirror character to Moon-Watcher. After getting the brain boost from the Monolith, each says the same thing \\"he was mater of the world, but he was not quite sure what to do next. But he would think of something.\\" Now Bowman is a lapdog.Also, Clarke paints himself into a logical corner. If Dave Bowman is \\"beyond love and hate, desire and fear\\"(Ch. 36)--the things that make us quintessentially human--, and if the Firstborn are in danger of evolving into \\"the stupefying boredom of absolute omniscience\\" (Ch. 52), they why bother with cultivating intelligence? The point of the monoliths is--admittedly in an indirect way--to stupefy intelligent species? Why bother to climb the top of the evolutionary ladder, if there is nothing at the top?And then there is the assumption that omniscience is stupefying. Why does Clarke believe this? Where is his hard data?I mention these three caveats solely because they are the cracks in the franchise's foundation.2001: A Space Odysseyis euphoric,2010: Odyssey Twois idealistic,2061: Odyssey Threeis optimistic, but3001 The Final Odysseyends up sarcastic. This book marks the beginning of the under-the-breath dread that rapidly crescendos into a scream. I would like to look the other way in this subtle matter, but I cannot. I respect the stores to well not to say something."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010 is one of the rare cases where the sequel is almost as good as the original - in some ways it is even better.There are some quibbles of course. In building on 2001, Clarke chose to follow the movie rather than the book (hence Jupiter instead of Saturn, the recap of Bowman's conflict with Hal gives the movie dialog and so on). Also, 2001 was almost austere in its simplicity. Dialog and character development were skeletal. The reader was positioned as an external observer - in that sense, 2001 was a challenge to the reader. 2010 is dumbed down in a sense. Character development (never a Clarke strength) is marginally better than 2001 but the dialog is plentiful, making it a far easier read. Not a criticism, one just misses the simplicity and elegance of 2001.Having said that, 2010 can easily claim to be one of the landmarks of science fiction. Imagination has always been Clarke's forte and the way he comes up with the various ideas of primitive life on Europa, the proto-sun of Lucifer and so on are nothing short of brilliant. The story line builds on 2001 and takes us further down the road, telling us more about David Bowman, the monolith and the intelligence behind it. All with a very human touch to it - witness the fate of the Tsien.And as always, Clarke uses his trademark sly humor and simple analogies to make technical concepts easy to understand. Language has always been Clarke's second strength and he paints superb pictures with words, describing the spacescape, the flight of the two ships, the exploration of Jupiter, Io and Europa (in fact fans of Clarke will recognize the Jupiter descriptions from his earlier short story classic \\"A Meeting with Medusa\\"). A very good book."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I started reading 2010 right after finishing 2001, which was confusing because many of the details were different. Instead of being on one of Saturn's moons, the black monolith is suddenly orbiting Jupiter. There were a few other details that were jarring. Clarke explains in the beginning that he decided to base 2010 on the movie 2001 instead of the book, which makes it tough for us readers to keep things straight.That said, however, I have to admit that I loved the book. One of the things I loved most about it was the imagery. The descriptions of Jupiter, Io, and Europa made me run to the library to try to find more books about these heavenly bodies. Clarke made the appearance of life on Jupiter and Europa seem highly plausible, even probable, and I was intrigued by the shapes this life took.At one point Dave Bowman reappears to warn the crew of impending danger. I thought that was a nice human touch, and I especially liked the way Dave was able to visit Earth and say goodbye to people and places he had loved.I would recommend reading 2001 first; I didn't feel like 2010 was a stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2001 is one of the greatest novels written by Arthur C. Clarke but 2010 is even greater. It is perhaps the best of them all! Before I read this book I had strongly suspected that it would be a weak attempt to follow up on one the greatest sci-fi stories ever written but I was mistaken. Fortunately, because this novel explains much of the stuff from 2001 which weren't that clear in the first place all the while it expands the odyssey universe to an extend that is even greater in scope than in the first novel. The only negative thing there is to say is that the first half of the novel is a bit technical. Some of the things going on can be a bit tedious I think but this is entirely made up for in the second half which, for my part, is probably the best work of fiction I have ever read! Clarke's imagination is apparently infinite and it is no wonder that he has recieved the status of both guru and prophet."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Filled with intrigue, suspense, and the one and only HAL computer, &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; is a incredible sequel to its predecessor &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Learn more about Heywood Floyd and what actually happeded to Dave Bowman in the Monolith, how our solar system will be forever changed. Pick up and read this book right away"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"As with 2001, Arthur C. Clarke has titillated our imagination with a book that is accessible to the non-scientist yet cloaked in an air of authenticity that leads us to ask: \\"Could this really happen?\\"2010 focuses mainly on the execution of a follow-up space mission designed to investigate the mysterious events that took place in 2001. There are several plotlines that hold our interest; beyond the human interactions of the Russian/American crew, there are a series of unexpected twists which, despite their dramatic nature, avoid the cheesy artificiality of a Hollywood movie plot.For one thing, China has sent a spacecraft to the same location at the same time in an apparent attempt to further nationalistic goals. For another, life is discovered within our solar system. Meanwhile, the interactions of Hal's creator, Hal's successor, and Hal are suggestive of a possible repeat of the \\"mad computer\\" plotline that was so chillingly exectured in 2001. Also, the being that once was Dave Bowman is floating around earth, and the black monolith springs into stunning action when it's least expected. In all, it's a very event-filled book.In the end, as in 2001, we are left with as many questions as answers, for that is the nature of the scientific universe that Clarke portrays.One of the things that I love about these novels is that scientists are presented as heroes, and yet they don't have to turn into musclebound ass-kickers to achieve that status. Clarke demonstrates that there is nothing more heroic, and more peculiarly human, than a battle of wits played against a vast and indecipherable universe. The human ingenuity that is brought to bear on the problems is, to me, so much more entertaining than reading about a brutish protagonist using force to blast his way through all obstacles.And Clarke also shines in his ability to realistically portray the practical workings of scientific advances that have, to date, eluded us. Human hibernation, for example, is something that scientists are currently researching enthusiastically, and is a facet of many scifi projects. But Clarke makes human hibernation seem feasible without compromising either entertainment value or authenticity.One weakness that Clarke struggles with, here as in his other books, is realistic character interaction and dialogue. To me, too many of the spoken lines sound like contrived speeches or forced witty banter that is too pat to sound real. At times, I get the feeling that Clarke's characters are articulating his own philosophies or ideas. That they do so is fine, but that they sound like they're doing it is a problem.Despite this flaw, I think that any reader would enjoy reading this great sci fi novel. It does work as a stand-alone, but reading 2001 first makes the experience much better. I recommend that you read them both."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The characters in 2010 are a little more \\"real\\" than the ones in 2001. You get Heywood Floyd's personal struggles and emotions, not just one single part with him in as in 2001. The ideas in 2010 are eerily real: joint US/Russian space missions at odds with the Chinese (who have sworn than, by 2010, they will land on the Moon I kid you not). We explore a little more of Hal and the Monolith and some questions are answered that were not answered in 2001.Overall this was a more than worthy sequel to 2001. I highly recommend it. Much better than its movie counterpart."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This, the second book in the Space Odyssey saga, is a fine return to the universe Arthur C. Clarke created with &quot;2001&quot;, only this time we are not allowed to travel to the far reaches of space and reality itself, but to stay at the vicinity of the silent and enigmatic giant monolith.2010 is a book very different to 2001 in nature, although the main idea remains the same, but unlike the previous chapter in the saga, this book is not without flaws. To be honest, it only has one single failure: The location of the monolith. Clarke explains this happens due the fact that mostly everyone is familiar with the movie's (2001) setting, while the book's location is left somewhere in oblivion.Although it was quite nice from Mr Clarke's part to write a whole book, that was the logical follow up of the previous, based on the settings of the original movie to make things easier for the ones who were not familiar with the original book, 2010 remains a sequel of 2001 the book, not the movie, and should have occurred on the original settings.But taking this aside, this is a great story and highly recommended"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This is a very difficult review to write. Why? Well, before I get down to it, let me say that the film version of &quot;2001&quot; SHOULD HAVE BEEN the only story released. No books, No sequels! (One of the main reasons for this is that I prefer mystery over the always &quot;too easy&quot; answers. For example, I'd rather always wonder why HAL did what he did, rather than have them tell me). In spite of all that, this is actually a pretty good book. The creepy manner in which the often overrated Clarke deals with the fate of the Tsien journey is astounding, to say the least.( I wish this would have been done in the otherwise good movie version). The main part of the book, the journey to Jupiter, is made interesting by the fascinating characters and the growing animosity between them. Not to mention thenice way the tension in Dr. Floyd's family is handled. But,I have one more tiny problem with the book. Since the novel version of &quot;2001&quot; dealt with a mission to Saturn, shouldn't the novel version of &quot;2010&quot; have done the same? Instead of Europa and Io, they could have explored Japetus and Titan? It wouldn't really change the story but would have kept the continuity.(Again another minor failing by Clarke). Conclusion: yes, as far as the novels go &quot;2010&quot; is better than &quot;2001.&quot; Clarke's &quot;2001&quot; severly &quot;dumbed down&quot; Kubrick's great story. In &quot;2010: Odyssey Two,&quot; however, he puts together a decent Sci-Fi story."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first book. It is very similar and builds heavy on the concepts without simply being a rehash."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Each time I venture back into the world of science fiction I'm reminded how much I love it. The sheer inventiveness of the authors, creating entire species and technologies fascinates me. As of right now (in my brief exploration) Clarke is so far one of my favorites.He doesn't sacrifice characterization to get the sciencey parts across. In both of his books I've read he creates deep feelings about the characters, positive or negative (even for the computer-HAL). In other sci-fi books I've read it's all about the story and the tech and the characters fall flat, but Clarke manages to do both.One of the reviews on the front calls it \\"sweeping\\", and that to me is the best definition I could find for this dazzling sequel. It isn't just fantastic, or inventive, it literally races across the solar system so fast at times I found it hard to keep up with it; it feels like flying. The book makes you question, and wonder, and imagine if these things could be possible. Not only am I constantly astounded by the author's creativity, I'm surprised by the creativity it sparks in myself.Granted science fiction isn't for everyone. It can at times be a little dense and hard to grasp, requiring a little bit of rereading. But it definitely is an amazing feeling to be taken completely out of the context of any other genre and forcing your brain to read in a new way. It's like trying to do things with the opposite hand you normally do-not hard, but definitely a challenge."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The first book in this series left off with an intriguing idea that answered some questions but left open open many more possibilities. 2010: Odyssey Two, the second book in the series, takes us back to the same realm of space to seek out more answers. The book picks up where the movie version of 2001 left off, not the book. While both are very closely associated, Clarke chose to make this adjustment based on the new set of knowledge of Jupiter's moons from the successful Voyager launches. This however takes nothing away from the story-line and Clarke makes the transition seamless.Clarke contained all the elements of the first book in this one, the most noteworthy being his adherence to real science and exceptionally accurate depiction of physics. The story is equally imaginative with more mind expanding ideas making this one a very worthwhile sequel. Although it is a bit dated given the focus on Soviet/US tensions, the aspects of the space program are so believable and credible that they easy overcome any other shortfalls. While the year 2010 may have passed, one can easily push this story-line a mere 25 or 50 years ahead and be right back into believable territory. Without question 2010: Odyssey Two is a fine sequel to the original and well worth the time."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Arthur C. Clarke is an excellent writer, and this book is a good read. But basically it's the same book as 2001. In the version of the book I read, Arthur C. Clarke has written an interesting preface. There I got to know that 2001, actually was developed simultaneously as both a movie and a book. Eventhough 2001, the book, is good, it's properly one of those rare situations where the movie is actually better than the book. Another fun thing I read in the preface to 2010, was that when the dark side of the moon for the first time was observed by the human eye, by the astronauts in the end of the 60's, the astronauts were very close to make a joke when they send their first message back to the Earth, they considered: \\"Oh my god we see an immense black monolith!\\", but eventually they chose to well-behave in the historic moment, and did not send that message;-) It's interesting to compare a sci-fi writer as Arthur C. Clarke to another sci-fi writer as Jules Verne. It seems like Jules Verne was underestimating the future. What we have seen in our time far surpasses the visions he had in \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\", \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" and \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\". On the other hand a writer like Arthur C. Clarke's visions have been too bold, today, April 1. 2012, we are nowhere close to make computers like HAL 9000 and we are nowhere close to make spaceships and space travels as he describes them. I actually think Arthur C. Clarke went wrong there, he shouldn't have dated his vision 2010, that's far too optimistic!"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"One quirk of 2010 the novel is that it references 2001 the movie rather than the Clarke's own novel; this is telling. Where the joint venture between Kubrick and Clarke succeeds due its awe-inspiring vision of deep space exploration before it existed, accompanied by Kubrick's visualizations that changed the face of science fiction movies, the solo project of the sequel was penned after space travel had become a reality. It is often dulled down by the logistics, even those aboard the spaceship Leonov become desensitized to the wonders of the universe. What I enjoy about Clarke's work is the science behind the science fiction as he tries to solve the problems of space exploration, such as using water from Jupiter's ice moon to refuel a hydro-propulsion drive. What I miss from his original novel is the mix of science, anthropology and philosophy in questioning our existence and evolution alongside the mysteries of the universe and our quest for understanding; this is not evident in this much chattier sequel. Although an interesting voyage, it does not rival the original 2001."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"This book is, in my opinion, one of the few cases where the best book in a series is NOT the first one. I think that this book is a lot better than 2001, and I think I know why. 2001 was based on a screen play by Stanley Kubrick. This book was not based on a screen play, and this let A.C.C. take more liberties with it. It has plenty of plot twists, and the whole shape of the book gets turned around in the middle. I definetly reccomend it, although you should probably read 2001 first"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The differences between the book 2001 and 2010 can be distracting at first, considering Discovery and the Monolith were at Saturn in the book 2001 and not Jupiter, but other than that this is an excellent book and part of the best sci-fi series in existance."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Brilliant! This book is really REALLY good, exciting and engrossing! I could hardly stop reading it the whole weekend! A brilliant follow-up to 2001! I heartily reccommend you buy this even if you're not a big sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"I must say this is a jolly good book. Not as exciting as 2001, though. I give 2001 a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10, and i give 2010 a 9.3. The plot is very nice, and it's not as suspensful as 2001, and it's a lot more down to earth, but that doesn't make it bad. So basically if you like sci-fi, and liked 2001, you will like 2010 also."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Arthur C. Clark presents a thrilling grasp of the infinate in this timeless novel. He combines imagination and science to create a dazzling display of time and space's eternal mysteries. He takes you on a journey from the remote past to the near future, and touches on that fragile subject- is there life on other worlds? From the firey fury of Io to the frozen ice of Europa, from the fragile wisps of gaseous creatures in the atmosphere of Jupiter down to its diamond core, Arthur C. Clark shows the dazzling splendor of what might be. I encourage you to read this book, especially if you have read 2001. 2010 prompted me to look up at the stars and think- &quot;What is really out there?&quot;"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Amazing. The only thing you can say is amazing. I often worry about sequels, but this went above and beyond all of my hopes and dreams. Arthur C. Clarke has woven together a story that not only compliments the original MOVIE, but adds so much more. We now understand the Space Baby and what the hell it's doing looking at Earth.We were told so much more...there's no way you can not like this book. Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant.A shame the motion picture 2010 was such a terrible waste of time....someday I shall redo it myself...(I wish) and I'll say, &quot;Arthur, Stan, I've made you guys a sequel you can be proud of!&quot;"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"2010:Odyessy Two is probably A.C.Clarke's finest novel; in his work prior to this book the narative and plotting is regularly great, but the characters are one dimensional stereotypes (ie A Fall of Moondust and Earthlight); later novels are mostly irrelevent character development and playful speculation for which the story is more or less a weak excuse (eg The Ghost of Grand Banks and the awful Cradel). 2010 nicely strikes a balance between the two trends, making it the best of the Odyessy quintet. It's most important aspects is its believiblity; you get the feeling this is what the people and methods of real space exploration will be like; and the sense of granduar Clarke maintains throughout. You are left with a definite sense of new, and real, worlds in this book; and the view from the other side of the alien Monolith preserves the mystery of its creators, without confusing the reader. And although it is now dated in terms of technological development (things are happening a lot slower than in the book) and politics (although not as much as the rather unsatisfactory film version!), the science is still good, as NASA, now flying the Galileo-Europa Mission, will attest. Here's hoping...!"},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"Frankly, this book is not as great as 2001: A Space Odyssey. In fact, I wonder if anybook can match 2001. Still, I loved this book as a fiction, and I read it several times. This book has almost everything that one can ask. ps: you may read 2061, but NEVER read 3001! I think Arthur C. Clarke was blackmailed to write this book."},{"Title":"2010: Odyssey Two","review":"The best book I've ever read!! I want to go to Jupiter because of it.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of this masterpiece is Clarke's wonderful descriptions of Jupiter and its moons...his words make you think &quot;WOW!

Having read this book, I will never look at a picture of Jupiter, or any planet, moon, etc. with only passing interest..."},{"Title":"Le Portrait De Dorian Grey (French Edition)","review":"This is a must read classic, I really love it, it describes how futile is the human being.How a person misses a chance to be happy because of pointless pride."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Machine Embroidery (Creative Machine Arts)","review":"As always, Ms. Fanning specialises in the head slapper in this book. Every time I go back through it I feel like an idiot for not having thought of some of the simple and (once pointed out) obvious techniques she describes. Whatever sort of embellishment you are planning, chances are there is something in this book to make the process easier and more effective. And when you are not sewing, the book is fun to read!

I unwrapped it, showed her the book and she did a \\"OoOOOO!\\" face and crawled to me and we sat down and read the book.Mesmerized. The pages are colorful, the rhymes are fun and tuney. I ADORE these books. Ever time I turned the page she will open up her eyes to take in all the colors and I would watch her eyes dart from side to side to see the pictures. Then would babble something about the picture.. then would want to turn to the next page. I love love LOVE how each page I turn the colors are a little bit different, the scenery is different so there is a nice contrast been the page you are on and to the next. There is also a 'dark' page towards the end of the book where it is night time, she loves this page too (also in the other two books) I truely recommendd this book its amazing.

The rhyming is so catchy that we both had it memorized by the first or second week.

Each page has a flap to lift but the only thing under each of them is one ant. I didn't exactly see how that fit into the story. The pop-ups are cute though but some of the word choices just didn't appeal to me. For the chimpanzees and the snake, it describes what they eat or how they eat - I just didn't find it suitable for a young child. For instance, \\"we munch each other's fleas\\" and \\"squashes then swallows his prey....they do taste much better that way\\". I'm scared that kids will go squash animals for fun now! In addition, it describes the elephant as being \\"fat and round\\" - do we really want our children to think of people or animals as \\"fat\\"!?

All the stories in volume 5 up to the end of August were written and laid out by Eisner, who also probably did some pencils, and perhaps even a little inking. Most of the penciling was done by Lou Fine and inks were by Fine and various assistants. The excellent and visually stunning story of August 23, 1942 was scripted and pencilled by Eisner and inked by Fine, who also signed his name in the last panel, the only time he signed a Spirit story. It is as good as anything Eisner did before the post-war period. Manly Wade Wellman wrote the next 3 stories and also the October 18 story and these 4 were penciled by Fine and inked by John Belfi. Eisner also wrote and did layouts for the remaining stories through November 8 plus the December 13 story and his hand is clearly present in the art. Other stories were written by Wellman or Bill Woolfolk, penciled by Fine and inked by various staff artists at Quality Comics. So there are 10 stories out of 26 that Eisner didn't have anything to do with, but they were done by talented writers and artists who hadn't yet become jaded with the chore, something that seems to me had happened by two years later. So don't pass on this volume. There is some truly excellent writing and art by Eisner here. If you liked the first 4 volumes, you are going to like this. If you like Eisner, this is not to be missed.Comprehensive writing and art credits for the whole run of the Spirit, unfortunately lacking in the Archives themselves, are available on the internet."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Volume 5, July 5 to December 27, 1942","review":"I just want to correct a previous reviewer.

His most important work is the Spirit. The Spirit Archives series has brought together all of his work, that was printed in a weekly newspaper insert. However, after the work found in volumes 1 and 2, Eisner was called to active duty and served in the army during World War II. The Spirit carried on, but it was drawn by other artists. Eisner's work does not pick up again until the stories found in Volume 12 of the Archives series. The work in Volumes 3-11 is fine, but it is not the work of Will Eisner."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Volume 5, July 5 to December 27, 1942","review":"This book covers The Spirit Sunday comic strip from July, 1942 to December, 1942. Spirit creator Will Eisner had been inducted into the Army in May of 1942, so he didn't draw any of the comics here. He managed to contribute a few scripts, but not too many. Scripts were written by Manly Wade Wellman, Alfred Bester, William Woolfolk and possibly others. Most of the artwork was handled by Lou Fine, who was no Will Eisner, but was a great artist in his own right.

True, it perhaps bit off more than it could chew, but what the heck, it was a really good effort on the part of the authors, who have written on everything from fast food toys, to action figures to non-sport trading cards and comic books. What this book really needs, however, is an update. With the explosion (and implosion) of the late '90s in the comic book field, and the new comic book movies of the early 21st century, I'm sure that there is a ton more stuff that could be added."},{"Title":"Comics, Collectibles, and Their Values","review":"Well this book gives out the basic values of almost every comic collectible ever made.

If you want a fictional account of a blues legend, try August Wilson's &quot;Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.&quot; Trouble is, Kay tries to accomplish all three in the space of less than 200 pages. Smith's life was bigger than fiction, and FUN to read about. At best, this book will whet the appetite. But read it fast and move on..."},{"Title":"Bessie Smith (Outlines)","review":"For the person looking to just scratch the surface in understanding the Empress of the Blues, &quot;Bessie Smith (Outlines)&quot; hits the mark, giving the highlights and lowlights of her life and career. Perhaps, &quot;Outline&quot;, the name of this book series, is an appropriate name given the length and depth of the book. For the Bessie diehards or those that want real depth, the book doesn't offer anything new or particularly insightful. Read the Chris Albertson book if you want the best bio on Bessie. Also, Kay annoyingly interjects fictional passages into the story, making it difficult to determine fact from fiction. I found that aspect irratating, particularly in a book so short. The back cover presents the Outline series as exploring the impact homosexual life has had on certain aritsts. Kay misses this point entirely. She actually avoids Smith's alleged homosexuality. It is a short (150 small size pages, large font) and easy read though."},{"Title":"Bessie Smith (Outlines)","review":"A beautiful melody of a book, Bessie Smith by Jackie Kay evokes the life of the great blueswoman through a provocative interweaving of fact, poetry, blues lyrics, and imaginings. It is also about the awakening of a young girl's (the author's) sense of herself as female and black. If you prefer dry facts only, or are doing serious research, look to another biography. If there's a bit of repetition in this book, well, think about the blues. If you want to immerse yourself in Bessie's blues, read this book in one sitting, and read it out loud. Then getout your old vinyls and a bottle of gin, and read it again."},{"Title":"The Finding of the Third Eye","review":"Vera Stanley Alder speaks about the conitued evolution of man's consciousness in a manner any one can appreciate and understand. This book was first printed in 1938 and for that time period her knowledge and depth of spiritual awareness can easily match and even outrank many of todays &quot;new age&quot; authors including Chopra and Heller . Vera's information is so well researched and unbiased it cannot help but allow you to free your mind to explore the vastness of the Spirit undefined by man's religons but by looking into the wisdom of the ancients . I would have loved to have met her in person. She is definitly one of the &quot;Great Teachers&quot; to roam the earth . I recommend this book without reservations for all brothers and sisters seeking knowledge of Life and Spirit but more importantly ...TRUTH .To the great people at Amazon.com find all her books if you can ...they won't stay with you for long . Guaranteed ."},{"Title":"The Finding of the Third Eye","review":"This book contains many topics grouped as chapters eg \`Secrets of Sound', \`Secrets of Colour', \`Secrets of Breathing', \`The science of numbers' and \`Diet & exercise' etc. Within each of these chapters there are many topics covered. I would suggest using the \`Search inside this book' feature to see more of the contents of this book. If you are new to esotericism, I'd say that this could be an interesting book to start with. Having said this though, this book does allude to some esoteric truths of great importance.I didn't really get into the first part of the book, even though there was some interesting information. I preferred part 2 of this book (pages 127-185) as it had a greater depth and focus. Much of this book was non-specific towards what the title of the book stated i.e. \`The finding of the third eye'. Chapter 13 \`The third eye' (pg 127) did devote 12 pages to this subject however. I did like the chapter on \`The history of the wisdom', as it gave a very interesting esoteric history and provided me with some books to source of which I was not aware of i.e. \`The laws of Manu' and \`Avesta'. I also loved the following from this chapter, \\"The greater path of the Egyptian consciousness was concentrated upon the path of attainment and the evolution of mankind\\" and \\"Book of the dead... They considered each human being as living with one goal in view, that of perfecting his character in earthly life in preparation for his journey through the \`nether' world or astral planes, and his gradual process through the subtler planes to \`paradise' or the heaven-world, helped by the various workers and representatives of the spiritual hierarchy\\" pg161. If at any point you wonder why you are here, you might want to take a closer look at this last paragraph again. If we all had this realisation and goal in mind, I'm sure the world would be a better place.I also appreciate this book for clarifying and confirming a practice given to me by the Gnostic group I attend i.e. \`The retrospection' pg 146. Having said this, I think it important to note that there are hardly any practical exercises contained in this book, especially when it comes to awakening the third eye. I would however have to agree with the review at the back of the book when it says, \\"She made it her task to simplify and summarise this knowledge in order to present it to others\\"; of this she obviously had a talent.On the whole I liked this book even though I did not accept all the views of the author; most were good however. I was a little concerned with the book containing information that I had already obtained from other esoteric books, this was especially so regarding the first half of this book.You can tell from this book that the author has done a good deal of research. The bibliography contains books from such great authors as H.P.Blavatsky, Alice Bailey and Gerald Massey etc. These days I find myself leaning towards authors who have had real spiritual experiences verses authors who write from second hand knowledge. This is my frustration however, an internal frustration as I make the transition from sourcing the Gnosis of others to experiencing my own.On the whole a nice book; for greater depth I would recommend the writings of Samael Aun Weor."},{"Title":"The Finding of the Third Eye","review":"This book by Vera Stanley Alder is a very good introduction to the western esoteric traditions.It was written in the 1930's and reflects a lot of the thinking in occult /esoteric circles of that time.The author comes from a theosophical background so readers who are already aquaintaned with this line of thinking might find themselves on familiar ground.She ranks definetly amongst the best of the theosophical writers and has a clear and precise way of introducing the assorted subjects in this books.None of the arrogance of some of her fellow authors of these days that tried to sign you up for their group.Very valuable as a starting point to the occult teachings.Although some of the ideas / information may seem a bit outdated it is still better than most modern day books out there.She definetly knows what she is talking about.Also check out \\"Shamballah\\" by Victoria Page and a book by the same title written by Jan v.

Unlike most works on the Civil War, it is not a re-comilation but a new look at an old subject using new evidence. And the evidence is damning -- the authors, all modern day intelligence experts, argue convincingly that the death of President Lincoln was a runaway operation that was designed to kidnap the president and/or blow up the War department. The authors ability to uncover fresh evidence at so late a date is an indication that modern research and analytical techniques used by the intelligence community have a strong and valuable role in historical reseacrh as well. This book is an absolute must read for anyone interested in the assasination of Lincoln, the Confederate Secret Service or historical detective work.MichShul@aol.com"},{"Title":"Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln","review":"\\"Come Retribution\\" is a lengthy and often technically detailed effort to place the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln into the context of Confederate Secret Service operations during the Civil War. The first half of the book lays the ground work by an extended discussion of Confederate intelligence and covert action activities. This discussion highlights the difficulties of reconstructing activities that were highly secret and poorly documented, especially in the chaos of the closing months of the Civil War. The second half of the book is the application of what is known about the Confederate secret service to the events around Lincoln's assassination. What emerges is a more richly nuanced explanation of those events, in which an extended effort to orchestrate Lincoln's kidnapping becomes an assassination plot after the fall of Richmond in April 1865. The gaps in the record, based both on the passage of time and the secrecy in which these actions would have been carried out means the authors must often imply or suggest links in their explanation based on their characterization of the assassination as an organized secret service mission. The motley band of misfits led by an allegedly insane actor found in traditional histories are in this version replaced by a purpose built organization recruited, financed, and directed to some significant degree by the Confederate Secret Service. The authors' explanation is reasonable and plausible, if not fully documented. The writing in this book is sometimes tedious and repetitive, and will be of most interest to serious students of the Civil War and especially of Lincoln's assassination. This book will be of particular interest to those with a background in intelligence or special operations; indeed, a full understanding of the book almost presupposes such a background. Those who choose to favor exotic conspiracy theories about the Lincoln assassination will be disappointed; Tidwell and his fellow authors prefer simpler explanations."},{"Title":"Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln","review":"Although many people today have assumed that Booth acted to kill President Lincoln, Seward and Johnson as an act independent of Confederate complicity, the authors of 'Retribution' document that Booth was well connected with the Confederate special operations unit and agents. The complicated Confederate special operations provided agents not only in Washington D.C. and Maryland but also NYC, Canada and other keys areas inside Union lines. After describing in detail the clandestine activities of the Confederates, the authors outline how the network of agents were implanted that were active in gaining and transferring information but also prepared to support Booth and his companions in the kidnapping of Lincoln aiding his transport through Maryland all the way to Ashland, Virginia and beyond. Unfortunately, definitive proof of the Confederate secret operations may not be explicitly connected to Lincoln's death, it is apparent that Booth was active with operatives in NYC, Canada and agents in eastern Maryland, the flight of his escape. When Booth determined to assassinate Lincoln, there is no conclusive evidence that Confederate authorities approved of his action; however, as the authors point out, the approved element of kidnapping risks death of the object of that kidnapping. In that sense authorities knew with the initial kidnapping plan, that the possibility of Lincoln being killed was a risk does indicate complicity in the possibility of his death. This is a very detailed and well documented book that demonstrates that the Confederate special operations were very active whether in germ warfare with a failed effort to contaminate NYC with yellow fever or to contribute to anti-war sentiment particularly in NYC or even to free Confederate prisoners in the Great Lakes, it is very apparent that Confederate agents were willing to use extraordinary measures to end the war. It's amazing that Lincoln was so vulnerable to being kidnapped or assassination and that he was virtually unafraid, leaving it all to fate as he often rode off alone and refused protection unless coerced upon him. It is ironic that perhaps an unwritten code not to assassinate Lincoln protected him when he was vulnerable during most of the war and just a reasonable complement of bodyguards in the end would have saved his life. While Stanton somberly stated, \\"Now he belongs to the ages,\\" upon Lincoln's death, it appears that Lincoln trusted a higher authority in protecting his life or in determining his time. How good is this book? The author of one of the most recent and acclaimed books on the Lincoln assassination, \\"Blood on the Moon\\" frequently references \\"Come Retribution\\" calling it a great scholarly history on the Confederate spy and special operations network and its activities."},{"Title":"Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln","review":"While not as readable as a novel or even a narrative history, this book is fascinating reading for anyone interested in the subject of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. While everybody and his brother has been accused of killing John F. Kennedy, few have questioned the &quot;lone gunman&quot; theory that John Wilkes Booth was a madman who acted on his own. Some years back there was an inept attempt to blame a conspiracy involving Union secretary of war Edwin Stanton, but no one seems to have thought to explore the obvious possibility of Confederate involvement--at least not since Stanton himself gave up trying to pin it on Jeff Davis shortly after the event. Now this book presents a sizable body of circumstantial evidence to show that, at the very least, the assassination was a last-minute perversion of a Confederate plot to capture Lincoln and thus bargain for its independence, or at least for its soldiers in Federal prisoner of war camps.The book is well written, and the thesis it presents is convincing. No one who has not read this book really understands the end of the American Civil War"},{"Title":"Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln","review":"Come Retribution, is not like a novel but more on the lines of hard line investigative research and I have enjoyed reading this book.I am not a conspiracy theorist, and if I was, there is no amount of information available to me that would change my mind, I prefer to draw my own conclusions.Lately, I have been gorging myself on this time period and it's people, and have become very fond of many of them. I have aquired many heros from both sides of the war and have felt both the joy and the sadness they must have endured during this trying time in our history. I have also, tried to put myself in their shoes and sought out the answers to the question, \\"What would I have done?\\". For those who have questions in regards to Lincoln's assassination, this is a great book that can help illuminate the darkness many have put forth in trying to explain the death of our 16th President of the United States of America. Come Retribution, has helped me to better understand the assassination of Lincoln and those involved. And now I feel I can better draw my own conclusions while also gain a better understanding about Licoln's assassination, the conpiracies surrounding this sad time in our history and the people of that time.My thanks to the authors for the work they have done."},{"Title":"Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln","review":"I read all the reviews on this book, and was really looking forward to reading it. With all due respect to the author, the book is hardly referenced, speculative, and relies on highly circumstantial evidence in support of its thesis: namely, that Lincoln was the victim of a Confederate plot.

It is in my opinion a definitive treatment of the subject of what faith is in the context of THE faith once for all delivered to the saints. Machen writes with theological and practical acumen. His analysis of the Biblical passages referred to are handled with clarity and precision. Yet, this book is surprisingly easy to read. What Is Faith is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who doubts or who is challenged by the unbelief of the present hour. Only the Bible itself can gender faith. But, Machen's work on the subject of faith will assist the wavering, the searching or the believingly challenged individual to rest in the facts of Scripture as the foundation for Faith and thereby entering into peace."},{"Title":"What is faith?","review":"In What Is Faith?, J. Gresham Machen seeks to define the role, nature, and object of the historic Christian faith, as set against that of the contemporary liberal theology of his day. Machen's view was that the liberal versions of faith were not really versions of Christianity at all; they were simply various forms of unbelief. Here is a description of this book by the author himself:&quot;In What Is Faith?, 1925, I tried to combat the anti-intellectualism of the Modernist church--the false separation which is set up between faith and knowledge--and to present the New Testament teaching as to what faith is. That endeavor involved necessarily some treatment of the object of faith, so that the little book contains a brief and summary treatment of considerable portions of Christian doctrine.&quot;"},{"Title":"What is faith?","review":"In the introduction to this text, J. Gresham Machen discusses the need to know things, to know facts, to know view points, before someone can think. A person cannot make educated conclusions without being educated. One cannot form ideas or arguments unless one knows the details that help formulate the thought or the arguments of other individual. Upon what study, what exploration does someone come to a conclusion. One must be able to discern between one's own conclusion, another person's conclusion, and absolute truth. Ideas are formed through emotion, cliche arguments, and utility. It is easy to come to a conclusion devoid of any understanding of the facts or arguments made.One can use vague references to Christian understanding and come up with a theology of sorts that conflicts with the Bible. Do the facts and arguments stated in the Bible used in the formulation of the person's thinking. What the person believes. Yes what the person has Faith in.What is Faith? I have faith in the person of Jesus Christ. Your Faith is summed up in a creed. What is the object of your Faith. If you say Jesus Christ, is your Faith consistent with the facts stated in the Bible and arguments contained in scripture? Do you choose to ignore what is written in the Bible. How do you perceive God's immanence? Is God the whole, is God the whole of the created, or does God exist external to all created, but perceives all and knows all and controls all? Man needs revelation from God to know absolute truth. God's creation is made up of infinite parts, but God does not make up the whole. He exist independently.J. Gresham Machen makes a distinction between Faith in the Father and Faith in the Son. To know each person of the Godhead and how it relates to you. As a created being that has rebelled against the will of God. One who needs a to be reconciled to the Father through the action of the Son. To believe in the Son and repent for ones sins. To Believe what Jesus taught. To believe man is condemned to hell unless he repents. This is what Jesus taught and what is recorded in the Bible. In the book is a long discussion how modern theologians attempt to avoid this fact. Also is a size-able discussion about Justification, atonement, distinction between works that come forth because of Faith and the incorrect concept that works that aid in a persons salvation (the Books argument). Jesus came to die die so you would not have to pay the consequences of sin. J. Gresham Machen goes through extensive arguments with his postmodern critics."},{"Title":"What is faith?","review":"An excellent presentation of the Orthodox Christian Faith, something that is becoming a rare comodity in this age of Apostacy, an age were many just want their ears tickled instead of hearing God's Word of truth."},{"Title":"What is faith?","review":"Faith is confusing to many but Machen spells it out in detail and you come away seeing what Faith is really about. Machen is very logical and he is a great theologian, some would argue his views dated, but most of what he has to say about Faith will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Patton; a study in command","review":"Being written by a former Brittish Major-General, as one would expect, this book tends to get right to the point. You won't find flowing prose or stylish eloquence here, but you will find concise, to the point, factual accounts of America's most distinguised military man of the 20th century.Patton is not romanticized, nor is he criticized, but he is looked at in a most objective account which accurately and succinctly illustrates the full realm of Patton's many extraordinary qualities, as well as the personal attributes which caused him great personal setbacks.Essame clearly illustrates at least 4 different occasions when, had Eisenhower listened to Patton, the war in Europe would have most certainly been brought to a close in less time and with less loss of allied life.For the devout Patton reader, this volume will contain much 'old hat', but for students of history with little knowledge of our greatest General, Essame gives a brilliant reflection of General George Smith Patton. The book has long been out of print, but was widely published and many good used volumes are available."},{"Title":"Patton; a study in command","review":"For whatever reason I dearly like old British authors (I'm an American). There is something about the way they write (or maybe it is the way I read) that makes their books fly by.I think this is a fine book about Patton in WWII. It isn't a full biography, it is exactly what the authors says it is: A Study in Command. The history is good, even if he blows past the unfortunate slogging match outside of Metz, and he gives a great feel for what made Patton the legend he is today. Very highly recommended for anyone interested in Patton or armored warfare in WWII."},{"Title":"Self-taught chess for beginners and intermediates","review":"I actually won this book when I was in the 9th grade at the Utah Jr. Scholastic State Chess Tournament.

Otherwise, it's an enjoyable read, and teeters on the brink of page-turner status.The main plot involves a super-secret sector of the FBI that specializes in bringing down the most lowlife criminals in the country using the most devious possible methods. The only problem is, once apprehended, they become little more than playthings to the nigh-demonic head of the sector, Roland Krutz. Torture, rape, sadism, and ultimately, death...you name it, it's all part of the game. One particular prisoner, Lloyd Potter, is brought into this \\"underworld\\" by mistake, and his wife and a few close friends race against the clock to rescue him before he becomes another victim of the program.This premise sounds intriguing enough, and once all the characters are introduced, the story takes a sharp left (or is it right?) into a hearty \\"good vs. evil\\" story. The team of friends, once assembled, seems less human and more like the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as the story progresses, with superhuman mental capacity, endless wealth, and seemingly limitless resources. (And let's not forget the smarter-than-average rottweiler!)There are a few things that bring this read down a couple of notches, though. First off, the language. There were enough expletives peppering the dialogue to make George Carlin blush, though the author seemed to reserve them for the most evil of the characters in order to magnify their depravity. (Not to say that even the good guys didn't let one slip once in a while, though.) Also, though there were a few parts that were exciting enough to keep the pages moving, some of it read like an encyclopedia. A couple of the characters were quick to flaunt their knowledge of certain subjects, but it served to do little more than show that the author had read up on them and added little to the actual flow of the story.The characters are endearing. The story, while at times a little ridiculous, is entertaining. The climax of the story is quite unexpected, and one of the final sequences actually had me laughing out loud at the end of it.Overall, for a first effort, \\"Artificial Attrition\\" pleased me. There were a few rough spots in the grammar, and Epperson's political views were made abundantly clear, but it didn't detract from the reading. An enjoyable summer suspense."},{"Title":"Floral Crochet (Dover Needlework)","review":"Floral Crochet is a Dover Publications reprint of floral thread designs from the 1940's and 1950's. The introductions states that this book is a compilation of some of the best floral patterns from this period. All of the designs are thread. Designs include bedspreads, table cloths, doilies, edgings, vanity sets, placemats, and pillows. I would not recommend the book to someone new to crocheting with thread. It's a shame this book does not have color photographs it would be a feast for the eyes! The vanity sets were particularly interesting as I have not seen many patterns for them.

She wants to leave the DVD on practically all day! In 2 weeks she has learned more of the songs the kids sing. The songs are all classic songs I learned in Sunday School, many I had forgotten over the years. My daughter loves singing along with the kids and marching or mimicking their actions, and this is one of the few DVDS like this I've found that are actual children singing not teenagers. I will definitely be looking for more DVDS from \\"Miss J\\" and her Sunday School class."},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"One of the unchanging aspects of the world in which we live is that change happens, constantly. And if that's confusing thought, so are our daily lives, as we struggle to find constancy in the often chaotic flow of personal and community activity. Thank God for the church, which never changes! Except that, what fails to change, dies. That's what's been happening in my own church, but I didn't understand the processes involved, and was therefore feeling a bit helpless. Fortunately, God is a great big GOD, and answers prayers. Mine was for insight and wisdom, and this book has provided both. When I first read it, the resonance I experienced was astounding. My church, like so many in America, is a bastion of TRUTH, and yet is failing to touch the lives of the unchurched in our community. And lately, it seems that we are losing the battle even with our own church attenders. What I now believe is that we've failed to be relevant to the lives of the people in our community, including those who have been filling our seats on Sundays. This book is a guided study for change in the spiritual community. It provides motivation and method, and maintains a sound scriptural basis for the process. It is not a bandaid, but a complete course of treatment, not covering over fundamental problems, but forcing them into the sometimes harsh light of honest evaluation and remedy. (Warning: Change is painful, but unavoidable. It will happen. Unless embraced and guided in the right direction, change will happen to you, for the worse, instead of happening because of you, for the better.) I recommend this book highly for all those interested in helping their whole church to obey Christ's command to \\"...Go therefore and make disciples of all nations...\\". Both your church, and you personally, will experience the sense of fulfillment and joy that comes with following Him."},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"One of the best nuts and bolts books a pastor could have in their library.

It is currently out of print (also not currently available through willowcreek.com) so keep your eyes open for a reasonably priced copy, or borrow from a friend. While it is probably worth the $90 that it sometimes goes for here on Amazon.com, I'd suggest you find one to borrow before you drop that kind of money. I also hope they reprint this, and make a few updates sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"There are hundreds of church growth books on the market today, scores of seminars on church health, and a variety of growing, thriving churches that provide models to struggling church leaders. All of these resources provide insights as to what the church should be, but fall short of training the leader of an established congregation how to get there without getting fired or destroying the fellowship in the process. This book is one of the few, invaluable roadmaps available.This title is long overdue -- it addresses how leaders with heads full of new ideas and hearts full of energy can actually bring into reality the things they are envisioning for God's people. This book is not for the church planter, but for the pastor and/or leader of an older, well-established church. The authors present an excellent treatment of how to be a godly change-agent -- it's well worth the price!"},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"Many pastors have sensed a calling to move churches from old ministry paradigms to new forms that will be more effective in the 21st Century. The problem is that such change requires insights and skills that are typically not intuitive and are not taught in most Bible Schools or Seminaries. \\"How to Change Your Church\\" is a much needed resource for pastors who are called to be congregational change agents.The book contains practical and proven strategies for moving a church through a change process. Any pastor on this journey would be wise to glean from the successful and failed efforts of the authors. The bias of the book is toward the \\"seeker model\\" but the principles would hold true for those desiring to move a church in any forward direction.At points the book can lose you in the details but the proven principles and tools of change are worth skimming through the less interesting portions. If you are contemplating being a pastoral \\"change agent\\" do yourself and your church a favor by reading and applying the principles and recommendations from \\"How to Change Your Church.\\""},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"This book remains the most robust resource on organizational change for pastors and churches ever written. As a Lecturer of Management at the Naval Postgraduate School and a leadership development specialist, I'm confident that although the content often transcends typical pastoral reading, it is the most salient book on faith community transitioning ever written. I'm more than confident that it will continue to remain strong as more and more congregations suffer from organizational malaise and go the way of so many dinosaurs and other institutional predecessors."},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"A friend gave me this book to read as I am praying and thinking about church planting or moving to a dying church to revitalize it. Our church would not have much in common with the Willow Creek philosophy of ministry so I expected to see things I disagreed with, but was looking forward to be challenged in unexpected ways. I was right on both counts.To the reviewer who said there are no references to Scripture, I empathize with your concerns about a Willow Creek model, but there are lots of Scripture references in the book. Unfortunately, many of them are taken completely out of context and incorrectly interpreted to make the author's point (e.g. their \\"theology of new\\"), but in many other cases they are helpful and wise such as reminding us of the importance of Eph 4 and 1 Cor 12 type body life during church transitions.I wasn't comfortable with their holding completely secular and pagan theories as equal in authority with the Scriptures (\\"these things have not changed in 40,000 years), since everything changed 2000 years ago, but they do offer some pragmatic ideas that are not unbiblical which will undoubtedly be a help to some people some of the time. Even with this issue, the authors are not trying to disguise these points as biblical (in most cases) and explain why they think these secular concepts are helpful in a local church context.I'm not going to go buy every Willow Creek book I can find as a result of reading this one, but I am glad my friend gave it to me and there were a handful of things that I thought were helpful to me where I am right now."},{"Title":"How To Change Your Church {without Killing It}","review":"All references and resources are to nonchristian or non scriptural sources. I keep expecting Willow Creek to throw a Godapaloozafest."},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"I certainly concur with other reviewers that Charles Whiting has an ax to grind, especially in regard to the American officers. My grandfather was a replacement in the 106th Division who somehow escaped encirclement and ended up in a half-track with the 634th AAA through St. Vith, Hurtgen, Remagen, and finally ending up in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia. My grandfather read the book after I did and he was not impressed with Whiting's rather absolute assessment (to the negative) of the 106th and its commanding officers.Truly, the events that took place on the Belgian-German-Luxembourg front during November and December were dizzying but officers such as Jones and Cavender can not assume as much culpability as Whiting confers. My grandfather was on the front lines during these months and the US Army reacted to the German assault with the resources available at the time. Surely, the men in the 106th and 99th lacked ammunition (especially the ever-critical anti-tank mines that could have slowed down the German counteroffensive), supplies, and food. The weather prevented air support and the fate of the 106th was essentially sealed by nature of their position. Individual units and combat teams performed with distinction throughout this time period along the Ardennes frontier, attesting to the flexibility of the US troopers pointed out by German officers such as Von Luck. The 'British perspective' on the Ardennes campaign was apparent in contrasting philosophies touted by Patton vs. Montgomery, a rift that was ultimately settled by Eisenhower. World War II was not the perfect war that many make it out to be but Whiting should tone down his bias against US officers - from Eisenhower down to Gen. Jones and Col. Cavender. As General Grant exclaimed, 'War is Hell.'For example, he makes the 82nd Airborne look so grand in comparison to the 106th. My grandfather's half-track served with the 82nd Airborne from St. Vith through Hurtgen. Attached remnants were generally assigned the worst duties such as setting up tank traps at night on outlying roads while the 82nd garrisoned in the comfort of the town. Bill Mauldin jokes about these 'garritroopers.' The 106th should not be written off as a bunch of flunkies, milktoasts, and cowards.I would recommend Dupuy's St. Vith: Lion in the Way which provides a more thorough and fair account of the situation, strategically and tactically. I do think that Mr. Whiting makes a good contribution to military history through all his works on the ETO but I hope that the demonizing of US officers is toned down.Respectfully,Frederick J. Lawrence"},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"If you've read one book by Charles Whiting, you've read them all. Literally. I've never encountered an author of history books who so shamelessly plagarizes his own material, down to anecdotes, quotations, even entire paragraphs or pages of text. Large chunks of two other Whiting books I've read, &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Adrennes: the Secret War&quot; are mixed up with &quot;Death of a Division&quot; and some of what is included, most notably the last chapter, are almost completely irrelevant to the story in hand and seem to have been put in because Whiting had the material on hand. Additionally, Whiting has two traits which are not befitting a reputable historian: his obvious blanket-bias against the senior US Army leadership, and his refusal to annotate or footnote his work. When he makes assertions, adduces quotes, or lists figures, he only rarely reveals how he came by the information. Example, when comparing the situation of the 106th US Infantry in the Ardennes to that of the British 1st Airborne division at Arnhem, he states categorically that the British &quot;killed 3,300 Germans.&quot; Now, I have read Cornelius Ryan's &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; and at no point in the book is he able to state German casualty figures with any accuracy at all. And Ryan's research of the Arnhem battle was far more exhaustive than Whiting's was of the battle of the Schee Eifel. Having said all of this, I did enjoy reading &quot;Death of a Division&quot; for two reasons. One, Whiting's writing style is very readable and fast-paced, almost like a novel, and his work on this subject is one of very few in the last 50+ years, which is suspiciously odd considering that the Battle of the Bulge is one of the most documented conflicts in US military history (it is no secret there was a massive, from-the-top-down cover up of the earliest days of the battle, including destruction of documents and falsification of records). His final judgement on the 106th is very harsh, considering the odds they faced, their inexperience, and the apparent failure of any of their senior officers to act in the critical moments, but it does seem that the two regiments in question should have been able to hold out longer, or to break out of the German trap. Both the American and German commands agreed on this....overall, I enjoyed the book as a read, though I am always suspicious of Whitings' motives and his scholarship. I find it curious that none of his books -- and he has written many -- center around the British army in which he served, and his criticisms of Allied commanders always land squarely on the guys from our side of the pond. &quot;Death of a Division&quot; is a quick and easy read that sheds some light on a very shadowy moment in US military history, but I wish somebody more objective and credible would take a crack at it."},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"This book, published in the United States with the title, _Decision at St. Vith_, purports to center on the destruction of the 106th Infantry Division during the first days of the Battle of the Bulge. Whiting, who is a prolific writer of Second World War books, tips his hand, however, in his forward which reveals &quot;malice intended&quot; towards the American high command which was admittedly surprised by the offensive.Whiting, himself a British veteran of the war, criticizes the American command from Eisenhower on down. In doing so, much of the book is unfocused. Whiting is never quite sure whether he is writing a critique of command, an elegy for the 106th Division, or a history of the battle itself. This is a shame, because Whiting is a good researcher, and despite his obvious bias against the American high command, he does have something of value to say about the battle and its conduct.Despite his obvious loathing of Eisenhower and Bradley, Whiting respects the American GI and does not disparage the heroism of individual American soldiers. Quite to the contrary.Part of the value of this book is that it takes up combat in front of and around the vital road junction of St. Vith, Belgium, which was every bit as strategically important as Bastogne. Too many Americans think the Bulge was the stand of the 101st Airborne Division and the winter counter-attack by Patton's Third Army. Whiting's book centers on some of the bitter fighting by unsung units that blunted the impetus of the initial German advance in what was the northern part of the Bulge.This should definitely not be the only book one reads about the battle, but it is informative and gives another, if a somewhat caustic, point of view."},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"Not being familiar with this aspect of the Battle of the Bulge, thought it would be worth the read; book is kind of short, though, and like many World War Two books that I've come across, doesn't appear to be all that well researched. I like detail, extensive research and referencing in order to trust a work of history; this book doesn't have it."},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"This book tells of the effective demise of the 106th infantry division, &quot;the Golden Lions&quot;, during the Battle of the Bulge. Made up of inexperienced soldiers, the group was placed in an area where no action was expected to take place. It was in that area that the Germans launched a massive attack during the start of the Battle of the Bulge. The soldiers of the luckless 106th, for the most part, are either captured or killed but there are individual examples of heroism. For example, an officer who rounds up approximately 50 men and give the Germans a dose of their own medicine. This valient group is later found dead surrounded by the 250 enemy corpses. This book is a must for all military buffs."},{"Title":"Death of a Division.","review":"I was amazed to learn that the U. S. Army could put on the MLR, a Division made up primarily of draftees, etc and with officers lacking combat experience. No wonder the vaunted German thrust practically wiped out the green GI&quot;s. Imagine, not only the excessive casualty rate, but also 5,000 plus American POW. Truly, the lowest point in U.S. Army annals. I realize the author had an axe to grind ,but cold facts say it best. For all the glory of other illustrious American Divisions on the road to Berlin, the demise of the 106th leaves a sour taste to poor adminisration to the [then] JCS, and all others, in the placement of this &quot;innocent&quot; group of GI&quot;s."},{"Title":"The Night of Las Posadas","review":"Mr. DePaola has outdone himself this time.

Elizabeth Canham offers a wisdom of spirituality that is grounded in the classic practices of Benedict, and she helps readers understand that the spiritual practices described by the 6th century Benedict were intended for ordinary working people. Canham structures the book so that we begin with Scripture and then we move to that essential Benedictine spiritual practice of hospitality. Prayer is a foundational discipline that Canham covers, but her conversation about other practices is a treat. She writes with an ease and charm as she yokes manual labor and rest, two spiritual practices that are misunderstood spiritually.Canham seasons her work with her life's experiences. She grew up an evangelical Christian in England and is now an Episcopal priest in the US. She lived in Manhattan and in a monastic situation in rural South Carolina. These experiences make visible the very Benedictine understanding of life as pilgrimage. Her work is well informed. Her understanding of Benedict's insights allow me to take up these practices in a life in which I fend off chaos and disorder. And that seems to have been a part of Benedict's vision in the disorderly 6th century."},{"Title":"Heart Whispers: Benedictine Wisdom for Today","review":"For my small study group of women who faithfully meet on an early morning once a week, this book calmed and directed turbulent souls.

If the reader is a liberal Episcopalian, the reader will probably love the book. However, Heart Wisperers isn't for everyone and might be a disapointment or even offensive for some readers.The book is fairly well written, but not for the general audience of Benedictines. Roman Catholic Oblates would find there are many pages with theological and moral unsoundess.Frankly, what is disapointing, is it wouldn't have taken that much effort to strip out the snipe at the Fundimentalists and tone down the social re-engineering comments. Perhaps in the future Canham will write books that have a broader appeal."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The Book A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, by Betty Smith is a very interesting and loveable story to read about a young girl who has to endure many hardships throughout her life. The story takes place in brooklyn, New York. It starts in the year 1912 and goes through many years till 1919 with the Nolan family. The family is a very fun and loveing even if they have money problems. I loved the book. Once I started reading it I fell in love with the little girl Francie and I just wanted to see what the family would do next. I though this book really captured what it was like for them. It helps you really imaging what was going on almost as if you were there. During the happy parts I felt all warm inside and was so happy foe the characters that I wanted to smile, and during the sad parts I felt like I was going to cry. During the scary parts my heart almost skipped a beat and during the funny parts I couldn't help but let out a laugh. This story really let me connect with the charters and though me how to really enjoy life more. I believe that everyone should read this book. Reading the book was an experience that I knbow everyone would enjoy. The book though me that you don't need all the martial things to make you happy all you need is the people that you love, and the people who love you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book twice in my early teens. I'm 41 now and decided to re-read it when a friend told me she was doing the same. What a treat! It is just as absorbing for me today as it was nearly thirty years ago. In this latest reading I picked up on more of the adult themes of the novel and could more appreciate Smith's writing style. Francie is among the most fully drawn characters of any book I've read. Smith's attention to detail is exquisite as is her ability to convey the conflicts and longings inside so many of the characters. I was also struck by how many of the passages depicted food--which makes sense, since when there isn't enough of it, it is bound to be a focal point. The ending is so touching that I wept, just as I had as a young girl. This is a wonderful story with universal and timeless themes of loneliness, love, poverty and hope."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was just my summer reading book. I picked up the 483-page book and dreaded to begin reading it. In one afternoon i had read 203 pages after being completely captivated by Smith's marvelous story. She presents a life in which every single penny is looked upon as a huge amount of money. I have walked past pennies and haven't bother to pick them up thinking \\"its just a penny who cares\\". Smith creates the setting with a poor district in Brooklyn where a dollar is worth so much. We nowadays spend that much on a King Size Hershey's. I have a fresh outlook on life and on money and its value. Also, on how the Nolan family with so little find joys in the darkest of corners. Truly an amazing story. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends. When Betty Smith wrote this book, she looked back on her life and the experiences she had, and put some of them in her book. It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up.

I dont' ever really remember a chapter when i didn't like this book. I read it in fifth grade which might have been too young for even me, but it was great!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five \\"books\\", each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: \\"Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It's growing out of sour earth. And it's strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong\\" (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919.After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as \\"serene\\", and quoting Francie's observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie's parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie's sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny's brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father's death, and sees her mother's newest pregnancy, which is Johnny's child. She recognizes her mother's apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat.Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie's new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie's new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self.Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary. I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. \\"The tree hadn't died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again...It lived! And nothing could destroy it\\" (483)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has a way of being able to transport you right to the place and time.

It was really hard to find in the bookstore, for it was bought as soon as it was brought in...and my teacher let me borrow hers. Anyway, I read it then, couldn't get past the first page. Then, MONTHS later, I read it.....and fell in love with it. It's a wonderful book, full of emotions. It isn't afraid to show the view of real life, with all its hardships and happiness.

I have to pay her back soon :) I read this at least 10 times! :D"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present when I was 14. Now 15, I have read the whole book twice, and skimmed my favorite parts numerous times. I identified with Francie, because of her many triumphs and hardships while growing up. It has many powerful characters, particularly Katie, who embodies inner strength and dignity.

How he knew I would be drawn to this book, I don't know, but I have read this book at least once a year, for the past 13 years. Each time I read it I find something new, and something that strikes a chord and resonates so profoundly that I see my own heart mirrored in the typeset. I almost think to study this novel in school would do it a tremendous disservice--it is so personal, and subtle, and quietly stirring, that it needs no public dissection.

I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Have you ever had a book that you did not want to end? Because it sucked you in, grabbed your heart, transported you to a place and a time you did not want to leave? If so, you have been lucky. If not, this is the book. It has captivated me since I first read it in middle school, and I read it at least once a year.The title refers to a tree that only grows in Brooklyn. No one plants it, no one really tends it, they don't want it, but there, stuck in the cement, often deprived of sunlight, the tree grows into a thing of beauty. This is the story of Francie Nolan, a child growing up in slums of turn of the century Brooklyn, and her family, Neeley, her little brother, Johnnie, her drunkard father, and Katie, her mother, who works hard and doesn't have time for her dreamy daughter. The story follows Neeley and Francie as they grow up and deal with life's trials and small joys, all while beautifully describing their community in a way that places the reader in Brooklyn and makes you yearn for life to be like that again, even just a minute.I have read other books by Betty Smith, and this is, by far, her best book. Francie is such a lovely, well-drawn character. The reader can not help but feel for her as she deals with the sometimes rough life she has been given. When the children go to the doctor after playing in the dirt all day and a nurse makes rude comments about dirty children, we hurt because Francie hears her and hurts, and cheer her for standing up to the nurse, and, when the children earn a Christmas tree by letting the seller throw it at them (a tradition), we cheer because they've come out ahead in a world where that doesn't happen often. I laugh at the events of their trip to the shore with their father and a neighbor child because it reminds me of the good-intentioned but poorly-executed day trips of my childhood. But we WANT Francie to succeed, for her to be OK in the end. It's hard to find many books that make you care about a character so deeply and this book does it so well.I look forward to the day when I can read this with my daughter and let her discover the beauty of the story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Well written, very interesting account of the times, and family, sad, funny.Read it twice, several years ago first, and now again.A very good read for book clubs."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My school teacher daughter suggested I read this and gave me her paperback. The print was too small for me but I was hooked after the first few pages. Ordered it sent to my iPad and I wish I could stay home from work to finish it! Very descriptive, very insightful, a truely great read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read this classic several tmes during my life. I own hardback and paperback copies of it. The book was published in 1943 and I first read it a few years later, probably when I was 12 or 13. I became so engrossed in the story I once sat on our very small porch rooftop to be like Francie, who read on a fire escape she could reach from her apartment window. The story of young Francie, a voracious reader, who lives in Brooklyn with her poor family - an alcoholic father, an always-exahusted hard-working mother - is one of the best books any woman, young or old, can ever read. When I discovered it was available now on Kindle, of course I bought it. I'm now 76 and can't wait to share Francie's life once more.This is not a child's book. It is about a child who makes her way in a difficult world and neighborhood, with help from unlikely caring people along the way.Thank you to Betty Smith, the author, and to Kindle for making it easily available to thousands of us.Janice Kirkland, Salem, Oregon"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was such a good book. I really enjoyed it. I put off reading it for years - I think mainly because of the title. It just didn't sound appealing to me. As it turns out, it was a great book and I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is an articulate and insightful view into historic Williamsburg.

I highly recommend this classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have plowed through so many boring books over the past several years, but this one was a real gem. They are few and far between, but when you find a book like this, it makes all the others worth reading to get to it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was every bit as good a book as I have ever read. I felt like a friend had walked away from me once I completed it. The characters were never boring,the content took you right into the life of Francie Nolan. It is still hard for me to understand the depth of poverty some children lived in while growing up in Ireland. Frank McCourt's book \\"Tis\\" was very good, this one is just as good. I would and have recommended this book to every avid reader I know."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Wow, this is an excellent example of american historical fiction. I feel as though I am seeing turn of the century Brooklyn through Francie's eyes. If you enjoy fiction with strong characters, details, and bits of history this one is for you. Love it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As I read this book, I find myself wishing that we valued education as much as the characters in the story. It's a great book, a classic, and one on \\"the list\\" of books that I want my kids to read when they are old enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I agree with one of the quotes on the back of this book-that whatever your background is you can find yourself in this book. I can identify with Francie Nolan more than with any other character I have encountered in literature. The story itself is very entertaining and engaging, even as it focuses on the ordinary lives and struggles of everyday, working class people in immigrant rich Brooklyn. The beginning was a little slow, but it quickly became interesting when a background was provided for it. I found everyone of the members of the Nolan family endearing or likeable in some aspect, even the mother. I would definitely recommend this book, its one of my favorites now!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith sure has a way of making the reader connect with the characters. I was very moved by this book. The characters were very likable, especially Francine and her little brother. Reading this brings me back to my childhood years. Although its rather long, don't let the number of the pages discourage you from reading it, the pages fly by faster than you think. I finished it in only a 4 days. Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about twelve years old, and I decided to give it a whirl once again. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it because the magic of reading it is as wonderful and beautiful in your adult years as it was when you were a child. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different and interesting effect on the reader, or at least it had a different effect on me this time around. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in 1912 Brooklyn. Although her life is a constant struggle over money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and beautiful story that people of all ages will love. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree Grows in Brookly will always have a special place in my heart, it along with Maggie-now was given to me by my late grandmother when I was younger. The reader is rooting for Francie and her family to make it through all their hardship that comes there way. The family sticks together and always come through in the end. What a great book. It is perfect for middle and highschool kids to read, it don't have all the bad behavior that's in so many coming of age stories today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I've been singing the praises of the book (and movie) now for many years. It's about time Oprah and everyone else realized what an American classic this is. The story touched me long before I ever lived in Brooklyn, having moved there from the South. It's timeless and so beautifully crafted that you'd be more than a little off not to be moved by it.I actually found the character of the mother more likeable in book than the movie. She came off as a bit too hard and cold for me in the film, but then the policeman came off better in the movie than the book. Both are great--don't get me wrong--but I always enjoy creating the characters in my mind, with the help of the author. And in this case, it wasn't hard to do.The movie often veers dangerously close to something sappy, but is pulled back just in time by a wonderful cast. I didn't experience these problems when reading the book, possibly because I wasn't forced into the pacing of the film.At any rate, the style of writing of this book is excellent and the characters (even the tree!) will stay with you long after you've put it down. Another reviewer was right: \\"They don't make 'em like this anymore.\\"Also recommended: McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood and Fall on Your Knees"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school and only recently read it again. It is (along with Harper Lee's masterpiece) my favorite novel. Betty Smith captures the essence of coming of age in a tough world. She found both the humor and warmth in a life and environment viewed by most as joyless and poor. Francie is a character to be envied, finding and making the best out of a hard life; she stands up to the world and prentends to be nothing but herself. Smith writes with such vividness that every detail and character is a superb imaginitive feat. This book will be a treasure for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was originally published in 1943, it was a huge success, and Betty Smith's book became an instant classic. It is about several years in the life of the Nolan family in the early 20th century and it is mostly about the coming-of-age of the main character, Francie Nolan. It is that rare novel that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.This book very definitely has its own style, I think partly because it was written as a memoir and changed into a novel. Smith obviously poured her heart into this book. Her other novels are charming, but they don't have the depth of this book. Because Smith could fictionalize apparently real people, she could flesh out the characters until they seem like real people, not characters in a novel. Sometimes even minor characters are given thoughts and feelings, as how they relate to the main characters in the book.A strong point of the novel is its sense of place. Smith even describes in detail the neighborhood. the neighbors and everyday life until you feel are actually in the Brooklyn of 100 years ago. The novel opens by describing Brooklyn in 1912:\\"Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only word for it; especially on a Saturday afternoon in the summer.\\"The women are the stronger people in the book. Many of the male characters are weak-willed, while the women persevere. Francie Nolan, the main character, is the daughter of Johnny and Katie Nolan and the sister of Neeley. Francie is a fully-realized character. Francie is a strong person, who you know will do well in life.Katie, the mother, is very hard-working. She cleans apartment buildings for a living. She is scrubbing floors when she is an advanced state of pregnancy. Katie refuses anything that smacks of \\"charity.\\" One wonders what she would think of Section 8, food stamps, free school lunches, and WIC. Sometimes there is no food in the house, and the children go hungry.Johnny Nolan, the father, is a singing waiter, but has no steady job. He mostly works at one-shot jobs like weddings and parties. Johnny is an alcoholic. There was little understanding or treatment of alcoholism when Smith wrote the book. We now know that alcoholism is a disease, with both powerful psychological as well as physical components. So even though Johnny is lovable, and really loves his children, he is perceived as weak and a loser. Johnny comes from a long line of alcoholics; perhaps his problems were at least partially due to a genetic disposition toward the disease.Francie senses that her mother loves Neeley more, but she eventually comes to peace with it. This does not mean that her mother doesn't love her, of course she does. It is partly because Neeley is reminiscent of the father and Katie does not want him to turn out the same way. Francie is like her mother in that she is strong and smart, but she has also inherited her father's creative ability and his dreaminess. One of the main differences between Francie and her father is that Francie takes action, and Katie admires that. Francie works hard at school and at her various jobs, and in improving upon her hardscrabble beginnings.The novel does have flaws. Some of the psychoanalyzing and character analysis is quite dated. Women are thwarted by \\"starved love instincts.\\" However, I find the book to be mostly very strong, especially about the characterization of Francie. She is a completely realized character. You feel as if you know her. The book takes her from an eleven-year-old child to a young woman about to leave Brooklyn and start new adventures. Even though she is going far away, she will never really leave Brooklyn behind:\\"She might get rid of her Brooklyn accent that way. But Francie didn't want to get rid of it any more than she wanted to get rid of her name. It meant that she belonged some place. She was a Brooklyn girl with a Brooklyn name and a Brooklyn accent. She didn't want to change into a bit of this and a bit of that.\\"You just wish that there had been a sequel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Sweet. Real. Honest. This coming of age story helped lull me to sleep throughout my childhood and I can't help but reread it yearly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am 11 years old,and think this book is amazing!!!I cannot get over how detailed and brutally true to life this piece is. Really inspiring and beautiful. So many good scenes encased in the pages, like Francy(the main character)having to buy the saturday night meat from a surly butcher,and how they got there big green Christmas tree and getting several bumps and scrapes in the process,or how aunt Sissy got her baby............in a very pratical way. All of them impeccably vivid and startling the way a little 11 year old saw the world in Broooklyn,New York in 1912 and then moving on to when Francy is 14,In 1915. It is great in audio(Kate Burton dose a fantastic emotinal reading!!!) or paper back.Has some sexual themes, but its all done in a very human and nataral way,nothing sleazy.This book is perfect for a slow rainy afternoon with a hot cup of mint tea!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A beautiful and extraordinary book I first read some 60 years ago.

I read this book in the sixth grade because my mom had been trying to get me interested in reading, but up to that point, nothing had clicked with me. She said she was going to read it along with me and quiz me after each chapter. It wasn't long before I didn't want to put it down. From then on, I would read just about anything I could get my hands on. I have such a fondness for this touching story and I plan to read it with my sixth grade students as the time frame and subject matter correlate with my state's social studies standards."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some good books are good because of excellent writing. Some are good because of engrossing storytelling. Some are good because of fantastic character development. One characteristic that I had always overlooked was the setting, that is, until I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this book, the author seamlessly transported me from my living room couch to the streets of pre-WWI Brooklyn. She made me nostalgic for a world that I had never experienced.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic coming of age book. It opens in 1912 with 11 year old Francie Nolan scampering about the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is a book about survival, overcoming adversity, and embracing life. Through her adolescent years, Francie Nolan copes with poverty, hunger, and her father's alcoholism. She is a strong, endearing character and you just can't help rooting for her.I have no doubt that the author herself lived through the same pre-WWI Brooklyn setting. No one could have created such a vivid setting without having lived through it. I was impressed by the incredible detail that she devoted to describing the setting. And I'm not talking about insanely boring details like the arch of every leaf. I'm referring to the little details about life that many authors overlook and don't even begin to think about describing.For example, I loved the author's inclusion of the milkman's horse in describing the times. At the start of the novel, the end of the horse-drawn carriage days was imminent, but it had not yet arrived. Milk was still delivered daily by a horse-drawn wagon. For some reason, the milkman's horse didn't like the milkman, but he seemed to like everyone else. In this detail, the author showed that horses had personality. For all the benefits that cars could bring, cars didn't have personality. This is the sort of detail that brings the pre-WWI world to life and makes you experience a world that has long past. Someone today imagining what life was like in pre-WWI might never think to describe horses in the way that Betty Smith did. Unless the story was specifically a horse story, a writer of today might just describe a horse as white or brown, tall or short, because for the most part, one horse would be just as good as another. Including details such as the personality of the milkman's horse was what made the setting of this book so realistic.In recent years, the young adult genre has gained quite a lot of traction. It's become popular and profitable. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a perfect novel for young adults, but I hesitate to call it a \\"young adult\\" novel. It doesn't obey by any of the characteristics of a modern \\"young adult\\" novel. It is not fast-paced. It is not plot-driven. And it is not part of a series. Instead, it is introspective, slow, and thoughtful. It is a book that any adult can appreciate without ever thinking that it is juvenile. And yet, it tackles the very same adolescent issues that everyone experiences in their transition from child to adult."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a member of that very small, elite club \\"My Favorite Books of All Time;\\" these are the books I have read numerous times, and will doubtless read numerous times again before I die. From the very first time I read ATGIB at age 11, it was firmly ensconsed as one of my all-time faves, and that position has remained unshaken in the ensuing 30+ years.I first obtained ATGIB through a free book give-away program at the poor, rural school I attended (back in the 1970s), and I can still remember so much about that very first reading -- for instance, that much of it was on a 10-hour long Greyhound bus ride. It was an impressionable and difficult age for me, which no doubt accounts for the very strong and indelible impression that ATGIB made on my psyche. I connected and identified strongly with Francie Nolan, and identified her parents with my own (and still do even now).I honestly don't know how many times I've read ATGIB: enough that I have most of the scenes and narrative practically memorized. It is a beautiful story, if a melancholy and bittersweet one, from beginning to end. Amazingly, I identify Francie and her family with me and my own even more now as an adult than I did as a young girl. I find the book more poignant and touching every time I read it.A few years ago I obtained this audio version (which I am now listening to for the second time) and it is superb. Kate Burton's narration is incredibly good, and she makes this wonderful classic even better. She captures the myriad of accents -- German, Irish, Brooklynese -- with perfect pitch.I can't recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn enough; although I think it might be primarily a women's book, I do think it could have some appeal for men, as well."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is such a beautiful title as it highlights the tree that continues to grow through the cracks in the concrete despite harsh conditions. It's such a beautiful metaphor for Francie who continues to blossom and even thrive through her difficult childhood with her alcoholic father, severe poverty, and the other harsh realities of her life. The tree continues to grow, despite all efforts to destroy it and is a strong symbol of overcoming adversity. I love that Francie is a reader and that her books help her transcend and escape from the world around her.Francie's innocence and perseverance was amazing. One would think she was gentle and passive as she would delight in the smallest things such as the beauty of the flowers. Don't let her fool you, though. When it was important, she would stand right up and do what she felt was right. She even found and lied her way into a school that would provide her with a far superior education to the one she was receiving from the school in her neighborhood where the teacher regarded her as worthless because she was poor.The touching and beautiful tale is a tribute to hope."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you loved Angela's Ashes?

She could literally write about a tree in Brooklyn I would read it. It's reflective of the writers personality which I don't usually like but here it adds depth. Her descriptions and storytelling struck me down and blew me away. One of my faves of all time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I ended up reading this book for a book report at school. I chose it beacuse of a quotable quote from Reader's Digest. Because of its length, I almost gave up. However, I stuck with it and was taken into Francie's world and could imagine myself in her position. It gave me a new outlook on the beauty of everyday life. Because Francie had little experience outside of Brooklyn, she did not realize her poverty and being poor did not bother her. I was profoundly moved by every section and feel that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very life-changing book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the greatest books of all time! I completely relate to Francie, not in an exact, economical sense, but as a 15-year-old girl; I have gone through the same emotional situations as Francie. She is a modern heroine who does not rely on anyone except for her own strength and will to survive. The lavish descriptions about her family's life will touch the heart of any reader. Betty Smith must have been a genius to come up with such a compelling, heart-warming story in a time when such graphic images of poverty were condemned."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"We listened to all 18 hours of Anna Fields' reading while on an automobile trip: mom, dad, sons age 10 and 8. We were enthralled. The four of us have nothing but praise for the Blackstone Audio version. When we arrived home, the eight-year-old found the book in our library and re-read the entire book for himself. Read other reviews for comment on the story. Suffice it to say here, this audio version captivated all of us, gave us the opportunity to stop the tape and have family discussions on a variety of important subjects, brought us all closer together, and gave us hours and hours of thoughtful entertainment."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I feel that I must recommend this book because I found it almost life changing, but not really. Hmmm, how can I explain myself better. I live in such a sheltered world. I am middle class, have never experienced hunger, and have cable. I also live in an imaginary world.This book finally presented reality to me... and it presented the idea that it IS possible to live in the real world. And it showed that even when things bad or sad happen, if you deal with it the right way, you become a better person for it. But it was not a book with a definate moral. It didn't follow the norm in books, no flowery language or silly romance. It was just straight out &quot;this is how it is, &amp; this is one way to deal with it, &amp; it is possible to be strong even when you are weak, or especially from your weaknesses&quot;. The impressive thing is how old it is, yet it dealt with issues that are still very prevalent today - the so-called disfunctional family (I so far have not yet met a functional one); alcoholism; idolatry of those you love; sexuality; fidelity; poverty; morality; mortality. In other words LIFE. This book is a must read for those who are daily forced to meet reality's gritty face as well as those who deny it, because you will hear an empathitic voice and even find hope, because after all... Trees grow in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a 17 female I have read this tantalizing book a number of times. Basically the other reviews say it all, how magical this book is, how inspiring, and just plain special. I just wanted to add one thing however, and that is that this book is not only just for girls, my father read it and loved it, and so did my brother. Certain scenes like when Francie goes fishing with her father are drop dead hilarious. This book is a must read for all, old and young, female and male."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read &quot; A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult,I read about the life of Francie Nolan and realize I can overcome any problem with the same determination that Francie and her family had. All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived. I would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age stories.I have read &quot;A Tree GrowsI have read &quot;A Tree GrowsI have read &quot;A Tree Growsin"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was similar in so many ways to Angela's Ashes. I enjoyed comparing them as I read. Mainly, I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn had a more hopeful spin than Angela's Ashes, but that Frank McCourt was more poetic in his writing than Betty Smith. If you have read one of these two books, I definitely recommend reading the other, too. It makes for a really interesting comparitive read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was in the seventh grade when I first read a &quot;Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot;. At the young age that I was, I still knew I had read a book that had changed my life or at least the way I looked at things. This is a book that will make you smile and say thats me! And by time your done with it you will find that a little bit of it is a part of you. Since I first read it I have tried to find as many books as a can that Betty Smith has written. I have suceeded in finding only two, &quot;Maggie Now&quot; and &quot;A Joy In the Mourning&quot;. I have poured over these novels and dread the day that there will be know more left to find.

The Nolan family lives in a poor neighborhood of Brooklyn at the turn of the century. Although their mother, Katie, works hard, sometimes they can barely scrape up enough money for food. For the Nolans everyday life is a challenge. But, everyday they wake up with a new strength, looking for what the new day will bring. Francie, whom the book mainly focuses on, is the oldest. she is very imaginative and smart, and learns a lot about her self over the course of the book. As Francie and her younger brother, Neeley grow older the world around them changes rapidly, as do they. This book is an excellent book about change and the relationships between family members."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was in college, I discovered that a neighbor of mine ALSO considered &quot;Tree&quot; to be her favorite book. We have been best friends still after many years. I have shared this book with friends and lovers who in turn have shared it with their friends and families. The &quot;Tree&quot; continues to grow. I recently found a library-bound edition to replace my old, dog-eared, lent-out-in-perpetua paperback.

Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city. Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do. I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years. Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is an amazing book. I loved it. It is a wonderful book that speaks to your heart. It is a true treasure."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book takes the reader on a voyage through memories so heartfelt you will feel like you have become a part of the Nolan family. The story is of an Irish Catholic family bringing up their children in the heart of Brooklyn during the beginning of the century. Francie and her brother Neeley are characters that you will take away with you, never to be forgotten.Life is hard and times are poor, but love of family and a good moral upbringing by the ever-present, yet distant mother Katie, gets them through. Life in Brooklyn struggles along with a laugh and a song from their drunken father Johnny who tries his best. With love and respect they watch their father&#65533;s decline over the years. Life is a roller coaster of emotions, trials, and tribulations, all layed out by the author in a manner that will keep you reading late into the night.This book was written back in the 40&#65533;s and is as much a classic today as it ever was. It continues to reach people into the new millennium. Though the century may change the lessons remain the same, love of family, strength of character, honesty, and hard work. The American Dream is there for the having and this book exemplifies it. Bravo a truly worthwhile read for everyone.

I took an old book from an old set off the shelf and there it sat for a few years, under various plants. That book happened to travel with me, unread, for another 15 years from apartment, to home, to home, until someone gave me a list of the Top Ten Life-Changing American books. Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family. I don't think I was ever required to read it. I never saw the movie - didn't even know there was one. To me, it is the most wonderful best-kept secret I have ever had right under my nose."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was eleven years old I first began reading this wonderful novel. It tells the story of a poor young girl named Francie Nolan who lives in Brooklyn in the earliest years of the Twentieth Century. No work of fiction before or since has to me so captured the wondering observations of a child who lives his life in emotional isolation. The shabby, mean, and colorless streets and tenements of Williamsburg are to Francie a playground of colors, mysteries, and adventures. Francie bears a passionate love for her hopeless, drunken, dreaming father. In contrast, she struggles to love her practical, hardened, and unsentimental mother. This conflict leads to a climax that forces Francie to achieve a balance between the dreams of her father and the practicality of her mother. If you enjoy fiction that allows you to see the world through a child's eyes, this one's for you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really liked this book about a young girl growing up in early nineteenth century Brooklyn. Francie is a memorable, real character and one who is intelligent and very aware of her situation and surroundings as she goes about life day to day - collecting junk to sell with her brother, observing the neighbors and each of their idiosyncrasies, reading one book a day, and most of all trying to win the love of her mother. This book paints a very lifelike feel to this time period in Brooklyn including union sentiments, prohibition talk, war rumors and overwhelming class distinction. It makes you feel like you were there looking through the eyes of Francie."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade. It seemed to be the world's best book then. Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book. One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew more mature as Francie grew up. It makes this book a 'happening book', and draws its readers well into the book while reading. Another excellent technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl. It is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The most amazing aspect of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is its universal appealto readers of any age, any race. Opening the covers of this book is likestepping into a time machine and visiting the squalor of 1920's Brooklyn, N.Y.Here Betty Smith's descriptive magic plunges you into the ugliness of povertyand the beauty of the people who fought to overcome it...Francie Nolan, a dreamy child who finds her escape in books...Johnny Nolan, her handsome young father, who finds his escape --and ultimate tragedy -- in the bottle... and Katie Nolan, her beautiful,hardened mother, who realizes that education is the only way her childrencan escape the life she is forced to endure.Although this novel was written many decades ago, modern readers will findthe prose to be shockingly frank and as realistic as it is descriptive.The only fault with the book, which covers the span of Francie's life frombirth until college, is that it eventually has to end.No history text can make the past come alive the way &quot;A Tree Grows inBrooklyn&quot; can...no movie can leave its audience with more satisfactionfrom a story well-told. I dare anyone to read this book and not comeaway a different person...it is, in fact, a true work of art."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in BrooklynBy Betty SmithHave you ever been so poor that you had to save pennies just to have enough money to put food on the table? A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith describes the life of a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the 1920s. Johnny Nolan, her father, was a drunk and always became quiet and depressed when he drank, while Katie Nolan, her mother, worked late and didn't see her family much. Yet, you can tell because of the way Smith describes Katie that she deeply loves her family. Betty Smith talks about Francie's courage to seek a better life. This happens to be my favorite part of the book. In elementary school, on her own initiative, Francie switched schools to get away from the bullies and succeeded to make herself happier.I love how Francie Nolan has a passion to write and wrote many mythical stories of flowers and rainbows. After her father died, she started writing stories about poverty and people starving. Francie is a unique character for many reasons: I can picture her as she used to run down to get paper dickie shirt collars for her father, and she drank coffee when she was only 10. Although she went through many of life's hardships, she still turned out to be a very nice lady.I recommend \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", A New York Public Library \\"Book of the Century\\" to anyone and everyone as it was enthralling and interesting, too.

The story covers her turbulant childhood with little money and alcoholic father. It tells of the menial work her mother did each day as a housekeeper to keep the family together because her father could not hold down a steady job. Even though it was tough for the family, Francie was kept in school until High School so that she would become educated and not have to wash floors for a living like her mother. Also Francie was intelligent, idealistic and hard-working. She became very successful as she matured and got her first real job. The story is one of hope that will inspire all who read it. It illustrates the American Dream fulfilled through hard work and perserverance."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I re-read this book every few years, mostly to remind myself no matter how difficult things may seem - I am blessed.

Francie Nolan is an unforgettable character that will stay with you long after you've read the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I lohuhuhuved this book. You think it's about a poor family and all their hardships. But it's not. It's about a poor family and their lives, how they form bonds and their sense of togetherness. Francie is beautiful character and her interactions with all her family members are wonderfully written. Oh, and the ending: I cried. It's just so beautiful. Gawd, I loved this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book while home from school and ill in 1960. I was 12 and very certainly male. I still remember this vivid, moving, enthalling story while I have forgotten most any details from the usual 'thrillers' that I read in those days.I am not surprised to find that most of the reviewers are female. The central character is a young woman, but her coming of age and coping with the realities of the human condition are pertinent to anyone, anytime."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is a truely captivating book, from the moment I was introduced to the grubby slums and characters of Brooklyn on the first page it cast its spell over me and I could hardly wait to get back to reading it after being torn away.All the characters are well rounded and the reader is shown them in all their wonderful glory, for better or for worse. The book's focal character is Francie, we are introduced to her aged eleven and follow her on a, sometimes turbulent, journey into adulthood as she gains wisdom and an understanding of the world.I found this book poignant, witty extremely wise and deeply moving. Betty Smith offers some wonderful insights into the human condition and gives a vivid description of what it was like to be poor and living in the slums of Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century america.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look into the heart and soul of an era, I was deeply touched by the sheer brilliance and wisdom in this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always heard of this book but never read it or saw the movie. I had just read another similar book, \\"The Glass Castle\\" by Jeanette Wells and the author recommended this one. I'm glad she did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My daughter recommended this book to me. At 58 and one who reads a lot I don't know how I missed this charming book about Francie Nolan (or is it about Brooklyn?). I loved every word. It was one of those books that I knew did not have an engrossing plot that chilled my nerve ends, I didn't care where it led me because I was living alongside a girl growing up in poverty who was teaching me about life. It is a story that both shamed me for my cavalier approach to material goods and gave me a renewed deep appreciation for the depth of the human spirit. If you have ever read Stegner you will love this book. The development of the characters, the easy flow of the narrative and at times, nodding your head in approval. It reminded me of Stegner's book 'Crossing to Safety'. I thoroughly enjoyed this read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A very sad story,but also a great book tough times back in those days Well worth reading for younger people so they can appreciate what they have."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was really moving for me.

Now,as an adult,I feel the same.In fact,I found the story even more wonderful. With her simple yet eloquent writing,Betty Smith takes you on an emotional journey that holds you from the first page to the last. Francie(her alter ego) is a very real,sensitive young heroine,and her family,even with all it's problems is a lovable one.(we could all use an Aunt Sissy!) Her father,though he has a severe drinking problem(and this was long before AA) is a sympathic charactor who truly loves his family,especially his daughter who adores him in spite of his illness,however she's not blind to it,which shows how intelligent she is. There is alot of humor too,which provides a balance thats just right. A beautiful story about growing up and life itself."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was barely a teen, and now 7 years later, I'm still loving this book. Brings to life the world of a family growing in the 1910s. The novel provides a critical view of class relations, without moralizing the actions of the main characters. The novel, one might say, claims only to paint a portrait of a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn before WWI. While I cannot attest to the novel's authenticity in representation of the lifestyle of people in that neighborhood during that time period, I would argue that Smith opens a window to another world, and leaves the reader emotionally attached to Francie and her story. I must admit this novel caused a tear to fall down my cheek more than once."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I juts finished reading this book for the first time, and I can tell it is going to be re-read and re-read again and again! The development of the characters and the nuances of the plot make for a brilliant novel, and because this book was originally written in memoir form, the story and characters are completely real and believable. The book unfolds slowly, but never at a boring pace. Everything that happens is fascinating, because it is just the way life really is. This is a MUST-READ for everyone! Possibly the best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"At first this book seems a little slow, but once you read into the second chapter you are mezmorized.

Now, even after having majored in English in college and become an English teacher, this remains my favorite book of any genre, any time. It is the kind of book you can enjoy as a child and enjoy even more as an adult, appreciating nuances you hadn't noticed before. The characters are so well-developed, so vividly portrayed, so multi-faceted, and so REAL that they become a part of you. This may be a work of fiction, but it is most definitely a \\"true\\" story, if you know what I mean. Don't miss this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book who's characters stay with you a long time.

This girls name is Francie and the story is about her life from birth to her late teenage years. During this time, the book tells us many stories such as her school, her writings, and her family. The reader also gets to know Francie inside and out, basically from the little details the writer includes that normally would not be important in a story. We learn to sympathize with Francie and relate to her. This book also describes greatly the horrors of poverty for anyone. All in all, this is a wonderful piece of fiction that anyone can learn/relate to in their lives."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was first introduced to this book by my mother at the tender age of 10. Since then, I have read it countless times, and find myself picking it up and reading sections of it from time to time. The Nolans became like family to me, and I find myself thinking about the characters--particularly Sissy and Katie--at inopportune times. These extremely well-written characters don't just get in your head, they immerse themselves in your soul, and if you read this book once you will read it 1,000 times. Betty Smith is not the best writer of the 20th century, but she writes stories like no one else and managed to create timeless characters, both in this novel and in Joy In the Morning. No one should miss reading this book at least three or four times. Trust me, if you read it it will become one of your favorites, and the characters will work their way into your heart.Sissy is my favorite character in the novel. Her lust for life, coupled with the unusual scenarios in the book, makes her unforgettable. I love Francie, of course, and who could help but love the good-for-nothing &quot;sweet singer of sweet songs&quot; himself, Johnny Nolan?This movie desperately needs to be re-made as a major Hollywood film. The 1940s version was good in its own right, but it was not entirely faithful to the novel. Think of all the charming actors who could play Johnny. Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Chris O'Donnell...the list goes on and on.Anyway, do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Shortly after reading this book, I have come to realize why A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is considered a true literature classic. The story illustrates a beautiful picture of Brooklyn, New York during the turn of the twentieth century, and the types of lifestyles the working poor lived. The story is focused on the life of Francie and Neely Nolan, the children of a sweet but heartbreaking couple, Katie and Johnny Nolan. The mother, Katie Nolan, is brutally honest, never one to publicly express emotion or sugar-coat things for her family or friends. The father, Johnny Nolan, is a charming young man who serves as the backbone for the family, but has a terrible problem: alcoholism. Smith gives some of the most common problems of children, yet is able to elaborate on them to develop the characters and give the reader a real understanding of them. For young Francie and Neely, their lives are subject to poverty, and they soon learn how valuable every cent is. As poor children growing up in a rural neighborhood, they learn to cope with teasing of their social status and their given situation in life.With the sudden death of Johnny, the family learns to cope with an even tougher life, and the story begins to unfold. It begins to tell of the physical and emotional changes of Francie as she grows older, and her trials and tribulations as she goes from a successful student to a vulnerable factory worker. As life goes on for this family, we begin to sympathize for it, and come to gain respect for all that they must pull together for to get through whatever life throws their way.Not only will the story appeal to the reader, but also the writing style that Betty Smith takes on. The setting descriptions that she gives of the beautifully constructed buildings, blooming flowers, passers-bys, and the whirlwind of life that Francie is observing are amazing and cause the reader to have an early fondness for the book. Imagery also plays another part in the development of the characters and the story. You could feel the warmth of the sun beating down through the windows of the bakery Francie made multiple visits to for cheap, day old bread. You could smell the coffee that Katie had brewed the day before, and tasted the freshly cut rye bread to go along with it.Through the experiences Smith put the characters in, and the development of the tale of this unfortunate family, the reader is able to understand that many endless themes and messages are interwoven within the story. Hope, survival, and courage are all included with these themes, and are illustrated through the way that Francie and Neely live their everyday lives. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book recommended for any classic collection, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by people everywhere. This heartwarming story is sure to touch all hearts of those who read it, and will give them a new view on life, and how lucky they are to live in the world they do today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"After I got my summer reading list going into freshman year and saw &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; on the list, I thought, Oh great, some other stupid book that school will make me read. I've been an avid reader since I can remeber, but school, it takes the fun out of things. But this book, this book was amazing. I stayed up until 4 in the morning reading because I didn't want to put it down. It was the first book that really ever made me cry, and I cried and cried because I think everyone can relate to a lot of different aspects of the story, I know that I could. I got through this book in 2 days, and it's not a short story. I was even inspired to read Betty Smith's other novel, &quot;A Joy in the morning&quot;, which by the way, if you like this one, I highly recommend. This book is a classic and everyone should read it. I re-read it all the time, and it still gets me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN is a wonderfully inspiring story about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900's. The main character, Francie, is quite an intellect and would rather read a book than play with other girls any day. Throughout the story we see Francie change from a girl to a woman. Along the way we meet two of the major characters of the novel; Francie's alcoholic father and hardworking mother. I would suggest this book to any girl age thirteen years and older. Although, I do not want to discourage anyone else from reading A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, I feel that girls over the age of fourteen would be able to relate to this book better than anyone else. This novel was not very original in setting, but the content and deep analysis of each character and situation by Betty Smith is quite unique. The narration was, for the most part the third person limited perspective. Betty Smith sets a very realistic story, though a sad one at times. I think this book is quite a timeless classic. It is an absolutely wonderful story in the slums of Brooklyn, New York. It will be just as wonderful a novel fifty years from now as it was fifty years ago. It has a timeless essence that I could relate to in 1998, and some young girl will in the year 2048. I loved this book because it was a fastpaced book and kept me reading until the very end. I hope you will decide to read A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, By Betty Smith, and love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a treasure, and it seems somehow shameful, that you can even get it in paperback. It's a keeper. My parents bought it for me when I was quite young, and now at the age of 51, I have just finished reading it again. For perhaps the twentieth time. There are few books that I read more than twice. My children will get the book soon, and perhaps they will treat it kindly, and pass it on to their children also. If they do not, there is not doubt in my mind that they will buy the hard cover copy. A paperback is fine, but if you can handle the price, by all means, go that way, so you know it will hold up for the many times you will want to reread it, and share it with others.This book will provoke so many different emotions in you, and I promise, you will never be the same again. If BOYS TOWN, A STONE FOR DANNY FISHER, and KNOCK ON ANY DOOR, brought all of your emotions to surface, then prepare yourself to reach new heights with these same feelings. There are onl! ! y five stars, and there should be TEN! See, after that, you don't even want a review!Bill Lambert"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A &lt;u>Tree Grows In Brooklyn&lt;/u> is a great book to read. It is about growing up, family, and the discovery of truth in the squalor of life in turn-of-the the century Brooklyn, portrayed through the eyes of Francie Nolan. One should read this book because it's considered a classic, it's original ideas matching no other. One should like this book becauase it's bluntly honest and smooth-flowing. I like this book because the characters go on throughout their hardships, an inspiration."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I understand why many would not. This is a historical novel and one where if you don't understand the language and descriptions used, you will not get much out of it. Also, this book requires a lot of reading in between the lines and critical thinking. This is why \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is so often required reading material and also why most adolescents don't like or understand it. This novel is about a girl living in poverty in the early 1900s. Simply put, this is about her life and the observations she makes about why people behave the way they do.There are many historical aspects to the story. There are references made to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, and frankly, if you don't know much about the history of the country during this time, you will miss even more still. If you do not have at least some background and interest in reading 'classic literature' and even history, this probably isn't the book for you.But if you do enjoy reading good literature, then this is definately the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and got a lot out of it. The characters are interesting, and it's an interesting look into human behavior which, despite the times of the novel, still hold true today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" tells the story of a young Irish-American girl growing up at the turn of the 20th century. Her father is a romantic man, with musical gifts and a tendency to drink. Her mother is a practical woman, who raises her children with tough love, and works as a janitor. The protagonist, Francie, is part of an extended family each member richly drawn, and as she matures, her world evolves from the stoop of her tenement to school to college and the workplace, all seen with her unique slant.I first read this book in fourth grade, and it is one that say, unlike \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" matures nicely. What moved me then, moves me now, and the author does that rare thing, gives each and every character his/her humanity. While the book is chock full of \\"Oprah\\" topics, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse and poverty, the characters are drawn as more than their various vices, far more. The protagonist at one point is chided for writing about \\"sordid\\" subjects by her English teacher, yet she quickly realizes that honesty as a writer is more important than fancy phrases and made up fantasies. So does the author.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found out about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" from Oprah. I didn't think a woman worth 40 billion would have time for a 60-year-old book about a poor New York tenement family at the turn-of-the-century. I was wrong. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an epic, detailed history of a destitute Irish family in 1912 big-city America. Father Johnny Nolan is a some-times singing waiter, mother Katie washes floors, and little Neely and Francie joust with cruel teachers, two-faced policemen, and self-serving neighbors. Dinner consists of stale bread and onion soup. They celebrate on Saturday night, when five bucks buys a mutton dinner. But \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is not all sad. It's filled with the love and tenderness only struggling family life can provide. Late one night, Johnny comes home tipsy, singing enchanting Irish tunes. Little Francie meets him at the door. He smiles, he winks, he gives her a tune. She turns away and faces the wall. A hot tear runs down her face. She doesn't want her father to know how much she really loves him...If you're tired of Stephen King mind-games and over-rated \\"How To\\" books, diversify into a heart-felt love-fest with this famous classic by Betty Smith. Somewhere in nineteenth century America, a little girl struggles for love and recognition. A tiny root pushes through cracks in the cement. A brave slender branch juts up, searching for the sun-light. A single vine might survive until the rain comes. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\"."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"FRANCIE IS REALI first read this book when I was ten. I didn't understand a lot of it but I liked it even then. Reading the book again, I'm now 75, was so comforting. I now understood everything. A &#34;Tree&#34; is historical,and socially revealing. It reads like real life.

The daughter of an enchanting but alcoholic father and an industrious but distant mother, Francie is a dreamy child with lofty ambitions despite the poverty in which she lives. Francie provides a sad, but moving description of life as she knows it and the tragedy and fortune that befalls her and her family.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is a very hard novel to review. It's about more than just one little girl and her family. This novel is about abject poverty, immigrants and their status in their own neighborhood and new country, alcoholism, and above all else, this novel is about carving out a place for oneself in the world. I absolutely adored this novel. It definitely ranks in my top 10 all time favorite novels. The imagery and the story are woven in such a fantastic way that this book will be one that lingers in the mind, long after you have finished it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In this classic book, Betty Smith creates a world with such realistic characters and vivid scenes that it invites the reader in and doesn't let go until the final page. The main character is Francie, a young girl who is a romantic like her father and yet a realist like her mother. She loves to read and longs for an education so that she can overcome the squalid conditions in which she is growing up. She is a survivor and does whatever it takes to get along in her world while having a rich life on the inside which no one else knows about. Her father is an alcoholic who causes severe financial problems for his family but still shows Francie love in a way that her serious and responsible mother never can. Her younger brother Neely is her constant companion and she loves him despite the fact that her mother favors him over Francie. This book was written during the time that my mother was growing up and yet I can relate to many of the timeless scenes in it, such as the magical moments when Francie learns to read. This is a wonderful book that should be taken off the shelf every few years and re-read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A tree grows in Brooklyn, indeed: a tree by the name of Francie Nolan.Francie Nolan is an eleven year-old turn of the century heroine. Times are tough for her family. Her father, although very loving, is an alcoholic who can not hold down a steady job.

I'm an avid reader and have probably read thousands of books, but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn continues to be my favorite. I think this book should be required reading for all high school and college students, and I'm always surprised it's not on more summer reading lists."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Frankly I prefer story driven books over character driven books. But not in this case. I feel like I know these people - that I could hear Johnny singing just around the corner on his way home from work. This is an honest and insightful story and I hope it doesn't get overlooked in American Lit classes. There are lines and images that have stayed with me for over 40 years and it just doesn't get better than that."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Readers who come to \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" looking for a fast-paced or action-packed storyline should look elsewhere: Betty Smith's perennial coming-of-age novel is more like a stroll through the forgotten alleyways and tenements of Brooklyn at the turn of the century.Influenced by Smith's work with the WPA during the Great Depression, the story ties issues of social injustice, gender, and class to a narrative of the childhood and youth of Francie Nolan, a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn. The novel is rich with vivid descriptions of tenement life, from clothing to food to the variety of ethnicities crammed together in busy Brooklyn.What's wonderful about this book is that it is accessible to all age ranges due to a cast of unique characters and has as much for the teen reader as the older reader who seeks a historical overview of the very specific period. Offering intense emotions, unforgettable characters and a broad appeal, \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an often-overlooked masterpiece of American literature of the last century."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an amazing book, by Betty Smith. The story is centered around Francie Nolan's life in Brooklyn, in the early twentieth century. The wealth of detail surrounding the characters in this book is simply amazing. It describes the people so avidly, that I feel like I knew them my whole life.It takes a great author to make you feel the emotions of characters in the book, and Betty Smith does it without a flaw. This book will leave you elated, sad, scared, and touched. Overall, a wonderful journey that takes us back to the early 1900s, and forces us to feel all of Francie's emotions."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read this book more than once and I own old hardback originals as well as the recent edition.I absolutely love to read of the extremes the human spirit can endure and survive. We know now that children like Francie Nolan would be called resilient children, because they bounce back like the fabled tree growing thrugh the harsh concrete jungles of the brooklyn 'ghetto'. Unfortunately, we have way too many children who can survive such hardship with a resilient spirit.It isn't merely the storyline that is engrossing, it is the tone and voice, the narrative nuances captured by the writer, Betty Smith, that allow you to see with your mind, but identify with Francie and her plight with your heart.Even more inspiring is the triumphant spirit of this little girl under duress. It makes one proud to be human. I work in domestic violence field and I have given this gift as an inspiration to particularly challenged children and even ten and twelve year olds can appreciate A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it becomes emotional meat for their bones and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How I wish I could have been a child like Francie Nolan! Yes, her family was poor and grief striken, but she enjoyed every day of her life! She made the good times seem magnificent and had a wonderful way of perceiving the bad times! The simpleness of her eating jello with whipped topping for the first time and the way she described that experience brought me to tears! How she craved education and new experiences! I hope from now on that when I encounter a new day that I look upon them the way Francie did! I believe that everyone experiences this book differently and that's what makes it such a jewel of literature!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book this year, my freshman year.

You won't regret it one bit!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Smith uses the descriptive style to depict Francie Nolan's story about her life well. Throughout the novel, readers are able to get a vivid picture of the struggles, hardships, and joys in the life of Francie. As the novel progresses, Francie faces the usual struggles of a poor family, worrying about where the money for food for the week will come from, and if her as well as her brother Neely Nolan will be able to acquire a higher education. An example of this is when the Nolan's are at the soda shop Katie Nolan, says, &quot;They never had enough to eat, never had right cloths. The best I could do wasn't enough&quot; (351). This passage shows that the Nolan's do not have enough money for everything needed and at times their family would struggle making Katie feel that she had not done enough for her children. Smith enables Francie to tell her coming of age story in a way that makes the reader know just as much about Francie and Francie herself does. When Francie speaks it seems that she is speaking to you and wants you to understand her pain, and joys allowing Smith to let the world know just how life was for some families growing up. Even though the Nolan family had nothing in the beginning, through hard work and some suffering, their family was able to gain a higher status than the generations before them, thus showing the reader that if you have strong determination, good will, and a sense of direction about where you want your life to take you, you will succeed and gain even greater happiness. Throughout the novel, Smith captures the readers mind as she takes them on a journey through the life of a child in Brooklyn, as seen through the eyes of Francie.

It is sort of a documentary of Francie's growing up. This book has so much detail and excitement that it is hard not to understand, although it may seem complicated when you first pick it up. This is a good book for people age 10 and up, and is the perfect book to buy for the ummer- it would be ideal to bring to a cottage or on a camping trip. Altogether, this is a fantastic book that you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I like this book, because it tells the truth about the way things are (and were).

She handed me this book and told me how much she had liked it. I started it and time stood still----I was transported to Brooklyn and the world of the characters---and I was very sad when the book ended and I had to leave that world! I wish this book had a sequel. I've read it many times since, with the same effect every time. If you've never had a first reading of this wonderful book, I envy you! You are in for such a treat."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a foundation for all others. The author is a master - she has captured a life and preserved it forever for us with her words -- the life is not that of a stranger or just a randome little girl -- there is a piece of every American whose roots stretch back to poor immigrants. Many, many timeless quotes are seeded throughout the novel. I highly recommend this book to all readers!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. It is so depressing and made me so sad that I wish I'd never read it. (The mother's rejection of Francie while deeply loving the little brother still haunts me, probably because I see the same situation occurring in a child who is close to me.) On the other hand, it must be very well written to invoke such deep emotions for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A book worthy of praise for its historical detail, although for me the writing wasn't top-notch."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I recently read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time.

There is also a well-known movie made from the book which follows the story closely. The book is the touching tale of a family with 12 children, much spirit and love, and at times very little money. It's an inspiring, very moving tale that shows how determination, hard work and the love of your family can get you through anything, good times and bad."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The thing about \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is that it is inconsistent in terms of quality. The plot is AT TIMES interesting, and other times so dull I barely even bothered to read what was on the page. The writing is in fact incredibly readable, but that is only because it lacks depth at times and is extraordinarily simplistic.For the most part, the story of the Nolan's is interesting. Francie seems to be a character that falls into a template or a pattern - she is a reader, she is somewhat weak, and she is an intelligent child. These traits have rather become cliches in main characters, but the point is almost irrelevant here. The remainder of the Nolan family is fascinating, but more often than not, we are only given Francie, which is both disappointing and also boring at times. Things do get quite repetitive.There's not much to be said about the writing. It's hardly the most beautiful writing I've ever encountered, nor does it have the greatest consistency or flow, but it reads simple. For readers who don't want to dive into a thick book that is also complex, this would probably be a great choice.The best parts of this book are the little things. The \\"should-be-great\\" parts of the book are merely \\"okay\\". While the overall story is grand and impressive, at times the book and the writing simply stall, giving a few pages of words that really need not be there. Editing, perhaps, would have helped.On the whole, this book can be recommended, though be warned that it may not suit those in search of good writing, and also that it stops at time, or rambles. It is thoroughly readable, though, and overall good.3 1/2 stars - Recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A simple story of a seemingly unimportant life that is inspiring and enjoyable. A must have addition to your library of classics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is the detailed account of young Francie Nolan's life from birth to about age 17. While the story is quite poignant at times, the amount of detail is really just too much. I felt like Smith gave a breakdown of every meal and purchase made from 1901 to 1918! Yikes! While these descriptions did give the reader a sense of the desperation, hunger, humiliations, etc. that the characters faced on a daily basis, I felt that it detracted from the story after a while as I grew accustomed (and perhaps calloused) to their misfortunes. The characters were very well developed, particularly Francie, Johnny (her pathetic ne'er-do-well of a father), and Katie (the hardworking and often under-appreciated mother). Smith did an excellent job of presenting them as multi-faceted people, full of inconsistencies and indulgences, without passing judgment on them. The relationships between the characters were also touching and true, the emotions real and understandable. Smith gives poverty a true sense of dignity. For this, she is to be commended. Keeping in mind also when this book was written, Smith blazed some new trails for the frank discussion of women's sexual identities and labor inequities. By today's standards, these things may not seem significant, but Smith undoubtedly was ahead of her time and helped clear the way for women writers to follow. So, while this book is not one of my favorites, it is worthy of a read, more for historical relevance than pleasure, at least for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this for some time.

Great service."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 13. I read it again recently, over 10 years later and I think I love it more then I did then. I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. Smith is so observant of life. Although Francie is the main character, I love how she gets into the minds of some of the other characters. For example, the scene where she retells how Johnny and Katie met, and how Katie was willing to give up everything to look at him and love him for the rest of her life. Aunt Sissy is one of my all time favorite characters. I love how multi-faceted she is. How she is so good and \\"bad\\" at the same time. However, of course, I love Francie, and her amazing observations of life: how she loves how Jewish women are proud when they are pregnant, how she wants to read every book in the library, and how excited she is to go to school. Another reader mentioned how this book is like an old friend, and I can't agree more. I open it and reread passages in dark times. I haven't written many reviews, but this book compels me to recommend it to as many people as possible."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was seriously deprived as an adolescent. I never even heard of Betty Smith's classic novel \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,\\" let alone read it. And I was an avid reader who lived relatively close to Brooklyn. Whatever the reason for this significant omission in my early literary development, I remedied the situation recently, (yes, it took me a while). I can only echo here what millions of other readers have said since the book's publication in 1943, this is an extraordinary novel which enriches and delights. I can understand why The New York Public Library chose it as one of the \\"Books of the Century.\\"Ms. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and drew from her own experiences to portray the hardships of the Nolans, a tenement family living in that borough's Williamsburg slums during the early part of the 20th century. Teenage Francie Nolan is an avid reader who wants to become a writer. She adores her father John, an alcoholic with a multitude of pipe dreams. He, in turn, loves his children and tries to be a good father, but he is not able to carry out his responsibilities. Nolan has become a dissipated man due to his alcohol addiction. Francie believes in him regardless, (and she's the only one), because they're soul-mates. Although it seems contradictory, the girl also possesses a strong practical streak. Her mother, Katie, abandoned all illusions for a better life long ago. She is rendered almost emotionless by a surfeit of her husband's grand schemes. However she stresses to her children that education is the only path out of the tenements. Grandma Rommely, Katie's mother, also reinforces the importance of education.There is a single ordinary tree visible from the Nolan's tenement window. It grows doggedly through the cement, in spite of harsh conditions which thwart it's development. Yet, it perseveres. For Francie and her father the tree symbolizes hope - the blossoming of life against all odds. It is like a beacon of of light in the darkness of their daily lives. Francie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams. Unlike her father, she has the inner strength and resourcefulness to make them come true.The author poignantly depicts the Nolan's struggles to survive and grow in a world of poverty, hunger, class prejudice and tremendous loss. Francie, a courageous girl, of strong character, comes of age here under extremely difficult circumstances. The portrait of her family members and her relationship with them is beautifully drawn, especially her relationship with her brother Neely. And turn-of-the-century Williamsburg is brought vividly to life. Broader topics are also introduced which enhance the narrative tremendously, such as, WWI, immigration, and politics of the period. Smith's characters are strong and well developed. She uses flashbacks to tell the fascinating story of John Nolan's courtship of Katie, their marriage and early years together.\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a heartfelt, moving novel which touched me deeply. Betty Smith's prose is powerful, as are her storyline and characters. This is a book I will keep to reread in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I bought this book mainly because I had always seen it on high school book lists but never read it while I was in high school, and thought I should read it. It turned out to be so much better than I'd expected! I couldn't put it down - loved it. Francie is a great character. It's both very interesting to read about her life in Brooklyn in the early 1900's and hear about her conflicts with her mother as she gets older and more independent - a timeless theme. Francie's aunt is probably the most colorful, standout character. Many (particularly in that era) would disapprove of much of her behavior, but she is in the end far more generous and loving than many \\"religious\\" people who frown on her.The book also has the potential to get kids (and adults too) to think about how they would have coped with the life and situations in the book. For example, how would they feel had they been completely responsible for younger siblings when they themselves were only five years old? Would they have been strong-willed enough to find a way to get to college while still helping her family as Francie did? Some great discussion points. It could also be a good way to connect to family stories from the older generations. (\\"Wow, Grandma did that too, huh?\\")The book is definitely most appropriate for mature middle school children, high schoolers or adults. Although the language level is not all that difficult, the book is long (although a quick read) and deals with some \\"adult situations\\" - the pain of childbirth, sex out-of-wedlock, even a brief touch on methods of ending an unwanted pregnancy, etc. But for all those reasons, it makes a fabulous read.Get the book for the rich descriptions of both the neighborhood and the characters, and just overall a great read. (And if you like stories such as this, visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City if ever you're there!)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a touching, coming of age story, about little Francie Nolan, growing up in poverty-stricken Brooklyn. I believe that what makes a novel a classic, is when it can be enjoyed and understood whether it is read one day after it is written or 50 years after it's release. Such is the case for Betty Smith's master piece. There isn't a lot of action and comotion in this novel, but there is a lot of life. It has it's moments of sadness, happiness and humor. There are issues that a young girl shouldn't have to deal with such as alcoholism, death...poverty but as in life the novel has it's ups and downs. It is impossible not to fall in love with delightful little Francie Nolan. A true relection of the highs and lows and the cracks and glitter of life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's ATGIB is an astounding masterpiece. The novel is a collection of life stories and hardships that will never be forgotten. This storie of Francie, a young girl who lives her life in Brooklyn, New York, in poverty and coming from a fairly uneducated family and overcoming hardships such as starvation and drunkeness, and suffering losses like the death of her Father. You come to love each character as if they lived in your life. Her mother Katie, is well displayed as a strong hold who keeps the family together. She is a strong character who should be admired for her courage. Her father, Johnny, however, isn't as strong, and with his drinking and then his death he fades from the story line. This book is completely relatable. Smith wrote with an uncanny knowing as if she had actually lived each and every event. WE would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It has a little bit of everything... danger, romance, family, history, struggle, suspense. To read this book is to read about life and is as close as you can get to actually living it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm entering the 9th grade this September, and am almost 14 years old. When I first saw this book on the reading list, it came along with Little Women and Tom Sawyer. I had to read 2 of them, so first I chose Tom Sawyer, and was going to read Little Women. As I was on my way out of the library (they had no books from the list there), I bumped into one of my mom's friends. She looked at the list, and saw A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and told me how much she loves the book, and that I must read it! I looked at it and first thought, 1912? How can THIS be interesting? So I started to read, and then couldn't put the book down. I began seeing how much the girl, Francie, is just like me, even though we grew up 74 years apart. I even learned some lessons in the book, and will defninitly give it to my sisters, and future children to read. I love that book so much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this story is about a terribly poor family living in Brooklyn, New York, at the turn of the 19th century. As technology advances and the American industry booms, a quiet, profound little girl called Francie Nolan lives in the slums of Brooklyn with her brother Neeley and her parents, Johnny and Katie.the novel begins with a view into Francie's world, of pennies saved and trash collected to earn them, the thin food and delightful stores; the libraries, the other tenants in Francie's apartment building.Betty Smith tells as much about Francie's parents, Johnny and Katie, as about Francie herself. We learn about how Johnny and Katie met, their whirlwind romance, soon falling out of the light as Katie bears children. Johnny, who is a kind, merry,friendly, impossibly handsome boy, starts abusing alcohol as domestic pressures fall upon his shoulders. Katie, a pretty girl, is much tougher than Johnny, and works from dawn to dusk in order to support her family, as Johnny, as lovable and sweet as he is, is not the main breadwinner of the house.We learn about Katie's sisters, Sissy and Evy, Francie's beloved aunts, pretty and tender and smart. Sissy, the man-crazy but fun and fantastically compassionate, and Evy, capable and refined, fun, and a wonderful storyteller of past events. Mary Rommely, their mother, who is saintly and understanding, clever and wise. Betty Smith tells everything about these girls, the Rommely girls, with their soft voices and the \\"invisible steel\\" in them, about their past and present situations, and they all play major roles in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.Francie is a smart, resourceful child and an avid reader. She is a talented writer, and is the favorite of her father. On the other hand, is her little brother Neeley, the favorite of their mother since his birth. They grow together, and you'll read about their exploits, and what everyone, even random people, think as they pass in and out of the Nolans' lives. What the tree-man thinks when he throws a tree at Francie and Neeley, what little boys think as they watch a horse, what Katie feels about her chidren, making plans about their unbringing and telling herself that she must not let Francie see that she loves Neeley much more than Francie, whom she only loves as a dutiful mother. (which, by the way, she fails miserably. About letting Francie know, i mean.)The books protrays Francie from the time she is born to when she is nearly seventeen and leaving for college. About her academic life, the bitterness and grief when Johnny dies, the Nolans' fears about money and food.Betty Smith is an expert on the perspectives of people. She has a wonderful idea of what people think, and why they do things. An great example of this is when she tells us about Joanna, a girl who gives birth to an illegitimate child, and the real reason why women despised her.This was a fantastic book, and i definitely recommend it to readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read tons of classic novels so I was surprised that it took me so long to discover this gem, which belongs on any list of classics.Betty Smith is a masterful storyteller with a gift for exposing human nature and illuminating the most meaningful nuances of relationships.I gave it a four-star rating only because it was a slow start for me. I pushed through based on friends' recommendations, and I was glad I did.After I got sucked in, I couldn't put it down. The story is touching, poignant, deep, moving, and profound. It made me more appreciative of the beauty of simplicity and the joy of relationships.To me the theme revolves around these two passages:\\"'Dear God,' she prayed, 'let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry...have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere--be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.'\\"\\"'People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,' thought Francie, 'something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains--a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone--just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\""},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I know it's horrible, but I JUST read this and I can't believe it took me this long. Lately I've been laying off the real reads and sticking to mags, blogs, and thrillers...with a few nonfiction pieces thrown in for good measure. I picked this up because it's the only mass market I own (someone gave it to me) and I was headed on a trip.I couldn't figure out why, but I couldn't put this book down. There's no big suspense, no mysteries to figure out, no major plot twists (or big plot, for that matter), but I couldn't stop reading it.This book reminded me what reading used to mean to me before I let myself get so caught up in reading current events and career-related stuff. This book is about hope. The characters are amazing and you grow to love them all. Then you keep the turning the pages because you can't bear to give up hope that everything will come out all right. This book is a lesson to all, without offering up any blatant fable-type morals.

I usually choose books with topics and intersets that I like. I, and like a lot of people, do not like to be told what I have to read. This was I book I had to read for summer reading. Out of all the books on the list and that I have ever read, this was the worst piece of crap that I have ever read. The main thing that made me hate this book was that the depressing and sad life lead by Francie Nolan, is that it is very much like mine. She is me living in the 1800's. The story is about Francie and her family's struggle through poverty, death, periods of no food and money, and most imoportantly, alcoholism. When you think that things can't get any worse, they do. Out of all the characters in the book I hate Johnny Nolan. He is just like my dad, but when my dad is drunk he is a jerk. I don't know how she can love someone who is holding her back from the world. She and the rest of her family give up alot for thier father's little things like clean shirt, beer and bus money. My favorite part in the book was when he died. I celebrated this convince for Francie...."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature.

I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details.

I felt it was meant to show &quot;what growing up in a poor Catholic family in that time period in Brooklyn was like.&quot; That's my family background, and it just struck me as some upper-class WASP who beat it out of the brownstones down South at a young age's snobbish look down. The &quot;plain&quot; daughter got sent to a convent? The daughter who was moving up financially sent her kids to an Episcopalian school? The mother told her daughter it would have been a beautiful thing if she'd lost her virginity to a guy she wasn't going to see again, although wearing her hair down was bad?

Not only does it spend too much time with detail, it seems to drag on FOREVER. A complete waste of time. Smith spends so much time on character development yet none of the characters are interesting or intelligent. And it never ends! If you are suicidal, do not read this book--it's too depressing. This is the first book I have actually hated. When I read it I daydreamed at least 50 times a page. I though I would never finish. This book is for sensative, emotional girls who cried during Titanic. Boys who like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction will want to burn this book after reading ten pages. Trust me. A lot of people like it because they can &quot;relate&quot; to it. But that's not what literature is about. Literature is about telling an interesting story in a manner that provokes thought, not about spending three-quarters of the book getting people &quot;attached&quot; to the characters and then at the end put them through a tragedy that makes sensative people cry and delute themselves into thinking the book was &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. Take my word for it, this book is wordy and poorly though out."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is a character who will long be remembered by anyone who reads &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot; Bright but lonely, poor but resourceful, Francie Nolan is captured from ages 11 to 16 with poignancy and love. Francie is her daddy's &quot;prima donna&quot; and she treasures his love while fighting to win her mother's. Although she never achieves the place in her mother's heart that her brother holds, her strength and sheer perserverance guide her through difficult times. Like the sturdy tree that grows outside her window and survives all catastrophes, Francie Nolan survives poverty, lack of formal education, sexual assault, extreme loneliness, and lost love.The reader first meets Francie at age 11 when, as an inquisitive young girl, her favorite time of the day is on Saturday when she can go to the library then rush home with her treasure and read the afternoon away on the fire escape of her Brooklyn tenement. As a young girl, she feels &quot;rich&quot; when she receives bits of chalk and stubby pencils her mother and father bring home from their janitoring job at a local school. She finds simple pleasures in her life, like being allowed to sleep in the front room on Saturday night and watch the busy street below. You will ache to go back in time and be Francie's best friend as she battles loneliness and rejection by her peers but learns to live a solitary life. But, like the tree, she is ready to burst into bloom and when she does it is beautiful to read about.This book is a wonderful description of life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and a strong statement on the hope offered to the immigrants who came to the United States. The story emphasizes quite clearly the value of reading and a good education, but most importantly the strength of family and the dreams that sustain people. As Francie learns, &quot;there had to be the dark and muddy waters so that the sun could have something to background it flashing glory.&quot; Young teens and mature women alike will relish Francie's story and hold its message in their hearts forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am in total awe after reading this book. In the beginning I thought it was going to be a boring and long novel. But throughout my reading I became to grow more attached to the story. The main character Francie was an intriguing and delightful creation that anyone would want as their best friend, should she not be a fictional person. I enjoyed reading how the poor family made ends meet and continued surviving when it seemed they couldn't hang on much longer. It seems that you shouldn't find it entertaining to read of suffering, but the author writes it in such a ingenious way as to that you're really reading about the magnificence of life, living, and death. As the family encounters dilemma after dilemma you find yourself encased in the wonder of how they do it. Throughout all the sadness and suffering the Nolans are still kind and considerate, loving and caring, fair and just; overall good people! Don't get me wrong, this is not a sad story, although some parts are on the sadder side. This is a marvelous writing about why people live and how. It shows a young girl growing up and changing into a woman. I was so in tune with the story I found myself laughing, crying, cheering, and feeling scared! The Nolans are resourceful and caring people, although they do have their faults. You learn about them from birth to middle aged and curiously watch them change, grow, and develop their ways. You see where each person gets their character traits from and why they do certain things. The setting is early twentieth century Brooklyn, NY. The Nolans live in a neighborhood of old flats. Electricity has not yet been invented and the value of the dollar is way higher than the present. Its interesting reading about how their insurance was twenty-five cents and that four people could eat on ten cents a day! The author provides you with outstanding descriptions of looks, feelings, and mood as to that you feel you are really there. You feel as if you have known the characters forever and are close friends with all of them. This is because you learn more about them throughout the story as if you really were their friends, and they were alive and you got to know them better as time goes on. While you read this book, you will discover how lucky we are, and what some people went through to cope with the daily mandatory needs of humans. I am completely convinced anyone who reads this book will fall in love with the gentle rhythym of the flowing sentences. When I finished I didn't want it to end, the author could've kept writing until Francie died and you would've ever get bored. Yet all books have to end. With a touch of history, I am positive anyone who reads this will be more than satisfied. This novel definitely deserves more than five stars!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In the first page of this book, Betty Smith writes very gently and calmly of Francie Nolan, a pre-teenager just beginning to step out on the edge of adulthood. And Smith ties the book up neatly at the end as if she's giving a present to the reader ... which she is. This is one of the sweetest, most eloquently written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn with her brother Neely, mom Katie and dad Johnny. It is in the early 1900s where the book is set. The family is poor ~~ living almost on the edge of starvation. Francie has taken to reading like a duck takes to water ... once she discovered the joy of reading, she becomes a big bookworm. She is also a keen observer of life around her ~~ her thoughts are often witty and funny as she observes the strange behavior of her mother's sisters and their lives, the neighbors, her brother Neely, her mother and father's relationships with one another. Till Francie grows up to be this amazing woman set on the path of her destiny.Betty Smith takes you along for a wonderful story-filled walk in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. She introduces the smells of old Brooklyn, the noise, the joys and sorrows of being in a poverty-stricken family ~~ the hopes and dreams of the immigrants that left the old country because there was nothing there for them. The hopes and dreams of the parents for their children to have better lives than they did ... falling in love with one another ... the disappointments of being disappointed by life, the wonder of finding joy in anything new or rediscovering something old. Betty Smith has captured the nuances of life and shares a bit of her soul for us readers to find.What I like most about this book is how much I can relate to Francie and her reading habits and her growing up years. She is full of insecurities and questions, loves to read and takes such joy in reading ... especially when she promised herself that she was going to read every book in the local library, starting from a to z. And Smith captures that longing perfectly, as if she has had the same dreams and desires when she was 11.I can rave about this book forever, but it isn't as much fun as reading this book.

In this book she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge into the human soul. All her words come strait from the heart to make a book that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to craw up to a better station in live against tremendous odds as well as forces working against them. A tree Grows in Brooklyn touches every ones hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father, yet this father somehow always make her feel so special and unique. She lives with her father, a severely realistic mother, and a brother who is always favored. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\"; Francie was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type. In fast she entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself that one day read all the books in the library, she started this goal by reading a book-a-day. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, doesn't help this division at all; she feels even more disconnected and different from the rest of the world at Neeley birth, fore he is the favored son and get all the attention that Francie lacked growing up. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division is society caused by money and education. Because of this division and favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the death of her father. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today this is a requirement from everyone, but at this point in time very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Nothing can stop Francie from getting her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better live for everyone. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"While many novels offer an escape through some fantastical storyline set in a faraway place, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the kind of novel that makes you realize the universality of common feelings, frustrations, and hopes--and the role that sorrow and sacrifice play in the development of character. One of my favorite scenes is that of the Charity Party, when Francie is torn between her desperate longing for the doll being offered to any &quot;poor child named Mary&quot; and her resentment towards the manner in which affluent individuals approach giving. The author allows Francie to be a child--she lies in order to receive the charity doll, knowing that on the stage in front of her neighborhood peers she is both pathetic for taking charity as well as envied for owning such a rich toy. However, despite giving in to her desire, Francie is also a spirit beyond her years. She walks home both clutching her doll and cursing the insensitive givers, cyring out that for once, people should give to the poor without having to say, &quot;I am rich and you are poor.&quot; Another remarkable aspect of the book, further demonstrating it's stark realism, was the fact that Francie never places moral judgement on her father. If we contrast A Tree Grows in Brooklyn with Angela's Ashes, we see two opposing manners in which families respond to alcolohic fathers. Francie's strength, we may surmise, is most likely a product of her genuine belief that she led a happy childhood with two loving parents that had her best interests in mind. While she may later look back and realize her father's problems robbed her of some opportunity, her sense of security and love for her father would still remain intact, and judging from the role her father played in the household, Francie seemed to need a tender male role model to counter her mother's harsh pragmatism towards her children. We also see this in Francie's reaction to her ignorant writing teacher's claim that Francie's stories were &quot;ugly,&quot; as Francie recognized that these tales (which were about her relationship with her father) were important and beautiful enough to be saved.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book that provides deep insight as to how individuals can be stronger, wiser, and more grounded. Above all else, it is an essay on love, trust, and suffering as it relates to the character strength humans need to be survivors. It was after reading this book that I realized for the first time in my life that suffering, though difficult to ride through, really is one of the most positive influences an individual can experience."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A friend of mine once said, &quot;A classic is a book which has never finished saying what is has to.&quot; This book is definitely a classic, one that I will read every year I'm sure.&quot;Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York.&quot; If that opening line doesn't hook you in, keep reading. With each word, sentence, phrase...it just keeps getting better. Smith writes beautifully, her words magically making something out of the life of a child who could have been a nobody. This story is moving and beautiful-a must read for anyone who loves books and an inspirational story.The story follows the life of little Francie Nolan, poor child of a penniless singer-waiter-drunkard Johnny, and hardworking-penny pincher-beautiful Katie. Francie is a smart child who loves to read. Her life is by turns happy, sad, melancholy and poignant. With parents determined to see her and her brother Neeley to do better in life than they did, she moves through school and into the working life of her teens. Her life is never easy, but one of her best characteristics is her ability to find beauty is the smallest things. One of my favorite examples of this is, upon a visit to the old, shabby library, she sees in a plain brown bowl &quot;...nasturtiums! Red, yellow, gold, and ivory-white. A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sigh. It was something to be remembered all her life. (page, 21-chapter 2).&quot;I laughed, cried and cheered with this tiny child, desperate to make something of herself and find love. Smith gives the lives of these poor, desperate, sometimes even starving people a measure of pride and beauty that is unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read many classic books, but \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is by far the best work of literature I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. As a sixteen year old young woman from suburban America, many may question how I can possibly relate to the unfortunate life led by Francie Nolan. However, this is the beauty of Betty Smith's masterpiece, for EVERY young woman is capable of relating to many of the scenes found in this timeless classic. These include Francie's sexual assault, the favoritism Francie's mother has for brother Neeley, and the close relationship Fancie has with her father, whose alcoholism ultimately leads to his untimely death.Despite the hardships Francie is faced with, she perseveres, acquiring a job in order to help her family survive. Although her education must be put on hold for the time being, Francie remains hopeful that the day will come in which she, like her brother, Neeley, will be capable of going off to school.Not only is the ongoing story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn simply timeless, but the metaphor of the tree outside Francie's window that has grown through unfortunate circumstances is absolutely perfect. The tree had been cut down and was even the victim of a bonfire, but it continued to grow and blossom. Just like Francie, the tree beat the odds and rose from nothingness to beauty and strength.Never have I read anything and cried at the end simply because it was over. As you read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", you become wrapped up in Francie's life until you feel as though she and you are one in the same. The fact that I have only read this book once astonishes me, and I can guarantee you that I will read it again this summer. The purchase of this book may set you [a few]...dollars, but the experience of reading \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is absolutely priceless."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a girl named Francie. She lives in Brooklyn with her mom, Katie, dad, Johnny, and brother, Neeley.Francie loves to read and has vowed to read one book everyday for the rest of her life, as well as a page from the Bible and a page from Shakespeare every night. Her parents are very young and her dad is drunk a lot. Her dad is out of work a lot, and goes back and forth between jobs. Her mom works very hard to try to support her family. Katie starts Franice and her brother Neeley in school at the same time, even though Neeley is a year younger, with the hopes that they will do a better job fending of the bigger kids together. Francie doesn't last very long in the school though. The teacher is mean towards the poorer children, and Francie is one of them. While taking a walk one day, she sees another school, one that looks much nicer and more fun. She gets her dad to write a letter to the principal of her school, saying that she is going to live with some relatives, and go to another school. He writes that Neeley will continue to go to this same school. She loves this new school and with lots of encouragement from her teachers, has found that she loves to write.I would definitely recommend this book. The book has lots of detail and the author does a good job putting into words kind of how it is like to be poor with a father who is drunk a lot the time. There are a lot of good adjectives and I felt like I was actually there.This is a contemporary fiction book and I give it 5 stars.Morgan Budihas"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had always meant to read this book and, at age 22, I finally got around to it. Making this purchase was an excellent decision.This is the heartwarming story of a little girl growing up in--where else?--Brooklyn with her older brother, her overworked mother, and her deadbeat, drunken father. It follows her over a significant period of her life, making it one of the earliest &quot;coming of age&quot; stories which focuses on a girl. You grow up with Francie and experience her heartbreak along with her in different aspects, from life in general to, at a little older, love.Not only did the author do a great job of telling the story of a family, she also informs the reader about what it was like to grow up at the turn of the century in New York as a poor family. It makes the reader (or at least it did for this reader) appreciate everything that they have in light of such poverty. However, it shows that, even in such dire poverty, children can still have happy and cherished memories of their childhoods.The book is a bit lengthy and does ramble on at times, but it does not fail to keep you interested and turning the pages. It is also easy reading, although it may look intimidating--I managed to get through it within a few days, and would definitely read it again. It is a great addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a novel to be read and enjoyed for many different reasons. As an initial matter, it paints a portrait of Brooklyn at the turn of the twentieth century. Many books contain descriptions, but this book contains something more. I could hear the chaos on the streets, including the noisy children, horses and vendors. I could smell and taste the coffee that Francie's mother left boiling on the stove at all hours of the day and night. It went beyond mere description--this novel involved all of my senses and made me truly feel what it was like to live in that time and place.Beyond the amazing imagery is a somewhat simple story of a family in crisis. Johnny, the father, drinks too much and can't hold a job but is the light and life of the family. Katie, the mother, loves her family ferociously, but has been imbittered by the strain that Johnny and their perpetual state of poverty places upon her. The story truly belongs to Francie and Neely, the two children, who survive by staying together, inventing stories and games for each other, and finding joy in their meager surroundings.The most noteworthy aspect of the novel, to me, was its utter anger. I have heard Steinbeck's Travels with Charley described as &quot;an angry book&quot;. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was much angrier. Francie's childlike but astute observations concerning how society ignores the needs and struggles of the working poor explode with anger. Francie's shining moment is when she shames the doctor who comments in front of her that all poor people are dirty, without thinking that she and her brother can understand him. Sissy's shining moment is when she shames Francie's teacher who ignores poor children to the point that she fails to release them to use the bathroom, causing them to have humiliating accidents. Even Francie's and Neely's victories contain an undercurrent of anger. They catch the leftover Christmas tree, warming the heart of the peddler who threw it. But because he is poor, he cannot openly be happy for them, and has to throw curses after them as they parade home with their prize.This book contains magic and heartbreak, heroics and cowardice, beauty and hideousness. It describes what it was like to be a poor child in Brooklyn in 1908. Above all, it reminds us that poverty and human behavior is universal. Shamefully, children and adults are still going through what Francie and her family went through 100 years ago."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book in the 6th grade. Even then I loved it. I am now in the 10th grade and I have read it 6 times since then. This is my most favorite book in the world. The entire plot is gut wrenching. It's a real page turner. Every time I read it I cry harder then the previous time. It is a long book, but its definatley worth the time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There are hardly words adequate to describe the impact that reading this book has had on my life. Any girl who grew up with a &quot;Johnny Nolan&quot; for a father has this book written upon her soul. A heartfelt story of unconditional and triumphant love. I have never read another book like it, and know I never will. It is beautiful."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Well, I started another book on my ninth grade reading list after my dad picked up the book at a store in Halifax, NS. When I saw that the book was 80 years old, I was ready to go searching for the cliff notes. But I decided to go for it thinking it might not be that bad. In the beginnining the story was a bit confusing, but later it began to take shape. So I read it, it was done, went to Brooklyn and realized they had many trees."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book three times already. The first time I read it I was in the fourth grade and didn't really get it. But in the seventh grade I read it again and now it's one of my favorite books. It was so realistic. I loved Francie, but hated Katie because she favored Neeley."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I must admit I didn't want to read it. I had to for school. I was horribly bored with it in the beginning but as it moves it's very, very good. Both girls and boys can relate to it. I related to a lot of what Francie said. However, Neeley is definately my favorite :)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Im 17 years old and I bought his book and read it in a day and i loved it completely. It is one of the best books i have ever read. Francie Nolan has deeply impacted my life and i dont think it will ever be the same. I see things more clearly than i have ever seen them in my life. It is a truly enjoyable book that everybody should read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is my favorite book. All my friends to whom I have described the story are interested in it! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for good reading around the age of 13 or older."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was trying to catch up on my classics when I ran across this book. I can honestly say that it was one of the richest, most fulfilling books I have EVER read. A book that truely has stood the test of time, &quot;A Tree Grow in Brooklyn&quot; will always have a place in my heart. Exelently portrayed characters leave someone that every young woman can identify with."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a beautiful book! I am 13 years old, and I had the obligation of reading it for high school summer work, so when I first looked at it, I thought &quot;Oh, this book is going to be boring.&quot; Boy, was I wrong! As soon as I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down. It's not filled with great action or adventure, but it is so interesting and well-written that I was pulled into the story, and I didn't want to stop reading it. Now that I finished it, I read it two more times, each time being just as good. I truly recommend this book to everyone!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT I KNEW THAT I SHOULD HAVE READ LONG BEFORE NOW. IT HAS BEEN ON MY MUST-READ LIST FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT ALL YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD READ. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SET IN THE EARLY 1900'S, SOME THINGS STILL APPLY TO OUR TIMES. IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING TO COMPARE LIFESTYLES THEN AND NOW. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book I read as a child as well as seeing the movie. For anyone who loved Anne of Green Gables, this book is as beautiful in a different way. It teaches morals, values, and the practical versus the emotional (and how each has its own value.) If you are searching for the perfect book for a daughter, grandaughter, or niece--10 and up, you just can't go wrong. It also provides a glimpse backward into America's history, when things were harder to come by and appreciated more."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story has been very close to my heart ever since I first read it in junior high. I have read it dozens of times since and its meaning, honesty and authetic descrition of this young Brooklyn girl and her family still effect me in the same way. Don't miss your chance to enjoy this keeper--&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; deserves a spot on your shelf next to all the great literary classics that you enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a pretty good book. It was about a girl named Francie and she grew up in Brooklyn with her parents and her little brother, Neeley. It was a pretty good book because it showed you steps of growing up; it started out when she was around six or seven years old and all the way up to college. I would probably recommend this book to someone else to read because it was pretty interesting."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book should be read not only by women but by men alike. the story follows a young girl &lt;francie&gt; and her childhood in brooklyn. the characters are amazing, the story beautiful. read this book, i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"One of the only books I've read twice! I read this book in the ninth grade and again in my 30's. It's a book I've always cherished. The characters are lovable and believable. An excellent story of growing up with too little. The apple of her charismatic drunken father's eye, pitied by her mother, Francie is an every day hero. Her parents try their dreadful best to give their children more than they had. You want to hate them but you can't. She is a piece of everyone we know. A young girl who is alone and loves to read to escape the life & circumstances she has little control over. So many who read this book feel that the book was written about them. I mentor an inner-city student who I will definately pass this book onto. It offers hope that no matter how we start out in life we can all survive and achieve. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger! A great book for teens."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say &quot;I told you so&quot;."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is as much a snapshot of the first twenty years of Brooklyn's twentieth century as it is a book about a family that anyone can sympathize with and relate to. This is Francie Nolan's story yet at the same time, through this girl, we become part of her family and part of her world. Betty Smith writes with such detail that I felt like I had lived the life she wrote for Francie and as I ate up the pages in between my first meeting with Francie up until I said good-bye to her as a grown-up, I was certain that I shared a special bond with her even though our worlds are years and states away. Not in the least a disappointment."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I found the book very good at an 8th grade level. I had to read it for history class and many people enjoyed it. It was a great subject for our class because we are studying early 1900s. It was great in detail of the problems and impoverished life of many immigrant families in New York. The only problem I found, was that it was so detailed that it became a little boring at times, or that the detail confused me. If you want to read a good book about a teen girl in the early 1900s, read this. Its a great book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have only read up to Book One so far of A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but so far enjoy it.

When my father died I took our beat up copy to a bookbinder and had it rebond in leather with gold lettering. He couldn't believe I wanted to spend that kind of money on a 40 year old book club addition. It means that much to me. I reread it at least yearly, it is an old friend."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I recieved A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as a gift for my eleventh birthday, from my dad. I knew it was a classic, and wanted to read it, even if just to impress my dad. However, I didn't get around to it until I was about twelve and a half. It was one of those books where I would pick it up, read a few pages, then toss it aside, until reading and falling madly in love. I have read this book about four times, and each time I read it, I feel so.... alive, I guess. Being a teenager (14 now) like Francie, when I read the book I feel as if my emotions have been validated. Once, after reading it on vacation, I had finished it and wandered around the empty cabin, sighing and crying. This is one extremely powerful, beautiful, and emotional book, and -this is a command- you MUST read it. It will send you on an emotional journey, and leave you changed forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'll admit, I was hesitant when my teacher told me we were going to begin reading this 430 page book. I thought to myself, &quot;Oh no, another book that drags on and on...&quot; I could not have been more wrong about this book. This book is extremely touching, as well as interesting. I found myself engrossed in this book to the point where I didn' t want to do anything else but read, which for me, doesn' t happen very often. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and I hope that whoever reads it will enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book stirred my heart as a teenager, Francie's age. Her expeirences with love and being wanted are so like mine it is amazing. I had to read this for a summer reading assignment. And I have a horrible time reading something required. It takes away from the book. But I could hardly put this down. I suggest this to EVERYONE!!!!!! Especially for younger girls, this has so many wonderfully, independent and strong women as role modles! Everyone from 2 to 102 needs to read this."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"AFTER REVIEWING ALL THE GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT THE&quot;TREE&quot; I FIND THAT EVERYTHING I FELT WAS ALREADY EXPRESSED A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS. THE LOVE I FEEL FOR THIS BOOK IS IMEASURABLE. I DISCOVERED IT WHEN I WAS 10 YRS. OLD. I WAS READING A FICTION STORY IN A MAGAZINE, AND THEY MADE REFERENCE TO THAT BK. I AM A VORACIOUS READER AND AT THAT TIME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOOKS I WOULD LIKE SO I WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TITLES OF BKS. I HADN'T HEARD BEFORE, AND RUSH TO THE LIBRARY TO CHECK IT OUT.

It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for an English project.

I love it!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm 14 years old and I really don't like reading, but I fell in love with this book. I'm from Norway, a small country in north Europe, and a lot of norwegian people went to Brooklyn, in hope for a better life, in the early 1900. So that's what made me read it in the first place. Francie and I have a lot in common. Everyone should read this wonderful book. It's a lesson for life!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I saw the movie A tree Grows in Brooklyn, I didn't know much about it, but I loved the film so my mom bought me the book.

I've read many books in my life and this is the #1, all time favorite, desert island pick. I've read it four times and it always touches me.

You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, written by Betty Smith, is a fabulous novel, which is about a young girl growing up poor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with her family and neighbors. This novel was published in 1943 by Harper and Brothers Publishing and was selected as one of the Books of the Century by the New York Public Library. Francie Nolan, the protagonist of this story, is a delightful young child with such great determination to succeed and to get an education. This novel is so interesting, because it shows how the hardship of daily life was like back in the 1900s. Francie Nolan has a very tough time growing up in Brooklyn at age 11. Part of this reason is because her father is an alcoholic, who struggles tremendously, therefore not being able to be a good father. This comes down to Francie having an empty stomach continuously. Francie is such a gentle and obedient young girl who is a mix of both the Nolan family and the Rommely family, though she is more of her own person. She acquires her own personality and own traits through her observations and readings, which really makes Francie a live and brilliant character.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was written very methodically, with the chapters going through Francie's life year by year, consisting with times when you can just about break out into tears, and times when you are just angry with a specific character. The conflicts, in which take place in Francie Nolan's life, are so realistic and entertaining that any reader will fall in love with the protagonist, Francie Nolan.Betty definitely achieved her purpose in writing this novel, for she intended for readers both young and mature to realize how fortunate they are to have up to three meals a day, while Francie considered it a blessing to eat only a slice of stale bread. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn strongly emphasizes the value of reading and education very clearly, but more significant, the importance of family and friends who will do anything to keep you safe from the real world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There's nothing I can add to the many fine detailed plot summaries already here, so I'll just say that I agree with countless critics more learned than I who put this on the very short list of Great American Novels.I have given it to every young girl I care about, starting with my four daughters and eight granddaughters, and I felt like a real sexist when one of my nine grandsons told me he borrowed his sister's copy and thought it the best book he'd ever read.The Dorothy McGuire/Peggy Ann Garner movie, by the way, is one of those very rare movies that almost do justice to a great book. Don't miss it, either."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have to admit that it took a long time for me to get into the story. If I hadn't enjoyed the film and didn't know the story as well as I did from my grandmother, I probably would have stopped around page 100 or so. The first third of the story is centered around the struggles and the shame of being poor. The second third allows the characters some time to blossom and shows the sacrifices families are willing to make to give the children a better chance. The final third shows the first tenous results of those years of sacrifice and at last the characters come into their own. Of course there are also the themes of life lessons learned, family tragedies, and family joy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith (1896-1972) wrote an American classic which became a huge bestseller in World War II America. The book was later made into a fine film.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel dealing with the coming of age of a young Irish girl Francie Nolan. Francie grows up in poverty in Brooklyn. Her mother is hardworking and favors Francie's brother Neely, Her Irish father is a singing waiter who drinks himself to death in his early 30s. Francie's school is grim and life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is a constant struggle for survival to the impoverished residents of this most colorful of New York's boroughs.Smith takes these ingredients and mixes them into a potent stew of heartwarming tales concerning Francie, her friends and her family,The book is no sentimental slow boat to a halcyon past of childhood memories. Smith tells her tale in a matter of factnon-maudlin way. Her style is simple but profound. Author Smith uses simple words to convey the joys and sorrows, tragedies and small triumphs experienced by a poor family in a poor locale.Everyone who wants to read a very accessible touching classic should read this excellent novel of a young girl and her dreams and daily life.I devoured this book in two days as I was transported back in time to the Brooklyn of the early 20th century entering into the tenement home of the Nolans. It is a trip I recommend for you to read!The Perennial edition contains a short biography of Betty Smith including a reminiscence by her daughter.A beautiful, enduring classic of American prose!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I am having a hard time believing someone would give this book a bad review. I must have read it 10 times over my life and I love it! I am about to purchase a new copy for my almost 9 year old daughter, as my copy is obviously well worn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I spent a very happy new years eve a few years ago with a bottle of champage and this book, and since then it has become a friend in times of need.There is always hope, so long as you have the strength to survive."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book based on the reviews here and I wasn't disappointed. I felt a part of the Nolan family throughout, longed to help them (thought they wouldn't have accepted it), and enjoyed their company. The many characters are quite well depicted as is life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. It's a glorious tale of family ties, neighborhoods, loyalty and strength. While long, it is a fairly fast read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book about five years ago while I was still in high school and I still find myself loving it just as much today. This is a great example of a coming of age book. Its a short read which makes it great for younger readers. But just because its short doesnt mean that there are not so many messages to take from this book. You see Francie grow from a nieve child to an educated adult. You sit with her as she suffers the heart ache that often hits us all at some point in life and show that life must go on. With so many books becoming a staple in high school education I find myself wondering how this book is not one of them. Showing that we all have it inside us to make it even under the worst of circumstances. A prime example of how the smallest seed can still manage to bloom into one of the greatest flowers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm so glad that I decided to read this book. I'd initially purchased it because it was on sale (and I really needed something new to read). Nonetheless, this book has become one of my, if not all time, favorite novels. The characters and situations are so real, and I'm a firm believer that ANYONE (male or female, young or old) can somehow relate to Francie Nolan. In this day and age where the youth seldomly read and are exposed to terrible mediums of entertainment (reality tv--Paris Hilton??) we need books such as \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" It's so genuine and full of spirit and heart, despite the characters' dismal situations. This book has the ability to inspire readers to live their lives with integrity and to persevere--especially in seemingly hopeless situations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"After reading this book, I looked at the negative reviews to see what people could have possibly said was wrong with this book. A few found it boring, some found it depressing. I think these people did not give this book the proper attention it deserved. Though \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is about the life of a poor girl in a poor neighborhood and a poor life, this is not what the book focuses on. As you read the book, you are constantly reading about the beauty of the world around Francie Nolan, not the squalor. Through most of the book, you see the world through the eyes of a young, imaginative, smart, innocent girl who does not have the \\"education\\" and \\"knowledge\\" to realize how terribly she has it. You see the true love bonds between brother and sister, father and daughter, and between a mother and daughter who love each other despite their inability to understand one another. Although it is true that there is some sorrow in this story, I found myself laughing much more often than I found myself crying. The sad parts are not fun, but pain is in every good and realistic story. The humor in everyday people and everyday life is what makes this book so enjoyable. Each character has a specific personality with humorous and lovable quirks. And the ending is worth the entire book. I finished this book feeling so wonderful about every aspect of my life. It is not a completely happy ending, but it is a very satisfying one. I would recommend this book to any girl or woman and I would recommend that everyone else should give it an honest chance too."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. I would honestly suggest this book to anyone and everyone I know.. even though the book was written so long ago, and takes place during the turn of the last century, the story is so timeless, and I could relate all of it. This was a great read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Wow - this one has been on my \\"must read\\" list for a long time, and I am so glad I finally picked it up. I read it in 2 sittings, and could barely put it down. The coming-of-age story of Francie Nolan is apparently based on Betty Smith's own life - and she is a magician with the written word. Her descriptions of the deepest poverty of Brooklyn during WWI and insights into the minds and souls of fragile yet incredibly strong people are stunning. Her observations about the human condition are timeless. Tree is a real treasure of American literature..."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong, complex characters, and the history of a legendary part of the United States being just two of them. The world through the main character's eyes is a world seen anew. The reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century Brooklyn, the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is timeless. I've read it a couple of times and so has my mom. Nothing dull in these pages. When friends and I discuss books, I always suggest this book first, second, and last!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It broke my heart during parts though, I had never realized how different times were then. It is a bit long, but I found that in the end, the extra length was worth it. Francie is by far one of my favorite characters I have come upon in any book. Those looking for an exciting book may want to back away from this one, but those wishing to read a wonderful piece of literature definitely need to pick this up."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Everything I like to find in a book is in it: honesty, depth of character, some sadness and also happiness. I love how this book shows all the different aspects of Francie's life through her own experiences and the experiences and lives of the people around her. On the last page, when I read the last paragraph, I almost felt like crying, and believe me, I'm not the type of person who starts to cry in romantic movies. Anyway, another great thing about this book is that you can see how Francie changes as she grows older. Again, another thing I like is how some of the characters who lead rather unconventional lives (take Sissy or Johnny)are described as the people who they really are and not labled as we tend to do in our society. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was a very good book. It was about a little girl, Francie, who grew up poor and became successful when she got older. She went to school and did part-time jobs. She went on to college with the support of her mother and with a lot of obstacles in her way. She also met a great guy. You have to read the book to really understand it. This book has foreshadowing and rising action in it. The author played out the book well. It keeps you interested and it makes you want to keep on reading. You want to know what happens at the end. It really is that interesting. I can't give this book any bad critique's, because it is a good book overall. It's a good book to learn about life. Life gets better and the saying, \\"there's always a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" is a good saying to describe this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just wanted to add to the review lists that I really really enjoyed this book and am saddened that I didn't read it earlier in life. I think there is a bit of Francie Nolan in all of us."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How is it possible that out of all the different literature classes I've taken (including a few American and a women's lit classes) that I have never heard of Betty Smith? This is one of the best novels I've ever read. The characters were so real, and the way Smith described the neighborhood and the culture made it seem as real to me as the world outside my door. This is the book that when you finish you hesitate to read another book, because it's really not possible to measure up to it. I admit that I was put off by the whole &quot;coming of age&quot; title this book seems to get, but it's so much more than that. It's a beautiful piece of literature and Betty Smith is an important American and woman author. I hope her other novels come back in print."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"You know those books you continually read over and over? The ones that grab you with their honesty, their utter beauty? This is one of those. This book is by far my favorite book--and considering how much I read, that is saying quite a bit. The writing is simple and elegant in that simplicity. Betty Smith has a way with words that pulls you in and lets you experience everything as if it were entirely firsthand. Because of that, this is not a book to read through quickly, but to savor at length. It paints pictures in your mind that settle into the crevices of your imagination, to be brought out later and enjoyed. They just don't write them like this, anymore."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"25 years after reading this book for the first time, I STILL love this book as much as I did the first time I read it. The characters are warm and real and the story still inspires me. I have given a copy of this book to every young girl in my life and everyone of them has been thrilled once they have read it. I re-read this book at least once a year and it has a treasured place of honor among my collection of girlhood favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's quite sad that someone with limited spelling and vocabulary felt the need to write three separate reviews against this book, merely changing the order of the complaint. Clearly, s/he didn't understand it. This book does not merely discuss the fact that Francie had a rough life that she managed to overcome; remember, as she and Neeley discussed the future after their mother remarried, they reminded each other how much fun it had all been along the way. Francie's struggles, analogous to the tree of the title, are what stimulated her young mind. Smith's writing so crisply describes tenement life, but she also gives Francie the credit for making crucial decisions along the way (changing schools, for example), rather than depending on others to think for her. My mother tried to get me to read this book for years, but it is not a book for young children--it took adulthood for me to truly appreciate this wonderful, heartfelt book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book quickly became my favorite book of all time! It was filled with fantastic detail and wonderful discription. I cried, I laughed, I was depressed I was extatic! This book was really amazing!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When i first bought the book, i had heard what a great book it was and how it was one the best books out there. As i began to read i wasnt sure if i was gonna like it as much as others had but i read on anyway. After the starting the second chapter, the book had literally absorbed almost all of my attention. While reading it i felt as though the characters were living next door and i knew them for my whole life. Its a complicated book about a girl living in brooklyn scrounching for money, learning about life, and basically growing up. I would have to say that no words i write can describe the book to its best. It is one of the best books i've ever read in my life and i recommend it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A deeply moving and all around great book. Smith captivates the spirit of a young girl in full. One of the best pound for pound books of our time. Being 13 years old and just getting into classical reading I would say this book is very easy to understand and read. It compares easily with To Kill A Mockingbird and Diary of Anne Frank."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is a bittersweet novel about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Even though her family is poor they still know what is important in life. All the characters come to life in this book. Francie is described from ages 11-16. I like her character better as a child than a teenager. This is a very well written book. I would recommend that every American should read it for a taste of a different life style."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book wa like reading a collage. Ms. Smith gives the reader many 'snapshots' of what life is like for Francie. We learn about her mother and her father and how Francie is like (and unlike) them. We learn about her setting and how Brooklyn makes her who she is. We learn about how poverty shaped her character. It's really a marvelous book, the kind I read at least twice a year just to releran the lessons it teaches me. What are those lessons? Here are a few: children pay attention to more than we think they do; poor people aren't always lazy; you can love somebody but also occasionally hate them...Bottom line? READ THE BOOK! (Then read it again.)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for a school assignment. I had over a week to read the first 80 pages. In three days, I finished it. This book is wonderful. It tells a full complete story of Francie Nolan's life of growing up. I truly enjoyed it. It is one of thise books that you positivly love, and HAVE to read over and over again. It truthfully tells the story of a poor, working class family in the early 1900s. It has characters that you will absolutely love, and the book is one to be treasured for many, many years to come."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one I highly recommend. Anyone who has ever wanted to be a little bit better, a little bit more dignified, this is the story of yourself. It may be a bit long, but it is truly a jewel of a novel. Inspiring and heartfelt!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I felt that A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN really expressed the life of a poor, struggling family growing up in the ghettos of Brooklyn. Betty Smith worked hard to enable the readers to understand this young child's perspective of life. The readers were able to focus in on the real problems and hardships that a child faced, when she was poor, and living in an unfair society, with uncaring people. The three children learn to deal with things and take them as they are, although they are having a very troublesome childhood. The novel goes on to tell about the parents, especially the father who seemed lost in the world. The father, spends all of his money buying alcohol, and getting drunk, where as the mother tries to cover up for his behaviors, and tries to make life seem normal. But of course, life isn't normal for this family. An even though the children's schools don't offer much of an education, the children discover how much they want to learn about life, and it's interesting ways. With only their mother to boost their self esteem, the children go on to collage, and the daughter has an editing job, where she earns a large amount of money to keep the family going. I enjoyed this book whole-heartedly and found it to be a suspense-holding novel with very good ideas. The author really made each character different, but loving towards each other. I hope all of the young readers in this world have a chance to read this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There are a few books that I always, always return to (Gone With The Wind, Rebecca, and others) and &quot;Tree&quot; goes into this category without a doubt. I don't know how many times I've read it in the 15 years since the first time I read it, but every time I pick it up, it's like coming home again. I have read Betty Smith's other books, and I was disappointed with them. Nothing could compare with the richness of &quot;Tree&quot;. I wish a more recent film were made of this book. Ignore the reviews here that insult &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,&quot; because this book is like sinking into a big comfortable sofa for a long talk with a friend you haven't seen in years."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I had to read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; for sophmore English. I read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; first because it was longer and I wanted to get it over with. It is my favorite book now (and I don't read that often). I didn't even read &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; because I reread &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; so many times."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was a great novel. Francie Noloan's description of her life filled with heartache, alcoholism, and poverty was extremely touching. Francie describes her life set in the early 1900's in the poor neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Her family and their lives of poverty, are the main focus of the novel. &quot;It grew in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps and it was the only tree that grew out of cement. It grew lavishly but in tenement districts.&quot; Smith's words capture a central theme of the book. It describes a young girl struggling to survive compared with the tree struggling to grow out of cement. Not only do they both survive, they both flauresh. Betty Smith captures the time perfectly and makes it seem real. She portrays each character in a distinct way. For example, Johnny, Francie's father leaves the reader angry and sad because of his drinking. This novel is especially geared women both young and old. I was disappointed with the ending because I was looking for a conclusion of Francie's life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Three years ago, when I was in the 9th grade, my English teacher introduced this book to my class. When my teacher explained how this would be a wonderful book, I found myself looking at her and thinking: &quot;Yeah, right. Whatever.&quot; Since I usually read books that were written by Asian authors, I did not think that this book would appeal to me in any way. The title sounded boring, and the book just SEEMED to be a boring one. However, I was proven wrong. Once I started reading the first page, I became completely absorbed into the story and couldn't put it down. The story about Francie Nolan and her family living in dire poverty touched my heart in a way few books ever have. I found myself immediately feeling for this young girl named Francie as she grew older and more mature with each page. By the time I finished the story, I had completely fallen in love with this book and read it all over again. I loved this book so much that I decided to keep the school copy ! (and pay for it) as I wanted to keep THIS particular copy of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Three years have now passed and I still treasure my first copy of The Tree and read it over and over again. Betty Smith has a simple, &quot;flowing&quot; writing style which enables one to become absorbed into the story very quickly. Needless to say, this has become one of my favorite books. I hope that one day, I will be able to introduce this wonderful book to someone else as my English teacher did to me 3 years before. Anyone who misses this book IS indeed denying themselves a truly rich experience. I heartily recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book has the eloquence, interest, and truth of history's greatest stories. By reading this novel, we also find an introspective view at a pivotal point in American history. I am deeply curious as to why Betty Smith's classic story of Francie Nolan has not been named the Great American Novel, for surely it qualifies."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It was 1962. I was 15. My life paralleled Francie's in so many ways I couldn't stand it. I desperately wanted a copy of the book but my family, like Francie's was very poor and we couldn't afford it. I was a student librarian at my high school and one of my jobs was to repair the books that had broken spines, and torn pages. As luck (fate?) would have it, one of the books in my pile of repairs was the &quot;Tree.&quot; It was so torn and tattered, the spine broken beyond repair (at least that was my juicy rationalization in my desperate, grasping teenage mind). The pages were like onion skin and spilled on to the floor when I picked the book up. I remember the decision vividly. Without hesitation I slipped the book into my large purse. I read, reread, the book and read it some more. My ritual was to read it at least once a year. It touched me in so many ways. Now it's 1998. I still have the book. I've moved cross country and back numerous times. I have lost more books and possessions in moving than I care to remember. But you know how when you move you always take your most precious things with you so nothing happens to them? This is what I have always done with &quot;Tree.&quot; It is my most treasured possesion. Yes, I made good on my theft. Some years ago I wrote a letter to the school and explained what I had done and enclosed a check so they could buy many, many more books. It's wonderful to read the reviews and know that this work of art has touched others lives as deeply as it has mine."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"c'mon-this is at least an eleven...I found this book in my grandparents basement, copywrite -like, 1920 or something. Anyway, this book is just so freakin' good."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My 9th grade teacher introduced this book to me and I thought it was going to be very boring and dull because it was such a long book.I was wrong it was so intresting, and so descriptive I felt as though I was Francie.It was so good (and the longest book I had ever read) I read it 3 times in 1 and a half years.The more I read it the more I loved the book.I recommend this book for anyone who refuses to read because reading this will surely get them to change their minds about reading.My whole class read it and even the guys could'nt put the book down.I am very thankful I was able to read this book because I will never forget how great the story was.Thank God we have an author as wonderful as Betty Smith to inspire us with her beautiful stories."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's classic is probably my all-time favorite book. After falling in love with it at age 13, I've read it at least 100 times as I approach age 40. And each time, I find something new -- a new character insight, a bit of description that I hadn't noticed before. Each character is memorably drawn, leaping off the page and coming to vivid life in my mind's eye as I read. I recommend it for all ages, but it's especially good for young girls and women who are, like Francie, smart and bookish and a bit of a square peg."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five &#65533;books&#65533;, each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: &#65533;Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. It&#65533;s growing out of sour earth. And it&#65533;s strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong&#65533; (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919.After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as &#65533;serene&#65533;, and quoting Francie&#65533;s observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francie&#65533;s parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katie&#65533;s sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnny&#65533;s brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful father&#65533;s death, and sees her mother&#65533;s newest pregnancy, which is Johnny&#65533;s child. She recognizes her mother&#65533;s apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat.Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francie&#65533;s new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katie&#65533;s new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self.Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary. I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. &#65533;The tree hadn&#65533;t died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky again&#65533;It lived! And nothing could destroy it&#65533; (483)."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"In an effort to move away from books that are published to appeal to women's book groups, we decided to select a classic. No wonder \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" has endured! This book was so far ahead of its time, it pleases me no end to imagine that school students are still reading it and finding meaning in it.I would be hard put to decide which of the well-defined characters would actually be my favorite character.I think I will carry Francie Nolan, her mom, Katie and her aunts in my heart always. I also loved the way Johnny Nolan's alcolholism was treated. The author was so wise to just tell the story and not moralize as would be the temptation. The same can be said of the poverty of the people. It simply spoke for itself.I will simply never forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a true classic that has withstood the test of time. It will touch and warm your heart, and remain with you long after the pages have been read. You will become deeply and emotionally attached to Francie Nolan, a young girl who overcomes many obstacles and challenges beyond her control in order to survive. Taking place in the slums of Brooklyn, Francie is part of a family who dotes on her brother. Her parents are not without their own set of problems, and Francie is faced with growing up in a world that has not been kind to her. She understands only too well the meaning of hunger, doing without, leaving school and not having enough money to go around.&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; takes place in the early part of the century and was written over fifty years ago. With this in mind, it may be difficult for today's generation, particularly if financial stability was never a problem, to fully understand and appreciate Francie's life. Unless, of course, the reader also experienced poverty - &quot;no money&quot; means no money, no matter what year or generation you are living in. You will marvel at Francie's determination, strength and courage, smile at her resourcefulness, and feel compassion for a girl who, by necessity, is far more mature than her years.Another excellent, highly recommended book by the same author is &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; It is written with the same grace, style and heart-rendering emotion as this one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As I read this book, I felt a mental change occuring and as I'm only 13, I didn't know what to expect from this story which my mother so highly recommended. But the story of young Francie touched and affected me so deeply, I felt her pain, sorrow, and triumph. Through all hardships and heartbreaks, Francie and Neeley endure and survive in their threadbare world, which in itself is admirable. This book struck a nerve in me that has changed my image of life drastically. Now the grass seems greener, the sky bluer, and suddenly it is as if someone held a candle up in front of me. The world is more distinct, and I appreciate the little things. I recommend this book to anyone that loves to read, it is truly a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and I could not put it down. All of Betty Smith's characters are vivid illustrations of types of personalities, yet she manages to show a bright side to all of them; the alcoholic father who loves his daughter, the &quot;free&quot; aunt who knows the true meaning of family loyalty, and a strong, sometimes harsh mother who will fight to the death for her children. This book is poignant and touching, with scenes that expose the tender and fragile nature of childhood. Francie's insights about society and people are also thought-provoking. The novel is an easy-read; however, by no means should it not be considered a literary treasure. Pick this one up for a novel study, a reading group, or just some summer reading next to the pool."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book many years ago as a young woman and loved it. Now many years later, it still is a wonderful story of a young girl growing up surrounded by poverty but maintaining an innocence of heart. There is not one ounce of cynicism in Francie's entire body; something that is rare today.I read many of the negative reviews from young people who have been required to read the book. It is so difficult for them to get past the differences of today's age and then; however, hopefully some will have inspiring teachers who will be able to get them through the details enough in order to see the universal story of perseverance and strength of family.This book is not a page turner, has dated dialogue and writing style, and is probably not for everyone. However, it is a warm, pleasant, inspiring read that should at least be tasted."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book as required reading my freshman year of high school. At the time I hated it. I read it again for fun about a year later and could not believe how great it was. I too was an avid reader as a young girl, just like Francie Nolan. I still have the same old beat up copy of the book I read in high school. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, and they're both wonderful. I think this should be required reading for every school child, especially the girls! Like me, they may not get it at first, but if they give it a chance, they will not be sorry."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" is named as one of the Century's Best Books by the New York Public Library for a reason. Originally published some 60 years ago, even to jaded readers of modern contemporary fiction, it remains highly readable. Every word.This was my mother's favorite book. I remember watching the movie with her when I was a child and for these two reasons, reading was slow. I couldn't help but reflect on the story as if they were MY memories rather than the main character's, a young girl named \\"Francie,\\" growing up in poverty in the early twentieth century. It reads like a series of both heartbreaking and entertaining anecdotes about life among first and second-generation immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. And while you can sense the starvation and the continual worry over making ends meet, through the eyes of the children, Francie and her brother, Neely, and also through their Aunt \\"Sissy,\\" who absolutely takes a bite out of life, it's difficult to feel sorry for them. They are prideful and make the most of all that they have. There's a scene where the children manage to stay standing as the tree vendor chucks a giant Christmas tree at them on Christmas Eve, which I will never forget. What will also stay with me are the feelings Francie discovers while growing up, about the different kinds of love she had for her family.I savored each page and didn't want it to end. For all the days I read, it was like spending time with my mom.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view.The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I hate this book and wish I was not forced to read it.

Just like the \\"Heaven Tree\\" that grew up through the concrete, she too struggled against hard, tough elements to reach the sky. For starters, Francie somehow knew that she had to get into another school if she had any hope of improving her life, and her determination led her take the necessary steps...even if it meant faking her address.Although she lived in poverty, Francie had the good fortune of being surrounded by people who loved her, especially her beloved brother Neely and her handsome, charming father. Unfortunately, the latter had a \\"likin' for the bottle\\" which proved to be part of his undoing. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother was a hard working woman who was forced to do more than her fair share of providing for the struggling family, and the scenes describing her diligently cleaning floors while pregnant are unsettling. So is the one in which young Francie is nearly attacked by a child molester until Katie rescues her. There are funny, lovely, and uplifting passages too...like those of Francie sitting outside to read while absorbing the sights and sounds of the city. The flowers in the library are pleasant to think about and visualize too, lovely reminders that regardless of poverty, pain, and disappointment, there is also beauty.It's a wonderful coming of age book, one that I plan to read again."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of those overlooked books that everyone should read! At the recommendation of a friend, I picked up this book and fell in love with it. Its a timeless tale of financial struggles, love, and family in the 30's. Even though the book was written sixty years ago, I found myself connecting to the book. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"For anyone who believes in the power of words to shape and transform, this book is a \\"must read.\\" It is stirring and rich, steeped in history and immensely entertaining. A really good book has the ability to make us understand life better. This is one such book. I learned so much about history from this book, as Smith brings color and depth into each page of her story with vivid details of the culture, the habits and the mores of the day. Her characters are strong, weak, flawed...utterly human. I was also reminded of the complexities of the human condition. Timeless issues make this book relevant to readers of any age in any decade. I savored Smith's style rather like one eats a really good chocolate, slowly as to truly experience its richness. I read this book in less than 48 hours; now, a week later, I'm re-reading it carefully with the intent of teaching it. It is my hope my own daughters will read it, as it presents as clear a picture of living, and as powerful a message about family and sacrifice, as I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a book that somehow over the years I had missed reading. It was fascinating! Mrs. Smith gave a wonderful account of life in an era of America that many of us know little about. Having grown up with stories from my parents and grandparents about life during the depression, and before, in rural America, I enjoyed contrasting their tales with Frances's life and hardships of growing up in Brooklyn during the same time period.

Growing up to be a responsible adult even with the odds against you.Betty Smith was a powerful writer with strong characters. I felt I was watching one of those old movies and took comfort in some how knowing that everybody was going to be ok in end. Well done Betty Smith"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I love this book. I don't know if I have ever read a book so fast. It took me a total of 3 days to complete it. I love the detail in which it is written and the relationships between the characters. I think it's a fine example of what it means to come of age, and shows how, as we get older we understand and look at things differently then we once had. I read some of the lower star reviews and I don't think it was slow moving or plotless. The plot is life, and sometimes life isn't gun slinging and damsels in distress. If you don't want to commit to the buy, check it out of the library and see for yourself."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is an excellent coming of age book.

What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.This is one that will always be on my shelf."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn.

Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling. The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living. She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food. She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on. She is happy in the way only a child can be.As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many. She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own. Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful. I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances. I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though. I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest. When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is by Betty Smith. Francie is growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. The book takes place from 1902 all the way through 1919. Betty Smith has a very detailed way of writing. She can take a little subject, like a rose and turn it into a two page story."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is so well written that you feel like you are living next door to the Nolans and sharing their life.You hope success finds this family, and smile when it does.I really enjoyed this wonderful classic, and will read it again someday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's been two or three years since I've read this book, but what's prompting me to write a review on it, is that I've just read Joy in the Morning by Betty Smith and I could remember all to well, how much I loved her first book, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.I remember first hearing about the book and thinking, \\"Well, this probably wont be interesting to me since it's not like the books I read,\\" but I was wrong...after reading the first twenty pages, I was hooked!! The same with Joy in the Morning, though I'll have to admit I like Joy in the Morning better.I recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read outside of their usual genres.I also recommend her book, Joy in the Morning!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book is a great book that u can pick any spot in it and just read away!!its a classic story line but it's soo interctly woven with great deatails that you thought only you noticeits the best boook ive evr read)( and ive read alot!)its worth to buy it...i hav 2 copies hard and paperbak!ive lived in bklyn for 8 yrs now and i never really look at bklyn the same again..it sounds corny but its truanyone can relate to Francie..she goes through everything you ever went through when growing up and even more...."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my new favorite books. It is an amazing body of work, by Betty Smith. It was her first novel and was written in 1943. It is the story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, learning the tough lessons in life under the most difficult of circumstances. It is about living life and learning the lessons that are thrown in your path. One of the aspects of this book is that the characters hold themselves responsible for the choices they make, good and bad, and rarely do those that love them throw their mistakes in their face. It is about facing life in the worst situations with dignity and pride and trying to improve your situation through hardwork, education, determination and an ability to continue on and not give in, no matter what may come. It is about a time when self reliability, hard work and family were highly valued, as opposed to an entitlement mentality, by those families like the Nolan's. This is a classic American tale that will be appreciated by discerning readers."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school, and thought it would be dull, despite its good reviews. As it turns out, it really interested me about New York during the time of World War I, and it was really hard for me to put it down. I reccomend it to any one of any age."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has a depth of themes and characterisation sufficient for composition of a thesis on the topic, cleverly hidden in the depiction of banal, every day happenings. In the relationships depicted, one gains a deep picture of every form of love, with no minimising of the joy, pain, sacrifice, or strength which each presents. Heroine Francie is an intriguing character - both a dreamer, who always is looking for the happy ending, and a creature of habit in the midst of an otherwise individualistic family. She is a curious lonely child who realises, always after the fact, that her isolation was entirely her own doing. One can practically feel Francie's conflicts, for example in that, where she knows she should think her mother is noble and her father &quot;no good,&quot; she so favours Papa (and the reader can certainly see why.) I shall admit that one prominent theme kept me wondering - and this perhaps was the author's intention. There is much excessive patriotism in this book, as if everything is best just by being American (particularly if one was born in the States rather than an immigrant.) Francie's mother, Katie, is the sort of &quot;noble&quot; poor woman who would be acceptable to those believing in the American dream - totally hard-working, and ultimately rewarded by a marriage to a wealthy politician. Yet it is all too clear that Katie, the tolerable poor lady who insists she'll kill herself and her children before she'll take a basket from the Catholic Charities, is often the very source of her children's sufferings. Her pride has a very dark side which her dedication to hard work does not lessen - she would let her children starve, or leave a pleasant home for a dismal one, entirely because she needs to be superior, not equal to, those of her own class and background. Without giving away the ending to new readers, I must add that it has its paradoxical elements. The supposedly immense good fortune of the conclusion concurrently makes it clear that these people will be isolated from people and places which they had loved and enjoyed. In fact, the single poor point in the book's development is the trite rags to riches theme. These are only a few of many examples of the sort of gritty realism, countered by warmth and humour, which make this book so fascinating. It is easy and engaging reading on one level, but enormousely insightful and complex. There is no stock &quot;good and evil&quot; or &quot;right and wrong,&quot; nor are situations resolved in any fashion neater than that of &quot;true life.&quot; It is true that there is no actual plot, but I believe that this is key. Betty Smith is giving us much truth about life and love, which never fits into a clean story line. Even the minor characters provide strong depictions of the beauty, weakness, and complexity of human nature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's a slow read for me so far. I'm not finished reading it yet. But I'm curious to know what the hoopla is all about"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I didn't want this book to end!

It was sealed so it had to be originally packaged with that DVD missing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My aunt bought me this book a long time ago. Apparently it was one of her favorites growing up. I do not usually enjoy this type of book so I have put off reading it for at least 10 years. It was very hard to get through as I don't enjoy books with incessant descriptions. I thought the book was very dry until at least half way in. I was determined to finish it and it did get better although I am not sure I was satisfied with the ending. On the other hand, the book has a lot of historical significance and does an excellent job describing immigrant's lives in this period of time"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I doubt that I'd have ever read this book were it not for my Kindle.

It goes on and on about what is happening in Francie Nolan's life, and the whole time I think \\"What does this have to do with anything? I really don't care that Francie saw old men when she was buying bread. Does this have to do with some sort of ending that might happen after 550 pages of boring writing?\\" I appreciate and respect that this book is a classic, and it isn't really written in the style as most books are now - a - days, but I just didn't like it AT ALL."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it, and when I first picked it up I had trouble putting it down. I was fourteen when I first read it, so I would recomend it to people in that age group. However, there isn't much deeper meaning to the book. If you're looking for a fun, easy, dramtic book, this is perfect."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn By Betty SmithBetty Smith isn't well known for her many works, but the one book that almost everyone has heard about, is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this novel she shows herself to be an author of great depth and knowledge; she gives us a peek into the complex human soul. All her words come straight from the heart to make a story that engulfs all who read it. This book gives great insight into life; it shows why many people strive to become someone better and how some people are able to move up to a better station in life even though there are tremendous odds and forces working against them. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn touches everyone's' hearts. It is about a little girl, Mary Frances Nolan (also known as Francie), growing up in the poorer part of Brooklyn with a drunken, singing waiter for a father. This father somehow always makes her feel so special and \\"normal\\". She lives with her a severely realistic mother, father, and a brother who is favorite child. She is treated poorly throughout school because she is so different and independent. Even at birth she was thought of as \\"different\\" just because she was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world. Francie always kept to herself and was the silent studious type, which deepened the division between herself and the other of the children. In fast Francie entertained herself with books from the local library; she promised herself, that one day she would read all the books in the library. Her brother's birth, not one year after hers, deepens the division even more. She feels even more disconnected from the rest of the world at Neeley's (her brother) birth, fore he is the favored son and gets all the attention that Francie lacked. At a very young age Francie learned how important money is as well as the division in society caused by money as well as education. Because of this division and Neeley's favoritism, Francie becomes the sole provider for the family after the her father's death. She goes to work straight after graduation from grade school and never gets to have the pleasure and luxury of a high school diploma, but that doesn't stop her from her dreams. Her dreams of moving up in the world, to a place were you don't have to worry about where your next meal comes from; a place where money doesn't necessarily make you rich. True, this sounds like a ridicules dream considering that today a high school diploma is mandatory for everyone. At this point in time; however, very few people, without wealth, were able to get a higher education or even be able to go to high school. Yet nothing can stop Francie from completing her dream. This wonderful book cuts right to the heart of life. It show the true American dream; the dream of higher education and a better and equal way of life for everyone. The novel tell this dream through one special girl who realizes that she can be and do better. If you don't read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will be denying yourself a rich experience of the true American dream. A dream that has made this country what it is today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 8th grade teacher. It is absolutly beautiful!

Author Betty Smith tells the stories of Francie, her brother Neely and the rest of the Nolans and their lives between 1912-1920. Betty using comfortable,descriptive writing,tells of the triumphs and sorrows Francie faces as she grows. She talks about the exciting events that happen in the lives of their family including the marriage of Francie's sister Katie and the reactions it caused. Betty often speaks of a special tree,&quot;The Tree of Heaven,&quot; as it is called in Brooklyn; Francie tells that it is beautiful and it &quot;reaches the sky.&quot; I really enjoyed the story and I would reccommend it to any sappy person who enjoys curling up to the fire with a good emotional novel."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images, the developing of the characters, Betty Smith is a master at her art. Francie and her family come alive in this book. I've read it over and over and I still love it.

This book has everything anyone would ever expect from a story. I look forward to passing it on to future generations."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A very somber yet at times cheerful look at life in Brooklyn. The story is told through the eyes of a young girl growing up in a very poor family. It tells of her life from grade school to adulthood. The family experiences many tragedies along the way to eventual happiness. I got this book because it was the most read book by GI's during WWII. I did not know what it was about. It has great characters, stories and a upbeat ending. I would recommend it to teenagers who want I look at life from a different perspective."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have read maybe over three or four thousand books in my lifetime (I am thirteen now) and still none of them surpass A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I have read every single one of Smith's books and this one grabs my heart each time I read it. I read this first in third grade, again in sixth and again in eighth. I love reading the intracate descriptions and the detailed aspect of poverty. I take nothing for granted now because this book has taught me that I CAN be worse off."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought the book took a little time to get going, but was certainly worth plugging along through the first 50 to 100 pages. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it, but there was one piece of the book (at the very end) that I thought was a bit contrived and not developed as well as the rest of the book. It almost seemed like the author had gotten tired of writing and was just trying to finish. It was a minor part of the end of the book and certainly didn't impact my overall impression."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful story that is one I have enjoyed reading over and over from the time I was 15 to now in my fifties.

Her other book, Maggie Now, is great also."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first picked up A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I had my doubts about it, since we had to read it for highschool, and we don't always read the best books for school. However, with every page that I read, I became more absorbed in it. It thoroughly described the hardships that Francie Nolan had to go through while living in the poorer parts of Brooklyn in the early 1900's. All the sad things that Francie had to put up with, all her fun times, and all her problems just touched me so much. It made me realize how lucky I am, how lucky we all are, to be living in such a time as this, with so much more fortune. It touched my heart as much as my grandparents' stories of the old country did, like Grandma Rommely, Francie's grandmother, had described (excepting that I did not come from Europe as they had). It was an amazing book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I had just turned 14. Before that time, I was not an overly emotional person - didn't cry at movies, etc. Let me tell you, if you wish to be involved in the characters you are reading about, to have a touching story stick with you through life or to just have a classic read that is very enjoyable, read this book. Since I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I have better learned to stay in touch with my compassionate, nurturing and sensitive side. I am 24 now and have been known to cry on subway rides because I am so involved in the novels I am reading. This book will surely do that to you."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes butwith greater sensitivity.Do not let this one pass you by."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was assigned reading for a book club that I'm in, and I am glad it was or I may have overlooked it. The reflections of the main character, Francie, create what for me is a whole other world; kind of a real-life science fiction. This is better than sci-fi or fantasy, though, because it is a glimpse of a real time &amp; place that existed nearly a century ago. Betty Smith writes from the heart about a place that, while holding no appearant beauty to outsiders, is glorious in the author's recollections. It also reminds readers of what the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really made of. The situations are wrought with love, and the characters are very real, multi-dimensional people. I would especially recommend this book to women of all ages."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When i began reading the novel A tree grows in Brooklyn i immediatly realted to the characters and felt their suffering and joys just as they did. From Johnny to Francie i began to love these characters and the story they were a part of. Betty Smith creates a world in this book in which the reader gets to feel what it was like to be poor and what it was like to not always have what you wanted and needed. This story also brought out so many emotions and was it truly became a heart-wrenching and tear-jerking moment for me whenever i sat down with this heavy hardcover in my lap. I didn't ever stop and think to be grateful for what i had but after reading this i see how it is to have to suffer and work and not have money and now i am much more apreciative for what i am so lucky to have been given. This Novel touched me and it really did cut straight to the heart of life be teaching me more than just a lesson. I absolutly loved this book and will treasure what it has given me passionatly for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a touching and realistic portrait of a young girl, living in the slums of New York at the turn-of-the-century.

I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is one of the best books ever read. I believe that Betty Smith wrote this story very much like her own life. She may not have lived in Brooklyn, but she did live during the same time period. I believe it paralleled her own life. What she wrote was fabulous. Her uses of words is wonderful. She's one of my favorite authors now, and that says a lot.This book is about the life of a tiny girl in Brooklyn. She grows up with her brother, mother, father, and a baby sister in the poor section of Brooklyn. She grows up very well. She refuses to do badly in anything. She has a spark for life, a zest for it. She works hard to get the things she wants, including going to a good school, elementary and college. I admire her perseverence."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not as eloquent as the other readers here who have so enthusiastically recommended this book, but let me tell you; the surprise at Francie's graduation made me cry like a baby.

Francie, the little girl to whom we can all identify...for in some way, no matter how small,parts of her live inside us all. I first read this on entering my teens on my Mother's recommendation and we have delighted in the joy of this rich classic ever since. I collect as many lovingly used editions as I can find.........although I wonder how anybody could ever part with a Betty Smith novel! I own a few old copies of Maggie Now, with which I have been tormenting myself for more than a decade......I am waiting for the right moment to indulge, for although I know I shall read it time and time again.........that first anticipation of turning page one in a Betty Smith book, holds such excitement! A Tree Grows In Brroklyn.......please don't miss out on this timelessly breathtaking classic!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Recently, AMC showed the movie based on this book. I had read the book many times when I was Francie's age, but had never seen the movie. Seeing the movie led me back to the book, which I had not read in twenty years.What a wonderful experience I had in meeting the Nolans all over again. There were parts of the book that had been tucked in my memory, i.e. the part where Francie decides to read all the books in the library in alphabetical order. Every time I go to the library, I have that same idea. I just had forgotten where I first got the idea. It was like a light bulb illuminating a dusty part of my brain.Katie Nolan has become an even more important part of the story to me now. I think this was helped by Dorothy McGuire's exquisite performance as practical Katie. Being a mother of two myself, I appreciate the way Smith captured the gradations of Katie's feeling towards each child and her inability to express them to the children themselves.Goota go; my copy of MAGGIE-NOW is calling to me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"it's a touching story of a girl named francie who live in a pauperous family .

This is a book that warrants more than one reading, it is a keeper, with a special place of it's own. The metaphor of the tree that kept surviving is highly appropriate and mirrors the life of the novel's heroine, Francie Nolan. This tree, not unlike Francie herself, has been subject to harsh conditions, but it continued to grow and bloom. Both the tree and Francie are able to rise above the adversity and thrive.The characters are lively and real. The main character, Francie, who is articulate and bright, desperately seeks affection from her mother. Katie Nolan, is a mother that can not recripricate that love to her daughter. Instead, Katie directs her energy and affection to her son. Neeley. Francie is drawn to her father, a local drunkard, who pays her much attention. The reader expereinces the pain of growing and reconciling her relationships with her family.Francie Nolan is a survivor.

They range from 4 to 5 stars with an ocassional bad review thrown into the mix (go figure) I cant offer much more than whats alreaddy been said. but what i will offer is from the perspective of a 27 year old guy...For starters, dont even kid yourself into thinking this is for women only,..its not...and you dont have to be a new age sensetive guy either to enjoy the full spectrum of emotions this book will put you through..at times i laffed out loud so hard i thought my belly would burst open...and at other times i would find myself crying and the tears would stream down my face so much that my eyes would sting and burn so that i would have to wait a few mintues to begin readding again..this book was a rollor coaster ride for me...it just so happened that i stumbled upon this book while my sister was cleaning out her closet...i figured,..i'de give it a read..and never imagined in a million years that it would have such an effect on me,..once i got through the first 50 or so pages,..i jus couldnt put it down...and when i was through...i was sad it was over..maybe johnny nolan reminded me of my own father...the not so educated but oh so handsome drunk...or maybe katie nolan, the hard work'n practical mother of francie and neely nolan, which reminded me of my own mother, all i can say is..if u get the chance...please do yourself a favor and take the oppertunity to read this book! men,esspecially...cause this is definetly NOT 4 WOMEN ONLY!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This widely praised novel by Betty Smith is heartfelt, but frankly boring. The main plot follows an Irish-Austrian-American girl as she grows up in a slum in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Subplots focus on her family members. There is a lot of nostalgic detail on life at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I imagine that this book would appeal to people who grew up at that time... but there are few such people alive. Other themes include the cruelty of people to one another, the rapaciousness of private enterprise, and female strength and resilience. This wasn't a bad book but there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest, and eventually it became a chore to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN came with such rave reviews that i just had to read it and see what i was missing. i cannot say that i find myself any more enriched by this story. it is the early 1900's in brooklyn, NY and francie and her family are forever struggling to make ends meet. it is interesting to see what things the family had to endure and i stuck with it only because i was curious to see how francie's life would unfold. but the story was extremely slow paced and not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Overall the book is a worthwhile read, especially if you are interested in beautifully presented American history. The main character, Francie, born at the beginning of the twentieth century, shares the story of her Brooklyn childhood in vivid and realistic detail. You can just tell, from reading this work, that the main character bore more than a hefty overlap with the author. The book is just too emotionally connected and detailed to be anything else. This is a book that is strongly, perhaps almost entirely, character driven -- and the sympathetic nature of the main character is what makes the book so endearing. I admit, I was sad when it ended. I would have kept on reading this fictional girl's life story -- probably to her death. I had a grandmother born less than ten years after Francie, and although I spent a lot of time with my grandmother over the 35 years I knew her, I feel I knew Francie better. To me, this speaks volumes about the author's gift.I did, however, have a few gripes. Allow me to list them.1) At times some of the characters or scenarios came across as cheesy. For instance, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) kept naming her new husbands John, regardless of their real names, it quickly got old, especially when the author reminded us of the renaming about ten times. Although this book detail may have been based on a real character, and probably was, to me it failed to translate well into the novel.2) There were some internal inconsistencies in the book, and that is a pet peeve of mine. For instance, on page 42 (first paragraph of chapter 5) the narrator tells about Sissy having given birth to ten children who all died shortly after birth. Then, on page 64-65 (a few pages into chapter 7), the narrator tells about Sissy's first child having been stillborn (as opposed to dying after birth), and the following three born dead as well. So which was it? Although you might consider me picky, a good editor wouldn't, and nor would a young mother who just lost her baby -- a stillbirth and a baby who lived an hour or two and then died are profoundly different things.3) Too much idealization of Francie's rotten parents. Yes, there was some criticism of them, but almost all of it, even from the author's perspective, was couched in a parent-protecting attitude. I personally felt enraged when Francie's mother put Francie to work and sent the younger brother to high school -- while she herself popped out another baby by her loser, alcoholic non-father of a husband, who, incidentally, had just died. I get tired of narrators or authors who side too much with awful parents.4) The author had a sort of proto-feminist attitude that too often (to tie it in with my last criticism) equated to siding with women who displayed awful or very disappointing behavior.And one final point, not exactly a criticism: I was surprised the book never mentioned that the hardy \\"tree of heaven,\\" upon which this book was based, and to which the main character was compared, actually has a horrible odor. If you crush one of its leaves in your hand you'll find this out quickly. The fact that this was never mentioned suggested to me that the author didn't know this tree as well as she might have let on. I used to love these trees for all the reasons the author did mention, until I actually smelled one. Hard to idealize them then.But all this said, overall still a powerful book -- brought to life an important time and place in such a special way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book provided an authentic look at life in turn of the century New York city, among the working poor immigrant class.

Wow!A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (P.S.)If you like to reminisce read it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an amazing novel, a kind of New York To Kill a Mockingbird. Beginning in 1912 but then flashing back to the early 1900s, it is the story of Francie Nolan, the daughter in a poor family. Her mother, Kate, is determined to get the best for her son, Neely, who is a year younger than Francie. Their father, Johnny, is handsome and funny and flamboyant, and also drinks way too much. And Francie loves to go the library. She's working her way through the books, from A to Z. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of the Rommely and the Nolan families' lives, centering on Francie. The title comes from a tree that grows in the yard.It's hard to pin-point what's so great about this novel. I read it 2 years ago, and loved it. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is less compelling than To Kill a Mockingbird, less deep, I guess you would say, but it's still a classic in its own right, and written much earlier. And it is pretty deep, whatever that actually means.Betty Smith brings to life the squalor and poverty of Brooklyn, New York, with her elegant prose. She creates wonderful, memorable characters and scenes. I loved reading about the various things that Francie and Neely did to earn a bit of candy money (though obviously, it was kind of sad), and reading about the various eccentricities of everyone in the neighborhood. You can certainly tell that Betty Smith was knowledgeable about Brooklyn; I'm pretty sure this book is based upon her own childhood at the turn of the century, and it shows. It feels realistic.I also loved the way that school was portrayed. A lot of the kids are awful to one another; even after they go through something, they tease other kids for having the same thing happen to them. The teachers ignore when the children need to use the bathroom, and bullying is rampant. And yet, there are moments of brightness: when the music teacher comes, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) intercedes for her. Francie actually really does like school.A thing I found interesting was that even though Manhattan isn't that far away, it seems so foreign to Francie, a whole other world that she can't even imagine.The characters were amazing. Katie, Johnny, Francie, Neely, Sissy...all of them and more felt realistic and were really fun to read about. Francie, particularly. She's an avid reader much like myself, \\"on that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\" I can identify with that, and I would highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a story that lingers in the minds of young adults worldwide. It is wrong, farfetched even, to say that this book is just about a girl and her life in New York City. This is a story about life at its limit and a girl that learns to grow up. Fragile threads of a seemingly dull existence and the tragedies of poor family are what holds the bindings of the book together. It is the rich past that makes it suddenly an adventure worth reading. The peace in it provides the finally perfect piece for the restless minds of people like me, who read this story. It teaches me that no matter how wrong the start, there is always a conclusion that fits incredibly well, despite the trail of sharp and cutting glass that a shattered mirror leaves behind. This is a journey spun beautifully by Betty Smith through her concise but stunning words, woven to life by her cunning twists of characters. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a journey of life, misfortunes, and maturity, will become a towering figure that roots deep into your conscious mind."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book had interesting insights into life in Brooklyn years ago.

The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is all about achieving the American dream through determination, imagination, and education. Life for the Nolans was very harsh in the sense that they didn't have much in the sense of money. The father, an alcoholic who at best brought occasional income was a charming lad who was very well loved by his family, up until the bitter end, when he died, leaving a posthumous child. The mother is a strong woman, steady, responsible, and caring. The heroine in this book, however, is Francie Nolan, who loves to write. In the end, she doesn't become a published writer, but she did keep her stories real, describing how life in poverty really is, and stands for herself when an ignorant teacher tells her that her writings are sad and ugly."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Loved this book the characters are like an extented family. Betty Smith writes so simply without the unnecessary violence and language in so many books now written. will be looking for more of her work."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story was made even more real when I visited the East Tenement Museum in Manhattan. To go through the rooms, to see how closely people lived, to have a picture in my mind where the baby slept so she could have fresh air......all the descriptions in the book came alive. What a wonderful story of the human spirit, the strength of character and the tenacity and grit to persevere through extremely physical and emotional times. How would we measure up today? Worth a discussion!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Hi Jayne,I recently reread \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" and as I closed the back flap of the well worn cover, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. This book is at the top of my Book List of Favorites and is perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.I don't want to spoil even one page of this miraculous novel for the new reader, so I won't divulge any particulars. (I find the less I know about a book, the more charming and surprising it's potential is.) I will say it is a young adult novel about a girl and her family in the poorest of New York neighborhoods around the turn of the 20th century. Mrs. Smith parlays feelings of innocence, yearning, grief, love, loss, hope, beauty, joy, childhood, family dynamics and how it feels to live in poverty so deftly, one can never forget this book.In our current \\"recession culture\\" this book is more timely than ever. Families are being ripped apart and children are growing up faster than before due to economic strains. While this book is set almost one hundred years ago, and some of the situations seem slightly archaic, the feelings are all still the same. The ability to protect a child and provide them with a happy and safe childhood is every parent's aspiration and the inability to do so is devastating. But as with any good book, it shows the the dark and light sides of any situation. Simply put, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.Read this book as soon as you can. It is the bitterest of sweet and sends the message that hope, as symbolized in the tree, sprouts eternal."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book...I bought this in Oregon at Powell's Books a few years ago on sale and I thought the writing was fantastic as well as the reader (Kate Burton). She was able to do so many accents for various characters and they sounded so good! This is how much I was a fan...when I first bought it, CD #11 didn't work...there are only 12 CDs so I was so frustrated. I really wanted to finish this with the reader I had started with! I call Powell's and they sent me a new set...and of course CD 11 didn't work. I ordered it off Amazon, and CD 11 didn't work. Finally, I called the publisher and begged and pleaded not just for a replacement but for someone to ensure that CD 11 worked before it came. They sent it for free and FINALLY FINALLY CD 11 worked and it was worth it. So yes, now I have 4 copies of this audio book which is a bit crazy, but hey, it was a great book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"How have I never read this book before? Why didn't my high school force me to read it, as they did other novels that so impacted my life, like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or The Great Gatsby? I wish that someone had made me read this book long ago, but I'm also excited to have discovered the beauty of Smith's book on my own, as an adult, when I could appreciate it for its own merits and not because I was supposed to.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my \`to read' list for the last year or so, and I have to admit I was kind of dreading reading it. Sometimes \\"classics\\" do that to me. I finally picked it up on audio, considering that to be a compromise - I could listen to it in my car driving to and from work without devoting my full reading time and attention to the novel.From the very first words that narrator Barbara Rosenblat spoke, I was completely hooked. Smith's story follows the life of Francie Nolan, a little girl growing up in Brooklyn during the early part of the 20th century. Though mainly a coming-of-age novel, the book winds its way throughout decades backwards and forwards, and into the lives of Francie's parents and extended family.Although Francie grew up poor in Brooklyn, concerned with the entry of the U.S. into the first World War, her father's alcoholism and where her next meal would come from, she is a character that can still be related to today. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic, and would whole-heartedly recommend the audio version."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was one of my best reads of the year.

I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Oh my what a trip into the past this was. I read this book several times as a child. In fact, I was about Francie's age when I first read it. My only memory was of a girl in a window and a tree. For some reason that image stayed with me more than the story.I can't say that the story came back to me as I read, it did not. This was good, in that it was like reading and discovering it all over again. No wonder I read it time after time. In so many ways my own life mirrored Francie's.Even to the picking up of trash ( bottles) along the roads ( alleys) and turning them in for money for treats.We, too were less than wealthy, but such is life. Better times came for us. As for Francie? Life is what you make it, don't you think? And Francie was a strong young girl, who grew into a strong and intelligent young woman. She came form a family of strong women, who knew how to keep family together and how to do whatever needed to be done. The poor can't afford much, and being squeamish is one of those things.I'd like to lift a glass to the Francie the woman, and the women around her who taught her how to be the best she could be. We can overcome a lot if we put our minds to it. This story was dated in some ways, but oh so current in others. After all these years there are still children who don't know where their next meal will come from, men who just don't have it in them to stand strong and do what is needed and women who make up the difference and stand with their shoulders against the door to keep out the wolf called hunger and keep in the warm called love.highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have wanted to read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" for some time and I finally did so. This is a heartwarming story about a little 11 year old girl called Francie and her truly wonderful family. The book covers about 4 years (from age 11- 16) with quite a few flashbacks to Francie's earlier life. It is set in Brooklyn in the early 1900's (about 1915-1918) and the story is about living in Brooklyn at this time of the 20 century. Francie lives with her mother and father and her one year younger brother in a poor tenement in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn. The family is poor but they do manage to eke out a living for themselves with lots of hard work and sacrifice. Francie is an imaginative 11 year old who finds beauty in the simplest things. She loves her family while at the same time being quite aware of their failings. But these failings only make her and her family stronger and the bond between them tighter. Francie loves to read and to learn and she gains a maturity far beyond her years because of her insatiable quest for knowledge, her effective observation skills, and because of the hard life she lives. When I looked at Ms. Smith's bio it appears that she herself lived in Brooklyn as a young girl at the time of the setting of this book. I am sure that she has put a lot of herself into the story, and her love of Brooklyn comes through on every page. And she obviously loved her characters as her writing makes them appear to live and breathe on the pages. It is easy to see why this book is considered an American classic. The writing and the characterizations are very well done indeed. It is a wonderful story about a precocious little girl as she grows up in a big American city at the beginning of the 20 century. I will miss Francie and her brother Nealey very much now that I've finished the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Ive always loved this book, so now I love having it conveniently on my iPad so I can take it anywhere with me"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I grew up loving this movie and was worried the book would deminish my fond memories of the movie.

It is no wonder that this book is still so read, it is still real and insightful into family interactions and personal observations by the all of charactersI recommend it highly"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a darn charming book with characters who are likable without being too swarmy, and I love the way they are presented, and the way the story is told. It's a long book, but you want the children to grow and mature, and I think Smith handled this part so well, so almost forgotten is Francie Nolen being eleven years old. At the beginning, Francie hauls junk, letting her brother split the money because he is a boy. They are poor. They live in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Their mother, Katie, works as a cleaning lady. Johnny was her best friend's boyfriend, and Katie coveted him, and they fell in love. Katie's brutish father was angry, feeling cheated that his daughter could not provide for him, and Johnny's mother was angry at Katie. They married, cleaned a school, then lost the job because Katie gave birth to Francie and a year later, there was Cornelius - Neeley. Katie loves her son more, and is afraid of how much she loves her son. Katie works as a cleaning person, hoodwinking piano lessons from the sisters downstairs - bringing the children so its three lessons for the price of one, and she is confronted, but Miss Tynmore likes her because Katie provides her good tea, whereas the piano teacher was only served watery junk from other customers. Katie is hardworking, smart, kind, and she loves her children - instructing them how to buy the meat, to have the butcher chop a fresh cut and then w/ an onion to prevent dilution of the meat, who to buy bread from and such. Johnny is a singing waiter, working less consistently, and the rule is that Johnny must bring home his salary, but he can keep his tips. Johnny is blond and handsome with a beautiful voice, but he is a drunkard, spending his time at a bar. He is kind, loving his daughter, calling her Prima Donna, never violent, more fun when drunk. His mother is sour, he is amongst four sons, and all the sons die before thirty-five. Johnny loves Katie. Katie has two sisters - older sister Sissy is good-hearted, loves children, has boyfriends, but cannot have children - she has more than ten stillborn children, and she blames husbands who love her, and she has a fondness for the name John. Later, she falls in love w/ her John, whose real name is Steve, and a baby boy is born. Younger sister is Evie, who marries a milk delivery man, William Flittman, who has an acrimonious relationship w/ his horse, who loves Evie, and eventually William goes away. There are more adventures, but the charm is not just with the adventures, but with the patient detailed writing. It was heart-warming to read this book. I loved everything about this book except the last twenty pages or so, when Francie becomes an adult and has that terrible misunderstanding with a boy. It was confusing to the reader, and I don't know quite what happened. The writing is so pure, almost every page is credible, and I could see all the events happening to a real family. This book has been accused of having no plot, but I think this is a book of adventures with many plots. It was so beautiful and extremely easy to read. No guilt in revealing some of the adventures, because the beauty is in the characters and the writing. A very, very charming read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was written many years ago and still pulls you in to keep reading--very heartwarming and thought provoking.

Great Book-5 stars."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book popped up on some kind of must-read list recently, which I thought was a little odd. All I knew about this book was there was a movie version, which I vaguely remembered seeing part of on TV as a child. I got the book from the library and was immediately entranced. This story of a bright, sensitive child growing up poor in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is also a story about family, the strength of women and the value of love, hard work and education.This book is so honest about the weaknesses and flaws of its characters as well as their good points. In addition to the story, which draws you along to see what happens next, you learn what it was like to grow up in this hardscrabble environment and in this time. But it's not like a boring history lesson, but a fascinating feeling of being \\"in it\\" and exactly what it was like to live on pennies a day. I was worried it would be sentimental, but it's just the opposite.From reading the material that came with my copy, apparently this book started out as autobiography and the author was persuaded to fictionalize it. Perhaps this is why it is so heartfelt. It was also marketed as for adults, but it could be read by 14 and up in my opinion (there is some adult subject matter, but it's only dealt with on the level of a child's understanding.)This is one of those books where you're gulping it down while at the same time wishing it would never end. There are so many parts I related to as a wife, mother and daughter--it's timeless, while being very \\"of a time.\\"Perhaps the best compliment I can give is that this book made as huge an impact on me as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books.

Picante is handed the book by a fellow soldier who is asked, is it full of blood and guts and gets the answer, it's not that kind of book. Rather it is about a smart young girl growing up in a tough tenement neighbourhood of Brooklyn who at one point assumes a fake home address so she can get into a better school. Reputed to be autobiographical the book is told matter-of-factually without pathos or appeals for sympathy. If it isn't on every high school reading list already it should be."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a great book. I must admit that some parts of the book, some of the chain of events seemed unrealistic and this frustrated me a little bit but it did not keep me from wanting to read more. I was ready to give the three and a half stars until I reached the end, where I was hit with sorrow that the book was coming to an end and the characters had grown on me. The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family. I was very sad to say goodbye to the characters in the book and goodbye to life in early 1900s Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Every year I think about rereading books I loved when I was younger. Every year or two I'll reread \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or I'll take another read of \\"Camille\\". It's like getting back together with a old friend and I always feel better after.Now these two books I've read rather consistently since I first fell in love with them but others I loved in High School and earlier I haven't read in years and in some cases decades. An example of that is \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". I don't think I've read it in 20 years or more. This month my book club decided to \\"A Tree\\" and I realized I haven't read it forever. But I began to get nervous that I wouldn't love it the way I did when I first read it.Well, I didn't have to worry. It was everything I remembered it being. Francie Nolan and her family live in turn of the century Brooklyn. Poverty and cruelty is everywhere yet the Nolan family they're family and neighbors work hard to simply live, an accomplishment in itself. Francie's father Johnny is a lovable entertaining man who drinks to much and finds it hard to grow up and take care of his family the way he should. The job of providing for the family falls to Katie Nolan, Francie's mother. Katie works hard to earn money and take care of her family and also pushes each of her children to get an education, knowing it's the only way they will ever escape life in the tenements of Brooklyn.A vivid picture of a time and place that doesn't exist anymore \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is, at heart, the story of how one little girl, with the help of those who love her, survives with hope and a remarkable resilience that makes you root for her to become everything she hopes to be.I loved this book so much. The old chestnut of \\"I Laughed, I cried\\" really does fit this book. I think one of the things that struck me most is how fast children had to grow up in those conditions. We talk today about how fast our kids grow up but it seems nothing in comparison to that way children had to fight to survive in this time period. Children went to work to support their family and while I'm sure it still exists I wonder if it is prevalent. Just with the child labor laws it must be different.The hope that flows through this story is what really touched me. I truly believe Francie would be one who made it out but unlike others shown in the story who made it out and turned their backs on their life in Brooklyn you're left knowing Francie would never forget or hate her past life. Thanks to the love and support of all her family Francie would never really leave Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was quite good. This book was only on my reading list since my senior year in high school. I am a freshman in college and have finally read this lovely peice of literature. Betty Smith portrays a beautiful life of Francie Nolan and her growing up in Brooklyn. Her family-Johnny and Katie (her parental units), Laurie and Neely (her sister and brother), Sissy and Eva (her aunts) all help build the pages of this book with a since of character and wit. The simplicity in this book is fantastic. I'm not very good at summarizing but basically it is about Francie and her family through out a period of over a decade in New York. Francie's family is poor, yet they are one of the purest families out there. I especially loved &quot;Book One&quot;, this section made me feel like a kid again. I loved Betty Smith's descriptions of the weekends, and collecting &quot;junk&quot; and the pictures of the candy stores and library in my mind.

I saw myself in her and my father in her father. It was touching and very interesting- I picked it up and was immediately sucked in. I finished it in two days! In conclusion, one cannot possibly live their life without reading this amazingly profound classic. It has influenced my life and opened my eyes.

She lives through many trials of being hard up on money, but family ties and events keep the apple of life as sweet as ever. Even sweeter, for though every meal is an adventure, she has a wonderful education and class, which as her mother believes is the difference between two types of richness, money and love from people and richness of knowledge. As she grows up, she sees the rest of the world, and her life is compared to a tree in Brooklyn, which always forces itself to grow, as she pushes her way out of poverty, getting a good job, and struggling to rise above her parents and go on for greater things. It is a very compassionate story, moves quickly, and though life is viewed from the point of a young girl growing into an elegant woman, it is meant for all ages. It gives the reader a power of hope. Aye, it has the same underlying generalized moral, but in such sweet and unique words, its like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter day. This is an awesome book, which you should read at least once in any point of your life, for it touches on all aspects of life. Cheers!! : )"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel that I read when I was a young girl and one that I've reread several times since then. I love Francie Nolan's story and the descriptions of Brooklyn, NY in bygone years. I love the character because she's growing up practically without any guidance. And I enjoy her guts and her determination to become a writer. The affection she feels for her father is touching and something that many people even today can relate to. All in all, a great book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic in every sense of the word. Betty Smith has brought us a compelling story of the Nolan Family who lives in Williamsburg Brooklyn, in the early 1900's. I really enjoyed reading this book and the story and its characters will live on in my mind for years to come.Francie Nolan is the main character of this book and we follow her and her family thoughout all the hardships that befall them. Money is not very plentiful in the Nolan household but yet somehow this family knows how to take a loaf of stale bread and turn it into a feast. We learn how Francie makes it through her teenage years and her story is of hope and survival.I truly enjoyed reading this book, it was well written with a lot of great characters especially Francie, Aunt Sissy and Katie. This is the type of book I could read again and its one that I plan to hold on to for a very long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is a young girl that lives in Brooklyn at the turn of the century. Her Irish father, Johnny, is an aspiring singer and waits tables while dreaming of a better life. Her mother, Katie, finds herself supporting the family more than Johnny, as he is an alcoholic. Francie is an admirable girl living in poverty and wants a good education; she has a true love for learning. Francie and her family live a hard life, but just like the tree that grows in her neighborhood despite a lack of soil, sun, and water, her family will find a way to survive. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith really captures the American Dream at the turn of the century. Fans of coming of tales must read this literary gem.Francie is one of my favorite literary protagonists. What is not to love? Despite growing up in a rough neighborhood, she loves books, libraries, and wants better for herself. Her mother is also strong as she has been dealt a tough hand in life. She could easily give up, but is an honorable character and a role model for her family. On the other hand, Johnny, although a sweet romantic, is unpractical and brings his family down. It was hard to watch his slow spiral into alcoholism and its impact on the Nolans.Smith is a brilliant writer. Her use of flashback takes us back to when Katie and Johnny first met, which was one of my favorite parts of the novel. Also, there were parts of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn that stopped me in my tracks and there were lines that were simply beautiful. Here are two of my favorite lines:\\"People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,\\" thought Francie, \\"something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains - a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone - just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\"\\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn's theme is a powerful one and will always be one of my favorite classics. It teaches us so much about perseverance, love, family, survival, and the American Dream. I display this classic proudly in my classroom library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is a historical fiction book set in ... Brooklyn. The book was published in 1943 and became an instant best seller despite criticism on its content.Young teen Francie Nolan's family has many struggles. This Irish-American family faces poverty, alcoholism and the brutal realties of life in turn of the century New York City.\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith is considered an American classic and an essential part of American literature. The book describes life in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn and is a testament for the hope kindled in immigrants who came to the United States.Not surprisingly, this well written book emphasizes the value of good educations, good teachers, community and family.\\"Before they went to bed, Francie and Neeley had to read a page of the Bible and a page from Shakespeare. That was a rule. Mama used to read the two pages to them each night until they were old enough to read for themselves. To save time, Neeley read the Bible page and Francie read from Shakespeare.\\"To be honest, I ignored this book for a long time. I had several chances to read it but chose something more \\"manly\\" each and every time. Finally the \\"classic book club\\" I belong to has chosen this book and I decided that this is it.I'm going to read it.The reason I always passed on \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is because it has always been billed as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\". That tag line didn't sound to enticing to me.Once I did read it I discovered that all the taglines and advertising did injustice to the book. This is not as \\"a book every girl/woman should read\\" but a book that everyone should read. While the story is also about the coming of age of young Francie Nolan, it is also a touching testament to the early immigrant spirit and the hardships of life which were rarely written about first hand.\\"'This could be a whole life,' she thought. 'You work eight hours a day covering wires to earn money to buy food and to pay for a place to sleep that you can keep living to come back to cover more wires. Some people are born and kept living just to come to this.\\"Even though this book was not written as historical fiction, I believe that it squarely falls in that category in 2011. The story is a powerful look at the time using relateable characters (even for guys). The book reminds us how lucky we are to live in this time, where the daily dilemma is should you download the new song from iTunes instead of not knowing where you're going to get those ten cents to feed your family for the day."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"They call it \\"a green umbrella\\", they call it \\"the tree that lived,\\", they call it \\"Annie,\\" this tree is no ordinary tree, it's a pet, it lived, through all the chopping down, and through all the fires, this tree lived.

Betty Smith explains poverty of the 1910's in Brooklyn, in her book \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\". She describes the protagonist (Francie Nolan) as caring, loving, and creative. Betty explains Francie's life from her childhood days to her 15th birthday. Ever scince she was a child, Francie has loved to read. From her first glance at \\"If I Were King,\\" to her job at the Press Clipping office, Francie has demonstrated her creativity and love for reading and writing. \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is split into 5 books. Book One, explains the childhood life of Francie and Neely Nolan. It explains how Francie loves the library. Book Two explains how Katie Rommely and Johnny Nolan (parents of Francie and Neeley) first met. Book Three is the longest and explains Francie's school life. She changes schools in the middle. In this book her mother saves her from a murderer. Book Four and Book Five go on to explain Francie's life from ages 13-15 and how she gets a job. It's a very good book.

The book is divided into five parts. In part one, the reader meets eleven-year-old Francie and her little brother Neeley. Francie and Neeley live with their parents, Johnny and Katie in the tenements of Williamsburg. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic and Katie works as a house cleaner. Living in utter poverty, Francie and Neeley earn pennies selling scrap metal with other children of the tenements. Part two tells the story of Johnny and Katie's meeting and falling in love as first generation immigrants. Part three describes the Nolan children as they begin school, as well as the death of Francie's father from pneumonia. The rest of the book chronicles Francie's coming-of-age as she and Neely grow up and get jobs to support their family. As Francie's life appears to have more on the horizon than that of her mother, she can't help but remember the small apartment in Brooklyn where she grew up.Though written almost seventy years ago about a time long since past, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn remains one of the most celebrated and classic coming-of-age tales .The character of Francie Nolan is one many teen girls can identify with: she struggles to find out who she is while coping with her father's alcoholism, her family's poverty, and her unfortunate surroundings. Addicted to reading and education, Francie's unending struggle to better her life has and will continue to inspire many. Betty Smith paints a rich portrait of the characters in the novel, and as they grow, the reader feels connected with their lives. The book is also an excellent look at life in the early 20th century. Smith's attention to detail is perfect for creating a realistic backdrop for her story. In a way, Brooklyn itself is another character in the novel. Francie's ability to overcome adversity, essentially becoming the \\"tree\\" that grew out of Brooklyn, is what keeps generation after generation interested in reading this wonderful, heartwarming novel.I have read this novel twice, once when I was about 14, the second time as an adult. Both times I thought it was wonderful. It is truly a classic piece of American literature, but I have met quite a few people who've never read/heard of it. It's definitely a must-read for people who enjoy historical fiction or period novels, but can be enjoyed by all audiences.Like my review?

I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12. Oh, and I was born in Brooklyn too!St. James Place"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie Nolan is an 11-16 year-old girl growing up in 1910 Brooklyn, part of a seriously poor immigrant family. Her story is valuable to teens, young adults, prime timers and retirees. Her story is an inspiration to upwardly mobile individuals and a tonic for those who assume that the poor are lazy, unskilled, bad, incompetent or different. The story is timeless.Francie loves her alcoholic father and appreciates her hard-working mother. Her life is shaped by a handfull of rules from her grandmother, most importantly those about thrift and education. Her life is also shaped by her extended family, her neighbors and her city. She is a good person who shares her innermost thoughts with the reader. Francie is one of the most attractive characters in American literature. She is not perfect; she's simplistic, naive, overly individualistic and overly focused. But, she's a keen observer of life.This book is rated a top 10 American novel on Amazon because it is approachable to all. It reflects American values. The description of life is authentic. The characters are familiar, but not mere caricatures. Francie is driven to succeed, but not at all costs. She learns and grows. The \\"cattiness\\" of life at all socio-economic levels is well-described. Francie rises above it. Random events and tragedy are fully included in the broadly positive tale. In spite of economic pressures, war, cultural norms, institutions, and human nature Francie ultimately succeeds in her primary quest for higher education. Her family succeeds economically. But, this is not utopia. Success comes with a cost. It does not provide permanent security. In the author's tale, grace comes to some, but not to all.The possibility of individual progress, in spite of ..., is elevated by this novel in a believable manner. If Francie Nolan can overcome the odds, we should all be fully engaged in the game of life, pursuing our dreams.The CD version is exceptionally well performed."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I did enjoy this book, but at some parts I felt the author could have done without. Some places have too many details and over explain; I got it the first time....the book is about a family, focusing on Francie as she grows up in Brooklyn, beginning in 1912. pre WWI. It's about loss of innocence in many ways, the harsh cruelty of life and the sacrifices that must be made, and the downfall of Francie's mind after a tragedy, dealing with her emotions, not being favoured by her mother and finding herself through the experiences of her life, her job and war. Francie triumphs in the end,and how she gets there is incredible and will leave you feeling like you've a diary of someone who had it harder than you and you will feel better and more confident about yourself and finding the strength to accomplish your goals no matter the hardships that come your way."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn captures the life of the Nolan family, who live in the slums of Brooklyn, not by choice, but because they are poor. The book follows them from the opening of the 20th century through the 1920s. The central character here is Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny, opening when she is 11, and follows her through her teenage years.The book is a coming-of-age novel, but at the same time, it's a look at many issues prevalent at the time which one could argue are still prevalent now. For example, beyond the immediate effects of poverty on Francie's family's life, the author has also reflected on how people both on the inside and outside of the Nolan's community viewed poverty. There is a great scene where Francie and her brother went to a \\"celebration for the poor of all faiths\\" (211) -- where the kids received little gifts, watched a play, etc., and then there was a give away of a doll. The woman gives a speech about the child giving away the doll, saying that \\"Little Mary is a very rich little girl,\\" who had received a lot of dolls for Christmas, and wanted to give the doll to \\"some poor little Mary.\\" All of the \\"poor\\" little girls refused to own up to being named Mary, because no one wanted to be a \\"symbol of all the poor little girls in the audience\\" (212). There's also a part where Francie, who wants to become a writer and is good at it, turns in compositions about \\"poverty, starvation and drunkenness\\" which her teacher tells her are \\"ugly subjects to choose..\\" and while Francie argues that they are true, the teacher says something along the lines of well, sure, but these are not subjects to be written about. (321).Smith also writes about the perception among many of the poor that education would lift their children out of the slums and give them a chance to have a better life than the previous generation, but at the age where they can go on to high school, many families were so poor that the kids had to get working papers to help support the family, sounding the death knell of many parents' dreams to get their children out of the slums and into a better situation, further perpetuating the cycle. I could go on. Gender, geography, the role of women, these are all important themes, but I can't write forever here.What this book is really about is hope and perseverance. At the end of my edition is a little bio of the author, and in it, the author's daughter notes \\"She often said about 'Tree' that she didn't write it the way it was, but the way it should have been.\\" I think the reason this book resonates with so many people is reflected in that statement. Would we have liked it as much if she had written A Tree Grows in Brooklyn \\"the way it was?\\" Contrast this book with Ann Petry's The Street, where it was definitely written the way it was and see which you like better.I vaguely remember reading this book as a teen, but I think my recommendation would be to older readers who are a bit more life savvy. There's a lot in this book to contemplate."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is not much more to add here about this amazing coming-of-age novel, except to say that the reader of the audio version, Kate Burton, made the book come alive by being spot-on with several different accents found in the melting pot of early twentieth-century Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I absolutely love this book!

I already can't wait to re-read it!And though its setting takes place around WWI, and the city is New York City, the book really reminds me of my own grandparents (contemporaries of the author, not her characters) in many ways.

Happily, most of them I had read as required reading back in school. I felt so proud, until I read the subscript that said, &quot;Unless you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, you haven't even skimmed the surface of great American literature&quot;. Truly, the only thought this book provoked in me was the memory of Bugs Bunny distracting a mad dog with it to make his getaway, in an old post war cartoon. How could I be missing out on the &quot;greatest american novel of all times&quot; if Mel Blank was using it as a dog pee-pee joke? I decided to put aside my Oprah list for a month, and &quot;suffer&quot; through the novel, stick with it no matter what. I wanted to &quot;grow&quot;.How surprised I was to become wrapped up in this book so completely, that I actually saw my husband peeking at it. What could be keeping me so quiet and occupied? Being the grandaughter of Immigrant Brooklyn-Americans, I was surprised no one in my family ever talked about the parallels between the Nolans and our very own family.

It is responsible for most of the viciousness, violence, terror, and heart and soul breaking of the world.&quot; -page 226 in the 1998 Perennial Classics (excerpt from 13 year old Francie Nolan's diary)This quote is what I believe to be the most powerful. It wrenched me to it from the moment I read it, and made this book worthwhile to me. It was a wonderful book, but I might have read it much faster if I did not keep turning back to that page to read that quote over and over. It stuck in my heart, and will stay there forever. It made the novel for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first read 'Tree',I must have been around 10. I read it over and over. The subject matter hits too close to home for me, having grown up in the 70's, but under startlingly similar conditions for their time. My mother, brother and I were alone, yet we utilised our time and resources just Like Francie and Neely. As one who has gone through poverty can tell you, that is much the way it is for many, many people in the USA. Reading this book will remind those people of the small things, the things that matter. This family was like many, in Brooklyn and all over the world, with its harshness, ugliness and hope. There will always be poverty, but for those, like Francie and Neely who have finally found their way out, it makes the past all that much more bittersweet. I recommend this book for those kids who have never gone without, who have their lives handed to them, and for whom the computer does all their work. Read this: you will be humbled. I promise you will appreciate what you have."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I picked up this book at the library at school. I had no idea who Betty Smith was or that the book was going to be any good. I cannot ever remember ever understanding a book as I did this one. The writing was so clear, I got the feeling and the meaning deep in my heart. I devoured it page by page feeling Francines every sorrow and joy. I think Betty Smith deserves a pat on the back and a thank you for this amazing piece of writing she has contributited to us."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read about the Nolans when I was in the 7th grade for a class assignment and I have read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; countless times since. Although I am an avid reader of the classics- I always stray back to my ratty old copy of &quot;A Tree Grows...&quot; - the same copy that I have now had in my possesion for the past 18 years. I still get a tear in my eye when I think about Francie and all she endured- perhaps because I can relate to her life in so many ways. Like Mary Nolan did for her children- I hope to do for my own. As Mary Nolan had Neeley and Francie read a page from The Bible, and a page from Shakespeare every night before going to bed- my children will hopefully do the same- however they will also read a page from &quot; A Tree Grows From Brooklyn&quot;. I only hope that they too will learn as much from the Nolans as I have over the years..."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I thought this book was amazing. It was one of my most favorite books. I felt like Francie became a distant friend. I felt her hardship, and I felt sad for her, too. She was a poor girl living in Brooklyn in an extremely hard time. I was astounded when Betty Smith said that Katie, her mother, liked Neeley, her brother, more than her. Thank god I had never had that happen to me, but it really hurt me when that was said in the book. I felt terrible when Francie's father died, he was her only support, she could always fall back down on him, and then boom, he died. So sad. She was so helpless, yet so strong. She was a wilted flower that still had the potential to live. Betty Smith gave Francie a very realistic role in the book, as she did all the other characters. She built them up beautifully, so you felt you really knew them, atleast I did. The story was like a jigsaw puzzle that wasn't missing any pieces."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I first had to read this book my sophomore year in high school I frowned on it simply because it sounded like a extremely boring book set in a boring time. As I started to read it I could kind of feel for Francie and I never could put that book down. To this day whenever I'm bored I will pull that book of my shelf and start reading it all over again."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of the few books that have made me cry. When a book makes me cry, it means that I have felt,throughout the book that I was in the book. Not as Francie, but as Francie's best friend who lives a better life than her. I still get sad when I think about it"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"&quot;There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the tree of heaven. No matter where its seed falls it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of the cement. It grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly without earth. It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.&quot;This paragraph, which appears right before the book starts is the definition of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It is the story of Francie, who like the tree, struggles to reach the sky. The sky represents the vastness of knowledge. To the people around her she would seem beautiful except there are too many of her. Her family is poor and are sometimes completely out of food, but she survives. She lives on life and gets drunk on it. Knowledge is her food and life is her drink. Betty Smith, the author, saw the beauty in a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn and wrote a powerful book.One of the most important characters in this book besides Francie is her dad, Johnny Nolen. Although he is a drunk, he is a wonderful father. Even though he brings in very little money for food he fills Francie and her brother, Neely's mind with stories of great beauty and with his own love. He is a pipe dreamer who never gets his dreams, but he builds a whole heep of them for Francie who has a chance at fullfilling them.Betty Smith brings color and sunshine to the Brooklyn streets through her characters. Sometimes with a simple barber or junk man or with a strong character like Francies mom, Katie. My favorite side character was Francies aunt Sissy. Sissy married a man of 25 when she was 14. She is concidered a bad woman because men like her pretty looks. She has married several times, calling every one of her husbands John. With her love of men comes a love of all human kind, and in that way she isn't bad.When I read this I was so pleased to find some things in common with Francie. Although there weren't many, it made me happy. I think any girl who reads this would find bits of herself in Francie. We sometimes forget that poor people have just as high expectations and longings to learn as any of us. Every time I opened this book I felt like I was being bathed in sunshine and when I finished I sat and smelled the pages, trying to take it all in."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I got this book, I had a warm feeling because I knew it was a classic and because I rarely get American books. I think this is a good choice for foreigners like me.A good thing about this book is that Betty Smith tells all about every member of the Rommely and Nolan families, as well as other people, even though this isn't important to the plot. She isn't realistic the way modern children's writers are, but she gives lots of little details. I love the parts about the Catholic religion.My favorite character is Mary Rommely, and I enjoy daydreaming of being cared for by her or Sissy. I like the part where she tells Katie how to raise her daughter. This could be used in real life, even today.Katie is very smart, hard-working and strong-willed. Sometimes she seems too stern, but other times she is kind and understanding.I can most identify with Francie when she argues with her teacher, Miss Gardner over her writing. Also, same as her, Ikeep imagining things, so I liked the part when she's told to write down stories instead of speaking lies. (Only writing takes much more effort!)I think part of what it makes this a serious novel is that sometimes little sad details are included. I don't mean the kind describing the cruel school system, but softer ones: the father Johnny being a bum; Francie and Katie knowing it would never again be all right between them. However, there are also some parts telling of good times.This is a good book to read, and after you've read it, you can browse through it again and enjoy your favorite parts separately."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I really loved this book until it got to the point where Francie left school and started working. From that point on the novel seemed like a Disney story. Factory work is fun? You can easily skip high school? I felt like the author ruined all the good she had put into the earlier part of the book. I loved, in the first 2/3 of the novel, seeing the characters overcome their hardships, the frank treatment of sexuality, the hipocrisy of the neighbors with the pregnant teenage girl, the way the family deals with attempted rape, handling difficult issues like alcoholism and the way the author honestly described peoples' flaws. Then it seemed like the author thought that the story was too sad and had to create a forced happy ending. The part where McShane \\"proposes\\" marriage to Katie was laughable. Here is a woman that would never accept charity but then she automatically jumps into marriage with the rich guy. I didn't believe that Francie would become such a snob too and state that she would never return to her old neighborhood. I just really hated the ending."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith does not need my words of Praise. It is exstraordinary piece of writing - Warm and human and speaking to you personally. It touched me deeply. With unforgettable characters that are drawn from real life.

What a masterpiece..Max PaetzoldAustralia"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a beautiful book. I have loved it for 20+ years and read it more than 20 times. Every time, it is as if I become a part of Francie. She is a daughter, a niece, a younger sister, the neighbor, the friend....she is so real to me. Look beyond the poverty to the wealth, beyond the filth to the clean heart, beyond the wrongness to all that turns out right, all because of Francie's strength of character. This is a story that may be over 50 years old, but is just as new as if it were written yesterday."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is an extremely fasinating. It combines love with the hardship of life in the 1920s. This is one of the only books that was hard for me to put down. Yeah, it was long but when I was done I was completely overwhelmed by the amazing abilities Betty Smith had for writing. She keeps you interested through the whole book. There is never a dry moment. Francie (the main character) is very heroic, and talented. If you were going to read only five books in your entire life time this should be one of them."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is my favorite.

I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your taste in books."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"ATGIB is the kind of book that you can sit down with and finish reading the whole thing feeling different about your life. I felt this way when I first read it: for me, I had to read it for school and thought when I first picked it up that it was a long book and what possible plot took up such a long book? Since then my life's changed because of Francie. I, unknowingly, acted like Francie each time I read this as a young girl: I managed to sit out somewhere where I could face my whole life (the neighborhood really) with a bag of something to eat with me. Sitting usually up in a tree with the copy, a bag of pennystick pretzels or popcorn, and a nice breeze once or twice, I fell in love with Francie, Neeley, Katie, Sissy, and all the rest. I could hear Francie telling me about her life in Williamsburg, NY and how she loved her father so much. I saw Sissy, the wild Sissy, doing all kinds of things imaginable. I smelled Katie cooking dinner and touched the library books that Francie treasured. I tasted the candy that Francie and Neeley bought. It changed my life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book when I was in junior high (over 20 years ago) &amp; still regard this book as a treasured friend. Betty Smith's description of life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is magnificent--you can smell &amp; taste it right along with Francine. (The Elia Kazan movie does some justice to the book--Peggy Ann Garner's portrayal of Francine is haunting &amp; makes rereads of the book even more enjoyable.) No matter how many times I read this book I never get tired of it. I return happily as if to a long-lost friend."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"At first this story that was set back in the depression era was real depressing but I couldn't put it down.

Don't give up on it, read it to the end."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Can't believe I've waited over 40 years to read this - but was it ever worth the wait!

It's a sharp contrast from the immigration situation we have today."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Another depressing book picked by my book club. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years. Really made you think how much we have now. Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity. It was not a face paced book. Took me awhile to get through it. I finished it so that says that I liked it somewhat. It made for an interesting book club discussion. However, it was just too slow for me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Many years ago, my seventh-grade English teacher gave me the combined set of this book and &quot;Maggie Now.&quot; (I wish &quot;Maggie Now&quot; was still in print too.) This story made a great impression on me way back then. Even though the place, time, and circumstances were different than my own life, the author somehow captured emotions and feelings very much like my own. I am ordering this book for me and my daughter."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This novel is one of the best that I have ever read. I first read this novel as a child and still enjoy it each time I read it.It is one of the few novels that I make a point of reading at least once a year. Each time I read it, I come away with a feeling of hope and sadness. Hope because Smith expresses the concept that any dream is possible as long as you apply yourself, no matter how bad your circumstances are. I also have a feeling of sadness that the novel has ended. But I guess that is a sign of a truely great and timeless novel. I were to pick 5 of my favorite novels of all time, this book would definately make the list. The characters are timeless. Even though it was written in 1943, it still can be read today and have the same impact. Smith's characterization captures the feelings of a child growing into a woman. It also gives the reader a sense of hope. It expresses the feeling that a person can a accomplish anything that he or she wants. One of the best passages proclaims that Francie is a reader. I take this saying to heart. As a true reader, I find this novel to be a must in anyone's library. Anyone reading this review, should do themselves a favor and read a novel that will capture one's heart and soul."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i fell in an anti-reading mood for a while in 8th grade, but a lot of people encouraged me to read because it really helps in writing. i went to the library 3 days ago and copied down some titles that incoming freshmen were required to read before fall. &quot;a tree in brooklyn&quot; was the first one on the list that still had plenty of copies on the shelves (i think the thickness discouraged some people). i opened it up that night and started reading; it's really interesting! some mysteries of life (some basic things like laughing in a new environment) are explained and in such a way so it isn't boring at all."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I'm not a great reader of books, but when I read this book for high school, I got hooked. I didn't put it down until I finished it two days later. I recommend it to all the girls."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have just finished reading this book at age 44. My mother suggested it over 20 years ago and I started it and never finished it. I read this book and cried, and laughed, and cried, and just passed it on to my 15-year-old daughter to read. It is a true classic. Reading this book was like eating a fabulously rich dessert and then feeling sad when it is all gone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for the first time in fifth grade and it was a life altering experiance. It is a wonderfully written and touching story. It changed my young mind's view on life and opened up a whole new world of literature for me. Recommended for mothers and daughters to read together."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I can't add much to the praise that's already been expressed on these pages. But it dismays me to read complaints about grammatical errors and misspellings. I have a Master's in English Language and composition and have taught English at the college level for many years. I have read this book a dozen times and have never seen grammatical errors other than intentional ones in the characters' dialogue. And for heaven's sake, if there are misspelling in your edition, they are typos created by someone who is not Betty Smith! Write a letter to the publishing company and they will make corrections in the next edition. Don't think less of this incredible, moving story because of a careless typesetter."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and The Triumph and the Glory are the only two novels that have ever moved me to tears. Read them for yourself and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was a wonderful novel about the hopes and dreams of a young girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn. Beautifully touching, it not only enables you to relate to your own life, but also allows you to immerse yourself into the world of Francie Nolan. Her experiences teach you about life, love, and dreams. You will not be able to put this book down. I highly recommend it, and it is definitely worth every minute of your time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is amazing. Like life, there are good things and bad things. I love everything about this book. I love Francie's take on life and how she is portrayed as an intelligent person. I also think it is wonderful how even though Francie may not live the good life, the rich life in terms of possessions and luxuries she has wonderful inner strength, humor, and self confidence. This is a wonderful book and I think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just completed reading this book for my monthly book review group. I really wanted to give the book five stars, and the only reason I didn't was because when I first started reading it, I had a hard time staying with it through the first few chapters. Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. I think perhaps Betty Smith was ahead of her time in her writing. The book had mistakes, but they were few and far between. I thought Smith did an excellent job of portraying her characters and I felt a warm connection to each one of them. When Smith describes how the family lived in poverty and the buying coal for the stove, I remembered my own childhood and the hard times my own family had. I recommend this book to anyone. Francie will win your heart, your respect, your sympathy and well...there's not much more to say, I really loved the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The world seen through the eyes of a child in Brooklyn. Many people have seen the movie which was excellent. The book however takes you from the courtship of the Francie's parents until Francie is a grown woman making her way in the world. The book is a piece of literature that will be read long past our life time. Read it and then read it again. It is nothing less than a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"If you are looking for a straightforward plot, this book is not for you. This is a beautiful novel, but beware, it requires more patience than others do. I can understand the complaints of some readers, in that the &quot;story goes nowhere&quot;. In a sense, this book is like a written photograph of the life of Francie, from the time she is 11 until she goes off to college. Betty Smith created her character and her environment and started crafting a tale about her life in exquisite detail. I enjoyed the &quot;mundane&quot; explanations and descriptions of what she sees or does in her everyday life. I have never been to Brooklyn, but i bet the author is extremely accurate in all her depictions, both of place and people. There is a very sweet, almost innocent touch in her writing style, something i have observed in other writers of her generation. In summary, a wonderful book that is a breath of fresh air in today's literature."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book covers all emotions experienced by human beings successfully: rage, sadness, happiness...There are already many good reviews for this book out there, so I won't write paragraphs. I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic. After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading. It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web. I am searching for A Joy in the Morning, and will probably enjoy it just as much."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a classic. It's a story about a strong, brave, loving, girl growing up in the rough city of Brookly. If you're looking for a book to read, or even a summer reading book, this is a definite choice. Everyone you has read this book has liked it. The author wrote this book in a way that you can understand everything clearly. This is one book you must read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is very well thought out. I thought it was very sad of how her father, John Nolan, died when only 34 and her baby sister will never see her father. Her mother,Katie, in the end ends up marrying a another man, but I won't tell you who he is. Her brother Neeley always came and collected trash for some money. Her family is very poor. Francis Nolan otherwise known as Francie is very mature for her age and also the main charcter in the book. One Christmas she helped her brother get a Christmas tree. I would think this book is for ages 11 and up. Happy Reading! :)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I don't have much to say about this book except that it is wonderful. Betty Smith, the author, tells Francie's story of poverty and hunger, and a few triumphs, very well. This a great book that no one should miss."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a sweet tale about a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, and yes, on the surface, that is what you could say this tale is about. But even moreso, I found this book to be a good, entertaining read, and it has an edge to it. This story is surprisingly unsentimental, and surprisingly enought, it's extremely frank in its depiction of adultery, sexuality, and alcoholism. This is not to say that it's explicit, but the lack of moral judgements make this a refreshingly non-biased look at the girls childhood, and we see things through HER eyes, and not the author's. This novel is very entertaining, and shows a city in the midst of change, with the influx of immigrants and faces that was slowly changing the face of early 20th century america. This is a fun, entertaining and moving book, and one you shouldn't miss. I didn't read it until I was 28, and now wish I had read it many years earlier."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I was assigned this book for a college English class. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I recommended it to all of my friends. Betty Smith brought Francis and the whole family to life for me. They tugged at my heart and showed me what my greatgrandparetns may have gone through. Thus helped me to connect with relatives I never knew and better understand what their children had to endure. The srtugle and the determination is strengthening. You beleive that what ever hardship you are going through it isn't as bad and you can make it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for an English assignment and I loved it. I recommend it for anyone looking for a book that will touch your heart. This book brings the &quot;old&quot; Brooklyn, New York to life. It helped me to understand what was going on at that time. Betty Smith brought Frannie and her family to life for me and into my life. The book helped me to understand what my grandparents and greatgrandparents went through."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a beautifully written book that invokes a world long forgotten.

It seems to me to be the author's autobiography. Before I read this book, I thought the only poor people lived on small farms in the Deep South. Don't miss it. This book is a lesson in survival that will make you a better person."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn transports us back to an earlier time, the early part of the 20th century in one of the most famous places on earth, Brooklyn, New York. Here masses of relatively new working class Americans came to make their way, dreaming about the endless possibilities while working hard to make it through the day.In this faraway place we meet the Nolan family, Katie and Johnnie who marry young, love, work hard, and bear two children, Francie, young, impressionable and sensitive to the hard world but aware that beyond her neighborhood's confines is a gentler world she wishes to enter, and Neeley, tough and tender at the same time but rambunctious and anxious to live for the moment.Johnnie Nolan makes his way as a singing waiter. He is liked by everyone for his friendly, respectful and thoughtful ways. As a father he encourages Francie, his \\"prima donna\\" to follow her dreams, and he encourages her fancies just as he lives in his own--that the impresario will discover him one night as he works, and all his wishes will come true.In order to keep her home together, Katie Nolan does not have the luxury of dreams. She works as a janitress in her building. She loves Johnnie, but she does not like his drinking nor the idea that she cannot depend upon him. Her sense of responsibility makes her appear hard, and in some ways she is, but she feels she has to act as she does if her children are to have a better and easier life than she has.Katie's mother, who can neither read nor write, insists that the family reads the Bible and William Shakespeare. Each night they read whether they understand or not, for she knows that somehow it is education that opens doors to a better world. It is Francie's intention, in fact, to read her way, alphabetically, through the books in the library, and she reads voraciously.We meet Katie's sister, Sissy, with her peculiarities. We meet other neighbors, some good and some bad. We see Francie become an adolescent and deal with all the problems that involves, and we see the very difficult and divisive decisions Katie is forced to make as Johnnie's drinking becomes more of a problem.Despite the hardships of daily life, throughout the novel there is so much good and a great deal of happiness in little triumphs and successes that keep spirit and hopes high. It is a testament to the strength of the human spirit. It is a reminder that the little things in life are often the most memorable. It extols the importance of love and family and of forgiving when forgiveness is not easy. Many of the characters are as strong as the tree that grows outside Francie's building--a tree that refuses to die.I love this book. I've read it before and it never loses its appeal. I've cried through the sad parts and smiled happily at others. An absolutely marvelous movie was made in 1945 starring Peggy Ann Garner and Dorothy Maguire. It cannot cover the entire novel, but it is a treat. I recommend this too.I re-read the book recently for a library book discussion, and I asked the men there if this had appeal for them as well, and the answer was an unqualified yes, so take A Tree Grows in Brooklyn along on your next trip."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is a classic that I just got the chance to read.

But there isn't a better way to describe Betty Smith's beautiful \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - except it isn't about a boy, but about a girl, Francie Nolan. It is a sad story - one that we have seen so many times - and, yet, Smith is capable of making it fresh and touching, because her prose is confident and abundant in details.Despite not being narrated in the first person, the story has the intimacy of narrator-protagonist, because we learn so much about Francie and the ones who surround her - her parents, he brother, friends and relative. She belongs to the same league of \\"To kill a mockingbird\\"'s Scout; and Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. They are kids whose wisdom is beyond their age. They are perceptive and sensitive about life and, specially, its difficulties and obstacles.What makes Francie Nolan - and consequently \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" - an enduring character is that in she we can see all of us. The girl is the fear of growing up, and, at the same time, she is the courage overcome our neighborhood after something bigger. We accompany her for too many years in the narrative, and become close friends with her.Francie is Betty Smith - Betty Smith is Francie. But she is also each of any of us fighting an everyday battle for a better living. Life has rarely been kind or fair to her, and in that we see every injustice kids have suffered all around the world, what makes of \\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" a perfect book for every generation - anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was for my daughter.

She and her parents and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, are a poor family and they know it. Her beloved Irish father, Johnny, is a part-time singing waiter and a nearly full-time alcoholic. Her petite, black-eyed Austrian mother, Katie, is the janitor (\\"janitress\\" here) for three tenement buildings, in return for their rent on a small flat. But with all this, they get by, though it's nearly always a struggle. Everybody likes the dapper Johnny, who seems incapable of doing anything right. Everybody respects the steel-cored Katie, who is equally incapable of making a misstep. This entire book could have been written about either of them and the reader probably would be just as satisfied. But Francie is the focus: Intelligent, thoughtful, observant, imaginative, dogged, tough -- she's all those things. She's also lonely and pretty much friendless. The narrative follows her through the next six years as she grows up physically, mentally, and emotionally, changing from a ragged street kid who collects junk to sell for pennies into a mature, confident young woman of seventeen who has skipped high school and yet is going off to college, having passed the regents' exams on the strength of summer courses, and without the benefit of high school. Francie is one of those kids who understands things. The book isn't exactly a novel, in the sense that there's no overarching plotline and nothing much of importance happens. It's difficult to answer the standard inquiry: \\"What's it about?\\" It's more of an oil painting in words, a portrait of the Brooklyn of a century ago and the people who lived there and who, with all their tribulations, still thought it the most wonderful city in the world. The style is very plain and straightforward, yet quietly poetic (which is partly why it's always included on school reading lists), but Smith spins her story out in such a way that you can't wait to find out what happens next to her characters. What holds everything together are the book's universal themes of family, interdependence, determination, and the power of learning, as well as a profound realism regarding both the good things in life and the bad. Betty Smith herself grew up largely as Francie did -- she originally wrote the book as a memoir but was convinced by her editor to recast it as a bildungsroman -- and she went on to do memorable things in literature. The reader will have no doubt that Francie (who no doubt has added \\"bildungsroman\\" to her vocabulary by the end of the book) is headed for a similar future. This book and the people in it -- and Brooklyn -- will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Like us, you'll find it very difficult not to fall in love with little Francie Nolan.While you may not pull an all nighter to finish this one, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a must read. The plot is delightfully complex, though, primarily surrounds the childhood of a lonely girl who loves books (now you know why we're so fond of her). Her family is stricken with many hardships including poverty and alcoholism, although her dad possesses one of the most underappreciated singing voices in all of literature. Symbolism is prevalent throughout and even Francie herself represents the American dream.For us it was so much fun to watch Francie bloom, ironically enough, much like a tree. We found it very easy (almost too easy...) to get caught up in each one of her successes and failures. There's also a whole cast of great characters that evolve and mature throughout the story. In the spirit of the holiday season, we double-dog dare you not to crack a smile at some of Aunt Sissy's antics."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I think that this book is very good, and the descrptions are very elaborate. Very interesting book. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Saying this book is very good is an understatement. The author makes the characters seem so real and unpretentious. Life for Francie doesn't always have a happy ending which is very relatable if you want a book that captures the essence of life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has the rabbit running afoul of some dogs in the New York City. Trapped in an alley, Bugs grabs a book that is nearby for some meager protection; the dogs see the title, perk up joyously and run away. The name of the book: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I have to wonder if more people have watched the cartoon than read the book that provided its punch line. Up until recently, I was only in that former group, but not anymore.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is Betty Smith's semi-autobiographical novel of life in a poor family in the early 1900s. As the story opens, it is 1912 and Francie Nolan - the protagonist - is eleven years old. She lives in a small apartment with her father, mother and brother. Her father Johnny is an amiable enough fellow who nonetheless has sunk into alcoholism. Rarely employed - and becoming less employable - he is unable to be the family breadwinner. Katie, his wife, married him more out of lust than love and now is suffering the consequences: although still young and beautiful, she is suffering from the burden of holding the family together. Neely, Francie's younger-by-a-year brother, still clings to childhood.This is the story of Francie's life, and like any life story, it is not driven by plot as much as character. We see Francie's development from child to young adulthood, while coping with the many problems (and occasional joys) that accompany an impoverished life. Attending bad schools, going to church, working to support the family at meager wages, even contending with a psychopath: these are some of the events that occur in Francie's life.This is an excellent book, well worth the \\"classic\\" designation often given to it. Smith's strengths are with her strong characters and wonderful writing. Francie, of course, is the centerpiece; a girl who is gifted but may not be able to exploit those gifts in her poor environment. Yes, there are sad moments in this book, but it is not really downbeat; one can imagine an adult Francie looking back at many of these events with a bit of wistfulness.Compared to other \\"great\\" novels of yesteryear - such as Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or the Grapes of Wrath, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn seems to not get the same attention anymore. It is, however, a book that is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a middle-aged man in the 21st century, I did not expect much from a story -- even a famous one -- about a young girl set in Brooklyn 100 years ago. The only reason I considered reading it was a comment from a reviewer here on Amazon, a young lady who seemed to have excellent literary taste and who cited it as her favorite novel.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a force of nature. Author Betty Smith, like Theodore Dreiser, formed piercing views of social conditions and expressed them through literature. Her arch gaze falls on an elementary school teacher here, a Tammany Hall politician there, small neighborhood merchants everywhere, and reveals an iron judgment that convinces as it informs. The weirdest aspect is that much of what she decries still pertains today.The main theme is the novel's paean to the benefits of learning. The story line is filled with interest; this book is simply unforgettable. Francie Nolan and her immediate family will remain in the reader's head long after this volume is returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It is the first book that I read that really made an impression on me, and I was only 13 years old the first time I read it (That was over 40 years ago!). I did not even realize how strong an impression it made until years later, as I began to grow and mature as a person. I recently (1 year ago) sought out and bought a new copy for my two teenage daughters to read.I identified with Francie's plight, growing up in a 'poor', but rural, area, and becoming 'aware of life' at 13, when I first read the book.Betty Smith's portrayal of a 'survivor' of a disfunctional life and time is 'universal' and timeless. Her poignant reflections of a young girl struggling and learning 'against the odds' are heartfelt and enduring.(I believe she was a strong influence in my love of writing and story-telling)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's not every book that will grab you from the opening paragraph and draw you into the characters lives the way this one does. 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was a fascinating novel describing the life and times of a young girl growing up in the early nineteen hundreds, but the experiences are not dated - they are repeated with every generation of young women, and the writer does a wonderful job depicting the inner turmoil. I loved the way the author described things, I loved how it was a book about life that I could relate to, but the thing I loved the most was that when I finished it, I wanted more.'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was an amazing story that follows Francie Nolan throughout her early life in Brooklyn. It touches on the many trials and tribulations a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn had to face in the early nineteen hundreds. The entire novel was split into five books and each represented a different point in time. The novel didn't have a single conflict, but instead it had problems overlapping problems throughout the story to show the reality of growth and development. The main goal in the novel though, was the maturation of a single child from their own perspective. It simply cuts right to the heart of life. The so-called solutions to the problems most of the time turn into larger problems and seldom solve anything in the novel, but that goes to show how honest and true this novel really is.The main character is Francie, a shy timid girl the reader can see changing and blossoming through the course of the novel, but the cast for this play has many actors. It takes many people to influence one's life. Francie's mother Katie Rommely-Nolan, played a huge role in this story, as she should because a mother's role is important to life. Francie's father Johnny Nolan also played a huge part in her life. He was an alcoholic singing waiter who was never around very much but influenced Francie's idea of life, death, and the value of everything. I noticed throughout the book that Francie compared everything to her father which showed his unbelievable importance even without a constant physical presence. Neely Nolan was crucial to this story; he was not only Francie's brother but also her best and only friend. Francie was also very influenced by her Aunt Evy who was a stern woman in many ways but you could tell that she enjoyed life, her Aunt Sissy who in the beginning of the story is a wild, crazy type and then settles as the story continues. Both of these women have husbands and children, but they don't play as much of an important role in Francie's life as the aunts themselves. There's also Francie's grandmother Mary Rommely, who indirectly plays a very important role in Francie's life because she taught Katie the grounds for raising her children. Other vital characters include Francie's bosses, teachers, schoolmates, significant others and random people she met on everyday travels throughout the city.This novel taught me that things are not always what they seem and that hardly anything goes exactly according to plan, and that you shouldn't take anything for granted. It mainly taught me however, to live life to it's fullest everyday so that I may get everything that I can out of it.If you have lived and you can read, you'll enjoy this novel. If you can't read, get it as a book-on-tape collection and you will love it too. Everyone could take this novel to heart because it's a novel about each one of us in the world, one that no matter whether you're a bum that lives in a cardboard box in the alleyway, or the king of England you can empathize with the author's growing pains, and that's the most important part. How can anyone deny reading a story about themselves? Some people are partial to science fiction, some people love editorials, all people would love this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a poor girl named Francie Nolan growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Francie lives with her brother Neeley, (who is a year younger), her mama, her papa, and at the end her baby sister. The story tells about the hard lives of the Nolans. After Francie had graduated from grade school, she had to start working while her brother Neeley continued on with his education and went to high school. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes to read books about growing up. I liked this book because it was very descriptive. It didn't focus on just one character, it told a lot about all of the characters. I also liked that it showed a very nice relationship between family members."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it seems a challenge to read since it has 500 pages, there wasn't a single page where I was bored. Betty Smith focuses on Francie's struggles and thoughts about life, her family, and the world surrounding her. Tragedy and tough choices plauge Francie all throughout the course of the story. Her lovable but unreliable father, loving, realistic mother, and favored, companionable brother add conversation and relationship to the book. This book is a moving tale of one little girl who tries to understand the world around her and teaches the reader about love, sacrifice, and hope in the process."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the coming of age story of Francie Nolan, an Irish-American girl growing up in the early 1900s. This book gives the reader a look into the daily lives and struggles of Francie's traditional, if not sterotypical, early Irish-American family. Poverty, alcoholism, and struggling to survive in a harsh urban environment are major themes in this book. Betty Smith's well-structured and detailed narrative helps the reader to experience the day-to-day hardships, emotions, and triumphs of the Nolan family, and is peppered with interesting details about life in early 20th century Brooklyn. Although the Nolans are poor and struggling, their intelligence and humanity never fails to shine through."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is one of America's timeless classics. The story of young Francie Nolan will touch your heart and forever change your view of life. A young girl growing up in the Brooklyn of the early 20th century, Francie had to face the many hardships of poverty as well as just growing up. Some of Francie's experiences are funny, and others almost brought me to tears. This book isn't famous for the phenomanal writing style of Betty Smith, because the book is written plainly and simply. Smith doesn't mince words getting to her points, but shows the life of Francie plainly and bluntly. From selling junk to earn a few extra cents, to an interesting fishing trip, Francie's life is just so different. This probably ranks number 2 on my list of all-time favorite books, right behind The View From Saturday. You haven't lived life completely until you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I would reccomend it to all girls over twelve or thirteen, because some of Francie's experiences are a bit inappropriate for some younger readers. A must-read!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I never read this book as a child (I missed out). I'll tell you right now that it is NEVER too late to read this book. It's a 'slice of life'. It's real-life with real lives that render characters that shine. It reminds us of the struggles we all go through in life. It's a beautiful story that revolves around the life of Francie and her family. It's no wonder that so many have told me how wonderful this book is to read. I underlined scores of lines that made me want to go back to re-read them...to be reminded of how to live my life or how to advise other people. This book would make a special gift for any one."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Francie taught me about America, immigration, poverty, and how hard it is to be an intelligent woman.My mom let me check this book out from the public library in 1976 -- I was 8 years old. I've read it countless times over the yaars, and it shaped my career choice... I'm a History Professor, and yes, I assign this book!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Some books that are hailed as \\"classics\\" are very much a product of their own time and seem confounding and dated to modern readers. Betty Smith's 1940 novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn isn't one of those books.. It touches on timeless topics like family ties, loss, and poverty, making it accessible to a large number of readers. It also helps that the characters are endearing, and above all, honest. Everyone has their flaws, and some are even self-destructive, but none are unlikable. None of the characters are sugarcoated in the least, and feel like real people with very real problems.The story of this novel revolves around the Nolan family, and in particular Francie. The family includes a mother, Katie; a father, Johnny; and a son, Neeley, in addition to Francie. As the title indicates, they live in Brooklyn, in a typical immigrant tenement building. The Nolan family is staggeringly poor, along with all the other families that live around them. Their poverty is evident in the first few pages when Francie and Neeley go around collecting junk with all of the other neighborhood children for a few cents. Even this meager amount of money is split in half so that part of it can be placed in a bank on a closet door in the apartment in Katie's hopes that someday the money can be used to buy a little land. Katie is a janitor in the apartment buildings and is still pretty despite the toll of years of hard work. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic, but is still charming and loving to his family despite this. His small pay as a singing waiter, alas, is not enough to feed his family. The book starts out when Francie is a preteen and gets to where she is in her late teens. In that time, the family has to deal with hard times, has had some small triumphs, and Johnny's alcoholism is a fact that can no longer be denied. The children all lose their innocence pretty quickly as living in poverty is a fact of life that has to be dealt with, as they find out.I guess you could say that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is largely plotless and doesn't follow the conventions of any type of genre literature, and you would basically be right, but a lot does happen in the book. Basically, the plot of the book is life itself, with no convenient twists or last-minute saves. What happens, happens--and none of the characters can change that fact. That makes the book seem too bleak, though; while it is never explicitly \\"happy\\" (how can you ever be truly happy when you sometimes don't even have enough food?) it never loses that glowing feeling of hope. Enormous sympathy goes to the main characters, who seem like hard-working, honest, good people who seem to deserve more in life than what they've got. Even Johnny's alcoholism is easy to understand, though of course not condoned. When he begins to spin further into the abyss of self-destruction, you don't think \\"well, that's what happens\\" or \\"Good riddance\\" but rather sadness for him, and for his family, because he is so likable. This feeling of hope does occasionally dim because of various things that happen, but you never stop hoping for the best.Betty Smith's writing style is thoughtful, and meditative, and occasionally even witty. She also has a commanding use of metaphors that is impressive. Her no-frills, butstill expressive, writing carries the reader through the nearly 500 pages with ease, and while the story naturally lags occasionally, it is never \\"boring,\\" just slow sometimes. She also stops from the main story into flashbacks that recall how Katie and Johnny have previously spent their lives, and she also fully fleshes out the many fascinating supporting characters, who get their own back stories. The most interest supporting character is Katie's sister Sissy, who is regarded as some kind of cheap floozy who sleeps around who is hopelessly in love with children despite the fact that she has miscarried over ten children. Her story is heartbreaking, but ultimately bittersweet by the end. Francie is always the anchor of the novel, though. Sometimes headstrong, sometimes weak-willed, she experiences a lot of life for her young years by the end of the book.I would recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn to anyone looking for a good coming-of-age story that is always interesting to read with fully developed characters."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book thirty years ago and have since read it many times over. It is a rare classic that will stay in your heart long after the pages have been read. You will become deeply and emotionally attached to Francie Nolan, a young girl who overcomes many obstacles and challenges beyond her control in order to survive. Taking place in the slums of Brooklyn, Francie is part of a family who dotes on her brother. Her parents are not without their own set of problems, and Francie is faced with growing up in a world that is not kind to her. She understands only too well the meaning of hunger, doing without, leaving school and not having enough money to go around.&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; takes place in the early part of the century and was written over fifty years ago. With this in mind, it may be difficult for today's generation, particularly if financial stability was never a problem, to fully understand and appreciate Francie's life. Unless, of course, the reader also experienced poverty - &quot;no money&quot; means no money, no matter what year you are living in. You will marvel at Francie's determination, strength and courage, smile at her resourcefulness, and feel compassion for a girl who, by necessity, is far more mature than her years.One other excellent book by the same author that I also treasure among my collection is &quot;Joy in the Morning.&quot; It is written with the same grace, style and emotion as this one. Both classics are highly recommended and would make a cherished part of your library."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This story is basically about the struggle to overcome adversity.It chronicles the childhood of Francie Nolan, a very wise girl, mature past her years, who grows up in the mean slums of turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, New York.In spite of quite a terrible childhood, filled with indignities, unfairness, and pain, Francie is determined to succeed, so that she may rise up above her surroundings. Although she must leave school before getting to high school, to work in a factory, she fights her way back to an education, eventually making it to college and out of Brooklyn.Francie's fight out of the slums is truly inspiring--like the &quot;Tree of Heaven&quot; that grows out the broken cement of the sidewalk, she fights through setbacks and never gives up. What I found to be especially wonderful was the fact that Betty Smith made no character all good or all bad. This enables the reader to feel what the character is feeling, and understand their motive in doing what they do. Thus the story is felt and experienced on many different levels and in many different ways.I really love this book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Author Betty Smith was a one hit wonder. Although she wrote other novels, her work after &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; never came close to capturing the characterizations and sense of time and place exhibited in this fine, even extraordinary, piece of writing that was released in 1943.But so what? Who needs an encore when the first performance has readers standing in the aisles? &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is as readable today as it was fifty years ago. It has stood the test of time to become one of America's most beloved and enduring novels.The story evolved from Ms. Smith's experiences growing up in Brooklyn in the very early 1900s. Although it is a novel, it's obvious that the core experiences are autobiographical. The main character in the book, Francie Nolan, is Betty Smith.The book carries us through a little more than ten years of life with the poor but proud Nolan family. The Nolans face numerous hardships - the heartbreak of losing a warm-hearted but alcoholic father, the attempted rape of Francie, the shame of being poor - but they are held together by the steely determination of Francie's mother, Katie.There are unique characters, perhaps the most unforgettable is the promiscuous and colorful Aunt Sissy who worked in a condom factory, had the habit of marrying time and time again without getting a divorce, and had ten babies stillborn, until a fake pregnancy brings her first healthy child (how? I won't give that away.)But the book's strongest point is its ability to capture a place and a time: Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century America. Not since Charles Dickens has a writer so skillfully described an era and a physical setting. Betty Smith harpooned with a pen the details and nuances that made Brooklyn the true melting pot of America, a rugged and confused place that bore more genius than anywhere else in the world. Ms. Smith is gone. Her tree is still growing."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"When I was thirteen I read this book and loved it. I was Francie in my mind. We lived not far from Brooklyn and while not as poor, shared many of the same problems. The book has always been a fond memory for me. This month it was chosen as a group read for my reading group. Although I rarely re read, I decided to see if the book was as good as my memory said it was. To my delight it was still as wonderful as I remembered. Only this time I had a bit more sympathy for the mother Katie, then I did the first time. Seeing the book through the eyes of a mother, I admired more of the qualities I saw as harsh those many years ago. Betty Smith writes with such detail, that one can see the streets of Williamsburg as seen through Francie's eyes. The Nolan's are a family that literally lives the American dream. They start the book in dire poverty, yet each generation accomplishing more than the one before. And they have the most important gift of all, the love and support of family. Today this would no doubt be labeled a dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic father, a mother leaving her children unattended, an aunt who is a little too free with her favors. Yet we love the Nolans, and root for them through thick and thin. Francie Nolan loved reading and the library above all else. I am now the grown up Francie, still trying to read every book in the library. I am glad I took the time to re read this one. Francie Nolan will be a part of me forever."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"It's no wonder that this book is truly loved by practically everyone who reads it: it's a story of growing up and innocence, life and love, caring and the way things go. You might not have a lot of money, but you can do one thing that's free, and that's to love. Francie Nolan is inside of all of us, the eleven year old girl who has her life set out for her: flowers in a brown bowl, read a book every day in alphabetical order until you reach the Z's, have a lot of children. She wants to win everything on a board that she spends a bit at every Saturday; right down to the skates and the doll with real hair: she yearns for what she may never get. Her family is poor and lives in the tenements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She and her brother Neeley do not know to be ashamed of their father and Francie has scant knowledge that her father has a bad reputation. Her mother works hard and her aunt &quot;gets around&quot;, as the writer calls it. She may be poor, but she has a loving family. She wants to be an author when she grows up and pay attention to children; she is upset with the librarian at the Brooklyn library who does not even look up at the poor little girl who comes in every day to check out a book that is good for an eleven year old. Francie is pleased when a book she loves is chosen; she symbolizes an everyday, American girl. We grow up with Francie; book one chronicles the life of an eleven year old girl that is so everyday, repetitive, that it shows everything is all right. The customs and the traditions prove that Francie's life has a rhythm to it, nothing bad happens. Book two chronicles life early on, as her parents meet and have their children and Francie grows older as things happen. And book three proves that you must grow up, as Francie enters college and begins a new life that only the reader can imagine what happens next. So read this book. Just read it, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I have always wanted to read this book, and when I went into my ninth grade honors English class this year and saw it on the reading list, I couldn't wait to start it. I never had read it before because it had always seemed too long. How wrong I was! I couldn't put the book down, and when I finished, I yearned to know more about Francie. The story is very believable, as I am sure that Ms. Smith experienced some of the same hardships that Francie underwent. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an excellent book to read for school, and it is probably on most reading lists. The theme is very prevalent throughout the novel, and there are good examples of figurative language, and other aspects that are discussed in the classroom. I think that in order to truly understand the book, the reader must be at least eleven years old. However, I do feel that this can be enjoyed by a younger child, even if the exact meaning is not understood. Francie sets a good example for everyone in her ability to overcome obstacles and reach her goals. This is a timeless classic that I'm sure will be enjoyed for years to come!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I first read this book almost 40 years ago when I found it in my parent's bookcase. I was in grammar school at the time and my mother thought I wasn't old enough to read it so she hid it from me. It didn't take me very long to discover her hiding place and I read as much as I could each Saturday when she went to do her shopping. Even as I child, I was moved by the story of Francie's coming of age in a city and economic situation that were completely foreign to mine. Betty Smith's writing transported me into Francie's life. I loved the book then and still have the copy that belonged to my mother. Over the years, I have forgotten the details of the story, but have remembered the feelings that the book inspired in me and how I felt connected in some way to Francie. I have just recently come across my old worn copy and am currently reading it again. The feelings still ring true, but to read it now as an adult, I am finding a depth to the novel that I missed reading it as a child. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i just finished reading &quot;A tree grows in brooklyn&quot; as part of a class project.

I didn't want to put the book down! There seemed to be a new surprise every time i turned the pages. There was just so much to learn about Francie and her family. The book at me crying towards the end, even though it wasn't sad. It was one of those books you just want to go on forever and never end. I think this book ranks alongside my favorite book of all time &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;. This book is one for people who enjoy reading about family life, and getting very much invovled with the charecters and caring what happens to them in the following chapters. I admit, there were some points in the book in which i was screaming at the mother &quot;Don't do that to Francie! &quot; i would yell in my head. I think that is what makes this book so good-you become Francie and become very much a part of her world. I read 400 pages of the book in 2 days. I never put it down-it was that good.

How wonderful to stumble upon this date in the opening of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;. Just like Shackleton, Francie and her family made up for a lack of physical comforts with inner fortitude. Titanic's lowest class of passengers could likely have lived a live much like Francie's. I absolutely loved the descriptions of her neighborhood its residents. The sense of place could not have been better. Smith skillfully paints her characters actions and thoughts, thereby leaving nothing unrevealed, yet episodes still often caught me offguard. Absolutely wonderful. Recommend this to young adults and up who are willing to tackle 400+ pages of enlightning reading."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"So beautiful. Such an inspiring story of a girl's coming of age. Every adolescent girl should read this book, and most boys would be improved by reading it too."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This was an incredible book. I read a few of the reviews that criticized the sadness and the troubled personalities of the characters. Look, those people have not truly read the book. They read the outside meaning of this book. They didn't read in between the lines. To get the true experience of this book, the sorrow and the triumphs, you have to discover the beauty of reality. You have to look beyond the hardships and the personal anxieties. You have to look at Betty Smith's absolutly beautifully written American classic."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This is the inspirational story of Francie, a young girlgrowing up in a tenament in Brooklyn in the '20s. Her fatheris an alcoholic with big dreams and no way to realize them.Her mother is down-to-earth, but completely worn down by theirpoor life.Francie is determined to learn; she enrolls in a school milesfrom her home, regardless of the hardhship this imposes on her.This is just one example of her strength and courage.I read this book first when I was in my teens; I am now 40,beginning college, and still find inspiration and hope in itspages.I would recommend it to anyone; however, women may find a lotin it. The main character, Francie, is a child of courage; Iwould love to meet her when she's 40!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I liked this book, I read it as a high schooler and found it intrigued me enough so that I finished it. I like historical fiction, and this edition is so nice for a paperback, with helpful added bio-information about the author in the back. The first thing I like about the story is how the central character is a girl who has a passion for knowledge and literature/writing.Although this was a coming of age story, I still couldn't swallow some of the things the characters went through; which made the story kind of dark, but not too much. The descriptions of life as an immigrant in early 20th century New York were not so disturbing as to make me put the book down, but it sombered me. I can only look back at this book somberly.There are some lies that were told in bittersweet ways to make life easier and some truths told in harsh ways that made things harder. Which was confusing and thought provoking at the same time. That's why I say brilliant but can't quite define the book as beautifully written. I suppose it is all a metter of opinion.Overall, it was a fairly nice read for its' genre. I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone younger then a highschooler, and I think it would make a great book club read.It is an odd but sweet ode to family."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The book's cover is in good condition and the pages are in good condition too. Very little wear. The problem is, about 4 chapters in the pages are in the wrong order. I've found this very frustrating - I keep having to flip back and forth through the pages. The seller should have made this apparent in the item's discription."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I expected the book to be used... even used. What I did not expect was that the cover of the book (including the portion that covers the spine) is attached by a few threads. I don't mind worn. But this condition makes the book hard to read and is inconsistent with how I remember the book being described in the sales materials."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book, written in 1943, is so heartwarming. It looks at family relationships in a very unique way. A must read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"The title of the book that am reading is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Bettie Smith. The main topic of this book as it states in the foreword.\\"The best anyone can say is that it is a story about what it means to be human.\\" Represents that the novel about a little girl named Francie and her little brother named Neeley that wasn't just about how they pulled through in a poor neighborhood. It was about the real life struggles families have to go through.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel. The author of this novel was born on December 15, 1896 with the name of Elisabeth Wehner. She married young with a law student from the university of Michigan. She then had 2 daughters named, Nancy and Mary. She wanted to finish her schooling but she didn't finish high school. Although she was able to take classes and she was focusing in journalism, literature, and drama. The foreward states that the novel isn't just a book about \\"social issues\\" nor \\"class struggles\\". Its a novel when you read it you recognize yourself.The main topic on this novel is that Nolan family of 4. Living in Willamsburg, Brooklyn. Trying to make ends meet with the father, Johnny Nolan, being the head of the family. Working as a singing waiter, And drinking his tips away. The Nolan family were very poor. they bought penny worth stale food.This work addresses to many audiences, but i think the problem relates to a particular audience which is the ungrateful audience. The type of audience that have enough and wanting more.At first the book confused me a little. The reason for this because the way the story was written in which i liked. But it started with Francie and how her life was. Then the next chapter it was about Francie's meeting. i got that part but the part where it was a chin scratcher was when the part where Mary and Sissy came in. Until I read on and understood that Sissy was Katie's sister, and Mary was her mother.The book in general is great. But the part that I loved. Was the part where Francie went up to the fire escape and started to read on a Saturday. I like this part because it made me understand the difference between kids from then and now.I completely concur with previous reviews. In which they state \\"A profoundly moving novel, and an honest and true one. It cuts right to the heart of life...\\" I recommend this book for all audiences to read."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I can't say I really loved this book but it was a decent read. I loved the symbolism and the characterization. I would say this is between 3 and 4 stars. I just can't say it gripped me."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I just finished reading this book a few minutes ago. I am not trying to be against the grain here at all but I don't understand how this book is so reputably powerful and a classic. It's not terrible reading because this story was by far very well written and my vocabulary has increased by atleast 13 new words. Overall though, this book felt like a auto biography, too close to reality to really wow me. As the reader, I was experiencing poverty, hunger, bulleying, chronic rejection and loss of innocence through Francie's eyes and yet, she progressed beautifully by independently finding ways to be educated and learning about the world and the people in it. I did find myself physically reacting to certain parts like when this young woman whom had a baby but was unwed was bedeviled by the neighbors and having rocks thrown at her and her child. Also, an important character in my mind passed on which changed my mood from then on. For the record, I feel the need to defend Francies Father Johnny. Yes, he did drink but I don't feel like he deserved to be treated like an acute alcoholic. He was never biligerent or hurtful to his family. Johnny wasn't the type to pour whiskey in his morning cereal and he was always singing and being chipper. But because every night when he performed he had gotten inebriated this is how he was remembered. Luckily, Francie saw past it because he was the only one that truely understood her and supported her ideas and dreams. Katie, Francie's mother lacked a sense of humor, obviously favored Francie's younger brother Neely, and could not let go of her control issues. It was her way or the highway. I don't want to give away the entire story but I must say that although I did enjoy reading this book, it did not satisfy my hunger from what I expected based on all the reviews I read about it. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an adventure and will more than likely relate to you in some way, this book just illustrated what we all must go through... Life."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book was 9th grade honors English required reading...our teachers beat it to death, and it was really awful anyway.

Completely satisfied. I will do business again. Thank You:)"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"This book took forever in developing the plot. It seemed like I had read a quarter of the book before we even got to the main character. It was also a little predictable when it came to what would happen to her father."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My daughter had to read this for her Honors English Class. She says it's interesting, but a little weird. Big problem was that it was missing pages 307-338! Amazon has been notified."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"i think it was really good, from the reviews i saw"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"My bookclub picked this book as every once in a while we do a classic and many in my club had fond memories of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. I got about half through and was never engaged in it. I found myself skimming much of it and finally decided that I'd move on to something else. I think if you enjoy lots of detailed description, this might be a good book for you. It moved too slowly for me, though."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I read this book for our book club. The reviews for this book got my hopes high before I started reading it, but disappointed me after I completed the book. Betty Smith wrote this book based on her own life experience, but she did not add any value for the readers who read the book (in my opinion). If you have no interest in experiencing poor childhood or awkward adultlecense, I would not recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A great story that was a glimpse into life in the early 20th century. What an impact immigrants had on America!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"As a reader outside of the U.S., I am not so familiar with the society and life during that era. This book provides the vivid background information. I find the details of her life and family satisfy my curiosity much more than the plot. I read some paragraphs to my 8-year-old daughter and she loves it!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"A heartbreaking and inspirational novel about love and life. Although set in the early 20th century, the lessons still ring true."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an essential read for teen girls learning about their surroundings. This historical fiction, set in early 1900s Brooklyn, leaves readers feeling like they have grown by reading the book. The plot centers around Francie, a girl who grows up with and learns to navigate a dark world.The beginning of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn establishes the poverty Francie Nolan, the protagonist, faces. Evidence of the Nolans' poverty can be found when Smith writes about how Francie enjoys \\"their one great luxury,\\" wasting coffee: \\"From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink... Mama explained: \`...I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging'\\"(14). Since Francie's mother, Katie Nolan, likens being wealthy to not worrying about scrounging, you could infer that her family is poor. A middle-class person would think it was normal to live without scrounging. The poverty, and other problems such as Francie's frequently drunken father, creates a challenge for Francie's growth.One of Betty Smith's messages is that in order to grow up, you must understand the world in which you are growing. The tree foreshadows this theme in the beginning. Smith writes about that type of tree, \\"You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first\\"(6). This detail suggests the tree understands poor habitats and that is why it thrives in these places. In the contrast, Francie is initially too innocent to understand the darkness of her life. Her navet&eacute; is demonstrated in the passage, \\"Francie made Mama watch while she put the eight cents in the tin-can bank. They had a pleasant five minutes conjecturing about how much was in the bank. Francie thought there must be nearly a hundred dollars. Mama said eight dollars would be nearer right\\"(12). Francie is too nave at this point to see that her family is poor. She will have to understand the circumstances if she is to succeed as she gets older. The tree symbolizes this requirement and, in that way, sets the stage for Francie's story.Teenage girls who are beginning to understand the realities of life and enjoy pondering these discoveries should read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is about a girl who is challenged to face the facts of her life. The plot would be attractive to another girl facing similar challenges because she could relate to Francie and would learn more about life. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn helps develop readers by vividly portraying Francie's development."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK HAS SO MUCH MORE THAT WAS NOT FEATURED IN IT. JUST A GREAT READ FOR ALL AGES!"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"I like the book but after reading a few chapters I realized I had seen the movie. I couldn't keep the faces of the actors out of my head. There were many stories of this nature at this time in history and my own life was reflected in many ways in this book.Susie"},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"So much has already been written about this book, that there really is not much more that I can add. I am rather surprised that some people gave it a one-star rating. If/when you do listen to this audio of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I believe you will understand why I am a bit confused by the one-star ratings.Our Book Club had this as our February 2013 book to read. One of the things mentioned in our discussion was that what you felt about the book might depend a great deal upon the age at which you read/listened to it. Several of our members read the book in school. Now as older adults, with life experiences and having children of their own, the book meant more to them. I am so very pleased that I had the opportunity to listen to this book. There is a reason that it was named one of the books of the century by the New York Public Library. If you have never read it before, or even if you have, I believe this audio version is one which you will appreciate very much.I highly recommend this book and, in particular, this audio rendition by Carrington MacDuffie. She brought the book to life for me. And, for those of you with a busy life style, having the audio to listen to while you drive, walk, or just rest (and listen to it with your eyes closed), is a great way to experience the book.I will not soon forget this book."},{"Title":"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","review":"this book covers it all.
