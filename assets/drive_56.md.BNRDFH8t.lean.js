One year, as I read, I realized my five month old daughter had cerebral palsy. The book was a great source of comfort and advice. Written in the 1940s, it tells of a time when mopst of these children were forgotten in institutions and thought to have no IQ. Karen's family not only kept her, but they raised her to be an intelligent and successful human being-a miracle for the time. I pick up every copy I find in thrift stores and give them to parents. (They're getting harder to find, so order fast!) Even if you have no special interest in Cerebral Palsy, you'll be touched by this loving family story."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read Karen in about the 5th grade. I have read it several times since. I have daughters in both 5th and 7th grades and I think it would be an excellent book for them to read. Too often now days things come so easy to some and they don't see the challenge or the blessing of being able to just live. I believe it would be a good motivational book for all children, expecially those with disabilities. My daughter has ADD and daily has to struggle. I would like her to know what can be accomplished by trying and trying, over and over again. Just an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read Karen when I was in grade school. Since then, I've worn out at least four copies with numerous re-reads. The sequel, With Love From Karen, is equally inspirational ... if only there were more! Definitely worth the search, it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Karen and With Love From Karen written by Marie Kililea are in my opinion both masterpieces on mans ability to overcome physical and emotional disabilities in a positive manner. I read &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; when I was young and wasn't able to appreciate at that time the true value of these books. The humor and kindness of the Kililea family was very apparent even at the first glance. I enjoyed them all the same at that time and recently picked them up again to reread. The literary style and content is superb. The quality is unsurpassed by many books written on handicaps because it gives a feeling of hope and determination rather than a feeling of &quot;the poor child&quot; to the readers. I would recommend this book to people of all ages, with or without disabilities because its a good lesson in appreciating the gifts of God that we receive daily.It's a pity that we don't know what happens with Karen as she goes through her adult life since readers feel that they know her at a personal level by the time they finish the books. I was also disappointed to see that &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; is out of print!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"It's not much, but I did a key word search on all the family names from the Karen books. I found a number of hits for a Russ Lea down in Georgia. I also found a hit for a Rory Killilea which took me to a picture of a middle aged man holding a young boy at a local ball game somewhere on the west coast. There was no article, just a caption: &quot;Rory Killilea and his son enjoy the game&quot; or soemthing like that. The Lea ones seem iffy because it seems to be a fairly common name, but I thought that Rory Killilea was unusual enough that it could be him. I couldn't find any thing on anyone else in the family except for references to the various books that Marie wrote. It left me with some sense of satisfaction to think of Rory as a happy dad. Anyway, thought I would share it with all of you who, like me, are wishing to know more of the story."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I received &quot;Karen&quot; from my Mom when I was 10 (I'm 16 now), and at the time I didn't think much of it. As a matter of fact, I even said, &quot;You can walk. Big deal!&quot; I wasn't being serious, but I still reget that careless remark. &quot;Karen&quot; is the story of a God-sent child and her remarkable family as they deal with Karen being &quot;affected by&quot; not &quot;afflicted with&quot; Cerebral Palsy. I reread this book whenever I feel lonely, or happy, or disappointed. You'll laugh at the descriptions of their mishaps and the nightly Bible classes between Karen and Rory. You'll grow attatched to the warm characters- both human and animal! You'll experience the family's troubles and triumphs and you'll cry at both. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't have a restored faith in the heart of humanity after reading this book. This book reveals the strength of the disabled and te progress of society toward their acceptance. I am very surprised and saddened to hear about the divorce of Jimmy ad Marie-- who would've guessed? At any rate, they are both strong people in their own right, so don't be disillusioned now! Does anyone know what happend to little Kristin? Anyway :) - Karen is a valuable book for life and how to live it."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I've read some reviews and have to repeat what someone else has pointed out: Readers need to keep in mind that this stuff happened in the 40's and 50's. You can't criticize the smoking, because at that time, people didn't know smoking around kids was harmful. Smoking was a very normal activity for many adults. If Marie Killilea had known that smoking might be contributing to her miscarriages and ill health of her kids, I'm sure she would have stopped. People didn't know.You can't criticize Karen's parents for not creating a cerebral-palsy playgroup for her, because they were the groundbreakers in treating cerebral palsied kids like \\"normal\\" kids. They were flying by the seat of their pants. My guess would be that they decided they should raise Karen \\"normally,\\" and having her play a lot with other handicapped kids would not have seemed \\"normal\\"--after all, what they were fighting were doctors and other professionals who recommended placing Karen permanently in an institution FILLED with other handicapped people. This book is not a recent book and it has to be read in the historical context. I mean, schools were still segregated when Karen was born. Geez.I read this book and \\"With Love From Karen\\" when I was in about fifth and sixth grade, after my mother gave me \\"Wren.\\" Honestly, I never thought much about the cerebral-palsy side of the books. I was an only child, I loved animals, and I thought that Karen was lucky to live in her family. The cerebral palsy was kind of a side issue for me. We didn't go to church, and I didn't understand a lot of the Catholic stuff either, but I loved that the family sounded so close.I think the concern someone posted about publishing this book when Karen was still young has some validity, but--her mom was desperately trying to draw attention to the fact that handicapped kids were okay. She succeeded in a huge way, through this book. She influenced a generation of people, people who would have looked at her daughter strangely if they ever met her, due to her handicap, but, instead, looked at Karen as practically an angel, because they felt they knew her through this book. And after all, when Marie wrote the book, she would have had no idea that it would end up being in print for decades and read all over the world, and that Karen would still be hounded by fans in 2007 (which apparently she is, when they can track her down).I guess what I'm saying is, before anyone criticizes Karen's mom, they ought to keep in mind that their opinions about what's right and wrong for handicapped kids were probably shaped by Karen's mom, whether they realize it or not. Our whole society was influenced by \\"Karen.\\" Yeah, everyone knows you don't keep a kid with cerebral palsy hidden in the basement of your house--but hey, America didn't always know that.I just found a website where I read that Gloria's two daughters, ages 9 and 7 at the time, were killed in a house fire. I actually cried over this. Although of course I never met any of these people, they felt like my family when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I am 49 now and read this book when I was about 8 years old. (Why a book with curse words was available in the Weekly Reader Book Club for little children to read, I'll never know.) I have never dwelt on any of the negatives that readers are commenting about, with the one exception of the smoking. I do not have CP, but as a child I knew something about me was different. I was premature, late learning to walk, and the slowest runner of all the children - no matter how hard I tried to run faster or how much I loved to run. I had frequent stomachaches & got sick with sinus/allergy/URI's/dehydration regularly every 3 months or so. I almost died at least twice. My ankles turned or twisted very easily. I hated being crowded or hearing loud noises. My legs hurt often, & if I fell on one of my kneecaps, it felt broken because the pain was so horrible. The pediatrician said this was \\"growing pains\\", but it wasn't. At the age of 28, I learned that I had \\"fibrositis\\", now called Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS or CFIDS). This incurable chronic disease - an autoimmune, muscle, pain, allergy/sinus, urinary, colon, and neurological/cognitive disorder in one - can be disabling. In fact, it has been compared to mild cases of spastic CP. Microscopic tears that grew into huge tears (caused by the FMS) made me need to have major reconstructive surgery of my right knee at 13 and my left knee at 24. So reading about Karen's struggles from a young age helped me to also conquer challenges that my own disability has brought into my life. I presently work a full-time job as an administrative assistant for a global company. I love Big Marie's different writing style. Like today's very popular cable show about the Roloffs of Roloff Farm in Oregon (married dwarves who have 4 children, only one of which is a dwarf), who have the problems and disagreements every family has but struggle as a team to make it in an oversized world, the Killileas were a normal family dealing with a precious child who was labeled \\"abnormal\\". I loved that they turned the living room into a physical therapy room and invited the \\"normal\\" kids over to watch and join in the fun. I loved that there were gouges in the furniture where Karen had vacuumed, and they didn't care. I loved that Karen was not a little saint - she was human, as proved by the stunts she made her little brother Rory carry out, and the \\"female dog\\" term she used to get rid of an obnoxious stranger who invited himself into their house. I loved that Gloria had the maturity, discipline and self-control to wait 7 years for Russ, her true love. I'm not Catholic, but I loved that they regularly went to Mass and had spiritual insights. I loved that they taught Karen to take part in what physical activities she could, such as swimming and horse riding. I loved that Karen dealt with severe pain every day (as I do) and HATE that they put that spreader between her legs at night to stretch her leg muscles - like torture! In short, the best part of \\"Karen\\" is that she never limited herself by listening to what doctors and therapists told her she could never do, but she surpassed all their limitations and expectations by victories like walking, writing by hand, and getting up & down off of chairs alone. I'm still inspired by this book today."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"&quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; remain my favorite all time books - and this is saying alot as I am a librarian and avid reader. I remember reading this in high school and wishing I could be in a family just like the Killileas. These books can be found at yard sales and library book sales. I recently picked up a copy of &quot;Wren&quot; (the juvenile version of &quot;Karen&quot;) at a yard sale. The reprint of &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; contains a brief update of the family but I wish there were more. I even wrote Marie Killilea quite a few years ago and received a lovely handwritten reply. More than a story about a disability, it is about a wonderful family!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read the sequel &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; when I was in high school (100 years ago, approximately); my grandma had given me a box of old paperbacks, and that was among them. I enjoyed it and re-read it....quite frankly, this family was more wholesome than the Brady Bunch! But I found that comforting somehow, and subsequently read &quot;Karen&quot;. Since then, I've re-read both books countless times.A separate online group has made Karen and her family something of a detective mission, and the following facts have been unearthed:Karen is alive and well, and working for a priest at a Catholic retreat not far from Sursum Corda.Big Marie and Jimmy have, unfortunately, passed away (both in the 1990s).Gloria just recently died (December 2001), and was still married to Russ. Oddly enough, her obituary mentioned two sons, but not the two daughters described in &quot;With Love from Karen.&quot;Little Marie has been divorced and apparently remarried.Kristin has also grown up and gotten married. She was forced to sell Sursum Corda due to tax considerations."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"When I first read this book, I was just starting my freshman year in high school. Although &quot;KAREN&quot; I read then was a graded reader for Japanese high school students, it was an impressive book (very difficult, though) and most of all the students in the class cried when Karen said &quot;I CAN WALK, I CAN TALK. I CAN READ. I CAN WRITE. I CAN DO ANYTHING.&quot;Several years later, I found &quot;KAREN&quot; and its sequel here and read whole story. The story still gave me strong impression and gave me a chance to think &quot;if I had been like Karen, what I would do?&quot; I just keep my friends who can read English) to read both the books (unfortunately, most of my friends cannot read English)."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Karen is a very immpressive young girl who is full of courage and hope. The way Marie wrote Karen is absolutely fabulous. Also, the way the book ends is also remarkable, as it says &quot; I can walk, I can talk, I can read I an write. Mom Pom, I can do anything.&quot; This book is a good model. It shows that you shouldnt give up courage and hope. I hope that this book was, and will remain usefull to many."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"My mother gave me Wren when I was in elementary school, and later introduced me to the grown-up versions, Karen and With Love from Karen. I have read both books again and again, and I have always felt as though I were a member of the family. Unfortunately, I do not have copies of these books and I am anxious to find them. Mrs. Killillea is a gifted woman in so many ways, as are all the members of her brood, including her precious husband, Jimmy. I wish I knew how and where everyone is today!I learned about many things besides disabilities from these books. I feel they should be available for public education - the reason Marie wrote them in the first place! It is a testament to Marie Killillea's ministry of public education that today students with disabilities are present in public schools."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a wonderful book for readers of all ages. I first read this book when I found it on the booshelf of a house we were renting for the summer. It is a sweet story and as you read it you will fall in love with Karen and all the Killileas. It is amazing as you look at the time that Big Marie and Jimmy put into helping Karen become self-sufficient. The story of Karen's birht is amazing also. KAren was born at 6 months 2 days weighing 1 lb. 12 oz. She spent the first 8 months of her life in the hospital, she was unable to gian sufficient weight because of an esaphagus problem. Weighing barely 8 lbs. The doctors risked everything and preformed surgery, completely fixing the problem. THen two days later Karene becomes so sick with the flu that she is put on critical. Miraculously a risky blood transfusion saved her again. Everyone should read this classic story of the Killilea family."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a profoundly moving book - the biography of a child afflicted by cerebral palsy who was born in an era when it was a little-understood disease with almost no treatment options or support groups. On the contrary, many people were repulsed by what they considered a dirty or degenerate condition. Written by her mother, this is a lively and engaging account of the family's experience, from discouragement to hope to triumph, all anchored by a deep religious faith that shines through. You don't have to be a devout Catholic to find this a profoundly inspirational story. Karen herself is no saint; her humor, intelligence and inner strength reveal a person of great value, even as a very young child. I have re-read this book many times over the past 45 years and it has never failed to enlighten and uplift me."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I was sad to see these books are out of print but was happy to see others felt the same about Karen and her family. I have a 14-year-old that I would love to have read these stories. How many of us have to write in before someone puts these fine books back in print?"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I, too, have worn out my copy of this. I first read Karen's story as a small child, as a child's book called &quot;Wren&quot;. Then I found &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; and read them to death. Thanks to Karen, I have a Newfoundland! I'm trying to find another copy of each of these, hence my stop here today. Also good, Marie Killilea's children's picture book, &quot;Newf&quot;. Great for dog and cat lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I can't remember how I got a hold of this book, but I read it when I was very young. One summer, my family took me to New York City and somehow we ended up in the suburbs and found the Killilea house. No one was home, but I can still remember how excited I was to be so close to the Killilea family. I also was puzzled by the fact that Gloria's life was much more detailed than little Marie's. Karen and With love from Karen really should be mandatory reading for children."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I bought this as a gift for my sister who loved these books as a young girl. She was so surprised and happy to receive it. It arrived very quickly and in great condition."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I too have fibromyalgia and pain every day. Fortunately I have a loving husband and two daughters. I have read these books do often I could quote passages from them. I am just heartbroken that the fire tore apart the family and three precious girls were killed. How could Marie had said such a thing to a freshly bereaved mother of two children? (she said now she had the theme of her next book) Our family is also dealing with many other illnesses including Alzheimer's with my mother and me being disabled from a career as a professor. It is a rough life down here! I am glad that the remaining family is close."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is such a good read, it is all about a little girl born with CP. She is so brave and such an inspiration. I think everyone will enjoy the story of Karen."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I originally read the Karen books as a child, and I've loved them ever since. To those who find fault, as others have pointed out, the events took place in the 40s and 50s- yes, a lot of people smoked. Interesting, but certainly not shocking. And to the person who objected to Marie loving her husband more than her children- for heaven's sake, remember the context: The husband was in emergency surgery and the author was *praying*. She says as she prayed she tried to bargain with God and explained that while her children were a precious part of her life, her husband *was* her life. These were private words spoken to God; not worthy of criticism."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have also been a fan of Marie Killilea's books since I first read them as a kid almost 30 years ago. I would love so much to find out what happened to the family members. I also find it almost impossible to believe that Marie and Jimmy ever got divorced, not only because of everything they had been through but even more because of their very strong Catholic faith. If anyone knows what really happened, please write!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is a wonderful and true story about a courageous mom and her very bright daughter who happens to have cerebral palsy. It is a finely detailed literary work that speaks volumes to the centrality of involved, conscientious parenting. Excellent and beautiful work, recommended for any one that cares as much about the parenting profession as this writer clearly and eloquently does."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is one of my favorites and should be read by all. It is a wonderful story of Karen and her family, back in the '40's when correct diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy was almost unheard of. Someone posted in the review section regarding Marie and Jimmy Killilea getting divorced over 20 years ago. Well, I did a bit of research of my own and found Marie and Jimmy's death records online. Marie died in October of 1991, Jimmy in July of 1994. It says his marital status at time of death is &quot;Widower&quot; (she died before he did). Under 'Name of Spouse' it says &quot;Marie Killilea&quot;. Also, I checked out the updated Forward to my 1993 edition of &quot;Karen&quot;, and Marie mentions going to the Bronx Zoo with Jimmy and their grandson Jason, in 1981. I have no idea why someone would say they were divorced; perhaps Pat O'Brien was confused at the time. Best to check resources carefully."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read Karen when I was in my early teens, and was thrilled to re-read it just a few months ago when my daughter brought it home from school. (About 40 years have gone by.)I was also able to read With Love From Karen, a book I had looked for, but was never able to find. Both books were in the local high school library!These are outstanding examples of humor, and faith in God enabling you to cope with any situation. In the Killilea's case without air conditioning! Just great books, and very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read this book as a child. I loved it, and wrote a book report on it. Even as an adult, I still find this book warm and uplifting. When my son was born, he sustained a brain injury that has caused him to be delayed in many areas. I reread Karen, and found strength that other people have gone through tough times. As to the breakup of the Killilea's marriage, this is probably evidence of how little support there was for parents of children with special needs. It can take a toll on a family, even one as bright and cheerful as Karen's. Read this book and be enlightened and encouraged."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this book almost 30 years ago and still remember it like it was today.

Having CP myself, these were the first books I ever read on the subject. Karen's courage, strength, determination and spirit were, and still are, an inspiration to me today and to those who are lucky enough to read these books as well. I strongly encourage parents, grandparents, siblings and friends of loved ones who have CP to read these books.

Equally important is Marie Killilea's description of the prejudices of the times, when she was advised to turn her back on her daughter and forget she ever had her. Her refusal to do so and her matter-of-fact recounting of her and her husband's struggles to help Karen speak equally well for their own courage, love and clear-sightedness.

It is still truly one of the most encouraging, real people books I have ever read. Marie Killilea reveals how cerebral palsy affects not only Karen's life but also the lives of her whole family. Fear, disappointment, discouragement, faith, peserverance and love are all shared in a reality many will never know. This book is not only one to be read by families of children with cerebral, but by everyone facing seemingly impossible challenges."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read this book when I was 11. It gave an excellent description of physical therapy and the different types of CP. It was a very informative book and I was impressed with the author's strong knowledge base and literary references. However, I was perturbed by the author's saying she would rather have Jimmy (the husband) than the two girls (Marie and infant Karen). The other thing that bothered me was when the author told Karen, then 6, who understandably was tired during one of her intense therapy sessions that &quot;God loved her so much he wanted her to suffer like Jesus.&quot; As a cradle Catholic, I just can't let that go unchallenged. God does not want anybody to suffer, His own begotten Son or any of His other children. Karen unfortunately suffered some sort of brain damage in utero (most likely) that resulted in cerebral palsy. She was well provided for -- she had a literary mother who made her famous, she had superior intelligence, she had loving siblings and a passel of pets. She was lucky in that she had a doctor who went to bat for her at an early age by recognizing her intelligence and telling her parents that she &quot;needed help and a great deal of it&quot; and for providing the Killileas with options to have Karen treated for C.P. (God bless that doctor)! In response to Karen's understandable displeasure with the button boards and her physically grueling routine, instead of telling her God wanted her to suffer (which certainly does not do a service to God), it might have been better to say that &quot;God is working with you and you have made a lot of improvements. Let's pray together for more improvement, or let's pray together for good work,&quot; or &quot;God is cheering you on! He had helped you come this far. Keep up the good work.&quot; My favorite uncle used to ask God to bless his work (he was in the construction and real estate)and this wonderful man really taught the faith in a loving and humane way. He really lived it in the kind way he treated people and in the respect he afforded people in his interpersonal and business relationships. He, of all people would be among the first to suggest that praying for &quot;good work together&quot; or for a general blessing would be advisable. That one part notwithstanding, it was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have only read Karen but I would like to read Wren and With Love From Karen.

This book was the warmest, most honest account of a families courageous, and all too human struggle to understand, cope and champion their childs condition, to not accept the grim reports of doctors, to meet the challanges of everyday life and most especially it is a story about the stength, courage and determination of a little girl who shows us that most of the things we complain about, are really trivial in the whole scheme of life. After reading this book, one feels inspired to be stronger, to do better and to try and make a difference. But as others have said, I have searched for information on what ever became of Karen in her adult life. I feel that I was left hanging by this mezmorising story. I want to know more, as in all these years, I've never forgotten Karen. If anyone, knows what ever became of Karen, PLEASE email me and share it with me. Thank you"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"There is an online group of Killilea family fans who has done some searching on what happened to this amazing family...Marie (author) suffered from lung cancer and had a lung removed in the eary 1970s. Miraculously, she survived for 22 more years and died in 1991 at age 78 of respiratory ailments.She was survived by her husband, Jimmy; unfortunately, he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and died two years later in a nursing home in Connecticut.Gloria Lea passed away in Nov. 21 and was survived by her husband, Russ, and two sons. Russ passed away just three months later. Their daughters, Mary and Evelyn, were tragically killed in a housefire in the late 1960s at the ages of 7 and 9.Marie's married name is now Irish, and she lives in Connecticut. Apparently, she visits Larchmont periodically.Karen lives in Westchester County and works for a retreat center for priests.Rory Killilea was last living in the Seattle area.Kristin Killilea Viltz was last listed as living in Tarrytown, NY."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read Marie's children's book, &quot;Wren&quot;, while in about second grade. I started reading &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; when I was about 10. Now I've read each of them at least 6 times!The books influenced my life in many little ways, and in some big ones, too. With little or no religion in my childhood, I found the references to their strong Catholic faith somewhat mysterious--but it taught me some Latin! Now I am a Catholic, imagine that. I much enjoyed the passages about Karen and the Newfoundland dogs, our family is on our second Newfy. Additionally, I learned about courage, faith and determination, and the lessons remain with me today.A note about the family, one of my Newfy contacts mentioned meeting Karen at a dog show a few years back, and that she was in good health. She no longer had Newfies, but another smaller breed (can't remember what). Both of fher parents are deceased, but no mention there of a divorce. Also, I hear that Karen works at a religious retreat not far from Sursum Corda, the family home on Long Island, I believe it was. She is a very private person, understandably. I hope she knows how many people read or heard her story and were inspired by it!!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this the first time as an adult. I had asked a librarian if she could recommend a good heartwarming book, and she insisted this was what I needed to read. It instantly became one of my all time favorites. The main reason I wanted to review it here, is I notice so many fellow readers complaining about the mother's approach to her daughter's disability, etc, and I want to point out,when Karen was born, the world was a different place entirely. 'Political correctness' had not been coined yet.Smoking was not recognized as the evil we now think of; in fact, it was common for doctor's to smoke in their offices with their patients. Mother's were not told to quit smoking because they were pregnant. I could go on, but my point is, for the time in our history when Karen was a child, there was no Disability Rights Act. The idea to treat a disabled child with dignity and equal rights were sadly un-common, and this is not the fault of Karen's family. Like all of us, they did the best they could with what they knew how to do.I think all this P.C. talk is taking away from the underlying feeling of the book. It is a triumph of the human spirit and I see that so clearly and am left feeling good about the strength and courage inside of us that we don't know is there, unless we are forced to summon it, or learn about someone like Karen, who had no choice but to live life the best she could.I am not condoning smoking or other bad choices mentioned in the book. I am simply attempting to suggest that if that is all you are looking at, you are missing the boat.This is the kind of book that I love most; it makes me laugh and cry and most of all, it is the kind of story that makes me realize how small most of my problems are.It brings to mind other humbling people such as Helen Keller. It may not be an equal comparison, but the feeling I derive from it is the same."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Upon reading some of the other reviews I was surprised to see that this book is/was considered a book for younger readers. I have a 2 1/2 year old son who has cerebral palsy (the same type as Karen, but not as involved) and this book was given to me by a friend. I found it fascinating--both the way that Karen's parents learned to work with her and the things that Karen accomplished. Given the historical timeframe, I was not bothered by the fact that they smoked as some other people were. Having gone down this road myself, I cannot imagine what these people went through with virtually no resources, help or information available to them. Marie's story is so real to me and both heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time. I would recommend this book to people to help them to understand what my parenting experience has been like (on a different scale of course--I'm not starting from scratch). A great book!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have read \\"Karen\\" a number of times since my teen years, though prior to purchasing the book, it had been at least 10 years since my last reading. This story of a girl born in 1940 with cerebral palsy -- and all the trials, tribulations, and stigma that went along with its diagnosis, treatment, and daily living at that time -- remains intriguing and engaging.More than simply an eye-opening account of life with a severely disabled child, \\"Karen\\" is a window into another era, even another culture (the story takes place in the well-to-do suburbs north of New York City). The Killilea's were a devoutly Catholic Irish-American family. This is before Vatican II and the changes it brought to the Mass and to the church itself. Smoking was socially acceptable, its health risks not well-consdidered. These things all play into the story.I feel compelled to address Marie's (author/narrator) comment, during her husband Jiimmy's serious illness, that she would sacrifice her children. I believe other reveiwers have mis-interpreted her remark. She wasn't minimizing her love for her children; she was expressing her extraordinary love and devotion to her husband. Again, remember that the book was written in 1952 and should not be judged as if it had been written in 2006. Language, customs, beliefs, and even our culture were significantly different.In summary, \\"Karen\\" is a fascinating story. Should you take everything in it at face value? No, of course not. Is it worth reading? Absolutely, if not for the day-to-day details of life with cerebral palsy, then for the window into life in suburbia in the early 1950's.It is also worth noting that Marie Killilea was instrumental in founding United Cerebral Palsy, the organization that still advocates for and supports the cerebral palsied today."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"&quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; changed my life...sounds corny, I know, but true nonetheless. I first became acquainted with &quot;Karen&quot; as a bewildered ten year-old whose parents were divorcing. Even though &quot;Karen&quot; had been published some thirty years prior to the day that I first picked it up as a little girl, the book struck a profound chord within me that still resonates today.In searching for a common reason as to why these books continue to matter to so many people so many years later, the prevailing theme seems to be the against-all-odds humour that infuses the pages with such joy, and also a sense of &quot;connectedness&quot; to a family none of us will ever know -- perhaps a familial connection that some of us have found lacking in our own lives. The message of these books is timeless -- love your family -- work hard -- be good to animals -- help your neighbours -- be true to yourself -- and let God in your life.Like everyone else, I would love to know what Karen and the rest of the surviving family are doing now, but one suspects the reason for their silence may have something to do with a wish for privacy that should be respected. I know Marie has passed on, but I would like to thank her and the rest of the Killilea family for encouraging me and thousands of others. (and readers, if you can get your hands on &quot;Newf&quot;, it's a beautiful children's book that adults can love too!!)"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"There are hardly words to express how much the book -Karen- and -With Love From Karen- has touched and affected my life. I too, was surprised to see how many other people were affected by these books, since I never came across anyone who had read the books. I never could understand why more people didn't know about them. Marie wrote with such talent and brought the reader into the family and made you feel a part of it. You couldn't help but be touched by the family, faith and relationships within these books. What an amazing family. I just read a review that Jimmy and Marie were divorced...It really took me a back and saddened me very much. They held together through so much heartache, joy, family and triumphs, what could have been the situation that came between them. I too, would love to know more of what has happened to the rest of the family. Little Marie, Karen, Rory, Gloria and Kristen and their families. Also in one of the reviews it was mentioned that they thought in the book -With Love from Karen- that the younger Marie's experiences were glossed over, and yet Gloria's was described in such detail...that has always puzzled me too. If anyone has more info on this family please, please email me. It would be much appreciated!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I too, like the other reviewers read this book and With Love from Karen as a child thirty years ago. I have since reread it countless times and it never fails to inspire and move me. I cannot wait for my children to be old enough to read it as well. Isn't it such a moving tribute to the Killilea family that so many people so many years from its first publication are still so touched by this story. Wouldn't it be great for the family to be able to continue this chapter for us. I truly hope that they are happy and healthy. I just wish I knew what happened to them. I contacted United Cerebal Palsy and no one has heard of Marie or Karen which I think is a disgrace since they blazed the trail for education and support for so many families."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I loved the Karen books as child; Karen was my favorite real-life heroine, next to Anne Frank. Now I am the mother of a disabled daughter and I haven't thought of Karen and her family for years. She was mentioned in conjunction with a group home and this brought back memories so I did a search on Karen, Well, the Cerebral Palsy Society has a news story on its website covered the news up-to-date of the Killilea family. Some are gone now but the news of the very nice and inspiring family is good to know. So search and ye will find."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I, too, have loved this book ever since I read it. I think it's wonderful, and really captivating, as well as informative. It may seem a little outdated at first, but it's a good way of realizing how disabilities were dealt with in the early part of the 20th century. It's very well written, and if you haven't read it, I think you'd find it interesting and a good read.I have discovered a little of what happened to the Killileas(...)in fact, Jimmy and Marie were not divorced as many think."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"After reading the book, &quot;Karen,&quot; I was so enthralled that I read the book aloud to my physically handicapped son who only wanted to read photography and computer manuals! The humor was so warm and delicious. I've always wished I could have been the type mother, as was Marie, who would actually *wear* the outrageous jewelry her children gave her! I even began to read anything that author Jean Kerr wrote because she was a neighbor to this family. As most other readers have acknowledged, there was a sense of belonging to that large, loving family and it evolved into an urgent quest for more information about them. About 20 years ago, actor Pat O'Brien (Uncle Pat) and his wife, appeared in a local theater production. I sent a note and asked to meet them. They were most gracious and shared that they had kept in touch with the Killilea family. I truly, truly regret to say that Marie and Jimmy were divorced by that time and Marie was suffering from some form of cancer. Karen was still living and, of course, was an adult woman. How I wish there could have been a more happy conclusion to my search for information, but we must not let the lack of ideal endings detract from the absolute beauty of that book and those lives. I hope this classic will continue to be read and appreciated for decades to come."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book remains a classic of Eisenhower-era nonfiction. Marie Killilea's lyrical memoir transports modern readers back to the days when smoking was socially acceptable, Catholics heard mass in Latin, and milk arrived in bottles on the doorstep. But, with Karen leading the charge, it also tackles more timeless themes. Ultimately, it's a clear-eyed record of the triumph of a little girl who, with the support of her family, met the challenge of cerebral palsy successfully. If you have this disorder of posture and movement, or want an uplifting read, look for this book in your local library. You won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"My wife had read &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; and the sequel &quot;Karen&quot; about thirty years ago. She was so enthralled and enthused by the stories and Marie's style of writing she almost demanded I read them also. I was in the midst of a college engineering course of study, and reading anything that didn't discribe &quot;Statics&quot; or &quot;Dynamics&quot; was out of the question. However, when I did pick these books up in mid semester I found a &quot;Dynamics&quot; that far exceeded anything I had ever seen in Engineering. These are true stories of women involved in living life's challenges with courage and finese that is rarely seen today. Karen and her mother are truly women for the Age. This is a must read for any one who needs to have a cold splash of water in the face and start their journey into the first day of the rest of their lives. It is a fresh, vibrant romp through the problems we all face in one way or another but are afraid to admit to. Karen and her mother make the impossible seem easy, if just taken one day at a time. They are not super human just human in a super way. If you want the end of your day to be better then the begining, start reading these books today. I am now in the medical field and a day doesn't go by that I don't think of Karen, and her mother Marie Killilea."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a wonderful story of a family dealing with a handicapped child and the struggle to get her the help she so desperately needed. It is full of humor and pathos - but it will surely bless the reader as the author takes you into her family and their lives.

Excellent book."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"25 years after reading it, this is still one of my favoritebooks ever and I am trying to find a copy of it and the sequels togive to my daughter! This book had such an effect on me that whole phrases and lines of it are still contained in my memory! Please someone e-mail me if you know what happened to Karen and her family! This should be a People Magazine follow-up story, they write about everyone else!

I did- that year, and straight through High School. Karen was once of the reasons I became a Special Education teacher. And her desire to go to school just like her friends and siblings is why I work in inclusion settings. This book was so meaningful in my life! I just finished an incredible year with a 7 year old who has Cerebral Palsy as a member of my First Grade Class. I recommended this book to his family, and was so disappointed to find it is out of print.

My fifth-grade teacher, Mrs. Allen, took it away from me because I was reading during spelling or social studies. The very next weekend, I bought another paperback copy at Woolworth's and kept that one hidden inside my textbooks! Like other reviewers here, I reread the book often as a young girl. In retrospect, I think it was the depiction of a happy family that most moved me. However, as an historian I have developed a professional focus on children with special needs and think that &quot;Karen&quot; must be one of the reasons. I join you in urging publishers to reissue this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"On Oct. 25, 1999, I wrote a review of the wonderful book,&quot;Karen.&quot; I shared that I had met the actor Pat O'Brien (Uncle Pat to the Killilea kids) and had been told that Jimmy and Marie were divorced. I now know that he was referring to young Marie, but only found out for sure within this past month. Because of these online reviews and the fact that some had left their e-mail addresses for contact, a group of us formed a bit of a &quot;fan club,&quot; have been together on a Yahoo site since Oct. 29, 1999, and now have a membership of over 600! It is there that we have discovered a variety of information and have become friends as well.

It is a wonderful story of Karen and her family, back in the '40's when correct diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy was almost unheard of. Someone posted in the review section regarding Marie and Jimmy Killilea getting divorced over 20 years ago. Well, I did a bit of research of my own and found Marie and Jimmy's death records online. Marie died in October of 1991, Jimmy in July of 1994. It says his marital status at time of death is &quot;Widower&quot; (she died before he did). Under 'Name of Spouse' it says &quot;Marie Killilea&quot;. Also, I checked out the updated Forward to my 1993 edition of &quot;Karen&quot;, and Marie mentions going to the Bronx Zoo with Jimmy and their grandson Jason, in 1981. I have no idea why someone would say they were divorced; perhaps Pat O'Brien was confused at the time. Best to check resources carefully."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Received the book quickly, gave it to my student teacher as a gift. It was a great book for me to read way back 45 years ago! Wow! I wanted to share it with a really outstanding future teacher.

I found several sellers who offered what looked like good copies; but decided to email them to ask if spine and binding was secure so my daughter could easily handle the book. Only one seller got back to me right away-she answered the question as honestly as she could but it satisfied me, and that is why I chose to purchase fromt them. I chose right!! The book arrived well before the promised date and was in even better condition than I had hoped! Thank you Amazon and Atlanta Books!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Like many of you, I loved this book as a child, but re-reading it in 2004, what jumped off the page to me was how much everyone smoked.While Marie is recovering in the hospital from the birth, she lights a cigarette. When they take baby Karen to the doctor, the doctor lights a cigarette, and then offers the cigarette box to the Killileas.I know this was in 1940, but still, it was disturbing, given that we now know smoking causes premature birth, and may well have led to Karen's CP.I would still recommend this inspiring book, but if I gave it to a child, I would have a talk with them about smoking first, since this family is supposed to be role models."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Christopher Reeve died three days ago, which caused me to wonder whether quadriplegic former skier Jill Kilmont was still among the living, which brought me to someone's post in which she said that Jill's story reminded her of Marie Kililea's \\"Karen.\\" My recognition of the book was instant. I then read these reviews with interest. So this is the book in which a loving mother said she'd not hesitate to choose her husband over her children--after all, she could always have more! To the saintly Marie Lyons Kililea, children were as fungible as furniture. I've remembered for thirty-five years that some mother felt that way; thanks to another reviewer of this book, I now remember just where I read it. Other memories of \\"Karen\\" flooded back as I read over these reviews; a desire to re-read the book and its sequel did not. I remembered the train trips to doctors, Karen's two enema bags, her mother's smoking (and her being told at some point, even in those distant days, that she thus might have caused Karen's paralysis), Karen's final choice of the wheelchair over the appliances she needed to walk. A story that lingers so long in the memory cannot be without value, and Mrs. Kililea was not without gifts as a writer. So why only two stars? When I was nine, Karen, plucked off the library shelf because she shared my name, irritated me because she charmed and was loved by everyone, as I, bookish and introverted, did not. Thirty-five years later, deeper reasons not to recommend the books occur to me. The Kilileas inhabit a world without moral subtlety. Everything is either black or white; every dilemma is resolved by submission to dogma and orthodoxy. Age nine is too young to read of mothers who'd gladly sacrifice the children for hubby, who lecture their suffering children that God wants them to hurt, whose beloved niece saves herself, waiting patiently, until \\"Rome says yes!\\" and her swain is released from his marriage, over legally for years with a divorce, by a Church annulment. Nor would I present either \\"Karen\\" or its sequel to a child with a disability. Not only would I not want to suggest to her that she must suffer gladly as Jesus did, but I would not want her to feel that she must shoulder the burden of setting everyone around her at ease with her handicap. Not everyone, whole or crippled, is born with Karen's gifts. So to whom, if anyone, would I recommend this story? Certainly only to someone who's seen enough of life to take \\"Karen\\"'s message of sweet submission to the divine will with a grain, or more, of salt."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I picked up this book in a library toss bin recently and foolishly (not realizing it was out of print) left it on the airplane for the next passenger requiring inspiration. The many 5-star reviews should give an objective reader a clue as to the type of book this is, and the type of writer Killilea was--and that does NOT mean Jane Austen. Because I am something of a 3-star Sally in my reviews, I must add that my usual complaints (poor writing, confusing organization, insufficient editing) are not my reasons for faulting this book. It is fairly well-written (back when editors were editors!), with the insousiance that pervades works by well-fed, country club ladies of the 1950's (Jean Kerr comes to mind) who bore none of the crosses feminism would later burn figuatively on their expansive front lawns.My beef about this book--please do NOT send me nasty e-mails!--is that I did not find any of the characters, and I include the title character and the author, particularly appealing. As to Karen herself, she was a little girl undergoing a particular education regimen. It was rigorous and stressful, and, being a little girl who, like most little girls, wanted desperately to please those whom she loves, she survived it. But living to tell the tale is not the same as heroism, though nowadays you would never know it, and if Oprah were interviewing Homer about Troy, we'd be listening to the story of Aeneas rather than Hector. I doubt that Killilea's intention was to raise her daughter to a pinnacle, though, and anyone who views the child's story as a triumph over adversity is misreading the book. I believe that Killilea's point was that Karen's story could be ANY child's story, given the same set of favorable circumstances.So, having attempted to view the author's intentions in a light most sympathetic to me, I sadly must now add that I really didn't like the author ONE BIT. She represents a type of unquestioning, anti-intellectual, rigid Catholicism that makes it hard for other Catholics to be Catholic. Since she flaunts her Irishness, I feel free to whack the ball back into that court by saying that the Italians where I grew up in New York thought people like the Killileas were crazy. I do not know how many Roman Catholics she and her ilk have caused to lapse over the decades; any healthy religion has a spectrum of levels of dogmatism, but this particular group seemed to dominate the Church in New York for a long time (if you think I lie, check the list of bishops in the NYC archdiocese even now).But I should not air this dirty laundry online! And I should not let my intellectual response to the book be colored by the fact that I now am sojourning in a city that gives full testament to the Catholic Church's exhuberance, wackiness, theological depth, and sensual excess. Killilea was probably an above-average product of her isolated little smoke-filled (literally as well as figuratively!) caucasion world. (I normally make my home in the Baltimore/Washington area, and found quite enlightening her descriptions of the people of color who carried the Killilea luggage on the way to Johns Hopkins Hospital).Speaking of smoke-filled: Amen to the reviewers who point out the frightening excess of tobacco-dependence. I do believe there was a point in the book in which the author and her husband sit around smoking in the same room where lay their daughter Marie, at that very moment suffering from some type of long-term lung failure. Excuse me? Is there a doctor in the house? (No, wait; the doctors were the ones offering cigarettes.) Maybe just someone with an inquiring mind? (See, it's getting back to the Catholic thing . . . . )"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens New Baby Book","review":"An old book we relied upon with our children, now 24 and 30.A vintage gift to our expectant daughter."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"Kate Stone is one of my favorite Civil War diarists. She is an admixture of a great privilege, passionate beliefs, lover of literature, keen social observations and amazing fortitude. Her Civil War was dangerous, turbulent and life changing.Brokenburn was a large plantation containing over 150 slaves in Madison Parish, LA. From 1862 on, it was in the center of the Union Army's fierce assault to gain control of the Mississippi River and divide the Confederacy in half. Plantations were commandeered and slaves were encouraged to revolt. The civilian population was helpless before the demands of military control. Madison Parish had a population of approximately 9,000 of whom 7,000 were slaves. After 1861, the Parish was emptied of able-bodied white men, most of whom had been sent to far-off Virginia and Tennessee, leaving none to protect the civilians.In 1861, Kate was 20 years old, her immediate future being beaus, courtship, and a gay social life before she settled down to become a proper southern matron. She was unsure whether this route was ideal, as she remarked, \\"women grew significantly uglier in wedlock and ignored and abandoned their former female friends.\\" This comfortable world was turned upside down, never to reappear again. With great enthusiasm and some trepidation, she watched her three older brothers go off to war. Her widowed mother made it clear that 14-year-old James was now in charge of the running of the plantation and the protection of the rest of the family. I was amazed at the serene assumption that a young teenager was thrust in this role, but it seems that was the custom of the times. If you had to grow up fast, you did. Yellow fever was a constant in the area, and longevity was not a norm. Both Generals Grant and Lee wanted their troops out of these areas during \\"the seasons of pestilence.\\" This was not to be, and both armies suffered devastating losses to disease. Kate treated the \\"fever season\\" as a fact of life, and planned around it with remarkable briskness.By 1862, the Stone family was desperate. The Federal leadership demanded that they stay on their property; yet there were serious slave insurrections that threatened the lives of the plantation holders. Those slaves who were not hostile were running off, and there was no labor to farm the crops. Many southerners could not believe that their \\"loyal\\" slaves would run away. Kate was not among them, saying, \\"If I were in their place, I'd do the same.\\" She was by no means sympathetic, just practical.The family finally escaped through the bayous in a rickety canoe with nothing, not even underwear, and finally made it across the border into Texas. They were refugees along with many other prominent Louisiana families. Kate was convinced they had arrived at \\"a dark corner of the Confederacy.\\" Upon noting the barefoot but hoop skirted frontier ladies, she sniffed \\"there must be something in the air of Texas fatal to beauty.\\"Kate agonized over the increasingly bad war news and was devastated by Lee's surrender. Kate is one of the most vivid, perceptive diarists of the Civil War. Her diary is one of social history, a time of calamitous change and invaluable for understanding this crucial time in American history. Kate is a natural writer and observer. A highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"Like Mary Boykin Chesnut, Kate Stone wrote her diary during the Civil War. They were both members of the slaveholding planter class and at the start of the war both were surrounded by servants who met their every need. But twenty year old Kate Stone's life would be more directly affected by the war. Her young uncles and brothers went to join up at the onset and before the war ended several were dead of injuries or disease. Kate Stone's Louisiana home was occupied by the Yankees forcing the family to flee to Texas. Both describe the deprivations of the war years, lack of shoe leather, lack of cloth and the unavailability of new books, and both were at times cheered by false reports of great southern victories. The two diaries complement each other."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"Kate Stone was 20yrs old when the war began. She was a very well educated young woman living on a plantation called Brokenburn in NE Louisiana with her widowed mother, younger sister and five brothers. Their fortune lay in 1260 acres of land, a large cotton crop and about 150 slaves. Kate began her journal in May 1861, when many young men were rushing to join the fighting before the war was over and they might \\"miss all the fightin\\". In the beginning, Kate's life was little affected by the war. It was not until fabric for her fancy dresses and things like tea, coffee and sugar became scarce that she was personally affected. But, life would become much harder than Kate could ever imagine. Not only were she and her family forced to leave the plantation, they were faced with having almost all of their slaves \\"running North\\", but they stole everything they could get their hands on from the old family home. ONE faithful old Negro servant knew where the family silver was buried and he guarded as much as he could and remained with the old homeplace until the end. On the run, Kate and her family went west - passing through Minden, La., my childhood home, and then on to Texas. It was in Texas that the real hardships were endured. Kate's writings are plain, honest and true. She freely expresses her feelings about the war and about slavery. Like many Christians, Kate was forced to taken an honest look at slavery as opposed to what she reads in the Bible - the two just did not mesh. Brokenburn is a great read. I found it difficult to put down and I couldn't wait to get right back to it. Kate is another journaler who should have been a \\"real\\" writer. Thankfully, the editors resisted the urge to change Kate's diary. It is presented as close to its original form as possible. I, personally, hate it when editors change grammar, spelling, etc., with the idea of making it easier for the reader. As \\"the reader\\" I much prefer the original text whenever possible. A GREAT READ!!!"},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"The Journal of Kate Stone records the Civil War experiences of a sensitive, well educated, patriotic Southern girl who was 20 years old when war began and was living with her widowed mother, five brothers, and younger sister at Brokenburn, their plantation home in northeast Louisiana. Beginning in May 1861, the Journal contains regular entries up to November 1865, with briefer sketches written In 1867 and 1868.In many ways the Journal is an apparently a civilian history during the great struggle. It discloses the rosy optimism at the beginning: the dogged determination as war brought shortages and news of defeats and deaths: the hazardous flight of Kate and her family to Texas before the invading armies and their plight their as refugees: the bitter acknowledgment of final defeat and the return to a home devastated by floods and ravaged by occupation troops: and lastly, the battle to stave off poverty after the war."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"One of the best Civil War diaries that I have read.

Kate painted such a vivid picture of her life - particularly easy to imagine for a person that has grown up in the South of today with the same geography and climate."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"Brokenburn is a wonderful account of the Civil War. Kate Stone provides a literate, expressive account of her family's series of misfortunes throughout the war, and plots the shift in mindset that overcame the Confederacy as the war dragged on. I'd suggest reading this even if you don't have any serious academic interest in the Civil War - it's incredibly relatable, well-written and honest. This book is a major source for a paper I'm currently working on, and while I read it mainly for the information inside, I grew to like Kate as her story went on. If it's any indication, I bought the book after finishing using it as a source, just so I can have a copy to read whenever I like. While many of her ideas and beliefs are outdated, she's an intelligent, kind girl whose life was uprooted unexpectedly, and following her through the turmoil of the war shows an incredibly resilient personality."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"I'm almost half way through this great book. As a born and bred Southerner, this book fascinates me. It gives a very realistic picture of life in the south as the war progressed.

I am very interested in the Civil War and seeing the war through the eyes of 1)a civilian and 2)a southern woman has add greatly to my knowledge base of this topic. I am currently reading non-fiction women's journals/diaries to do a comparison between how they are being presented to the reader in comparison to Lillian's Diaries: Whispers From Galena's Past which I had transcribed and had published through BookSurge earlier this year. I have several more years of diaries to transcribed and am looking for different ways to do that. I really liked the way Brokenburn took a grouping of days and combined them into a \\"short story\\" format. I don't know if Kate Stone actually wrote her journals that way, or if editor John Q. Anderson has just presented them that way but it t is a very good way to take out the repetitious statements that appear in almost all diaries such as \\"No news today.\\" or \\"The weather is warm.\\" which can take up so much space and usually are not of interest to the everyday reader. I also liked the footnotes added to Kate's journals which clarified a name, an event or a word that is no longer used today. This is a technique that I found very educating, make the journals an educational experience as well as an entertaining read. Despite the differences in time periods - 1861-1868{Kate's journals} and 1913-1919 {Lillian's diaries} I found the writing personalities and even some of the experiences of the two women similar. Brokenburn was easy and enjoyable to read....but leaves you with an desire to find her next journals."},{"Title":"Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1868","review":"In diary form...just not as good as expected.

On one page she describes the slaves sitting in the gallery in church in their gaudy finery and laments how the Civil War is going to put an end to such a delightful way of life. Later on she is incredulous at how she could have ever thought such a thing! Her consciousness is finally raised to the point where she realizes how grueling daily life was for the slaves, who weren't there for her entertainment (although in fact, they were) and not at all \\"delightful\\" for the slaves. Her mother was a widow who ran the plantation alone into substantial profits; there is an uncle who never worked (these people are quite wealthy) - an interesting peek into people who lived in a real \\"Gone With the Wind\\" existence. However the book plunges into panic and \\"survival mode\\" as the Union soldiers run them out of their plantations into Texas where they live in relative poverty. Very good book for people interested in how people thought and lived in other times."},{"Title":"The Cathedral","review":"An amazingly detailed and analytical description of a very beutiful place, Notre Dame de Chartres. Understand that the Cathedral Huysmans describes is true gothic architecture at its most extraordinary, and Huysmans really puts his heart into this work. The pages display Huysmans' knowledge of Catholic art, saints (especially martyrs), iconography, and, especially, Notre Dame de Chartres. Huysmans weaves into this the tale of Durtal, the decadent former Satanist now Catholic zealot, as he visits some pious friends in Chartres. Joris Karl's love for this magnificant building, combined with his dedication to realism, yields a compelling account of the cathedral. However, unlike La Bas, En Rade, and En Route, the plot line is somewhat thin, with Durtal coming in second to a building, albeit a beautiful one. Still it is a must read for any serious Huysmans fan, Gothic architecture aficiandos, or anybody who is visiting Chartres and really wnats to know what they're looking at. For contrast, read Au Rebouirs, an equally exacting description of Huysmans' decadent, misanthropic lifestyle and thought written 15 years earlier. Curiously, Huysmans' disdain for humanity at large shines thorugh, even in the Cathedral."},{"Title":"The Cathedral","review":"Joris-Karl Huysmans' \\"The Cathedral\\" is the third volume of his Durtal tetralogy (preceded by \\"La-Bas\\" and \\"En Route\\", and followed by \\"L'Oblat\\"). I have read that \\"The Cathedral\\" has been sold and used as a guide for visitors to Chartres cathedral, and the reader certainly gets a detailed tour of the site through the eyes and thoughts of Durtal, as well as additional commentary by the Abbes Gevrasin and Plomb. The description goes beyond the physical, and includes musings on the meanings and symbolism of most of the ornamentation and decoration of the cathedral (and cathedrals in general). Overviews of the cathedral's history, as well as an overview of the history of gothic architecture in France, are tossed in for good measure.After the cathedral itself, most of Durtal's attention is focused on the Virgin Mary, to whom he looks for aid with his current spiritual dilemmas. He also supplies the reader with a history of her manifestations in France and descriptions of the sites. Additional sections deal with the religious symbolism of plants, flowers and trees (as Durtal, Gevrasin and Plomb create a hypothetical botanical version of the cathedral), and of animals as well. As always, Durtal also contemplates religious art and the lives of miscellaneous saints.As can be imagined, this is sometimes tough reading. And the plot itself, you ask? The dramatic tension mostly consists of Durtal agonizing about the \\"dryness\\" of his faith, and whether or not this would be helped by making a retreat to the abbey of Solesmes (I won't give away his decision and spoil the ending). Durtal's point of view is both very French and very Catholic.So is \\"The Cathedral\\" worth reading? I think a better question would be if you enjoy the writing of Huysmans. If you read and enjoyed the previous two books, then odds are you will enjoy this as well. If you have followed Durtal's story thus far, then I would recommend this book, if for no other reason than to be able to read final book of the series, \\"L'Oblat\\", which is generally a better work. In my opinion, this book is the weakest of the four.If you are a stranger to the works of Huysmans, then I would suggest you start with \\"A Rebours\\" or \\"La-Bas\\" instead. If you are interested in Chartres cathedral from a viewpoint of pre-20th century French Catholic mysticism, you might find some enjoyment here. And if you want to know what St. Hildegarde has to say about the spiritual virtues of ferns, then this will be right up your alley. If you have no familiarity or sympathy with the Roman Catholic liturgy or hagiography, then you will be reading with something of a handicap.\\"The Cathedral\\" is not without its pleasures, and some of Huysmans odd detours can be quite fascinating. However, Huysmans continues to reference authors, artists and books that the reader would have either to have lived in 19th century France or been a member of a 16th century religious order to have heard of, as well as an assortment of more or less obscure religious figures and authorities. Also, the dramatic tension of Durtal's spiritual crisis in \\"The Cathedral\\" is nowhere near as intense, dramatic and moving as it was in \\"En Route\\" - he just seems indecisive here.The bottom line: \\"The Cathedral\\" is not for everybody. Caveat lector!"},{"Title":"The Cathedral","review":"This is the second to last book in the Durtal series, and describes that character's further aesthetic adventures. It is at once an awesome essay on the architecture of the cathedral and a loose story of Durtal's spiritual delimma. Few writer's have such knowledge in their work, and even fewer have been as inovative in their writing. To those who liked La Bas, The Cathedral is a must."},{"Title":"The Cathedral","review":"I love huysmans but I don't know if I will finish this one. it's pretty dull. I think the biography of St Lydwine is far more interesting, if you want to get into some of this late huysmans catholic mania stuff. en route is totally enjoyable as well. but the cathedral is pretty hardcore and dry."},{"Title":"Taxation of Estates, Gifts and Trusts (American Casebooks)","review":"This is an outstanding book. I teach a course for undergraduate and graduate business students to teach them how to naviate the gift and estate tax waters.

This is not just a reference book, it is a wonderful winding adventure through the African bush. It combines the charm of the charismatic mega fauna, (lion leopard elephants etc.)with the wonder of the often ignored, smaller superstars of the savannah scapes. Peter Apps writing is accessible and authoratative and he gives new insights into the private lives of many facinating creatures. The real cudos however, undoubtably go to Richard du Toit who must be one of the finest wildlife photographers working today. His pictures are fresh and inspiring and he manages to capture behavioural moments that regularly escape the eye of even the most experienced photographers. Richard shows an intimate understanding and clear passion for bushveld beasts. Perhaps the greatest thing about his pictures is that he never overlooks the little guys who invariably add originality and interest to every frame. Creatures of Habit is both informative and highly original. Top marks to Richard du Toit and Peter Apps!"},{"Title":"Fantastic Flights: One Hundred Years of Flying on the Edge","review":"We checked this out for our 4 year old and ended up buying it as we checked it out sooooo many times from the library.

I recommend the book for every manager who wants to sharpen the focus of their team, and for \\"anyone who aspires to leave the world a better place.\\""},{"Title":"Ten Commitments for Building High Performance Teams","review":"Reviewed by Cherie Fisher for Reader Views (1/07)The \\"Ten Commitments for Building High Performance Teams\\" has lots of valuable management advice packed into 82 pages. Tom Massey, the author, heads each chapter with one of the 10 commitments needed for building a successful team. The author promises in the introduction \\"The ten commitments outlined in this book will help you get the right people in the right positions to develop a focused, values driven, high performance team.\\" Massey asks you to read the book all the way through and then read each commitment separately and incorporate it before moving onto the next commitment. Each chapter also has a practical applications section that includes questions and activities pertinent to applying that section.The 10 Commitments are as follows:1. Commit to getting the right people \\"on the bus.\\" Take the time to really think about the qualities, skills and needs that each job requires before making the hiring decision.2. Commit to getting everyone on the same page. A team can only be effective if it's has a common goal and vision.3. Commit to creating a learning environment. Investing in your team can create an environment that will lead to success.4. Commit to sharing the profits and losses. A team will feel vested in a business and strive harder when they can also enjoy the profits.5. Commit to turning around poor performance. Poor performance has to be turned around or it can bring down the whole team.6. Commit to dancing with \\"those that brought you.\\" This is very important chapter on loyalty - yours, as well as the team.7. Commit to playing to win. You have to be able to move your team through fear to develop a winner's attitude.8. Commit to growing through adversity. Conflict is a part of team work. Accept it and teach your team to work through it.9. Commit to having fun. High performance teams typically have high productivity, creativity and morale. The bottom line is they have fun.10. Commit to playing large. It has to be more than just a job for a team to be successful. Give them purpose.The book is written in a straightforward common-sense approach. I highly recommend \\"Ten Commitments for Building High Performance Teams\\" for those of you in management or contemplating going into management. I plan to immediately implement these commitments into my team at work.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The Web Hosting Manager","review":"I agree with reviewer Maggin and am astonished at the number of great reviews for this book. The author's friends? Any adult could write most of this book off the top of her head. Where to get funding: personal funds (DUH!), the bank (DUH!). How to fire an employee? Sigh. This is generic stuff, most is not about web hosting in particular. Same with suggestions for advertising. Maybe if you are a person with zero business experience you will benefit from some of the generic advice, but you'd do just as well with a book from your local library about starting a business in general. I returned this book in the next mail."},{"Title":"The Web Hosting Manager","review":"Essentially the point of this book is to assert that hosting web pages for yourself and your friends creates its own secondary income streams. This book, for example, which the writer self-published and marketed through Amazon. It's encouraging to learn that self-publishing is actually a relatively worthwhile pursuit here in the twenty-first century, but it's not terribly useful to someone looking for a nuts-and-bolts account of web-hosting -- which is ostensibly what the book is about. Rah, rah, Chris; thrilled to hear it's working out so well for you, but I've got a life too. See you around."},{"Title":"The Web Hosting Manager","review":"I considered The Web Hosting Manager to be a fantastic book, especially for those just beginning in the web hosting business - or for those who need to remind themselves why they're in the business. The information does not get too technical (I consider this to be a good thing), and grammatical errors run rampant (I consider this to be a bad thing. Ok, so I'm a writer and kind of freak out about that - most folks probably wouldn't notice.). This book holds a great wealth of information.The book starts off by detailing the costs for getting started, and the exact actions to take. It does a superb job of guiding one along from wanting to start a business to actually getting the startup process done. Everything is covered here - from legal to reseller accounts and more. One thing I liked about this book was that it did not detail one hundred different ways to start - i.e. reseller account, dedicated server, own data center, etc. - Christoph Puetz, the author, realizes that most folks reading this book have limited funds and so want to startup as quickly, easily, and inexpensively as possible. Therefore, the book assumes that the reader will go with a reseller account, and everything from the beginning forward is based on that.This book evaluates typical competitors and typical customers, and also details financing, employment, pricing, and more. This section was extremely useful to me, as it helped me cement my business plan and actually feel comfortable with it when I was finished! Again, it does not go very in-depth into any of the subjects, but there is also not too much of a need to do so, in my opinion. I found the section about employee motivation to be particularly useful, as I am getting to the point where I will need to hire some folks, if I go after VC funding.The last section of the book deals with marketing. It is filled with many quite brilliant marketing techniques, and includes sections on business cards, AdWords, local marketing, and other proven techniques. Even if you buy the book only for this section, it is still very much worth the $20 or so you will pay.All in all (grammatical errors aside), this is an excellent read, and I highly recommend that every web host purchase a copy. It is the only book written wholly for the startup/small web host, and perhaps the only book that would enable these smaller hosts to become larger. It is the industry's one true \\"bible\\", and I recommend getting your hands on a copy ASAP."},{"Title":"The Web Hosting Manager","review":"I was looking for a book about web hosting, however, this provides little information.

He's fought to change his life of violence, against himself and against others who constantly drag him back into that world where death is quick and harsh, and respect only comes with a stack of greenbacks or at the end of a gun. In SIX EASY PIECES, Easy actually takes on seven cases filled with death and mayhem, the kind of life he's always known, while striving to hold his personal life together and making certain none of that violence spills over onto the family he's struggled so hard to carve out of the tapestry of tragedy that he has never been far from. \\"Smoke\\" begins with a phone call that tells him Mouse, the friend whose death he believes he caused and whom he has mourned for the past year, is still alive.

GONE FISHIN' is an exploration of Easy's early days and the violence that gave birth to the man he started becoming. Mosley has also written two volumes of short stories about ex-con Socrates Fortlow, ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED, ALWAYS OUTGUNNED and WALKIN' THE DOG. The author also writes science fiction in FUTURELAND and BLUE LIGHT. FEARLESS JONES introduced another detective duo that so far has only shown up in one novel. RL'S DREAM was a straight novel about the last days of a bluesman. Mosley has also authored nonfiction that includes WORKIN' ON THE CHAIN GANG and BLACK GENIUS.Fans of Easy Rawlins will fall right into this collection of novellas because the resonance of Easy's life and the tapestry of his person history-including his failings as well as his successes-holds true. Long-time readers will get the feeling he or she is revisiting a well-known friend in the middle of several crisis points that those friends have seen coming. If this book is a reader's first exposure to Easy Rawlins and the violent world of pre-Civil Rights Los Angeles of 1964, the introduction to the man, his family, his views of life (and yes, there is more than one) and the violent and mean streets he walks down comes in simple gulps that never impede the action or the emotions. Easy Rawlins is a real person in these pages, full of hope, fear, love and hate. He holds the burning brand of self-knowledge and knowledge of the world, while at the same time being confused by twists and turns he can almost see coming, and being hurt by the unfairness of life that he knows is there but can never truly accept. Mosley's execution of the stories is flawless, pulling the readers into Easy's world and life, into his struggles with outsiders as well as himself. The dialogue is sharp and true, of the street, of years of growing and learning and accepting, of the stations in life that men and women of all colors sometimes get trapped in, and of the trade-off they make with hope and dreams just to find a means to survive.SIX EASY PIECES is an excellent volume of crime fiction, of period noir, and of a man who is still yet growing and changing, still building himself while at the same time being broken and battered. New readers who enjoy the strong male characters of Robert B. Parker and James Lee Burke will find another author and voice to love and respect in these pages, and old readers will be visiting with a true friend they can trust and enjoy."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"I love me some Easy Rawlins! When Walter Mosley let loose another round with Easy I was there to pick up the pieces; Six Easy Pieces.Six Easy Pieces is a book of seven different stories reminding fans of who Ezekiel Rawlins is (as if we had forgotten) and what he does that makes us love him so. Mosley shows us a forty-four year old man who over time has become a senior janitor at Sojourner Truth Junior High School, a property owner, the father of two, and the lover of one. Despite all of that, each story has a friend needing his help and in spite of himself Easy ends up in the middle of all the action.Mr. Mosley moves Easy easily through the city of Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California. He is involved with a little bit of everyone doing a little bit of everything. In the story Smoke, Easy investigates arson at his school, in Crimson Stain he investigates the death of a prostitute who found religion, in Lavender he is chasing after a Black boy with his nose wide open behind a flirtatious rich White girl, and in Gray Eyed-Death his past comes bursting back on the scene with a vengeance. These are just four of the seven exciting stories.Easy Rawlins fans will enjoy this book because Mosley gives you small pieces of Easy and his friends in well told stories and good pacing to keep you reading until the end. This is especially good for those who want to satisfy a small itch but have limited time to read a whole Easy Rawlins Mystery. Those who haven't read Easy Rawlins Mysteries before will get recaps to bring you up to speed but will probably find yourself needing to read the other books to get a complete picture. (And that is not a bad thing.) Walter Mosley does it again and I just want him to keep doing it over and over and over again.KotanyaAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Fans of the Easy Rawlins Series will be thrilled with this collection of seven short stories, six of which were culled from previous works and one that is original. This collection of short stories are unified by several common threads. First, we have Easy's attitude of grief and guilt over the death of his friend Mouse. Second, Easy's relationship with his girlfriend, Bonnie, is on the rocks. He isn't sure if he is the man for her. Third, we find Easy's deep concern over his adopted son, Jesus, who has dropped out of school. Add all of those elements together and you have a novella with intriguing possibilities. The short stories stand alone but taken as a whole the reader sees another side of Easy.Although it was fun to re-read material published before, I had moments of disappointment with this volume. The constant repitition of facts that you already knew was an annoyance as you moved from story to story. In many cases the story ended to abruptly with you wondering how did Easy get from point A to point B so quickly? In truth I wished that this volume had been an entirely new collection of Easy stories and not just a compilation of older ones. Don't me get me wrong. The book is good but fans of Easy's deserve something new and fresh.Readers who are unfamiliar with Easy will find great collection for them to whet their appetites for more of his adventures. Those of us who are oldtime fans will like the work for its collector's value and will yearn for something new from the author's pen."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"The best thing about this book is the prose. The author has a fantastic style. This a magical book that adresses racism, betrayal, and dignity. It keeps you glued to your seat reading well into the night as you follow the protagonist, Easy Rawlins, as he discovers himself after a midlife crisis. Mosley has done it again! And I look forward to his next book. I hugely recommend this book, all of his books. And if you're looking for a few other great titles, look no further than these, Buckland's Hot List: most creative, The Butterfly: A Fable (Singh); most engaging, The Alchemist (Coelho); most interesting, Life of Pi (Martel); most enlightening, 9-11 (Chomsky); most thrilling, The Lovely Bones: A Novel (Sebold); and finally, the most creative, engaging, interesting, enlightening and thrilling book of all, The Little Prince (Saint-Exupery). These are the books I'd recommend to my family, friends, students, and wife. There are many more, trust me, but these are the first that come to mind (for having left an impact slight or proud as it may be). If you have any questions, queries, or comments, or maybe even a title you think I should add to my list, please feel free to e-mail me. I'm always open to a good recommendation. Thanks for reading my brief but hopefully helpful review. Happy reading. Donald S.

Mosley continues to stand out in contemporary crime fiction because the book(s) are equally as strong as a vivid portrait of being a black man in America. It's no contest that Easy is of the best drawn and fascinating caracters in literature today."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"This was a much welcomed gift to us Easy fans from Walter Mosley, Even though the stories were all published in reissues of his previous works, they seem to flow smoothly.

This is a must have for true fans, but WARNING; it will leave you ready for more."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"The seven short stories are definitely easy to read, and it's a pleasure to once more be in the company of Easy Rawlings. Here's a chance to finally find out what happened to Mouse, and to catch up on Easy, Feather, Jesus, and Bonnie. 6 Easy Pieces is not as engaging as the earlier books in the Easy Rawlings series; there is not the sense of place and time conveyed in those novels. Still, you won't be sorry you read this book, if you're a fan of Easy Rawlings."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"This collection includes one new and six previously published longish short stories featuring one of Walter Mosley's most fascinating characters, Easy Rawlins, a man who grew up more or less on his own and who has had his difficulties with the other side of the law at least partly because of his childhood friend, Mouse, who is a killer. He is, like Mosley's other character, Socrates Fortlow, trying to keep his life together in spite of the odds.He functions as a sort of unofficial detective who gets involved in the troubles of people who might not otherwise go to the police with their problems, and as such he serves a real purpose in this gritty urban scene. Of course, Easy has been the protagonist in seven Mosley novels by now. These short stories fill in some of the gaps in his life history and as such contain background and psychological material that I think would be important for readers of the novels."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"While these are seven (apparantly Mosley believes in overdelivering) enjoyable short stories, each in its own right, the overall story told in the series does have a couple of important developments here and make an interesting change of pace between the earlier and the later novels. I do have one comment and that isn't so much on this book itself as it is on labelling. The library copy I've read has an \\"African American\\" label on it, and I do wonder if designating the Easy Rawlins series as African American literature might not discourage many readers not acquainted with the series from reading it. While admitting that the label does fit, I feel the mystery designation is preferable. Be that as it may, the eries does portray the deveopment of inter-racial relations over a span of years, but this is better seen as a background to the mystery series.However yu lok at it, this is highly recommended, although I do suggest reading the earlier novels before tackling this collection."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"I love Easy Rawlins, his style and wit and go get itism.

Six of the tales were included one at a time with the recent releases of the first six Mouse novels. Yet in spite of the not long ago reissues of these tales, fans will relish seeing them along with one new story in this book though cost should be considered. As always the cast including the allegedly dead Mouse makes Walter Mosley's contributions so much fun to read.

The short stories stand alone, although there is a common thread that runs through them: the death of Rawlin's good friend (and earstwhile \\"heavy\\") \\"Mouse,\\" Rawlin's struggle to maintain a relationship with his wife (a flight attendant), his committment to his adopted children, and the daily struggles of an African-American man in pre-civil rights America.The mysteries each have a unique tenor to them - each case presents a different glimpse into the character, his world, and his moral compass. I particularly liked \\"Gator Green\\" (dealing with the wrongful arrest due to a theft and the masterful way in which Rawlins deals with racial intolerance of the time) and Amber Gate, perhaps the most \\"Hammet-esque\\" of the stories, given its resolution. That said, Walter isn't Hammet or Chandler; while I'll certainly give him another go (hisAlways Outnumbered, Always Outgunnedwas highly recommended to me), I think I'll give Easy Rawlins a rest."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Walter Mosley is a great writer, i have followed the Easy Rawlins series from devil in the blue dress. this book is a great sum up of the series to me."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"I didn't read the description carefully and assumed this was another Easy Rawlins novel. It is actually a collection of Easy Rawlins short stories, as the title hints.The year is 1964 and Easy is in his '40s now, with a full-time job as custodian at a public school. He is drawn back into the business of trading favors and unofficial detective work and once he starts, he can't stop during the course of these adventures. The stories are loosely connected, mostly by two themes: 1. Guilt over the death of his crazy friend Mouse, and the incredible rumor that he might still be alive. 2. Suspicion of infidelity by Easy's Stewardess girlfriend Bonnie.I like Mosley's novel-length stories better, but these did improve as they progressed. And Rawlins meets and reacquaints with some fascinating (or sometimes grotesque) characters along the way, just like the old days. I also liked the Easy Rawlins character better before he became so respectable with the full-time job, adopted kids (Jesus and Feather) and white picket fences. But he's still likable and has the same moral strength that always legitimized his extra-legal endeavors. This reminds me a lot of an anthology of Dashielle Hammett shorts I once read. About the same entertainment value."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Book was shipped promptly, received quickly, and arrived in excellent condition.Mosley, of course, achieved fame through his Easy Rawlins books, but he hasn't limited himself to these, and this book was a try atwriting Easy Rawlins material in short story form. The stories arefine, but they don't fully succeed because his characters and plotsare too complex to be fully presented in only 40 pages or so. Perhaps that's why he hasn't attempted this format since."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Such a great series of stories.

However, the CD's are very user-unfriendly. There is no way to tell where a particular story starts or ends. Most start in the middle of a disk with no audible chapter markers. If you import these into iTunes, you just get 7 chapters, broken up into about a dozen parts with great titles like 1a, 1b, ... 1m, 2a, 2b, ... etc. Not very informative or easy to use in a computer, car or player.Overall, I prefer the cassette tapes read by Paul Winfield. Better sound, better voice and a lot easier to use. It's actually easier to digitize from the cassettes than it is to import from the CD. That's not normally true, but in this case it is.Again, this are great stories and a good listen, but the product is poorly designed and hard to use."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Walter, you are a great writer and Michael Boatman is the BEST narrator.

In the case of Easy (born Ezekiel), Louisiana spawned a poor boy who fought his way of the roughest part of Houston at the side of his unafraid and murderous friend, Raymond Alexander (Mouse) via World War II, and then came to Watts where the only people he could trust were other African Americans. Hiding his good side, Easy did favors for people . . . and righted many wrongs in the process. This often placed him in a vulnerable position between the police who wanted to use him . . . and evil-doers who wanted to eliminate him. In the process, Easy emerged as middle-aged with two children he has rescued (Jesus who dreamily builds a sail boat and young Feather who goes to school), a little yellow dog, Frenchie, and Bonnie, a stewardess he has invited into their lives. Unknown to most, he's become a property owner building a future for his kids. In public, he heads the custodial staff at Sojourner Truth Junior High School. In private, he will right wrongs that others will walk past.These seven short stories capture Easy in transition while he tries to settle down at 44 in 1964. The first six stories were added to the reprints of Gone Fishin', Devil in a Blue Dress, A Red Death, White Butterfly, Black Betty, and A Little Yellow Dog in 2002. The seventh story is new with this volume.These stories deeply explore Easy's relationship with his friend, Mouse, Easy's family, his work, and a number of his friends. As background, Easy had asked Mouse to help him a year earlier. That help had led to Mouse being shot and carried off with no pulse by his wife, EttaMae. Easy has been searching for Etta Mae so he can pay his last respects to Mouse, but Etta Mae has vanished. Easy is also trying to decide how much of his heart he can share with Bonnie.In Smoke, the junior high school suffers smoke damage and destruction by the fireman who douse the fire from an arsonist's device. This attack on his authority in the community has to be addressed. And why does someone call him looking for Mouse?In Crimson Stain, Easy learns that a woman named Etheline Toms thinks she has seen Mouse. In tracking her down, he discovers a murder and travels between a house of ill repute and a church to avenge an innocent's death.In Silver Lining, Easy meets his new principal and an old friend needs help to rescue a missing person. In a dramatic climax, life moves on after justice is done.In Lavender, jealousy grabs Easy by the shirt-front when he sees a gift he wasn't meant to see. Etta Mae returns and demands that Easy repay her for the loss of Mouse by saving a young man who has walked into harm's way in responding to a woman's charms.Gator Green finds Easy sleeping in the living room . . . much to Feather's concern. Saul Lynx, one of the few white men Easy trusts, needs help in clearing his brother-in-law. Easy goes undercover to find a thief . . . and finds himself tempted by a wanton woman.An old acquaintance re-enters Easy's life in Gray-Eyed Death. Easy finds that a simple man from his childhood has been framed for a robbery and murder. Easy unravels what happened, but knows he cannot prove the case to satisfy the police. How else might justice be done?Amber Gate introduces Easy to the death of a young woman who has more friends among older men than most. His shoemaker asks Easy to clear his landlord, and Easy finds what he's looking for where he least expects to find it.Like all of Walter Mosley's writing about Easy Rawlins, these tales ring true, take us into the heart of another time and place we haven't experienced, and allow us to walk in another man's shoes in a way that leave us feeling the calling to reach out to others. Full of violence, these are really tales of supreme humanity. You'll be moved, and so you should be.Bravo, Mr. Mosley!"},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Walter Mosley is one of half a dozen detective novelists who are my favorites, who are in my opinion flat brilliant. He's written a number of Easy Rawlins novels, which are almost universally wonderful. This latest collection of short stories really works better as a novel with seven plots, but several background threads that run through the stories. One has Easy wondering if his friend Mouse is really dead, Easy having seen him get shot the previous year. Mouse's woman ran off with the body, though, and since Easy didn't see Mouse get buried, he's not entirely certain he's dead. Next we have a series of subplots involving Easy's family: his girlfriend goes to Africa as a stewardess and meets with royalty, his son has a boat, his daughter reads and goes to school. Lastly, he has subplots involving his work at Sojourner Truth Junior High School as a janitor, though of course since he's Easy there's more to the job than that.The seven pieces included in the plot involve a variety of different crimes. Murder, arson, blackmail, kidnapping, fraud, and murder again are featured. Easy has to dodge several women, bad men, and nefarious plots. Things are resolved and several characters from previous books appear (one dies), and the author moves things right along.I really enjoyed this short story collection. As I said, for the most part I think the stories work better together than apart, and I'm glad I read them as a collection."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"Six Pieces is a must get for any true Easy Rawlins fan. It has suspense Is or Isn't Mouse alive? It has drama What's going with Bonnie? This is a true wonderful book. No wonder Walter Mosley is my favorite author."},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"A now mellower Easy Rawlins has a stable job, a beautiful home, and a wonderful family. So by most people's standards, he should be content, but this is not the case for two particular reasons. First, he is still mourning the death of his best friend, Mouse, who was a staple in Easy's life. Secondly, since Easy is a man who craves danger, adventure, and the thrill of the chase, living a quiet, normal life is boring to him.As an easygoing man, he likes to help others, and when trouble comes knocking, he answers. The latest trouble surrounds a bomb that explodes at the school where he is employed. Easy's love for the children makes him determined to get to the bottom of things. But the bombing has a domino effect and as the events unfold, he is continuously placed in harms way. Easy faces a cast of original characters and some new shady and interesting ones, all of whom keep him on his toes.SIX EASY PIECES: EASY RAWLINS STORIES, Mosley's latest book, treats readers to seven different Rawlins' adventures, with Easy as the common thread. Mosley has a way of taking readers along on the adventures and this makes his stories even more interesting, and this one comes highly recommended.Reviewed by Simone A. HawksTHE RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Six Easy Pieces: Easy Rawlins Stories","review":"\\"Easy\\" Rawlins is a black WWII vet with a jones for the streets, but in SIX EASY PIECES he's gone straight more-or-less, working as supervisor of maintenance at Sojourner Truth High School. He's even got a family, two adopted kids he's rescued from abuse (Feather, a mulatto six-year-old and Jesus, a seventeen-year-old) and a live-in lover, but because of his street reputation people from the black community still come to Easy for help. Easy is not in it for the money; he truly cares about his people.The \\"six pieces\\" in the title are short stories revolving around the same setting. It's 1964 Los Angeles and Easy must take on cases the police disdain because they occur in a dangerous part of town. The first story \\"Smoke\\" deals with a smoke-bombing of Sojourner Truth, which Easy eventually traces to a gambling debt.Throughout the first several stories, Easy is haunted by his friend Mouse's murder. Easy feels responsible since Mouse was helping him on one of his cases. Easy has a feeling the notorious Mouse is still alive. Easy is also upset about his live-in lover Bonnie, a stewardess who may have had an affair with a black politician she met during a tour of Africa. Easy feels inferior to the man.Outside of Easy, Mosley doesn't have much of a flair for character development. Jesus works on his sailing boat; that's about it. Bonnie tries to convince Easy she still loves him. The plot lines of the various stories are rather pedestrian. \\"Amber Gate\\" is about the murder of a young prostitute; Easy takes the case as a favor for his shoemaker who promises him a new pair of shoes (worth $200) if he'll help prove a friend of his is innocent. Easy traces the crime to a hobo who hated black prostitutes who mess with white men. \\"Amber Gate\\" is unique in that there is no closure to the story.I chose this book because of the structure. I didn't really like the first Mosley book I read, but with short stories what's the harm? The same thing happened to me once with Ed McBain. I hadn't been impressed with the 87th Street novels until I read three of them, one after the other. Been hooked ever since. Not the case with Mosley."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"It's been just a month since my non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis became official, and two months since I've been aware of the strong possibility. Since then I've been engaged in a thorough search for information on the disease, and this is by far the most helpful book I've found. It was recommended to me by a good friend, who's also a lymphoma survivor - with about a year's more experience in traveling this road than I have. Written by a neurobiologist who contracted NHL herself, this book's got a powerful, one-two punch of personal testimony and very detailed medical information. Parts of it get a bit technical at times, but they're easily skipped over or saved for another day. (Better to have too much information than too little, I always say.)If you've got lymphoma, or if you love someone who has, get this book. It will become your handbook on understanding the disease, and dealing with it."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"Having read a number of books on lymphoma aimed at different audiences, I was leery of this book. Boy was I wrong - Living with Lymphoma is an excellent book filled with the information that patients, loved ones, and friends can use during diagnosis and treatment. Adler gives a personal touch from the patient perspective without making the book a personal journal and she does not skimp on the medical details you need as each type of lymphoma is different requiring different treatment details.While no book seems to click with every person, this book is:- Current as to treatments in use today, not in 1999- Aimed at a wide audience without skimping or overloading- Affordable compared to specialized medical textsIf you would like a modern, practical, and affordable book on Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, you should look at Living with Lymphoma first and foremost."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I found this book extremely informative. It is from a patients point of view and therefore very sensitive to the psychological element of dealing with the disease. The book is a one stop shop on Lymphoma for those of us who dont need all the medical jargon but would like to understand the words that are spoken to us by our physicians. I would highly recommend it to Lymphoma patients and to their families."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I still read a great deal about NHL, even though it's been over 15 years since i was diagnosed with stage 4 mixed small and large cell indolent lymphoma (to use the \\"old\\" terminology).

I wish this book had been available when i was first diagnosed. With my trusty reading glasses, i had no problem reading it and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"This book is everything it should be: well written, and even entertaining; thorough and comprehensive, but still clear and easy to understand; intelligently organized and easy to use. In the weeks after my lymphoma diagnosis, I found reliable answers to most of my questions here. Adler tells just enough of her own story to keep things interesting -- and unfortunately for her, but fortunately for the reader, she has been through pretty much everything, so she can speak about side effects, procedures, etc. from personal experience. I absolutely recommend it -- in fact, any new patient should get two copies, one for yourself and one for your care partner/advocate/concerned relatives. Then you can tell them to look up all their questions here!"},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"A wide range of library holdings will want to make this a basic reference; from public libraries to college health collections. Neurobiologist Dr. Elizabeth Adler was herself diagnosed with non-Hodkin lymphoma, and had to cope with the emotional stress of diagnosis and many new decisions. Her Living With Lymphoma thus comes from both a scientific and a personal viewpoint and provides consumers with excellent coping strategies. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I was very pleased to find this book which is not only easy to read (and I am extremely near-sighted) but very informative without going over my head. I think it does an excellent job of providing basic information about the biology of non-Hodgkins as well as the treatment options and personal impact of the disease. I am now nine years past a diagnosis of stage IV marginal zone NHL and six years past treatment with Zevalin. I wish this book had been available back in 1997."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I have heard my husband say to others,\\" I'm living the cancer and that is all I can handle. My wife takes care of the reading.\\" I'm in the process of reading this book, even getting up in the middle of the night to find an answer to a question that I might have regarding my husband's condition; he has non-hodgkins lymphoma. The book doesn't read like a text book, it reads as a first person account. The author diagnosed with this disease tells us what she went through, and has survived many years post-non-hodgkins lymphoma.....I had read portions of this book in the library, went home and ordered from Amazon.com....

This book tells current and factual information regarding diagnosis, signs & symptoms, side effects & treatment. When I can understand the diagnosis, I don't fear it. I would highly recommend this to anyone with any type of cancer, especially lymphoma. Judith Hafner"},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"This book is a terrific idea for individuals recently diagnosed with Lymphoma. It provides plenty of very useful and direct information that can help cancer patients make vital life-changing decisions. There is also a very useful glossary and index in the back."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I was hoping for a book that would give us more practicial information-as the title of the book, \\"Living with Lymphoma\\" implies I found most of it very difficult to understand and hard to read. In short the book is too technical for our needs. We just wanted to know, \\"What does this mean for us,' and \\" How can we best deal with the my husband's diagnosis of Lymphoma\\"? I was looking for something practically helpful and encouraging. If that's what you are looking forward this is not the book for you. However, if you'd like to know about T Cells, B Cells and how the cells connect, etc in a very technical manner, this might be the book for you.One big flaw is that the author, who was diagnosed with cancer again does not talk about the value of a solid support system. In these past weeks since my husband's diagnosis I don't know what we would have done without those who have gathered around us to support and pray for us, which helps us to be and to stay positive. If you are looking at this book because of a recent diagnosis I pray as you read this review God's presence and comfort will lead you to Him. Find a book that gives you hope you don't have to dig for in a way that comforts you and gives you practical advice about what to do and how to do it."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"This book was the best source of information for both my husband and I as we go through treatment. It answered questions and helped formulate others for the Dr. to answer. It is by my bedside everynight."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I read this book after I completed my last round of R-CHOP and sure wish I'd read this book before I had started my treatments! Even so, it is full of helpful information. There are lots of technical terms and complete sections that I just couldn't understand, but what I did read was informative. If you're looking for a book that will help you cope with a long term living with Lymphoma, don't buy this book. It's really more for how to cope with the treatments, side effects from the different forms of chemo, what to expect in the future, etc. The author, being a doctor, was certainly not very proactive about her illness until she found out that it was non-hodgkins lymphoma. All of her odd symptoms were misdiagnosed and mis-treated for quite a while before she was finally diagnosed accurately. This in itself is a lesson, but unless you have lymphoma, you wouldn't be reading this book, so it's not very helpful to the lymphoma patient except to show us that those in the medical field aren't perfect."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"Strictly as a resource, the book is okay, but I found much of it a bit deep in places and hard to follow. Since I was looking more for an alternative guide, this was not the book for me."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"The type style and font size make this book extremely difficult to read. If you are over 50, I would pass it by."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"This book was purchased as I was undergoing my own diagnostic procedures after MRI/CT scans showed probable non-hodgkins lymphoma. I appreciated the author's first-person perspective on her experiences, which helped to normalize some of my own. The book offers good, basic descriptions of many of the different lymphomas (lymphomi?) possible, and thoroughly describes the possible treatment options. I found her explanations of chemotherapy types very helpful, making the whole topic less daunting and scary. The chapters that included cell biology, immune system, & genetic basis for lymphoma were tough to read through--but I found these gave great background for understanding what my oncologist is thinking, where he is going with his recommendations, and makes me a more involved patient. This has really helped me to cope with these first weeks/months of my disease, thank you Ms. Adler!"},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"Dr. Adler's book is the best, by far, of all the popular books on lymphoma. It's informative and easy-to-read. If there is a term you don't understand, you can easily find the term explained with a simple Internet search. I am a lymphoma survivor since 2001. I gave away most of the other books on the topic--they were mostly diaries. Although interesting, the others don't match Dr. Adler's in content that helps one fighting lymphoma."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"This is the first book I read after being diagnosed with Lymphoma and still my favorite."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"Although there are a lot of technical/medical terms, I really enjoyed reading this book. I only wish it was available when I was diagnosed 5 years ago. The book helped explain some terms clearer than my doctors did, or maybe it was because I didn't have to try to remember everything, I could always go back and re-read a chapter or paragraph. I only hope my original treatment was sufficient to \\"cure\\" me and I won't need this information again in the future, but it is nice to know it is there and availble to me."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"Suddenly I wanted to learn a lot when my partner was diagnosed with lymphoma. This book truly helped and is my bible. Not too simple and not too difficult, it helped us make some informed decisions and to understand what was happening in the confusing world of chemo and beyond. Since the author faced this disease herself, it's very reassuring to hear her story because she is so open about all her fears and hopes. I wish her well and thank her for a wonderful, science-based, practical book that helped us sort things out."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"It has been over a year since I bought this book for a family with a person with Lymphoma. It was packed full of info, but as I recall, the print size was a little small for me. I'd just advise you to look at a page online, if small print might be a problem for you."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I found this book to be very informative and gave me more knowledge than I had. I wish had had found out about this book sooner. It had very good explanations of how the different combination of chemotherapy drugs work together.

It was nice to get information from someone who had the disease and been through chemo."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"I received a copy of this book from my Sister-in-Law who's husband, my brother, had also recently been treated for NHL.

I acquired a copy recently for a friend who had recently been diagnosed with Lymphoma."},{"Title":"Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide","review":"First of all, this book is a good help for people going through everything involved with lymphoma. Unfortunately the author was, in parts, writing to professionals who already know as much if not more of the disease than she does. This is not a book to read, but a reference - a good one - for what to expect at certain stages of the disease and how it may be handled. Reading it cover to cover is nearly impossible, there is just too much information."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"This is a terrific, fun book. It's packed with scary stories about the myriad ghosts who haunt the old plantations in Louisiana. Jill Pascoe, who lives in Louisiana, writes about strange happenings in The Myrtles in St. Francisville, Oak Alley in Vacherie and Chretien Point near Sunset and many others, including some plantations that have burned down. Several stories of haunting by those long dead are genuinely creepy. The thirteen chapters key on individual plantations, except for the last about burnt plantations and the forlorn spirits who wander the ruins. The author anchors the ghost stories within the history of each plantation and often a reader will feel transported back to an age of lively grand houses with sweeping lawns and towering live oaks. Some of those people from long ago never left their plantations and continue to disturb the houses and grounds. Pascoe also writes about her personal and scary encounters with the spirits. The book is a grand read!"},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"In the mood for a ghost story or two? Louisiana's Haunted Plantation has a few stories and more. This is a well researched book that provides a great look into the past and the present of the haunted plantations in Louisiana. Taking safety into her own hands, Jill Pascoe, gives us some first hand accounts of the plantations, and their mysterious goings-on. But most chilling are the interviews with the people who work and live at the plantations.Each chapter focuses on a single plantation with an excellent blend of history, architecture and narrative. The black and white photos of the plantations help realize the vivid images painted by the words.After finishing the book, I found myself wanting to visit the Louisiana and some of these plantations. Although, I might not have the courage to stay overnight at some of these places. The book provides great contact information for each of the plantations including websites.After you've read the book, I recommend taking a careful look at the front cover...Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"If I were a ghost I don't think that I could find any better place to haunt than a spooky old Louisiana plantation house. Apparently there are several spooks who agree with me because according to this very well written book there are ghosts aplenty in these antebellum mansions. Not only are the locations discussed in this book haunted, but they are more often than not haunted by several spirits. No rundown old Victorian houses for these ghosts for they seem to enjoy the finer things in life, or death as the case may be.Jill Pascoe has done an excellent job of putting together a fine collection of ghost stories from the old plantation homes of Louisiana. Her writing style is very pleasing and I found that I zipped right through this book and I finished wanting more. The author hits a very good balance between the history of the haunt and its home and very recent eyewitness accounts which come straight from the witnesses themselves. All too often these books lean so much on history and legend that they have no credibility because no living person who has experienced the ghost is consulted. Sometimes however, the pendulum swings the other way and there are numerous accounts from recent eyewitnesses but the ghost or location is given no historical treatment at all. This of course leaves the reader wondering why this ghost haunts the location in question and who might this spirit have been in life. Pascoe, in her first book has accomplished a balance that many veteran ghost authors haven't achieved after numerous books.It is refreshing indeed to find an author in this genre who takes her work as seriously as this one does. She does not treat this like it is a college literature folklore assignment but instead seems to be very much in tune with her subject. She even has some experiences of her own while visiting the sites she writes about. It adds so much extra flavor to this type of book when the author actually visits the sites they are describing but all to few make this effort. On top of all this, she has taken the time to include the contact information for the sites discussed, including web sites. Since many of these plantations offer overnight accommodations, she has even made the effort to list the most frequent disturbances in each available room so you can decide whether you want to feel something snuggling up to you during the night or would rather just see an one armed specter. This is the perfect book for those who like to visit and stay in haunted houses. I am one of those people but unfortunately my wife is not.The only drawback I found was the author's all too detailed description of the architecture and furnishing of the homes. I suppose this is to be expected from a museum curator but it left me a little weary at times. Other than this one little flaw I would have to say that this is one of the better ghost books I have ever read and if you are planning a trip to Louisiana this book is a must."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"If you are planning a trip to Louisiana to visit our beautiful plantations than this is the book to bring with you. It gives a brief history of each plantation and describes what ghostly activity has occurred within each one. I've been fortunate enough to visit a lot of the homes listed in this book and it covers things that the tour guides tend to miss. This is definitely a recommended read."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"I'm a plantation and ghost fanatic so this book was right up my alley. I only wished it had been longer and more pictures of the insides of the homes."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"This book was one of the best that I've read so far on Local Louisiana's Haunted Plantations by Jill Pascoe. Enjoyed it as I have been to many of these Plantations covered in this book. Well written & very Interesting and easy to comprehend. Would recommend this to anyone interested in local hauntings in Louisiana. Looking forward to other books that she may write."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"If you are looking for a very scary book, this is not the one. It does tell about ghost that are, and have lived at differant plantations in Louisiana. Most of the ghost are descibed as peaceful sprits that for some reason have decided to stay on at their earthly homes. I also enjoyed the history and the pictures that the author gives of each of these plantations. This is a very well written book, that I would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in ghost."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"As a lifetime resident of Louisiana, I have long loved the history of my state, as well as the superstitions that never die here. I am especially fascinated by the plantations and the stories of those that lived there. I was quite disappointed by Ms. Pascoe's book, as it completely failed to grab my interest or make my spine tingle. I spent much of the book wondering if the author was sponsored by the plantations, as the book reads like a brochure. Louisiana's plantations are well worth visiting, though some of the best ones with the most fascinating tales are left out of this book. However, I don't need a book of ghost stories to try to sell me on that. I would have enjoyed my read much more if it had focused more on the tales of hauntings and less on the available accomadations."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"Focuses most on the actual historical aspect rather than wild unbelievable ghost stories, which I appreciate. This has fueled my desire to visit Louisiana asap."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Louisiana's Haunted Plantations. I live in Louisiana and found the history of the plantations in general both interesting and informative. I enjoyed it and do not regret having purchased this book."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"We came back from New Orleans and had to learn everything about what we had missed. This book was good and had different hauntings we did not know."},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"I picked up my copy of this wonderful book at The Myrtles Plantation. It's neatly arranged with each plantation and its ghosts in a chapter of its own. What I really like is the directory in the back of the book giving the address and contact information for each plantation, something many books about haunted places fail to do. It's compact size makes it handy for taking with you when visiting these plantations and their ghosts. While a bit large for a pocket, it would fit nicely into a purse, an overnight bag, or a medium-sized camera bag. The type is large enough to read in the dark with a flashlight! Each plantation chapter has a photograph. The only thing lacking is a map of the plantations' locations, which would be a help when organizing a trip around these stately homes.The ghost stories are interesting and the abbreviated plantation histories add to the research. Comments on previous guests and their experiences only add to the book. While some of the plantations experienced minor damage from Hurricane Katrina, the vast majority of them are open and ready for visitors, so go, take this book with you, and meet the ghosts!"},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"IF YOU LIKE THE UNKNOWN YOULL LOVE THIS ONE IT IS VERY INTERESTING READING"},{"Title":"Louisiana's Haunted Plantations","review":"I bought this book for christmas for a friend and he loved it. The service and quality were great, I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Doug TenNapel's Gear","review":"This was the book that really hooked me on TenNapel's stuff. I'd seen and loved the Five Iron Frenzy covers, I was a big fan of The NeverhOod, and I enjoyed Earthworm Jim, but this was the first offering of his that was exclusively his. Even better, it was in my favorite format: the comic book.This collects issues 1-6 of the Gear comic series published by Fireman Press. The story concerns four (sort of outcast) cats from the armpit town of Newton . (If you're at all familiar with Doug's later work likeCreature TechorEarthboy Jacobus, you know that Doug has a particular fondness for small \\"armpit\\" towns.) These four cats are on a mission to secure a new Guardian for Newton. Guardians are giant piloted robots that each faction (cats, dogs, mantids) uses for the defense of its respective city.As the story opens, we are also introduced to the search for an apparently highly valuable and very powerful device mysteriously named \\"the Forbidden Mechanism.\\" Those seeking it seem to think it will grant great power to whomever possesses it.The story comes to a head when the true nature of the Forbidden Mechanism is revealed.The book is enjoyable on a number of levels. First, there is the pure aesthetic appeal. Doug certainly has his own style on this book. The artwork is purely black and white brushwork. He used a thick Japanese brush and a very loose brushwork to achieve an appropriate sense of energy. It can appear sloppy at times, but there is some very good illustration and cartooning to be found here. The character designs and some of the contrast-defined images are very impressive. If you were already a fan based on TenNapel's past work, you'll dig this. If you're only familiar with his human-based later work, I think you'll enjoy this different style.The story is great fun. It's cats vs. dogs vs. mantids...in giant robots. Revolvers vs. swords. There's even a bit of kung fu. The dialogue is hilarious. There are also some surprisingly poignant moments to be found throughout the story.This original edition is next to impossible to find, but fortunately Image released a new color version in January 2007 that is readily availablehere."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is my favorite book ever. I loved it because it was one of the most motivational books I have ever read, and the best part about it was its all true. I think everyone, not just athletes, can relate to Lance's life and in some way walk away from the book inspired in some way. It was also well written and very absorbing. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book several years ago, and was just looking it over again, thinking about selling it on Amazon. I decided not to, not only because I underlined several sections and wrote in the margins, but because I want to hold onto this book for inspiration when I need it. I also want my 12 and 15 year old sons to read this some day.Lance's fortitude in the face of adversity is inspiring. He does come off as a bit of a jerk and an egomaniac in several places--attributes I do not wish upon my sons--but I think they'll see that for what it is and still learn some great lessons from Lance.I picked up this book because I'm a cyclist and a big cycling fan. I wanted to see the inside story to Armstrong's incredible comeback. I got a lot more from this book. He's gut-wrenching honest. I'm also a writer and a reader, and I found this book one of the best-written books I've read lately.___Reviewer: Michael C.

However, I have always resisted buying and reading the book as I was 100% it would be nothing but posturing and self promotion........ BIG MISTAKE. The book is excellently written and there is almost an incredible lack of focus on his amazing capabilities as a rider and an athlete. There is however, a lot of sophisticated insight into the human nature as well as cancer itself, and as my mother is a cancer surviver as well I can recognize a lot of the experiences from her fight as well.On some issues I believe that Armstrong could have gotten closer and in more detail, such as more specifics on the Post Cancer period and how he was dealing with the everyday life.The book left me in awe of Lance Armstrong and not only as an athlete..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Anyone will be inspired by this account of Lance Armstrong's life.

Every time I finished a chapter it would end with something like, \\"I might lose my life\\" so I would end up reading another chapter. I don't usually like nonfiction but I recommend this book to everybody. Sometimes when I was reading I would stop and think,\\" I can't believe this actually happened.

A truly inspirational story...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a great book and I would recommend this book to anyone. I would recommend this book to anyone because it teaches you to never give up. It also tells you that you can get through anything. I thought that the plot of the story was unbelievable. I think this because it is amazing that Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France after he survived cancer. I think that people that have cancer would enjoy reading this because it tells them that it's not impossible to beat cancer and tells them never to give up. Overall this book was an awesome and touching book and it would be great if other people read it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved this book. My father was fighting pancreatic cancer for 1yr as I was reading this book. I never believed anything else than that my father would win his battle, and a year later he beat it. I'm an athlete and have also thought nothing could happen to me, because I'm healthy. But after reading Lance's battle, if it does...I'll fight it with everything I've got."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's life with all it's stupendous ups and cruel downs is a true testament to the human spirit and its incredible powers to triumph. In this very descriptive account of his life as a cyclist, son, husband, father and a cancer patient in recovery, he delves into details that will both awe and inspire you. He'll take you through a journey of seemingly insurmountable obstacles which he eventually overcomes with perseverance, determination and the ample love with which he's surrounded. His story is a triumphant experience worthy of telling and it's all laid out in this book. Without doubt, this the most optimistic and inspiring book I've ever read.Being a man and a cyclist, Lance's life resonates a great deal with me. His fears and doubts are so real that I felt a chill going down my spine reading some of the details of what he had gone through both in the hospital bed and on the bike saddle. When I say he's an inspiration, I truly mean that in the most personal way.You don't need to be a man or an athlete to enjoy this book. It's is about the human struggle to overcome the hardships of life and actually succeeding. It's also about learning to see the blessing in the most god-awfull situations that life throws at you. It truly is an amazing story worth of every minute of your time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong wrote an amazing book about his life and how he was able to change it for the better. After his cancer, he was able to change his life to better suit his new life. I learned a major lesson from this book. Lance Armstrong was able to prove to the world that he was not afraid and that he would fight what was fighting against him. Lance Armstrong was also able to show a great relationsip between him and his mom. She was there for him when he needed her most and she was always willing to help him with whatever he needed. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book or anyone who wants to read about an amazing life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Can we all get our money back? What a book full of lies. Why is this even published now? Good going Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The events described in this book are mostly fiction. A true account would describe a mediocre cyclist who couldn't win a race without cheating. So he made it his life's work to be a cheater, liar and fraud. More like a gangster than a competitor, he bullied, attacked and sued anyone who dared speak the truth. He organized a drug ring within the U.S. team, so that his teammates would be as fraudulent as himself, and he would be able to keep them in constant fear of being exposed. There is no winning behavior in this story. It is a sad and vile tale of pathological liar corrupted by greed and evil. This is not about surviving cancer, it is about being a cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike\\" resonates with the boundless, Tour de France-winning energy of its author. Armstrong tells his story with honesty and simplicity in a way that made me want to hear and know more, and not shrink back from the details of what it's like to have testicular cancer. As he talked about the person he was before and after fighting cancer, I could feel the post-cancer Lance emerge in the book - a person who woke up to what a difference people make in our lives, and what a difference we make to other people and to ourselves. I really like the following quote from the book: \\"The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt --more than any experience I\`ve had as an athlete--is that we are much better than we know.\\"I owe a great thanks to a reviewer of this book from Jersey City. The review spurred me on to read this book as well as another book she recommended \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. I've read many books that have pointed the way to a great life, but this one went right tothe heart of the matter - that trying to fix yourself keeps you stuck in the places you'd like get out of, but getting into the moment will set you free. Don't miss either of these books."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For those not inclined to reading anything, this is a quick read, not because it is simplistic (which it is not), but rather because the story is engrossing and ultimately, uplifting. For those not knowledgable about the world of competitive cycling, after reading this book you may find yourself tuning into this summer's Tour de France just to watch Lance do what he does best - living life.From the opening sentence, Lance Armstrong makes it clear to his audience that this is not a book about the Tour de France (even though it is the subject of the longest chapter in the book), nor about cycling (though it serves as the constant backgrop of his story). Lance takes you with him, day by day, into his personal struggle with cancer, chemo, and near death. But he also shares the romance of finding true love and the personal gratification of winning the ultimate cycling challenge, the Tour de France. The book is filled with personal lessons found previously in other writings such as &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; - enjoy life, love those close to you, never quit.In a time when role models are scarce, Lance Armstrong emerges as a true hero for all generations."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a biography, this book is clearly a total fraud. As the fiction we now know it to be, it is mediocre at best. Sally Jenkins got played like the rest of us. The difference is we get it while she is still delusional in her defense of this creep."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After the events of the last few weeks, it's obvious to all that this is a complete and utter fabrication. Lies upon lies. Deceit upon deceit. DO NOT BUY. Every cent Armstrong earns from this book should go straight to the people he aggressively sued and took money from. You're right, Lance, it's not about the bike. It's about the disgraceful, unethical lie you lived and the arrogant swagger you had for so long. No more. No more."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Wow! I just now finished the last page of Lance Armstrong's incredible story, and I had to share my thoughts and feelings. At several times throughout reading this book, I found tears welling up in my eyes (a bit self-consciously, as I did most of the reading in public places). I was touched and moved by the honesty of Lance's telling of all the aspects of his experience, as a champion bike-racer and as the conqueror of an almost-surely fatal disease, but mostly of his growth and unfolding as a person, his expanded awareness of the difference he has made and continues to make in peoples' lives.In the last chapter, Lance says &quot;The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt--more than any experience I've had as an athlete--is that we are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometimes only emerge in crisis.&quot;This statement sums up the sense he gives throughout the book, that it is not in fame or unparalled achievement that we can experience life's greatest satisfaction, but in the simple connections with our fellow human beings, in sharing our weaknesses and strengths, our joys and fears, life's daily triumphs over whatever &quot;obstacles&quot; appear. It is a lesson in living day by day, moment by moment, and not giving up, no matter what.I expecially enjoyed the description of traveling in Europe with his future wife during his recuperation from chemotherapy, and really seeing the places that he had only raced in before, experiencing them in a totally new and unexpected way, by sharing them with the love of his life and seeing them through her eyes.Another book that has profoundly impacted my life is &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work, a book about Instantaneous Transformation&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. In a remarkably open and relaxed style, the Kanes explore through their own experiences what is possible when living in the moment, which is: love, satisfaction, joy, health, wealth, success in business and personal relationships, and freedom from the mechanical patterns that we all acquire as we grow up. I have seen all of these aspects blossom in my own life, without &quot;working on&quot; them, since reading the Kane's book.

It's a personal handbook on having a great life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in one day because it was damn good. I wanted to covet every word written; it's about hope, it's about survival and it helps to know a little about the most grueling athletic event in the world - the Tour de France. How this man survived a major illness with a 2% chance of survival and got on his bike the very next year and won is a force of determination beyond human comprehension."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was filed under \\"Sport\\" and \\"Biography\\", but should instead be under \\"Fiction\\" and \\"Fantasy\\".

I thoroughly enjoyed this story and fully appreciate the fact that Mr. Armstrong was so kind as to share something so personal with his fans. Readers (as did I) will find this heartwarming, tearful, motivational and finally exultant, as the authors take you from his humble beginnings, through his near fatal bout with cancer, through remission and to victory in the world's toughest and most prestigious cycling event. Perhaps most enlightening about Mr. Armstrong is his consistent effort to give credit to those who helped him achieve his goals (i.e. his Mother, Wife, Team, friends, etc.) A must read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had the priviledge of actually getting this book signed by Lance Armstrong a couple of days after he won the Tour De France. He was at Niketown near Rodeo Drive a couple of days after he won it and is a very nice guy. It's a great book, it shows all of us you can overcome any obstacle. I definitely recommend this."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great title! It's about the bike. It's about cancer. Recovery. Desire. Determination. It's about pain and suffering. Lance went through a hell of a lot and came out of it a champion.It's a book that must be read. To see a young man, an arrogant young man learn that he isn't indestructible is a learning experience not only for Lance but for the reader, because there are a lot of people out there who think that they are going to live forever.This book allows the reader to reflect on his/her life. It shows the importance of relationships. The importance of being a good (make that excellent)single parent as Lance's mother was in bringing him up.I cannot say enough about it. Read it! I just finished it and plan to read it again now!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Now that he's won the Tour de France twice, more people are looking at Lance Armstrong and with good reason. This book tells the story of the kid with the rough family background and the mother who wouldn't give up and how he became a world-famous athlete, only to nearly lose it all when cancer began taking over his body.Lance and Sally Jenkins write an accessible story of growing up and dealing with the big C. The medical aspects of this book are never hidden or shadowed and the retelling of Lance's victory at the Tour de France is exciting, although we already know how it ended.This is a great biography and a great story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was just awesome!! I happened to be reading it at the end of the 2000 Tour de France, and it had me read the paper every morning for news about Lance. My wife actually bought it and read it first, at the beginning of the Tour, and she read and watched everything she could find about Lance's attempt to win back to back victories of the Tour. A must read for any athlete, cancer patient, cancer survivor or anyone who enjoys being inspired. I'm buying a bike and I'm going to start riding!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A very candid account of the life of one of best athletes in the world. Sure it's a great account of the world of a professional cyclist. However, it is more than just another athlete's account of how a regular person from a humble background becomes a hero. Armstrong is both honest and a bit brash, but most importantly it is almost impossible to walk away from this book without getting the feeling that we are truly fortunate to be alive. That we have the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our friends and families. As long as you are a survivor you have the chance to be special. Good story, great inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is an Incredible Strong Human Being.He has Overcome So Much.this Book puts everything into Perspective.The Value of Life&amp;Loved Ones.Lance Armstrong is a True Warrior.He Never Gave up.after reading this Touching Book You Will See him More than an Athlete he is a True Champion of Life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you are looking for a work of literary art, this isn't it. If you want to know what it was like to grow up and live as Lance Armstrong, the World Champion, Tour de France Winner, and Cancer Survivor, this is the book for you. You feel as though Lance is at the supper table telling you the story of his life over a home cooked meal his Mom made up. If you don't get goose-bumps, check your pulse."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book is very inspiring, but not in the fluffy, ethereal manner of so many &quot;inspirational&quot; autobiographies. In this book you get SOME idea of what it must have been like to go through his cancer treatment in very detailed descriptions (central line removal, sperm donation, nausea...). Kudos on the technical correctness in the book from this physician. For those interested in the cycling side, it is also interesting to glimpse the strategy, training and team approach to the Tour. Even if you watched the televised portions of the Tour, you will have a much better idea of how Lance and the U.S. Postal team rode to victory. Very good book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"WOW! I could not put this book down. Truly inspirational. A must read for all Americans!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read the book, what a fake, fiction at best and can only say, better books to be read, better time to be spent."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"While most people are probably somewhat familiar with the Lance Armstrong story, assuming he's like other professional athletes who have encountered adversity would be such an underestimation of this incredible man. His story, written in first person style sounding very much like he probably speaks, is awe-inspiring. He doesn't gloss over those years when he acted a bit like a jerk, or ignored coaching advice. He's honest with his readers when he speaks of past mistakes which are probably rooted in an unclear vision of who he really is. The cancer that almost killed him he now describes as \\"the best thing that ever happened to me\\". He doesn't spare any detail when describing how sick he was, nor does he try to make us think he was some big tough guy cancer patient, putting on a happy face through countless days of torture. His cancer story is very real, and this is a person that could not have come much closer to death. But he chose to embrace life, and it was this choice that brought about all the changes that made him who he is today. Anyone who is procrastinating about anything in life needs to read this book for that kick in the butt that will get them moving. Need to lose a little weight? Change jobs? Run that first 5k? Get out of a bad relationship? READ THIS BOOK. You will realize how soft your life is, and how choosing to LIVE, rather than exist, will make you the best person you can be. Oops, did I make this sound like a self help book? It's not at all, just an inspiring account of one person's life and how he fought back to become, in my humble opinion, the world's greatest athlete, and an amazing person. He is on the verge of winning his 4th Tour deFrance. Listen to what he says when he does, it will tell you what kind of person Lance Armstrong really is."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book on a whim. I am not a cyclist nor have I really followed the sport. Inspite of that, I found Lance Armstrong's biography to be incredibly inspiring. I read it while on a plane coming back from Jamaica and found myself utterly enthralled with his story of self-discovering and growth that gained as a cancer survivor. I was also moved by the parallels he described in battling the pethelon and conqueoring cancer. His love for the bike and what it has brought to his life is equally impressive. I felt as though I was with him as decribed cycling through harsh weather, pain and all the wonderous nature of the French countyside.Oncology nurse Ms. Latrice Haney, whom he calls a real life angel, was also inspiring. Her dedication to her patient and her profession was moving. If am ever sick, I also hope encounter an angel like her.Life is miracleous. Lance Armstrong's testimony bears witness to this fact."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a lie. Lance Armstrong cheated his way to 7 Tour wins and used his money, power, and fame to bully anyone who dared speak the truth about his drug use. I can get over the cheating and lying in a sport where most riders did the same. But the bullying is another issue. The bullying of former best friends, trusted colleagues, and others who literally gave their all to put Lance on the podium is despicable. This shows his true character and anyone in the press who continues to support him should take a good long look in the mirror."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a long-time and obsessed cyclist, and huge fan of the sport, I picked up this book as a feel-good prelude to this year's Tour. However, upon completing it, I find myself surprisingly conflicted.On the one hand, it would laughably arrogant to say that Lance is not an admirable person. He is peerless as a cyclist, tireless in his training, relentlessly determined to win and has become one of the sport's true sportsmen over the years, most famously by pausing on a fierce mountain stage of the Tour to allow his main rival, Jan Ullrich, rejoin him after a crash. His fight with cancer was nothing short of heroic, as was his desire to help others by setting up a foundation and charity event.And if you doubt the man's courage, consider this: in his mid-20s, he could have retired quite comfortably. He would have been recalled as a hero, a world champion cyclist and brave cancer survivor. He had the wife of his dreams, the house of his dreams and could have made a very tidy living as an inspirational speaker and cancer spokesperson. What's more, he would have collected almost $2 million in disability for sitting on his butt, playing golf and drinking beer-I don't have to tell you what I would have done. Instead he threw away the money and gambled everything for what at best looked like a few years of obscure mediocrity as a domestique.If that's not guts, I don't know what is.However, on the other hand, I found his portrayal of himself as a lonely, hard-luck outsider absolutely absurd and moreover, insulting to both himself and the mere mortals who have faced some of his struggles.Lance's days as an outsider ended the moment he won his first triathlon. The day he started crossing the line minutes ahead of his rivals, he stopped being one of us and became the ultimate insider--he became Lance. He whines about the tough life he had growing up, but let's face it: he was mommy's special little man from the get go and never truly went without. He may not have played football, but he was a star athlete in every sense of the word, making an adult's salary at 15 and driving a fancy car throughout high school. Once he graduated, his life was almost completely managed by a cadre of professionals and powerbrokers, the connections were made, the money poured in and the models had their hearts broken.And again, while it would be obscene to minimize his cancer experience, he did have it better than many. Lots of people get cancer, lots of people don't have health insurance, but few people have white knight CEOs blackmailing insurance companies to pay their bills, a tribe of lawyers and corporate honchos flitting around in jets to cater to their every need, or the top cancer specialists in the nation tripping over each other to treat them.So in ready this book, I found Lance almost greedy; isn't it enough to be a genetic superman, a champion, a survivor, an inspiration, a hero? Why do you also have to a victim? What about those of us who do that first race and come in last? Who never win? Who never get sponsored or trained or handled and still keep at it? What about the cancer victims with no insurance who quietly die a slow, painful death, leaving their families in debt? If you're an outsider, and underdog, a victim, what does that make them?So in reading this I found Lance's life to be extraordinary, a triumph, an inspiration. I only wished he'd acknowledged this good fortune, taken the chip off his shoulder and left it behind for someone who really deserved it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Now in January 2013, Lance Armstrong has been backed into a corner and has finally confessed to using drugs and doping in all seven of his Tour de France wins and has admitted that he is a bully and liar. George W. Bush and Lance Armstrong are good friends. Now we see why: they both are pathological liars who don't mind destroying people's lives. Can we believe Armstrong's version of his struggle with cancer or is it filled with exaggerations and fabrications?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If Lance Armstrong isn't the Greatest Sports Hero Ever, who is? Those overpaid ballplayers with gold chains who think they're heroes if they play with the sniffles? Lance Armstrong came back from DEATH to win the world's most grueling sports event three times in a row. And the only chain Armstrong wears was given to him by his friend who later died of cancer.Although Lance Armstrong gets the byline, the book was obviously written by his talented co-author, Sally Jenkins. But the combination of Lance's inspirational story and Sally's engaging writing is unbeatable. Sally weaves Lance's Texas childhood, his horrifying experience with cancer and his European cycling career into a compelling story of man's triumph over adversity. I competed against Armstrong in his first Triathlon in Dallas and can assure you that this book describes cycling perfectly. And, as the clich&eacute; goes, a Hollywood producer could not have invented a better story.Lance Armstrong remains his own person. He doesn't pander to the press, hawk merchandise or make stupid appearances at the local mall. He leads by example and gives hope to cancer patients. When you're shopping for sunglasses, remember how the CEO of Oakley forced his insurance carrier to cover Lance when he had lost his previous coverage. And what of Cofidis, the French company that dropped their sponsorship of Lance when he was coming back from cancer? Examples like this show us the true nature of companies and their leaders as opposed to their advertising, PR and celebrity endorsements.And while athletes like Patrick Ewing visited the Gold Club when he was at the last Olympics, Lance Armstrong is completely devoted to his wife and son. When Lance trains in Europe, he brings his family along. I wonder if Ewing took his family to Atlanta?The book deals with sensitive subjects like Lance's testicular cancer and the in vitro fertilization of his wife. However, there is no time for self-pity. Does the book idealize Lance relationship with his mother? Yes, but so what? It's not Lance's fault that he's the son of an angel.Some critics say this book is not about the bike but about Lance. Of course it is! It's his biography. And that Lance has been arrogant, self-absorbed and egotistical. So what? Can an underprivileged kid raised by a single mother climb to the top otherwise? And what do you think brought Lance back from death? My father says his attitude carried him through his own experience with cancer. Like my father, Lance just refused to give up. And they're both alive today. Those armchair experts who criticize Armstrong or accuse him of doping should watch bowling instead or maybe go for a little bike ride of their own.Every cancer patient, every cancer survivor and every person facing adversity can look up to Lance Armstrong. I've respected him since he dropped me in that Dallas triathlon years ago. My father admires this young guy who also beat death with a combination of luck and attitude. And we can all look up to Sally Jenkins for crafting such a wonderful book. This is one of the most inspirational stories of all time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars! This is one of the most inspirational biographies I have ever read, and comes from the truly remarkable life experiences of a determined young man. I loved every word!Early in the book, Lance Armstrong says &quot;. . . that cancer was the best thing that happened to me.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;When I was sick I saw more beauty and triumph and truth in a single day than I ever saw in a bike race.&quot;Overcoming cancer and becoming an athletic champion in the grueling sport of bicycle racing require a toughness of spirit, mind, and body that is hard for most of us to imagine. This inspirational book portrays beautifully how one can start with the right spirit and overcome enormous obstacles.Although his doctors told him he had a 40 percent chance of surviving stage three testical cancer, this was mostly to keep his morale up. After he had recovered, his doctor admitted that is chances were around 3 percent, instead.While he was being treated for the cancer, no one thought that he might ever race again. He did decide to go through treatments that would leave open the possibility that his lungs (affected by the cancer) would still be functional and his coordination (through delicate brain surgery) would be unaffected. Within two years, he had won the Tour de France, a grueling race he had never done well in before he had cancer.Growing up, Lance Armstrong had little reason to suspect that he would become one of the world's greatest athletes. He was well into high school, still trying pretty unsuccessfully to make the football and swimming teams, before it became clear that he could become a significant cyclist. Pleased with the money that success brought, he had a tough time building the attitude of a champion to go with his remarkable endurance skills. Overcoming cancer helped him with that, as well as seeing the beauty around him.He met his wife at the press conference to announce the beginning of his foundation to fight cancer. They were married during his recovery, and recently became parents through the miracles of modern medicine.Of such wonderful stuff are role models made, something we have too few of these days.The story is told in a very open and matter-of-fact way. He is not trying to make himself into something that he isn't. Clearly, his purpose in writing this book is to help all of us fulfill our potential rather than to glorify himself.Please share this book with people who need this inspiration and encouragement to take on the pain of giving life all you've got."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is fascinating on several levels: First, it's a very frank analysis of Lance Armstrong and his rise from a less than ideal family situation to his perch atop the cycling world. Second, it's an amazing account of his mother's strength and devotion in raising a son, often as a single parent. Third, it's a troubling account of the overwhelming difficulties facing cancer patients -- from insurance runarounds to loss of jobs to contradictory assessment and treatment recommendations from the doctors entrusted with their care. This is truly an incredible story. Four years ago Armstrong dropped out of the Tour de France and bombed out at the Atlanta Olympics. Over the next year he discovered he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer,tumors in his lungs and two in his brain, underwent brain surgery and four rounds of chemotherapy. Not long after, he was competing in Europe again. The rest is well-known: Tour victories in '99 and 2000 and a real hope for Olympic gold this time around. This is a frank, well-written account of Armstrong's incredible journey. I think it may be especially well-received by those undergoing cancer treatment or their families. The story goes far beyond an account of two-wheeling through the Alps."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even if you aren't normally interested in sports memoirs or medical-miracle tales, this combination of the two is well worth reading. It is informative, moving, and often funny account of Armstrong's battles both as an cyclist and as a patient, distinguished by his refusal to slip into arrogance as a champion or into self-pity as a cancer victim. Rather than recite platitudes, he tells us in fascinating and often gut-wrenching detail exactly what he has had to do to beat his cancer (I found the medical sections fascinating, as good as any science book you'll read on the subject). The cycling parts are, as you might suspect, a little bit lighter, but also very enjoyable. Buy this book. Read it. You'll be entertained, you'll be informed, and you might even be a little bit enlightened."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Pre-cancer, I didn't care much for Lance Armstrong. Although an excellent cyclist, he had an ego and arrogance that was far bigger than his tallent.Post-cancer, I saw a dramatic change in his personality (not to mention ability as a cyclist).This book gives a very good insight into what makes him tick. For instance, it was a little easier to understand his pre-cancer ego.The writing in this book is simple, as if he dictated it into a tape recorder. This is not distracting to the story, but is not as rewarding as other biographies I have read.Overall, this is a good read. It shows how one person with determination can overcome anything."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought and read this book because it was on my son's summer reading list. From page one I felt like Lance Armstrong was talking to me. Through his simplistic, descriptive style, I became a part of his life. I became entranced; I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I was on edge as if I were on the sidelines. It taught me about cycling, about cancer, about the life of a survivor. I had never thought about any of these things, and I became educated without trying. It's a fascinating book. If you admire people who are willing to work hard at what they do, you will love it. If you know someone who has had cancer and/or is a cancer survivor, you will learn more about that person, and you will love it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Ali. Jordan. Armstrong. There are a few names in athletics that define a sport, and, in a bigger sense, define all sports. Lance Armstrong, in what is a relatively small sport in America, has succeeded to be able to able his place among the greatest ever.Had Armstrong not had cancer, it would not have made him a lesser athlete. He might have more victories behind him. But with his struggle with cancer, he has been vaulted beyond being a great biker, winner of several Tour de France yellow jerseys. He has become a great man.As a biker, I know any Tour de France victory is extraordinary. These guys are as tough as any rugby player. To win it multiple times seem impossible, but Armstrong has the bragging rights. However, this book is not filled with self-congratulating phrases or business book mantras. It is a challenge to reach the top of your game.Furthermore, he has been unafraid to exercise his free speech. He has opinions, and does not cater to the media. Yet, unlike too many athletes, he has something to say. Armstrong has not let his victories be stained by drugs or crime. He is that quintessential All American Good Guy.If kids watch Armstrong, they can want to be like him. Parents will not be ashamed of him. High school kids can read this book (even nonbikers) and feel a sense of drive to press onward, to get the job done, to not lose hope no matter how dire things seem. Armstrong pressed on, and now, as I write, he is on his way to winning another yellow jersey.I fully recommend \\"It&#65533;s Not About the Bike\\" by Lance Armstrong.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When Lance Armstrong dies a pathologist will look inside his body...this book allows us to look inside his soul."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. Even though I don't know a thing about Lance Armstrong nor cycling, it is certainly easy to get &quot;into&quot; the book. Lance Armstrong traced his childhood, how he became an athlete, how he was exposed to cycling and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It was very amazing to me when he said at the beginning of the book that cancer was the best thing that ever happened to him. I couldn't believe that but as I continue reading his book, it seem unbelievably true.It was also interesting to read how cancer changed his perspective on life, his priorities and just getting a second chance to live again. His endurance, persistance to live and win the Tour De France was inspirational. I think what impresses me was no so much that he won the title but the way he fought to win it.I think Armstrong also accomplished an unintentional aim - that is to tell his readers that cycling is not as easy as it look. It takes a lot of patience, endurance and strategies to beat your competitors.In addition to that, it was very touching to see Armstrong's friends and family members stood by him and how their moral support helped him through the most difficult time of his life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about survivorship."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Being an amateur cyclist myself, there was much I enjoyed about this book. The inside information into the cycling world was very interesting. Of course, the inspirational account of Lance's comeback was quite compelling. What I found somewhat disturbing about the book was Lance's liberal use of profanity. I didn't see any need for this to be included, at least not to the extent that is present. No one seemed excempt from this man's foul mouth. Whether it be nurses, friends or competitors, all were subject to it. Lance could have given us the accounts of his life with the same intensity without having to resort to including this. But, as I said, apart from this, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Did you ever stay up late at night - just to finish a great book. ? Well ; that is what I did with Lance Armstrongs book. Truly a good book - well written and inspiring. Some biographies are not that great, as they describe people just leading their &quot;famous&quot; life, or just &quot;doing their job&quot;. But this book is different ; it is the hardship, real life experience,and the extra efforts by Lance that make his book special. You can relate to this guy and his experiences. When I was reading this book, the local Texas paper announced that the little girl (cancer patient and Lance friend) mentioned in the book had lost the battle with cancer. I did put the news article inside the book, to remind myself what really matters in life. Since the book was written Lance also won the 2000 Tour de France - so Lance we need an another book !!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book gives an interesting view into the life of a professional roadracer and into Lance's own battle with cancer. His determination and will are most admirable. He gives hope to others, make that great hope to others and often hope is the only thing a cancer patient has. There were a couple of things about the book that were detractors. One was Lance's own self absorbtion which did not seem to change from his pre-cancer days and the other was the all to frequent use of the &quot;f&quot; word. I find it amusing that Lance found the porno magazines at the sperm bank offensive, but doesn't mind using crude sexual language in his own book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great book, but he also really pays tribute to how importantit is to have a special mom to stand behind you and fight for you, Especially when your too tired or ill to do things your self--good job Lance's mom (also a hero!).Lots of all around inspiration!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a wonderful book that will make you cry, make you laugh, make you cheer.

Few weeks later I had another meeting with the same VP and as I walk in to his office he gave me this book as a present, knowing I'm an avid reader.I read it during the long flight back home! Great inspiring book! Never did read a sportsman biography but this one is worth each single word.You learn something new every day!

It is a great mix of athletics and the will to survive and what it takes to accomplish both. Get it and read it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quite good. The compelling part of the book is to hear Lance tell how he overcame advanced-stage prostate cancer, with treatments that fully debilitated him. Only then did he come back to win the Tour de France for the first time! (And the only time in this book.) He is frank about the rougher sides of his personality, but does go beyond his illness to learn how to be a better person. You are cheering for him all the way. Although written with a ghost writer, it is his voice that comes through loudly and clearly. The book ends with him quite in love with his wife and first child, projecting a family life into the future. Sadly, as we know, it was not to be, nor did he stick it out with Sheryl Crow who had yet to appear in his story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One of my \\"wow\\" moments while reading this beautiful book was when he described his thoughts, once he was diagnosed with cancer, \\"Basically, I can endure more physical stress than most people can, and I don't get as tired while I'm doing it. So I figure maybe that helped me live. I was lucky -- I was born with an above-average capacity for breathing. But even so, I was in a desperate, sick fog much of the time.My illness was humbling and starkly revealing, and it forced me to survey my life with an unforgiving eye. There are some shameful episodes in it: instances of meanness, unfinished tasks, weaknesses, and regrets. I had to ask myself, 'If I live, who is it that I intend to be?' I found that I had a lot of growing to do as a man.\\"And, yet, as I read this book, I kept saying to myself, \\"Man. He would be a demanding kind of guy in a good and a bad way - depending upon how you feel about yourself, while you are around him.\\"In my humble opinion, Lance Armstrong is a type A man who in this book really reveal what I can't imagine him revealing in person with others, with the exception of his mother.There are many life lessons in \\"It's Not About the Bike.\\"And, on a lighter side, every time I drive my car, and the traffic light has just turned yellow, I laugh at how in \\"It's Not About the Bike,\\" Lance Armstrong describes how this is his chance to speed up, not slow down and prepare to stop.This biography has a conversational and strongly visual tone. I also learned many things about bicycling being a team sport, rather than an individualized activity as I had always thought of it as being."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book initally because of Lance's accomplishments. However, I soon realized it was as the title states more \\"than about the bike\\". It is a book about hope, preserverence, belief in one's self and survival when all odds are stacked against you. My husband was going through Chemo for Leukemia when he read the book for the second time, it helped him believe that he was going to make it. If Lance could do it so could he. This book touches you where you least expect it, in your soul. It will give you hope and strength. Now every time we have a friend that has been diagnosed with Cancer we send them this book as well as the Livestrong Survivorship Binder from the Livestrong Foundation. This book is not just about cancer, bike racing or survival, it is about hope, whether it's surviving cancer or winning the Tour de France. One feels they can accomplish anything after completion of the book. I cannot recommend it highly enough and feel everyone should read it from 13 to 90."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The definition of a page turner: I read this book in one day! I've also had many of my sophomore HS students choose it as an indpendent read and they've all loved it. A must read!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an excellent and easy to read book about Lance Armstrongs life and struggle with cancer written in plan, easy to understand English. It tells how he battled back from a 3% chance of living to win the Tour de France bicycle race. I was unable to put this book down after starting to read it because its written in a very positive and uplifting way. I feel as though I almost know the guy now."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I recently became a regular bicycle commuter, with intentions to do some bicycle touring, but I am also fascinated with professional bicycle road racing in general and Lance Armstrong's role in the evolution of it in particular. This book is an excellent introduction into amazing life and times of Lance Armstrong. It is important to remember that this story is told from Lance's perspective, and therefore can not necessarily be expected to be totally objective; he occassionally uses the book as a platform to \\"correct misipressions\\" created by others. Although, I can't fault someone as controversial as Lance Armstrong for wanting to air his side of a story. In short, a bloody good read, if you are interested in the core topics..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved this book. It is very inspirational for anyone dealing with cancer. It is also just a great read. Lance Armstrong comes across as a regular guy, with human failings, but with a phenominal talent, and great dedication and determination. He has done a great service by writing this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are a lot of reviews of this book already on amazon.com, so I'll keep it brief and just say that this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. If you have any interest in reading about cycling, cancer or the story of an exceptional person's life, then you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This true story of a young champion cyclist's struggle in the sport of professional cycling and his struggle with cancer which had spread to his brain and lungs from his testes is totally gripping on every level.It is eye-watering in its honesty and frankness.It is a tribute to the single mother amongst other tributes.Friendship,the medical fraternity and their dedication, the psychology of serious illness as well as the physical effects are all vividly described . The shocking truth that even if you have a positive nature,you don't necessarily beat cancer makes one realise life is truly a lottery.How he rode that bike in between bouts of chemo I will never know.The best bio I have read,ever.(I read it in one day.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So,admit it-how many of you were weeping and laughing and cheering when Lance crushed the field and powered to the top of Hautecaum (sp?) in stage 10 this year?!!! I read the book after this year's Tour and found it riveting. Lance's self-centeredness, arrogance, and crudity are front and center with his courage, determination and heroism. It's very honest and direct, and I wanted to read more. Fortunately the story goes on."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A very good book if you can get by the profanity. It never ceases to amaze me how a perfectly good book can be degraded by a limited vocabulary. I would have rated this book a 5 star if it were not for the language used. Overall an excellent book. Easy to read and very inspirational story of a true hero who beat the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No matter what you struggle with in your life, Lance Armstrong's story will inspire you to persevere. As an amateur cyclist in Dallas, and someone who made it big at an early age in a business endeavor, I can certainly relate to his early life. But what strikes me as most incredible is his determination (with the help and motivation from friends and family) to get back on the bike and &quot;move&quot;, as he puts it - continue on, and win the Tour, in the face of innumerable odds, after beating Cancer. Whether he wants to be or not, Lance Armstrong is a true American hero.Thanks for the story and powerful inspiration, Lance. Thanks to your words, I'm cycling again daily and will race again soon. Your life will inspire others in unimaginable ways."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"You know, I've always cheered for Armstrong in the races. I've always thought that he was a decent guy. Until I read this book. Lance Armstrong is a very, very cocky guy that seems to have some kind of anger deep inside that he keeps pinned up until he explodes. His comeback was amazing, his careeer is amazing, his cycling is amazing, but I don't care if he has won the Tour 5 times, he is still to arrogant for my liking."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Sorry but I agree with Badger Bob. This is a \\"I love Lance\\" book written by Lance. And a recurring problem in autobios by unexperienced writers. I have read many auto bios and I was half expecting this to be one of those greats. The Book should NOT have been titled as such. Mr. Armstrong, it took 159 pages of patience for you to crack a smile of humility, you had a chance to make this an inspirational book like \\"Born to Run\\" (some great moments). I thought It's Not About The Bike meant you ride with spirit with a certain grace. I half expected to admire cycling more as I'm an avid road cyclist. But it became repetitive. This may have to do with the fact you probably haven't read much great literature, Athlete's are busy, and rarely focus on matters of self discovery and spirituality. I hope in many years when the fame fades away and you discover yourself, THE great Lance Armstrong, who is not a cyclist but like you said, Cancer survivor, human being, and father figure, you can share words of wisdom when u finally get back on that bike at 50 yrs old and although it hurts you ride everyday like a child on his first trainer with a free spirit."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I disagree with most of the recent reviews that have come out pertaining to this book. Before anybody decides to come down on me, I want to say that I am in no way an advocate of using performance enhancement substances in competitive sports nor am I particularly fond of Armstrong's decisions to cover and fight against the truth. However, the central message of the book is what I focus on and it's still what grabs me. The book isn't about winning the Tour de France, it's about a man who didn't give up. No matter if one decides to use performance enhancement substances or not, the drugs themselves do not do the majority of the work. Now the advantage the drugs gave raise the issue of ethics, the fact remains that Armstrong did fight against a lethal disease, survived and made the triumphant return to a sport that he loved. This man worked hard and gave everything he had and that's inspirational regardless of whether he won using the drugs, won without the drugs, lost with the drugs or lost without the drugs. It seems rather ironic that while we as a society tend to celebrate effort above anything else, we readily dismiss it in this case."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I heard about Lance Armstrong in health class; and because my english teacher has a picture of him in his room. Both my english teacher and I love riding bikes; however, I don't chain my bike to my desk.This is a fanastic book which I think everyone, even if you don't like sports, should read. If you read this title, you can tell it is about Lance Armstrong the 7-time Tour de France winner. Many people who have heard about Lance Armstong from his Livestrong foundation, his wins, and his finance Sheryll Crow.Here is what the book is about. It is Lance Armstrong's memior about his life from when he was little up to the birth of his son Luke. In 1996, Lance found out he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer, which left him sterile. When I say advanced, I mean that it spread to his lungs and brain. In this story, Lance explains why he became the way he is. He talks about how after experiences with his first stepfather hitting him with an old fraternity paddle for any reason is the reason that he thinks organized religion is for hypocrites. He talks about how great and wonderful his mother is. He talks about his start in Plano, Texas. And the birth of son by in-virto. he talks about being the youngest Tour de France winner. He also mentions that after his horrible battle with cancer, how he won the Tour again; however, people thought he used drugs to get that way. In my opinion, it is very sweet about how he talks about his wife Kristin aka Kik (they are now divorced) and his mother. Anyone who wants to read a good book should read this.There are only two books I can say are as good as this one; they are EVERY SECOND COUNTS BY LANCE ARMSTRONG and the RYAN WHITE BOOK. Every Second Counts is what takes place after this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is raw, candid, and often moved me to tears. I knew Lance in name only before the book. I admire his honesty in this book.Lance (and his wife) experienced seemingly more Miracles in the shortest amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime. He is blessed to have had so many people (including his wife) who &quot;put it on the line&quot; for him, yet I can't help but wonder if he truly appreciates it.Lance is a &quot;take charge&quot; kind of guy and we get to see that at its depth as he takes us through his cycling and cancer challenges. Both of which, in his case, are extremely amazing feats. When that much is demanded of you, or demanded of yourself, is something lost? Lance Armstrong seems torn throughout the book about his role in his life.Never discount a Miracle or Who it came from."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Whether you like bicycling or not this is a book to be read and reread. The courageous story of this world class athlete will amaze and touch you. This man is a true American hero who can evoke emotions with words as well as his performances."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The second part of the title says it all, &quot;My journey back to life.&quot; While quite a bit is said about bicycling, the book is more about survival and a tremendous comeback and a soaring spirit: a spirit that is not defeated. This book is very encouraging and I think especially cancer patients will find in it tremendous comfort and even hope. Healthy folks will love to read this book too, and they'll come away thanking God for their health. Another book that I found extremely encouraging and uplifting is Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is outstanding, and while I retain very little respect for Lance Armstrong on a personal level, after watching his interview with Opera, I still highly recommend this book, as it is outstanding."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I red this book now, because I am sure that the new one will come out very soon and wanted to see how was he thinking and presenting himself at the beginning of his career.Love the book. It was simple, easy to read, and very interesting."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never finished this one. So glad I waited and found out what a waste of time it would have been to read this book. It really wasn't about the BIKE. It never is! It's about character! The book was in great shape when I got it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with testicular cancer on Jan 7, 2013. I had surgery the next day, and having no idea what to expect, bought this book. Before the Oprah confessional, I read this book hoping to gain some insight.By the second chapter, I determined it isn't about the bike. Rather, this book is about a super ego. This narcissistic autobiography must have made Lance feel better, but it does little more than stoke his own ego.He isn't a good guy. It comes through in his book- we did not need Oprah to bring this into the light of day. He does that on his own.The book title must be truncated: \\"It isn't about the the bike, it's about me!\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even though he lies through the entie book about his drug use the story of what he went through with cancer and how he trained is amazing. I bike but even a none biker would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book back in December, and even then I was ambivalent. It seemed to me that even if he did use drugs, the fact that he was able to overcome cancer and race in the Tour de France is inspirational. The book was indeed well-written and was a good story. He came across as a rather unlikeable guy, but still inspiring due to his drive to survive and come back. Now that he's made his confession, you'd really have to read a lot of this with a grain of salt. My recommendation (and my plan) is to find a good biography about him instead. My next order will be for &#34;Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong&#34; by David Walsh."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I received several gift copies of Lance's book. I found it very intimidating. Do I need to be like Lance Armstrong to beat cancer? I found it hard to relate to. So I wrote \\"I'm Not Lance!\\" for ordinary patients and their supporters. It's earning rave reviews from readers on amazon and also from professional critics. Many ordinary people fighting cancer feels it speaks to them. I donate ALL proceeds to the Liddy Shriver Sarcoma Initiative.I'm Not Lance!: A Cancer Experience and Survival Guide for Mere Mortals"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"well worth a read although its a little disappointing to see that by the time i finished the book he had already left his wife (a long time before)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked up this book in the juice store in San Jose on a trip. Someone I knew had given a moving speech on Lance, and I love inspiring stories. I have read a few. None, and I mean none so damn well written. The words, the descriptions, and the story, is so deep, and so well-written, that it was incredibly hard to put down. You start to get to know a real person, and all his defeats, his hardship, his anger, and his emergence as a real winner in face of it all. It is the best read in all of my carefully selected dozen books in the last few months. I highly recommend it!!! I love you Lance Armstrong! You are amazing!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance is one person that gave me a great deal of inspiration in this book. How he overcame is struggles is an inspiration to so many people. So what if he has personal \\"love life\\" things to deal with? That is not the foundation of this book. The foundation is the human spirit that overcomes so much, and he is an incredible inspiration to so many people.Don't pay attention to the judgment of reviewers that seem to balk about his intimate personal life. This book, and the messages in it are what matter most, not his dating life.This is a must read book if you are looking to overcome a lot of adversity. Lance is a tremendous inspiration, and this book is a great read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The most inspirational book I have ever read! How can anyone not be moved by a story about a man that nearly died but instead found the will to live and will to win and dominate his sport."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I too have been faced with cancer and have fought my battle on the winning end. Lance Armstrong is such a strong athelete and I'm amazed by what he endured and accomplished after his treatments. This book is very real and I could feel his pain throughout his story. Loved this book! A good read for ANYONE."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Mine is a very personal story. By chance in 2002, I became hooked by cycling and so I naturally found my way to this book. Like many others, I found it inspiring. So when I found myself grinding up a hill, my legs and lungs screaming in unison for me to stop, I would think of Armstrong and all he had gone through in his fight against cancer and - more often than not - I would find the heart, somehow, to keep going.Then in June 2003 I was diagnosed with cancer and required an urgent operation to remove a large tumour from my leg. I was worried that I might never ride again, until I realised that I might never even walk straight again, as they needed to remove a good size piece from my leg.When I went in for my operation, I tore a large photo of Armstrong from a magazine and I stuck it by my hospital bed. I looked at that photo when it hurt. And I looked at it some more, when I slid out of bed and tried to walk. If he could do it, so too could I.So, what price can one place on this book, despite its imperfections? His story gave me courage to fight back, as it has given courage to tens of thousands of other people. You don't need to have cancer or be a cycling fan to appreciate the courage and strength of character, which shines through, page after page.And my story also has a happy ending. My tumour was benign and I was back on the bike within a few weeks. But I still think of Armstrong when my body wants me to stop. And I keep going.What better recommendation could one give?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book offers great insight into one of America's little known but emerging heros. Lance is a real man as we see in him a devotion to his family and friends, his sport, his battle against cancer and his continuing fight against the disease, all characteristics rarely seen in professional athletes these days. Most folks don't realize the effort that comes with a battle against cancer. I didn't, but this book opened my eyes. People outside of the cycling world know little about Lance Armstrong. That's too bad because he is an example we can all use these days. When sports are filled with steroid using, greedy role models who care for nothing more than themselves, Lance is a refreshing break from that norm. We can all learn a lesson from him. The book is good. Even if you don't ride, this book is, as it's title suggests, much more than a story about a cyclist. Cycling is secondary to the more important aspects of this book. Lance is only in his early 30's but has already fought and won several battles of a life time both in life and on two wheels. I can only wonder what lays ahead for him and when his next auto biography will be ready.Post Script Several years later: one divorce, hookin up with Cheryl Crow (but still devoted to his family), 7 TDF wins, pissin the French off etc. Still a good book.Post Script again a few more years later (Jan 2013). Well you know the rest. I'll have to re-read this book again and see if I still feel the same. We all kind of knew something was going on, but to the extent as to which was exposed, yikes. The problem with cycling is that it's not about who's the better cyclist, it's who as the better dope doctors. The TDF is basically equal in that all of them are using something (my opinion)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is a breath taking and inspirational book. I usually don't find autobiographies good, because I don't find peoples life interesting, but this made me keep on reading. What the story is about is how Lance Armstrong, a sensational bike rider got cancer in his early twenties. Right was he was 12 years old he had his dedication for a bike. He used to love triathlons and was competing in the highest level against twenty year olds. In school everyone would were polo shirts and talk after school, while he would be riding his bike for several hours. One day he didn't fell a hundred percent and finds out that he has testicular cancer. After about 1 year he got rid of the cancer, but he had lost all his muscle mass and his hair after going through chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a strong substance that either will kill the cancer or you first. It is a high risk procedure. The doctors for Lance said to Lance after he had got out of cancer that he had a ten percent chance of living, and that it was a miracle, yet it wasn't, because those doctors believed in him. Before other doctors said that he would never be able to bike, but his sponsors never gave up on him because they all believed in Lance Armstrong. After Chemotherapy he was riding again, but couldn't win a single race and was deciding to quite. Abruptly he won his first race after cancer and thought that he might win the Tour de France. He had remembered what someone had said to him a long time ago, \\"Lance your going to win the Tour de France one day.\\" He had trained for one year for the Tour de France and didn't compete in any other races; he just waited and waited for the Tour de France to draw nearer. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story but I really think you should read the inspirable book. One reason why I liked this book is because that it teaches you determination and the struggles that he had to go through, but he was confident that he was going to defeat the disease which he did. One thing that I liked about Lance Armstrong's writing is that it is really descriptive and it is a fast moving book, but that is just me. I also like books that are really inspirational and show nothing is impossible if you just put hard dedication into to it. I really think you should read this inspirational book that teaches you that nothing is impossible."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Several years ago a great mountaineer wrote that it any endurance athelete needs to be incredibly selfish to make it to the top of his or her game. To be the best, you must have no qualms about sucking the energy of the people who love you in order to feed your obsession. You can give them cars, homes, money, and your name, but your net worth to your family will always be diminished because you must love your sport more than you can love the people who love you.Mature atheletes acknowledge the human toll, either in the loneliness of trying to go it alone or in the broken people they often leave behind. Lance Armstrong has not reached point yet, so this book is just as interesting for what he leaves unsaid or misunderstood.We admire the strength, obsessiveness, and tenacity, the qualities Lance Armstrong personifies. Most readers can draw inspiration from his story and improve their lives by developing more strenght, obsessiveness, and tenacity. On the other hand, beware of trying to use this story as a model for living, unless you are willing to either pay the price or inflict it on others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My son has recently been diagnosed with testicular cancer.I bought the book for him, and he reads it over and over again.It prepared him for the surgery and gave him the courage toseek tratment at the cancer ceter in Illinois.The book was open and honest and gave him the support and courageto face the future.

Lance Armstrong's story is one of courage and human spirit. He met his cancer head on and never gave up. This is a book that will inspire you from the very beginning. As a cancer survivor myself I highly recommend this book as a must read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have always been a cycling fan. In college we would periodically ride 50+ miles on a Saturday and each week my bony backside reminded me of everyone one. Given that, and watching the Tour de France, I committed to read Lance's bio. In a word, I'm a fan; now, more than ever.Initially, what jumps out is Lance's scrappy writing style. It's refreshing; I loved that he was unafraid to identify the &quot;father figures&quot; in his life for what they were and were not. His devotion to his mom is pure and true. You can hear it in his narrative. His mom should think about writing a book about her own strength, tenacity, and dedication to being a great mom under very difficult circumstances.The second striking aspect is the man's amazing anatomy. His physiology and his tolerances for pain are unique. It doesn't hurt that he seemingly manufactures less lactic acid than the rest of us poor sods. However, I was struck by his quest for pain as a pure way to leave all the peripheral interruptions behind and to really focus on his job. That is the one aspect that has stayed with me. One can program one's thinking to see pain as focal point rather than a debilitating distraction. What a powerful and liberating feeling.His frank and story of the surgery and chemotherapy are gut wrenching (literally!) As well, the reader definitely wants the happy ending and is thus rewarded in this biography. His personal reflections of his emotional, physical and spiritual transformations after the cancer motivate this reader to cheer all the more. Good on ya Lance!

It is extremely well written, easy to read, and a &quot;can't-put-down&quot; kind of book! I found it had a great balance of technical details about bike racing (even though I'm no cyclist, it was easy to understand), but more importantly, Lance's emotions and feelings came through in EVERY chapter. His strength of character and will to live, and love of life was totally inspiring to me, as well as to my entire family who read this book (including 2 teenage sons who read very little!) We all loved it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book grabs you from the get-go and never lets go. It quickly pulls you into Lance's world, makes you feel the shock of learning about cancer, and makes you feel the struggle and pain of getting through it. Not for the squeamish, the descriptions get into gritty detail. The parts about racing really have you in the saddle--you can practically feel like you're straining up the mountain or screaming down the descent with Lance. A hard book to put down; great insight for fans of Lance as to his drive and personality, and an inspiration for everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long time.

It was a page turning book that never let you get bored. It wasn't just a book with no point it was a book with a moral. It taught me many different lessons and values. This book taught me that you can never give up and it made me think. When something in life happens, you can never give up whether it is a game or cancer. It didn't just teach me about Lance, it taught me about my inner strength and others inner strength(how you have to beleive in yourself and others and never let yourself or others quit).

Whether you ride bicycles or not, this book is an honest look at life through the eyes of a young man who has everything to live for and decided nothing, not even a life-threatening disease could keep him from his goals. He gives a lot of credit to his Mother, wife, friends and teammates. He never takes credit for having done it alone. Besides being inspirational, it was a facinating look into the world of bike racing, a subject I knew little about. Now I'm looking forward to being in Austin next year to watch the Ride of the Roses. Maybe I can't ride a bike anymore, but I'd love to be able to watch those who can and to help fund the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Put me on your mailing list."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Let me be the first one to admit that I know very little of the cycling world. I had heard of Lance Armstrong and I knew that he won the Tour de France. So I was a bit leery reading a book, much less a biography who normally would never even hit my radar screen, but I have learned my lesson. This book just blew me away, it capitivated me in a way that only a good book can. It moved me, made me think, and made me feel grateful. If only for that short time I felt I really knew Lance and I was right there with him -- pulling for him the whole time. He was open, outright and honest in this book and it was was written in a respectful and responsible manner. For readers like myself, I feel thankful that Lance chose to share his story with us. It was touching and I'd truly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that means something and can teach you something too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you think you're not the &quot;autobiography&quot; type -- think again! As the title states, it's not just about the bike. As a rider however; I thought it was neat to get the athlete's perspective on the Tour, as well as the type of training Lance endured. It's an easy read and would make a great gift book for anyone who is living with/has survived cancer, come from a single parent home or loves riding."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The odds are part of the result, not the direct indicator; Lance Armstrong -- fellow Austinite -- proves that. When you're expected by all to give up, don't. As Lance's mom says: &quot;Son, you never give up.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not one for reading biographies, I read this book in two days. It has all the elements of a great story.....rags to riches....overcoming adversity....love interest, and a wonderfully happy ending that continues on as Lance recently won his second tour. A great story of survival about one of the greatest athletes of our time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"At first I thought &quot;what a cocky person, with attitude&quot; but as I discovered later in the book, that without that attitude, as he battles cancer, Lance would be dead today. I wish I had this book eight years ago before my dad died of cancer, Lance would have made me ask more questions and demand more answers from the doctors that my family thought we could trust. Lance is remarkable and I pray that his inspiration spreads across the world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very interesting book and well written, I read it from cover to back and must say that normally I am not too interested in biographies as a whole, but this one was exceptional. Though the book takes you through the life of Lance, from his immature, spoiled and manic upbringing to his overall success in the 1999 Tour de France; it really isn't about Lance at all, but about survivorship against cancer. You come away with the distinct feeling that this event in his life changed him forever as a person to where he stopped thinking about himself to where he has started to think about others...i.e. his cancer foundation. I never thought I would read a story about cancer and its effects on people until I picked this one up. Unfortunately, the only reason I did was because I am myself a cyclist and have watched Lance's career as well as other's in cycling blossom in the US in the last decade. Don't make that your reason for reading this book. EXCELLENT, kudos to the writer...!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having been on on again/off again fan of the Tour de France and knowing who Lance Armstrong is from his win last year, I purchased this book during this years race and read it while avidly following his progress.Lance is not afraid to share the most intimate details of his experience with cancer and this book touched me in ways few books have in my lifetime. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in sports and a place in their heart for the abilities of man to overcome any obstacle and achieve.I more fully appreciate the difficulty of bicycle racing and have more appreciation for the difficulties faced by those stricken with cancer having read this book. Well written, and thoughtful, even tear-jerking in spots, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; has an important message for everyone. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in 48Hrs! Truly the most inspirational story Ive ever read. Waiting for the movie."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book I didn't know who Lance Armstrong was, except by name. Lance very candidly tells the story of his struggles with testicular and brain cancer. He is a man of true respect and honor. His writing is simple, compelling, and motivating. By one Doctor's estimate, Lance had less than a 3% chance in surving cancer, yet he did just that. His personal battles and in depth writing about his testicular cancer is informative and much needed. Lance is a true champion. It is apparent more through the words he speaks/writes, than the races he has won. I would recommend this to anyone and I feel very fortunate to have greater insight into truly a remarkable man and American. The challenge now to me, and the other readers, is to live our lives with as much passion as Lance Armstrong. Read this book! God Bless him and his family. It would be an honor to count someone such as he, a friend.RK Powers"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's attempt to share his psychological and physical battles with professional cycling and cancer is very interesting and emotional. I found him to be honest and insightful. He allows you to see his many sides: brash, bold, cocky, vulnerable, sensitive, frightened, invincible. I think that this book is quite valuable because Mr. Armstong emphasizes the hardest part of his battle with cancer: being a survivor. I would recommend this book to anyone who hopes to better understand the emotions associated with having cancer or anyone who simply wants to know how Lance Armstrong achieved his impossible accomplishments."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As increadible as Lance Armstrong's third consecutive Tour De France victory is, it pales in comparison to his victory over cancer. Lance himself has said on numerous occasions that the Tour is much easier than the horrific cancer treatments he was forced to endure, and when you read this book, you'll believe him. &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; is a truly enjoyable read. It is the type of book you can sit down and blaze through in an afternoon, or, if you want a more leisurly pace, over the course of three or four evenings. It gives a brief account of Armstrong's rise to success as well as some insider information into some of his more impressive early victories. Then it descendes into the painful world of a cancer patient. As impressive as Armstrong's cycling victories are, you almost begin to forget that part of his life as you learn about what the cancer treatments put him through. By the time the cancer victory has been achieved, the Tour De France win seems more like icing on the cake than the real achievement. Lance Armstrong is an increadibly interesting personality that the general public knows almost nothing about. As an athlete, what he is doing on the pavement is almost unprecidented. He is starting to have the apperance of, not just a Tour winner, but one of the great men. It seems he has the potential to go after the record 5th or even 6th tour win (a feat no other racer has achieved). In Lance's book you see what it takes, both on the physical and mental side of the equation. Like all endurance athletes, Lance had, before cancer, displayed an awesome ability to fight off infection. He simply has a body that can take a tremendous amount of abuse and come through strong. But you get the sense as you read, that what cancer did for Lance was further temper an already iron will. He learned a level of discipline that almost goes on human potential and he learned it because he had to to survive. Although he undoubtably has always had the body to be a tour winner, cancer strengthened his will to the point where he is now almost unbeatable. It is a shame that the American media pays so little attention to the Tour De France. The race is bar none the most difficult sporting event in the world. Many of the top professional athletes in the world are unable to finish not because of injury but simply because they can't physically go on. This is not something you see in any other event. Armstrong's victories are a testament to iron will and meticulous preperation. The argument could be made that he is the greatest athlete America has ever produced. A three-peat in the tour puts him in an elite group of only a handful of racers that have participated in an event that has been going on for a hundred years. Combine this with the fact that Armstrong battled back against horrific cancer treatments that often totaly destroy the body of the patient, and you have a story that is simply miraculous. There is no greater example of the human spirit, or the American spirit than Lance Armstrong. It is simply a sin that he is not spoken of with the same godlike reverence that accompanies Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods. If you want to make up for this in some small way, take it upon yourself to learn about the man yourself. This is a story that every American should know."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I would have never bought this book, simply because I am not a cyclist. A friend had it on their coffee table, and once I opened it, I could not put it down. I usually was an Oprah book club reader occasionally, and always bored by the monotony of non-fiction I could not relate to. But, I am a fellow Austinite and I hear all about Lance and his trials - from Texas Monthly magazine's article and newspapers statewide to coffee shop talk. We all know about him. Nothing really prepared me for the dynamics of Lance Armstrong. By reading this book, I was able to get inside the head of this incredible athlete. He drew pictures of his struggles and his rags-to-riches life so simply. He really is a great writer! More importantly, this book is not about cycling essentially - it is about his cancer and how it changed his life - everything. I find it to be an awesome page-turner, and I recommend it to all my friends. Go Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is Lance Armstrong's story through the first Tour De France victory.I admit, cycling does (did) not particularly interest me. That confessed, I have followed the Tour De France from the days of Greg LeMond enough to know who wins.Armstrong's story of growing up with a single parent, surviving cancer, falling in love, winning the Tour De France and having a child is detailed in \\"It's Not about the Bike\\" and is riveting in its frankness. Armstrong does not attempt to be politically correct and his humanity touches the reader.I have had this book sitting unread on my bookshelf for several years. That is regrettable.I was slightly amused and then saddened when reading passages in the book about Kristen, Lance's love, wife and mother of his three children. The fairytale is only slightly blemished by Lance moving onto to another love.Five stars."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"The truth is that cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me. I don't know why I got the illness, but it did wonders for me, and I wouldn't want to walk away from it. Why would I want to change, even for a day, the most important and shaping event in my life?\\"This single quote could summarize this most remarkable book, by an equally remarkable man. After reading this book, (in which I stayed up until it was finished), I am just totally amazed at Lance's guts, determination and strength in fighting testicular cancer, which should have, according to the poor odds against him (less than 3%), killed him. Lance, instead of becoming a victim, chose instead to be survivor!Here a story of inspiration that will bring tears to your eyes, tears of compassion, joy and triumph. This is one man's story of incredible challenge of digging down deep for inner resources in managing and conquering cancer. Lance refused to become a statistic and instead rallied and became cancer's worst enemy. He refused to give in and chose to fight the disease with all that he had. I admire his love and admiration for his mother, who continues to be one of his strengths in his life. He was fortunate, as well, to have loving friends support him throughout his entire ordeal.\\"The one thing the illness has convinced me of beyond all doubt - more than any experience I've had as an athlete - is that we are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometime only emerge in crisis. So, if there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it's meant to improve us.\\"The book chronicles the emotional and physical changes Lance undergoes as he triumphs over cancer as well as his emotional coping both during and after. This is a book of true courage and determination. Lance set up a foundation to help other cancer patients manage and survive their cancer. Lance lives his mother's inspiration of \\"make every obstacle an opportunity.\\"Lance proves that the power of the mind, combined with taking control of one's disease, seeking different opinions and doctors, and becoming an expert on the topic can help one overcome and conquer cancer.This is book is an excellent, poignant and emotional testimony to one man's faith and determination. Finishing this book, I have nothing short of admiration for Lance Armstrong. Thanks Lance for being an inspiration to everyone and with your work with cancer patients. The world needs more role models like yourself!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The basic story here is awfully familiar : healthy, cocky, young athlete is stricken with cancer and faces a fight for his life. But what's truly remarkable is how differently the story ends than those we've become used to over the years. Just thirty years ago, in Brian's Song, the story revolved around the courage and grace with which Brian Piccolo, a 26 year old football player for the Chicago Bears, struggled against certain doom, and how he touched the lives of those around him. Today, not only did Lance Armstrong survive testicular cancer--the same cancer that killed Piccolo--he was actually able to return to championship bike racing and win that Tour de France thing. Nor is this a rarity, there are numerous other pro athletes who have survived cancer and returned to compete at a level at least equal to where they were prior to their illness. In fact, it is almost tempting to become blas&eacute; about such stories.So the great service that Armstrong provides here is to detail just how frightening it still is to face such a disease, no matter the survival rate. In particular, the rather gory detail he goes into about the manifestations of the cancer, and the treatment process, serves as a helpful reminder of the psychological, as well as physical, costs that survivors pay even as they return to health. Modern medicine is capable of some amazing things, but it still requires a healthy dose of the human spirit to overcome illness. Lance Armstrong is nothing if not spirited.The book may not turn you into a cycling fan--it didn't me. But it will more than likely get you to root for Lance Armstrong, and the other brave folks who have fought back, successfully, against cancer.GRADE : B"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A story of an incredibly egocentric, arrogant, selfish and immature man, who manages to haul himself up to the emotional level of a late-adolescent. And he's proud of it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's story is truly incredible. It taught me too never give up or take no for an answer. Never lose hope. It is an especially great book for athletes, but anyone could draw inspiration from it. I did not, however, like the way Lance came off in the book. He seemed really cocky and self-centered. The book also was not very well written. Overall, this book was very inspirational and thought-provoking but had the potential to be much much more.*This book may not be a good one for readers with particularly weak stomachs.**Some mature content and language is used in the book and may not be appropriate for younger readers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you want to know all about cycling, if you want to have an inside, in-depth look at the world of cycling, this is not your book, read the newer one that was published in 2004.But if you want to go inside the mind of Lance Armstrong, if you want to understand what it is like to go through cancer, and what it is like to survive after your chances of living were one in five, if you want to understand the grit it takes to win the Tour De'France, then this is your book.Lance Armstrong takes you through his childless fatherhood with a mother that supported him every step of the way. He takes you to himself as a teenager, winning triathlons while competing against older men, he takes you to himself as a young cycler, bull-headed, but full of promise, he takes you into the hospital, where nurses hook him up to bags of chemicals so strong doctors need gloves to handle it. He then takes you through his long trip on the road to recovery, and victory in the Tour.A great book, and I strongly recommend you follow it up with the recent Armstrong book written by Daniel Coyle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's not about the bike\\", like the title said, is not only about racing, but also about life generally .In the book you are going to read about fear, courage, support, friendship, love and victory. You'll find all of the feelings that anyone always meets in your life, makes Lance a human being like everyone. In this book, he's sending us a message about how life can be full of challenges and if we make up our mind we can be surprised about what we can do. You'll find a lot of great quotations like \\"make every obstacle an opportunity\\" etc. which can be very instructive in your life.This book was my first autobiography and I'm glad that I read it, because immediately after you finished reading your life is going to be very inspired.I also like the style of the writing because everybody can read without any difficulties. The messages are very strong and frank. I didn't know anything about Lance, now it's like I always knew him. This year I wish he'd win the Tour de France, but this time I'm going to follow all the stages of the race."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished the audio cassette version. Having recently gone through a cancer fight with my mother-in-law, I can relate to Mr. Armstrong's incredible struggle against the odds. His experiences with surgery, chemo, blood marker counts, all sounded so familiar. No one would blame him for giving up racing, but to come back and actually WIN the Tour De France...Lance is an inspiration to all cancer patients and their families, to never give up hope. Very well done, Mr. Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's journey back to life is indeed incredible. I was expecting a sob story where a cancer patient recounts his life, blah, blah, blah. Instead, this book offered a fine balance between the melancholy and the actual fight he put up. I am amazed by his determination. This just reinforces the fact that with determination, everything is possible. This is especially so in the part where he described how he was determined not to be sick and even went cycling when he was undergoing chemo! How many people can do that?!This is a very touching book and I highly recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book has shown me what tough is all about. Lance was able to express what he went through so well. It is a book that will really put comfort in your soul and yet give you a feeling of reality. It explains the joy, pain, and suffering that his life endured. It is a keeper on my bookshelf. When I read this book, I couldn't put it down. I read it in a matter of a few days. Mr. Armstrong shows us what life is like for cancer patients all over the world in this book. It is a \\"must get\\" book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with Testicular cancer in December 2001. I am still going through the treatment right now. I was given this book as a gift from some thoughtful friends. I gobbled it up.Sadly, the Medical community provides little information about coping and dealing with this disease. Lance's book helped me to understand the disease from a survivors perspective and helped to comfort and motivate me during a time of great personal concern. In addition his website dedicated to the disease is extremely helpful and informative.Although having testicular cancer has made this book particularly personal, I found it to be an excellent read from a human interest perspective and would gladly recommend it to others (who could care less about the cancer aspect) just for the entertainment value of learning about this incredible person and his incredible life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins hold nothing back in telling this story about cancer survival.

Dont be a quitter."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book helps put life in a healthy perspective. Actually, I picked up this book while I was in the midst of reading &quot;The Survivor Personality.&quot; While the latter book is good, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; masterfully shows what it's like to be not only a survivor...but a thriver. It helped me change my attitude about some challenges that really amounted to nothing more than &quot;mole hills.&quot; The book tells more about what it has taken for Armstrong to succeed than some reviews have indicated. Yes, he has natural physiological advantages. But so do all professional athletes. Lance does not have physiological advantages over all of his competitors. The book shows that he has learned to plan, execute his plan...and work his butt off. Does this mean that Armstong has the personality that many people wish he had? No. And the rest of us have personality flaws, too. I much prefer to read about people--especially sports stars and other celebrities--as they are, not as we would like to idealize them. This makes the book's message (about what it takes to become a survivor) much more relevant to me. Most everyone will love this book. You don't have to be a bicycle rider or sports fan. Riding with Armstong down Alps road on a bike at 70 miles per hour...with only a few feet of visibility...moves you into a differernt world. Readers who are offended by occasional expletives are the only ones who should steer clear of this terrific book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What makes this book most powerful is that the author is not afraid to admit his faults and mistakes. You certainly don't end up thinking he is perfect (sometimes you believe his wife should be nominated for friendship).Yet when you finish, what really blows you away is the there really is a sports hero! With so many mindless sports bios where they make claims as to how many thousand women they have slept with, or why their 25 drug arrests were actually mistakes,or the whining that there hotel suite wasn't as good as the next guy, here is a guy with not only ability, but courage and honor to match.A friend gave me this book because I was a very serious cyclist. I probably would not have bought this book on my own, sports bios put me to sleep.As I was working on reading this book, the Tour de France was on, and I would tell my 4 year old that this is the kind of person she should grow up to be. The back story here is so powerful, it had me in tears when I saw him pull ahead of Jan Ulrich in his 3rd tour.This book is more than a good read, it is a great service because the story is one of hope, and the victory has very little to do with biking."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an amazingly well written/well edited book by an athlete who manages to inspire us while staying a regular guy. I was really pleased to see how readable the book was, and even more pleased to read about the ethics of a man who has overcome great obstacles while keeping focused on a very difficult goal. We don't have many athletes to point to when trying to show our children a well-balanced, high-achieving adult. Lance Armstrong fits the bill.I would recommend this book to cancer patients and survivors, to those interested in bicycle racing, to kids needing a book to use for a report on heroes, to single parents needing encouragement (Armstrong's mother was a single parent), and to readers in general who need an inspirational story to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A very interesting book about one of the greatest modern Americans.

Once I picked it up I read it all the way through in two days and really enjoyed hearing his story in his words. One voice among many that have hard times in life, a real encouragement to perservere everything that comes along in life and keep your dreams alive.

My mother had cancer and I knew what it takes to overcome such a setback, but Lance Armstrong turned his life around and never gave up what he enjoyed doing. I have a new love for cycling and if Lance Armstrong can win the Tour de France after cancer, I can quit being lazy and do something in my life too. Thanks Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a three-time winner of the Tour de France, an achievement that in itself is extremely praiseworthy. But what is amazing about Armstrong's victories is that he achieved them after recovering from cancer - at one stage the doctors had believed his chances of recovery were less than 20%. It's Not About the Bike is the story of Armstrong's life - his growing up, his riding, his becoming a father. Most of all, it is about his battle with cancer, and how it changed him for the better.Don't fear - this is not some airy-fairy new-age hope story. Armstrong is very down to earth about the whole process that he went through, and is not afraid to share details (gory, icky details). This book achieves a lot that other autobiographies miss - he drops some pretty big names and doesn't shy away from comparing himself from the greats in cycling, yet you never feel he is boasting. You get a lot of detail - what goes into chemo treatments; a run through of his 1999 ride of the Tour de France - but it never feels boring or superfluous. Rather, Armstrong comes across as a guy that manages to be amazing and reassuringly normal at the same time - he likes to kick back and drink beer, he loves his Mother, he is proud of being a Dad. He just happens to be one of the greatest sports people competing today, and after reading this book you realise how hard he works to be so good.You don't need to be a cyclist to enjoy this book - while there are sections on his riding, nothing is too technical, and all cycling terms used are explained. As the title says - it's not about the bike. It is about an amazing man that went to hell and back, and made the best of the second chance he was given. I guarantee this book will manage to make you laugh, make you think and inspire you all in the same reading. And there's not much more you can ask from in a book than that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is the a Tour D France champion. Lance Armstrong is a cancer survivor. Between those two headlines is a very courageous and complicated American hero. The first person narrative takes you from boyhood to today with emphasis on his struggle to survive and his subsequent struggle in a comeback. What makes this book special is the self-awareness and spriritual perspective he shares from his experience. I was inspired and tearful as he won his third Tour, knowing his road to Paris was a greater challenge than most spectators imagined."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I started reading this book for an english project... but I loved the book.

I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great book. Of course, I am a huge fan of Bicycle Road Racing, and Lance in general, so I am hugely biased. It is an excellent book, and well written. Even the non-cyclist can appreciate the story. It is tremendously uplifting and positive."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I couldn't put this book down after I started reading it. I applaud Lance's mother for the courage she displayed from the beginning. I can see why Lance had the ability to overcome the cancer, because his mother raised him to be a winner. For a 17 year old girl to become the mom to a champion doesn't just happen! Mom's a stud! I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to believe in miracles!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Cancer survivor, two-time Tour De France Winner, world-class athlete. I guess I was expecting more from the book. I came away sorely disappointed. Armstrong came across as an arrogant, insensitive, unsympathetic jerk. 275 pages of him bitching and complaining about one thing or another. Spoiled, rich, good looks...and zero personality. His story should be a compelling read but I found it entirely too self-indulgent. He has no faith. He has incredible wealth. He, unlike a lot of people, could afford the best cancer doctor money could buy. He was damn lucky to survive. BTW, I'm a theraputic foster parent, adoptive parent, and plain old parent. My wife and I currently have seven children at home. The children who cross our doorstep have been abused, neglected, and abandoned. We fight a daily struggle to keep these kids on an even keel. Their story is a thousand times more compelling than Armstrong's. According to Lance, no one is as great as Lance. No one, that is, except the millions of abused and neglected foster children in the Unites States, who fight a daily battle for survival and the hope of a &quot;normal&quot; childhood. Lance, as an American, I was proud of your personal and professional accomplishments. Your book did not make me less proud, but did give me an insight into the bitter person you are. I'm sorry for you and all of those you come in touch with."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'll admit it; I am in awe of Lance Armstrong and his athletic achievements. Like many great athletes however, it seemed to me like he had sacrificed part of being a regular guy in his pursuit of greatness. Lance had sometime appeared aloof and singularly focused. Having read this book you see a decidedly different portrait of the athlete as a human being growing up, starting a career, starting a family and probably most importantly fighting and winning his battle against cancer.Particularly poignant to me was his detailed account of his early life growing up with a single mom. I admire his honesty and openness in recounting the outsider mentality that sometimes gets applied to those whose family picture does not fit the description. Being a cycling fan, his story of success in the sport was very intriguing giving a good glimpse of his abnormal gifts of strength and determination. Many define Lance's battle with cancer as heroic. After reading the book its obvious he saw it as purely a battle for his life. Like everyone, Lance had a lot to live for and fought as hard as he could to keep it. His depiction of the disease and the treatment really expose the raw wound of illness that most of us turn away from. Lance's story reminds us that people suffer greatly each day just trying to stay alive. If anything, it gets you to feel some compassion that you may not have felt without stopping to hear the stories. Lance's heroism comes in his courage to tell his story honestly and continual work to use his celebrity to raise funds in support of cancer patients."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent, well written book.I didn't want to put this book down! Lance Armstrong is amazing the things that he has lived through! Absolutely must read!! highly recommended"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is one of the best and only books I have read. This book is a fantastic book and definitely a must read. Lance is not arrogant and self-centered, like other review writers have said he did lose to the best in the world. This story starts out with him being a child and like me his sport is disrespected by other high school students. Then he becomes one of the best bikers in the world, but soon after his rise to fame, he gets cancer. This story is extremely inspirational and intense. Even though you know he is going to win the Tour De France. He obviously overcomes his Testicular cancer and wins six, yes six Tour De Frances. He will not make it to seven because he is not mentally focused. He is thinking about retiring. Lance is a great preson for people to admire. He maybe one of the most inspirational people alive today. You may know the story, but not like he depicts it. He gives you lots of details like the chemicals they used in his Chemo (chp. 6). If you have not read this book then your life is not complete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book in a few hours during a trip to Europe this summer. Lance is a competitor and it comes through loud and clear through his book. I especially enjoyed reading about his training regimens and how much time he has to put in to win races. The majority of this book however, focused on how Lance battled and beat Cancer. I think Lance is very inspirational and causes everyone to not live like they have no tomorrow. This book is entertaining, inspiring, and a great portrayal of the greatest cyclist in history. Thanks Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I picked this book up I knew the same amount about his form of cancer and international bike racing - that is to say nothing. I became interested in him after he recently won his 4th Tour de France. I was thinking the book would be one of those super positive books that came close to a self-help text. I was wrong, the book was very interesting and detailed his problems without the sticky sweet self-help overlay. I did not expect the detail though on all his medical procedures, all I can say is that I hope I never have half of this done to me. I really enjoyed the detail he goes into on the training and all the pain that he goes through. He also very down to earth, I wonder just how raw the book would have been if not for professional writer he hired.I also thought that his real personality comes through, that is the hard charger that is very sure of him self. I guess one would either have to be or being at the top of your profession makes you that way. This ego, for lack of a better word, was the only real negative I found with the book. Overall it was a very interesting and uplifting book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a good book. As an athlete and a person, I appreciated the inspirational qualities of Lance's story. The descriptions of his battle w/cancer are harrowing, but important for understanding the devestation of illness. I was disappointed, however, with Armstrong's attitude. His arrogance quickly became old. I pity the people who were the brunt of his wrath."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, so very ill with cancer, survived it. An amazing and very personal story of his struggle with the disease and with his upbringing. Yeah for his mom, his friends and his wife, who were/are great supporters! The book, hard to put down, describes how he rediscovers his life through a trememdous ordeal. Very inspiring -- he just doesn't give up!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Speaking as the parent of a young man fighting cancer, this book is a powerful weapon that Lance has given those who face cancer. He does not sugercoat the rigors of treatment, nor recovery. He tells how he overcame the same obstacles facing every cancer survivor. His words shout &quot;hope&quot;. Our culture is still stuck in the belief that a diagnosis of cancer means death, or at the least, permanent disability. But Lance Armstrong shakes off that belief and tells how he climbs back on his bike and back into his life. The gift of hope that he provides with his story is well worth the price of the book for anyone fighting to climb out of the black hole of cancer treatment."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I value Lance Armstrong's story, he is a driven and talented athlete who has had to battle through a life threatening illness. The story is incredible but you wish that Lance wouldn't be so in love with his own story!Humility is the virtue that Lance needs most. Maybe that could be his next focus. I'm sure if he put his mind to it, he could tone down his ego. He accomplishes every thing he puts his mind too..... maybe improve his writing as well...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So I'm reviewer 187. You'll probably never meet Lance in your life, so this is the next best thing. You'll get to know Lance and the courageous mother behind (ahead of?) him. Lance will inspire you. I'd like to meet his mother as well as him. Take a weekend to read this book. Work was annoying, while reading it, even eating was inconvenient. Lance is the American story and shed light on the America I like to hear about: that there are some people out there that do their darndest to be the best at what they do and are willing to pay that price. Made me look at myself and wonder how I was doing with my life. Not a page wasted!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just went through with my grandmother 3 months of radiation. And to a certain extent i understand how Lance Armstrong felt. His book is heartwarming and made me feel like i was with him every part of his chemo treatments. I was even interested in how he dealt with his having to bank semen if he ever wanted children. He made everything very matter of fact and not to be ashamed of. This fact above everything else in this book is what people should come out with. Nothing is wrong with the human body. Yes it is true that a person shouldn't shout out from the roof top how they bank semen, but by Lance telling his story it levels the playing field. I think how matter of fact he tells his story will help others not feel so superior and help other ppl goign through cancer see that their is hope. Thank you,Shani Apter"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I quite honestly felt the book dragged a little bit in the early stages -- kinda like a bike race. However, the more I read the more I couldn't put it down. This is truly a moving story. If you never believed in miracles, Lance Armstrong story will change your mind. The title is perfect, It's Not About the Bike -- the trails this book takes you has the reader breaking at every curve. How much can one man take? I am amazed that Lance has managed to keep his sanity. What an inspiration -- GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before you crack this book, you must make a pact with yourself to put it down after each chapter unless you are a quick read and have the time. There will be times that you fight against this notion, and there are times that you will lose and end up reading multiple chapters.You Are There because the voice is &quot;real&quot;, the details of Lance's life are open, and believable.If you know someone with cancer, this is a good read for both you and your acquaintance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I finished this book easily in two days. It's very easy to ready, and flows very well.The only thing I didn't like about the book is that Lance sometimes uses phrases that make him seem like a teen-ager."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a kid, Lance had issues. He grew up on the wrong side of the Dallas tracks with a mother who coddled him. He played catch with flamming tennis balls, and terrorized the streets in his Camaro IROC. He nursed his grudges. But along the way he discovered a world class talent in endurance sports,(his VO2 rates are still the highest ever recorded at the Cooper Clinic)and began successfully competing in triathalons and bike races. Focusing his angry energy and prodigious talent on cycling, he became a world class champion. Then the cancer struck and Lance had a whole new battle to fight. It's Not About the Bike interested me because along with the great sports story, Lance reveals a lively intelligence and some real humility. He knows that fate played just as big a role in his life as his indomitable will. His book reads well and has a nice flow to it. I gave it four stars because while it is not a classic, it is certainly one of the better sports autobiographies around."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For the last two years Lance Armstrong has captured victory at the Tour de France. In It's Not About The Bike, he captures the heart and soul of his readers. Rarely has an athlete's depiction of his struggles been more moving. Rarely has an athlete's depiction of his ultimate victory been more compelling. Armstrong's focus is his victory (physically, psycologically and spiritually)over life-threatenting cancer. His oddessy to beat this deadly disease is well crafted, easy to consume, and rewarding to complete. Oh and by the way, he wins a big race too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong in his book recounts the transformation that happened in his life out of finding out at age 25 that he had very advanced testicular cancer. Incredibly, he was able to beat very unfavorable odds and come through cancer free. The cancer in his case seems to have worked as a tool that helped him transform and wake up to the richness of his life. He discovered how loved and supported he was by his family and friends, he discovered and was able to appreciate the dedication and incredible talent of others who collaborated to save his life, he discovered his inner resources and his passion for living, he rediscovered his love for the Bike which he was taking for granted... Out of this experience he won the Big Price: Huge professional success and a very fulfilling and loving marriage. If you are interested in transformational experiences and in discovering the state of being where success, love, satisfaction, self expression and aliveness reside, I highly recommend that you also read the book WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book is a gem and it delivers all the keys to personal transformation and enlightenment. I highly recommend it to anybody who, like Lance Armstrong, is willing to challenge the limits of what we think it is possible to make happen in our lives."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a fast, easy and enjoyable read. All I knew about Lance Armstrong before reading the book was what everybody knows about him -- 1999 Tour le France winner and cancer survivor. This book is a glimpse to the &quot;man behind the athelete&quot; or a glimpse of the humanity that makes up Lance Armstrong. I was touched by his honesty on every subject he wrote about. Reading about his upbringing and how close he is to his mother, about meeting and falling in love with his wife (Kik) and about the conception and birth of his son speaks as the completeness of Mr. Armstrong. Highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's story is one of true inspiration and is a must read for everyone. This book is not just for athletes or sports buffs; Lance discusses his childhood, his career, his fight against cancer and his quest to have a family. He tells his story honestly and openly. You feel his struggles and his triumphs. His explaination of medical and cycling jargon not only makes the book understandable but is educational.This story was so well told that I couldn't put it down. A tremendous, memorable story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading this book I felt motivated. Motivated to do anything. The feeling of the previous reviews also shed the same light as I felt. I would recommend this book to anyone over 15. It has some language and parts that may not be suitable for children. I learned a lot about life, death, bikes, racing, and even childbirth. I also learned much about Lance. I had an unrealistic opinion about him, but after reading the book, I realized that Lance is only human. Lance, I am praying for you!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance personifies a typical Texan. He tells a great story while not leaving out the details. Highly recommended. All I can say is How about them apples!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book demystified Lance Armstrong for me. I always thought of him as super-human, whose career was a result of incredibly fortunate DNA. While he is DNA gifted, he is also extremely dedicated to his sport, and very much human. Inspirational without being corny, and a fast read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My parents actually advised that I read this book when I was really not understanding certain essential parts of life. Reading was never something I did before this, but since completing this book, I read a book almost every week. You don't have to know anything about cycling at all to understand this book - it's not what it's about. It's about an incredible story where an astounding athlete is torn apart by cancer, and how he picks himself up off his feet. I strongly advise you read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not since I read To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee when I was in middle school have I been emotionally transformed by a piece of literature. I knew nothing of Lance Armstrong (wasn't he some guy who rode a bike?) nor his ordeal with cancer until I read It's Not About the Bike. I will forever be changed by this book. The inspiration in his story, the determination in his words and the transformation of his character have etched a permanent place in my spirit. Robin Williams said it best- Lance and his creation of this book will \\"kick you in the heart.\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The concept of this book is simple : Lance wrote down the story of his life.The way it's being told and the comments Lance makes on everything most certainly improve the quality of the book. Although it's clear Lance isn't exactly a world class writer (as opposed to a rider), it reads easy and once you begin reading it, it won't let go of you. Personally, I was reading until 4:30am when my body was simply giving up... if it hadn't, I would have finished to book during the night.The story itself is great, but not because it was invented, but because it's a true story, a story with beauty and uglyness, where we can discover the true Lance Armstrong, with his weaknesses and problems.

Are you a bike fan, battling cancer or know someone who is or has, interested in the sports world, or just looking for a good story about someone who battles a tough time in their life and still comes out ok? Here's a good story for you. Lance Armstrong, a guy who rose up to become a good competitive proffesional bicyclist and was stunned with the news that he has cancer. This is the story of his life, how he handled the battle with cancer, and the ways that his life has changed in the years since then."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's story is one of incredible courage. The story is extremely well told. The passages on his cancer treatment were gut wrenching. There is no doubt in my mind that he is quite simply the greatest athlete in the world today. My wife and daughter read this and enjoyed it as much as I did,"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have a simple review for this book. It is not about bicycling. For the most part it is about love and determination. Lance goes from having almost no chance at all for survival to winning the hardest bike race in the world. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The cover says it all...Winner of the Tour de France;Cancer survivor;Husband;Father;Son;Human being.Or, translated into Yiddish, mensch.This is not as self-serving as one might suspect. Armstrong comes across as a multifaceted and a complex person notwithstanding the overwhelming focus and singularity of purpose needed survive cancer and go on to win the Tour, not once, but as it turns out, seven times.It's Not About the Bike provides insight into his greatness and inspiration for other survivors. It's also well written, and makes for an engaging read.Few memoirs are as compelling. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was eager to read this book, I saw Lance on several t.v. shows, his battle with cancer interested me because my mom also had cancer at an early age (29), so I bought the book with the hope of learning what made him strong, wondering: how can he inspire others? Well, the first half was pretty good, I was amazed at how much the cancer took over his body and the grueling recovery. I was in awe of Kik and how she stood by him, along thinking he was a humble,family man. I was wrong. The latter part of the book indeed was \\"all about the bike\\" going on and on about all the prep for the upcoming races, the TDF (the biggest, most prestigous bike race), the move to Europe (for the bike) and all the proper cycling terms...ho hum. I almost left that part unread, but I hate doing that, so I trudged on. I was sad to find out later after having read the book, that he no longer was with Kik and his children, but doing just spendidly peddling away and loving his singlehood.I think in writing this book I only learned that for Lance it IS about the bike (and himself). He seems cold, egotistical and unappreciative of those who sacrificed for him. Is that what it takes to get to the top??"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book has been one of the most inspirational books that I have ever read. Now whenever I'm at the gym I just say to myself, come on mike if Lance can do it so can you. I raced bicycles myself when I was younger and after breaking my collarbone at sixteen years old I thought biking was over for me; If only I realized at that age a broken bone was nothing compared to Lance. Thank you Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am absolutely floored by how well-written this book is. Once I picked it up I just couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in an evening. As in all great writing, the story just unfolds completely naturally, told in a way that seems effortless. Tears welled up in my eyes as I came to the end of this book. I can't remember the last time a book had this effect on me. Definitely read this book! It will change how you live your life. I'm so glad I picked up this book at a used book store on a whim.I can't believe how realistic his descriptions are of everything, especially his inner monologues as he is racing. Every race is packed with detail--it made me feel as if I was there listening in on his communications during races. I also have a newfound appreciation for cycling.Cancer survivors say things like \\"Getting cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" I could never fathom how someone could truly mean that. I still can't say I understand it, but, after reading this book, I can get a sense of what it might feel like to say that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have to say this is one of the better autobios I've read. Lance lets you into his head and helps you to understand what it is like to bike a hundred and some miles a day, as well as how he dealt with cancer and the side effects he went through. After reading this, I have a growing respect for the man as well as the athlete named Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Firstly let me start this off by saying that the spin class at my local gym terrifies me - so in no way do I qualify as someone who has ever had anything to do with bike riding. In fact, on my copy of this book it said that Lance had won the Tour de France three times - which I thought was pretty cool not knowing he'd kept it up 1999 - 2005. So, my point is that obviously my cycling knowledge isn't the best but that's one of the amazing things about this book. It didn't need to be. I was never bored with the cycling regime Lance had to go through, I was constantly uplifted by the descriptions of the races and I was even fascinated by his diet. I picked up this book not because I had a love of cycling or even a sparse knowledge, I honestly picked it up because I was having a bad week and I wanted to read about someone who had gone through something infinitely worse and survived... no triumphed. I read this book in 2 days the last day involving me shutting out everything and curling up in my bean bag reading like a crazy woman - I was captivated at every stage of the way. It's written in a down to earth style, for real people wanting an amazing insight into a phenomenal journey. If you can't take away lessons from this book to incorporate into your own life you're not reading the same book I was.Advance to Go, Collect $1 Million"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First, a disclaimer. I am a huge fan of Lance Armstrong. I think he is one of the best athletes that America has produced, and a real 'rags to riches' man. Like many such men, he has his faults and issues.About the book . . .Its an extremely inspiring story of a driven athelete, his close brush with death, and return to life. It's a life-changing book.It's Not About the Bike is particularly useful for anyone recovering from a severe illness and then moving beyond thier disease to excel at atheletics. After 2 or 3 critical illnesses in the past three years, I credit my general good fitness to keeping me out of the grave, and this book gave me the inspiration to achieve that fitness, even when I wanted to quit.Others have found it similarly inspiring, so much so I bought extra copies and hand them out as needed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I read this Thai tranlated version , I did not know Lance and bicycle.

It delves deep into the realms of the human spirit, against the worst of odds. Lance Armstrong isn't just the single greatest athlete of our generation, hes an American hero, and he beat cancer. Yes, he did not just survive, he defeated it, and proved it can be done. I have never had cancer, I have never fought against unbelieveble odds.

Fantastic Read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life.\\" by Lance Armstrong is truly inspiriting. In the book Lance writes about his life, from the time of his adventurous childhood all the way threw his defeat of cancer. In his story, he tells of his diagnosis, treatment and recovery without holding any details back to show the true extent of his illness. In the story, Lance tries to convey that although he is most commonly known as a world class cyclist he would rather be known as a cancer survivor who beat the odds. I really enjoyed reading Lance's story. Some parts I was laughing, while other times I was on the verge of crying. There is not one part of the book that I didn't enjoy. I recommend this book for everybody to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book i felt as though Lance Armstrong was an amazing man-overcoming cancer, wining the tour de france 6 times. As i began the book i still symapthised for him, but as i read further it came apparent to me at how conceited mr amrstong is. Anytime he lost it was alywas to \\"the best in the world\\" and \\"he had given his absolute best and there was nothing he could do\\". It seems as tohught he cant admit his faults. With all his talk aobut his wife and how amazing she was, why did he divorce her?

After reading his book, I can honestly say I dont think I've heard of a more arrogant, self centered, childish jerk. Ever. He's a hothead, and has no concept of how to treat other human beings. Although he may not be involved in any sexual assaults or homicides(like other athletes in the news), he exhibits zero class, much less maturity. I know this not from some unauthorized biography or news account, but from HIS book, his OWN words. Considering what he's been thru, it's truly shocking. And he's completely oblivious.As for the structure of the book. It's good. It's a quick read. One may get somewhat beaten down by the lengthy details of his cancer treatments. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but after all that is the subject of the book. Needless to say, his recovery was remarkable.I enjoyed learning of his early riding experiences and his meteoric rise to international stardom in such a short period. However, now I'll never be able to look at him the same again...or cheer for him. He is not a good man. Although Lance will tell you otherwise.

I don't know all of the facts surrounding his personal life, but my wife did go through in-vetro fertilization. It is an incredibly uncomfortable and invasive procedure for women.

Lance's medical recovery and skills as an international champion cyclist are beyond refute.However, the book is marketed as something more than simply a sports memoir. Unfortunately, Lance's humility and personal transformation aren't convincing. The manner in which Lance lashed out at the employee at a golf shop, proudly labeling his wife a &quot;stud,&quot; and accelerating his automobile past 100 mph when &quot;Kik&quot; went into labor left me with the impression that he's still an obsessive, self-centered, macho jock.In my opinion, Lance's effectiveness as a positive role model should indeed &quot;not be about the bike.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A good telling of a great story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not what I expected at all!

It was fascinating to read about an athlete's relationship with his body, or to learn that even super-star athletes sometimes look upon going to work as just another job that has to be done. This book is extremely well-written, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The title offers a satisfactory narration on Lance Armstrong's life, both as a young adult and as a cycling professional. This is not particularly inspiring, but I do get something after hearing how he was dealing with his crisis.Oliver Wyman, the man who reads the book in the audio edition, has done an excellent job. His reading vividly illustrates the emotion Lance has had during different stages of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent Book.Lance is amazing.Buy it, read it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a triathlete I've always been interested in Lance the cyclist (who used to be a triathlete) and never really cared for Lance the man. In fact, there are few professional athletes that I care to understanding outside of their sports realm as they are usually arrogant. Though it is their arrogance that makes them such great athletes. That was until a friend recommended I read his book. Wow! His story of survival is truly an inspiration to us all. Forget about the 3 tour victories. Here is a man who understands that we need to cherish every moment we have and take life full force. Be it good or bad, this is the only life we have so make the best of it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a great read and Lance is quite an inspiration.. and yes, he can be slightly arrogant at times..but we all have our faults. I read this book in a day and have since reccommended it to family/friends. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong comes across as a very honest and strong person. I'd be honored to meet him. The book has a great balance between the tale of his cancer, his athletic achievements, and his family. I wonder what Armstrong will do with his life next; one can't see him resting after his cycling career."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book has many words written about his fight on cancer. It has also detailed descriptions about how the disease affected his life and his perspective of life. It is well-written in a very direct way which can be very inspirational and emotional to readers. This book scores well from the inspirational side, especially on how he recovered from the disease.For cycling enthusiast who would like to know about his Tour de France races and conquest, there are about 50 pages of stories, with scant reference to other cycling greats like Indurain, Zuelle, Escartin etc. How I wish it were more detailed and more references because this are the parts which are most exciting to read.At the end of the day, many of us know Lance as a cyclist and this is what we like to look forward in his next book........"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was truly am inspiration! Not many people have the courage to fight back as he did. It was a wonderfully in-depth look at real life for a person stricken with cancer. He has a no-holds-barred approach to every page. He writes with passion and attacks the story aggressively! A must read, especially for those who enjoy biking, wether mountain biking or the Tour de France!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a fan of cycling but I am a fan of humanity so when I was given this book I thought I'd give it a try. I always was truly inspired by Lance's story so I was quite suprised that the book truly changed my feelings about him. To start off with his ego which is as big as the Pyrnees he conquered, truly stands ot on almost every page. If I highlighted every instance where he tells you how great and wonderful he is my pen would have run out of ink halfway through. There is a point where his wife basically asks him what he is going to do with his life after he beat the cancer and has done nothing but golf everyday. She says &quot; I'm so bored so tell me so I Know if I should get a job or not&quot; He is quoted as thinking &quot;Normally nobody talks to me like that&quot; HUH? You mean nobody speaks their mind to him because he's a complete control freak. That's just one instance of many people tiptoing around him.This is just another story of some overprivileged athlete.The only thing different is that he survived cancer with oh by the way instances of favoritism by docters and Oakley strongarming their health insurance company to pick up his coverage. Hate to tell you but you or I would have died given the same prognosis.Oh if you think this review is garbage than tell me why Lance went Hollywood, dumped his wife and kids and now dates Cheryl Crow and Sandra Bullock. The same wife he pledged his love to over and over and over in this book. He's a piece of garbage and I hope he loses the next tour."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quick arrival at a great price. Does the job perfect and the sellers were great to work with. I would buy it agian."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book purchase was advertised as new. When it arrived the glue had separated from the spine. I contacted the seller, and they refunded my purchase and suggested I might donate the book. Good customer service, but not new condition."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in one day, it's very hard to put down. It Starts with Lance as a child in Texas developing a love for cycling and endurance sports, his career as a cyclist, finding out about his cancer, the treatment, the start of his family, and finally ends with the Tour. The section about Chemo was informative and inspiring. He focuses on beating the cancer just like one achieves any other goal. It really shows what the human spirit can overcome. It doesn't get too far into Biology of cancer, but that makes it more appealing to the average reader. I could really relate to the book being a runner because there's a similar mentality between cycling and running. You don't have to be a cancer survivor to be inspired by the book. almost anyone can take the \\"never give up\\" mentality and apply it to their own life. The title is a bit misleading because there is a lot of cycling talk. Overall though it's a real page turner and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book was in great shape and there was No damage. It shipped in a timely manner and you could not beat the cost.Thanks"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a must read for cancer survivors, the most inspirational book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book really kept me spellbound and I could hardly put it down.Although never a big Amstrong fan, my love of the sport has certainly allowed significant interest in the biggest star since Indurain.I loved the book. I loved the comeback. This is real hero stuff.Enjoy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thought it was an awsome book"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book directly from Mr. Marcus after his appearance at an all-star seminar here in Boston. For someone who has accomplished so much and is a rising self-improvement guru, he was very humble and quite easy to talk to; these characteristics are evident in his book in that it is a pleasure to read and learn at the same time. In my opinion, Marcus' greatest asset is that he examines all of his failures in life and uses the experience from them to keep on a course towards success. That is something that I am trying to do now and the book has helped a great deal. I also signed up for his free e-newsletter at cmarcus.com and it is extremely helpful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very enlighten book. A must read for anyone dealing with cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a very detailed novel of Lance Armstrongs childhood, cancer survivorship and his life after cancer. I thought this book was excellent and it gives a new perspective on life. The way this book was written, it made me feel like I was really close to Lance Armstrong and I could almost relate to his feelings and emotions through the whole story, even though I have never had cancer. After I had read the book, I felt like I wanted to read more about Lances life. I would recomend this book for someone that likes true stories, or someone who would like a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For all you who read biographies, this should be on the top of your list. And for you who don't read biographies, this should also be on the top of your list. I have not had cancer, and I am not a cyclist, but this book certainly kept me interested. The book goes through his life from when he was a kid, to when he had cancer, all the way to being a father. Lance Armstrong had gone through chemo for cancer, and one would think his career as an athlete would be over. But he struggled through training and fought hard. It all paid off when he passed the finish line at the Tour de France as the winner. This is a book of true inspiration, and for one man, a journey back to life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an outstanding book, wonderfully moving and uplifting. Lance goes full tilt in everything and in this book he doesn't hold back - you live his journey and it is a harrowing, steadfast, intense, remarkable story. It is beautifully written -personal, honest, full of laughter and tears. I could not put it down and was astonished at his strength of spirit, intelligence, determination, and sheer chutzpah! He gives you such a sense of how to cope when the worst you can imagine happens and of the indomitability of the human spirit. I loved it - don't miss it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a very strong and intelligent guy. He was also a bicycle rider. He never gave up for anything, even though he got sick, and he stood to fight the disease. His cancer drove him crazy, and Lance beat it in his body. He was a cancer survivor, and he had a lot of energy to fight with it. Even though he hnew it was a strong disease, he wasn't scared of it, and he believed someday he will be healthy again, ride the bicycle, and do activities he did before."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I can say many good things about this book, and write a list of reasons why you must read it, but I'm pretty sure that it's better if you find your own reasons. You won't be sorry to invest your time in it, you'll just enjoy it. What I can tell you about my personal experience reading Lance's narration &quot;He's inspiration&quot;. He's a sample of human potential, how far a human being can go if he or she wants. Also he can teach you that waiting for things is not going to help you in life. He made me think not only what I'm doing for me as well as what I'm doing for others . Like him I want to change the world from my inside and I hope , I won't experience the same suffering that he did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a student from NYC Technical College. I study English as a second language and in this semester our teacher picked this book. &lt; It's not about the bike&gt; By: Lance Armstrong. I think she made a good choice for the class because some times we read together, we shared ideas, and we enjoyed reading this book. My opinion about Lance is that he is a perfect example for others with any obstacles in their lives. Lance fought against his cancer and emerged with victory. He won his dreams because he won the Tour de France. He had a second chance in his life and he was approaching this opportunity. I want to see him racing his bike again in a competition. Maybe I will read his second book if he writes another and follow his new life with his wife and his son. I encourage others to read this book based on real life and how he won the fight: &quot; Lance vs cancer &quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I sat down to read this book in the afternoon and stood back up at 11pm. I plowed strait through it! As a cyclist, I found it a fascinating read, but as a person his message regarding life and the lessons that cancer and &quot;growing up&quot; taught him were very valuable. A must have!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you are expecting to find the answers to life's questions, you might be disappointed. If you want a damn good read, to be inspired by bravery and a story of personal growth, better understand professional cycling and cyclists and not put the book down for a day or two, you'll enjoy this very much as I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I got this book on Thursday night and I've already read it twice in the first week!Lance Armstrong's story, told in this book, will grab you from the first page and not let go until the last page. But this story is not just about him, it's about every survivor who found the courage, determination and strength to battle death and disease... win or lose.It is not surprising that battling cancer changed his life. The fact that he boldly states that it was the best thing to happen to him, and then describes why, is the part of the book you'll appreciate most.After reading this book, I keep hoping that I can someday develop the perspective on life he has, without having to face death to do it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspiring publication. Worthy and noteful; to be read repeatedly through out one's life. There were several times I related Lance's contextual experiences to the Old Testament book of Job: Enduring much, but keeping faith. A book of this nature belongs in environments where growth and development issues abound."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband read this book out loud to me in a day and a half. Once he started, I wouldn't let him stop reading. I cannot think of a better book to encourage teenagers to read. There is a true American Hero alive and well today - his name is Lance Armstrong. He embodies everything good about the human spirit, and he wrote a great book, too!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love a good inspirational story, and this is among the best. It takes a while to build sympathy for Armstrong, however, as he comes across with a brash, in-your-face storytelling style at first; it took me a while to warm to it. His account of learning he has cancer and the brutal treatment is dramatic and sobering, and you share in his pain. More importantly, you share in his strength and you are convinced he would return to cycling despite his protestations. Like Greg LeMond, who survived a hunting accident and went on to win the Tour de France, Armstrong's story is moving and the satisfaction is ultimate when he takes the &quot;maillot jaune&quot; (the leader's jersey in the Tour) for good. Probably the best athlete autobiography I've ever read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As someone dealing with a cancer diagnosis myself, my motivation in reading this book is obvious. I wasn't disappointed. Lance, as a cancer survivor, delivers a story which inspires both admiration and emulation.From his first descriptions of his tenacious and spirited mother to the account of the birth of his son Luke, Armstrong provides the requisite insight into the aspects of his character which drove him to become one of the world's most impressive and honorable athletes. Central to the climactic winning of the 1999 Tour de France (and the followup encore of 2000) is his battle with testicular cancer, his recovery, the loss and eventual recovery of love of his sport, his indefatigable will to win, and the amazing loyalty of his friends and family.His survival story, like his early wins of the Tour de France, is as much about the team surrounding him as the intensity of his own personal efforts.If there is anything about the book which bothered me at all, it was the nagging curiosity about the role of his co-writer, Sally Jenkins. When I read autobiography, I assume the imagery, metaphors, plot development, and narrative structure come directly from the author, not the co-author or ghost writer. I couldn't help but wonder how much of what I was reading was the product of Sally Jenkin's creativity and how much was owing directly to Lance.But whatever the answer to that question might be, this book remains one of the best choices available for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"How would you like to be stuck in a hospital bed, vomiting for three months? Lace Armstrong led a normal life as a kid. He never knew his real birth father, he just knew his name. His mother remarried twice, becoming single in the end. Her first husband, was mean to Lance for the worst reasons. If Lance left a sock hanging out of his drawer, he would meet the paddle. From elementry to middle school Lance was not athletic. He never excelled in any of the sports that involve a ball. In high school he finnally discovered swimming. He wasn't very good, but he hired a coach that made him the best in the state. There was a running race at school. His Mom gave him a silver dollar for good luck, and told him he was racing the clock, not the people. Lance won first place in that. There was a bike shop on his block, where he got his first bike. Amazingly, he was a natural. When other kids challenged him for a race, he wouldn't just beat them, he would whoop them. Later on, he decided to enter a triathlon. He won against people in their 30's, he was in high school. Lance entered in Triathlons all around the state, he was soon the best........After he was diagnosed with cancer, he went to three hospitals. He decided to take kemo at the Valpo University Hospital in Indiana. They were the only people who changed the operation so he could get back on the bike. The cancer had spread from his lungs to his brain. First they preformed surgery on his brain, removing the non-spreading tumors. Then through a period of 3 months he under-went massive kemo. When it was over he married a woman named Kristen (Kik). After that he proceeded to France where he entered in a bike race to make a come-back. Very soon he dropped out of the race not sure if he really wanted to cycle for the rest of his life. After lots of encouragement, and training, he finnaly entered in the Tour de France. He obviously won with flying colors. Not soon after, Kik was pregnant with their first child Luke. After he was born, Lance entered in yet another Tour de France, winning again. He now decided to train for the olympics. Unfortunately, while training he broke his neck. While it was healing he still trained, but he wasn't strong enough to win the Olympics...he took home the bronze. This was an educational, entertaining, and inspiring book to read, and I would reccomend it to anyone.This book had a lot of action in it. Lance was training so intensly, that sometimes it was more action filled to read about him training than it was to read about him in the race. During his second Tour de France there was a man that called himself \\"Pirate\\" that was allways hot on Lance's tail. On one race to the finish line (for a stage) Lance said that he would let him beat him, but the man thought he said something else. They ended up sprinting to the finish, each insulting the other horably. When Lance was a young rider, he wasn't very polite. During races, you would read about him cussing people out then zipping past him. Actually, that happened in all of his young races.This book also made me worry a lot. I worried about if Lance would make it, or if he'd die. One time during the Tour de France, a spectator stepped out, Lance barely missed him almost costing him a few seconds. Or when Lance broke his neck, not many people live after breaking their neck.This book was also fun to read. As I said before Lance did a lot of cussing before he had cancer. Like in the Tour of the Mediteranean, Lance cussed out a greatly known Italian biker Moreno Argentin. It was fun to read about the times when the doctor came in to say \\"Our last ex-ray shows there is no more cancer left in your body.\\" Or when Lance finnaly got back on his bike after surbviving cancer. He went through a trama after cancer, and he wanted to retire, but when he went on a bike ride one day and realized that he loved biking it was very cool.I enjoyed this book so much, it was funny, I learned things from it, and it made me want to do things I never thought I would or could do.A.Lindemann"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished reading the book as the Tour de France entered its final stages this week and Lance Armstrong is pursuing his fifth consecutive victory. Needless to say, I have never been a cycling fan until now. I have never cared much about the examples celebrity athletes provide until now. And I am not one to put athletes on a pedestal...until now. More than his words or his cycling accomplishments, his story of surviving cancer would set anyone apart and make them worthy of such attention.Lance Armstrong, through Sally Jenkins, successfully brings together the best in autobiographical writing, motivational writing, insights into the world of competitive cycling, and gives the reader much to think about in the end.I have read a few books on the power of positive thinking and healing to know that Lance has put it all together here. Thanks Lance and Sally."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 49. My father died of cancer at the age of 52. I was beyond stunned or numb. Catatonic would have been a relief. An attending Doctor and bicycling enthusiast, recommended this book to me at the time of my greatest fears and doubts. As I read what this other Texan went through when dealing with a most undesireable period of his life, I found myself getting stronger and more determined to find a way to beat this temporary diversion. Lance Armstrong's epiphany moment with the doctors in Bloomington Indiana, has become the touchstone for everything I now encounter. My Doctor friend echoed this same theory from the book: Anyone, regardless of their position, education or authority, who is not positively contributing to your overall success; fire em'! Life is about what you determine to make it, and what you can make it for others. We don't have time to waste on pithy, trivial \\"what if's\\" or \\"maybes\\" or \\"but I might fail\\". We may not have control over everything that happens to us in our lives, but we don't have to simply lay down and take it either!I am now 51 years old and recovering quite well from my cancer experience. I now believe that a cancer diagnosis is not a death sentence, but negative or limited thinking can be. Lance Armstrong has my most profound gratitude for having the guts to speak his mind on a subject few people even want to acknowledge; the value of every day in this life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When Lance Armstrong was an up and coming rider, I always thought he had such a cocky attitude (some is good, too much is bad). But this book puts alot ot that in perspective and helps me to understand how a man can overcome adversity, change his life, succeed when no one thinks he can, and become a change person. Lance Armstrong is not a saint, and some of the critiscsms from earlier reviews are unnecessary, but neither are many of us and that's why the book is so good."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong certainly is an inspiration to us all I found this book very profound. Lance Armstrong shows us his journey. He deals with his entire life like a champion. He shows his human side, that he is not always perfect, and that things are not always easy. The one thing he show us the best is that he never gives up no matter how much he may want to. He takes each day as it comes and does his best not to get ahead of himself.Another book I really enjoyed is &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane It is about living in the moment and I found it simply delightful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's story is a great inspiration. The story is more about surviving cancer than biking. Some of the detail on cancer treatment may be a little much for some people. But this is one of those books that makes you stop and think how fortunate you are and inspires you to think about those less fortunate. I just wish he had included contact information for his foundation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you can read this book without becoming caught up in Armstrong's struggle and inspiration, you're a pretty tough nut--if I can use that expression in this context. Huge kudos to Sally Jenkins for telling Lance's story without diluting any of his true voice and character. The book is extremely well-written and riveting from the first words. Whether you are an avid cycling fan or not, this a story of human drama that transcends the pro sport aspect and becomes simply a tale told beautifully--no holds barred."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is the most enjoyable I ever read because it's about a famous biker and I never knew about him until I read it. He is a strong guy and when he was a boy he was adventurous with his training. And he is fighting cancer.So it's a very interesting story. You must read this book and you will learn more about the winner of the Tour de France."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book.This book was interesting because Lance's life was like a race. He won many races When he was young, but the enemy, which is Cancer changed his life when he started fighting against it.At that time,the time his life was slower and also his thought towards life changed.Lance saw life in a different way after he won the race against Cancer.Finally he devoted himself to his community.The foundation&quot;Ride for the Roses&quot; is a special foundation to help people with Cancer.I think Lance followed one of the ten commandments&quot; Love your neighbor like you love yourself.&quot;I recommend this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I finished Lance's book &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;. Lance has to tell us two sides of his life. One is the sports-man and another is the fighter-man. As cancer survivor he had to fight that illness, while he tries to race again. This illness affected him and he made changes in his life. But after he fought it, he turned into a man with a great family. -Life is beautiful, specialty when you have this things: parents, a fiance and children- you became part of human life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I started to read this book.I didn't believe a person who had brain surgery recovered like Lance Armstrong,but after I read this book,I'm convinced this will happen.I like his relationship with his mother.I think all we do with love can be positive like Lance's mother did.She gives courage and she never leave him alone,when he needs her support,she suffered but she never showed him.In my opinion the cancer was devasting to Lance but the cancer changed his life too.Also I like what Lance does to help other people who suffer like he suffered.I think he gives hope and good life lessons."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book can show you how a disease can change somebody's life, in this case Lance Armstrong's. You can see how he changed from a non-sweet and non-caring person to a sweet, caring and kind person. He changed his view of life, the way of looking at people around him, and the way that he coped with the chemo. You can see his passion for cycling and how he struggled with it after the chemo. You will laugh, cry and you will live and feel with him every single memory that he is giving you. He is a symbol that inspires COURAGE to keep going and not to quit. This is Lance Armstrong, the man who did consider himself as a &quot;Wave&quot; before, but now he considers himself as a &quot;part of the ocean&quot;(&quot;We are no waves, we are part of the ocean&quot; it is a aphorism form the book &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;. It touched me a lot because it means that we are not by ourselves or alone in this life. We are part of the humanity that during our lives we need someone beside us)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved this book and learned some about how terrible cancer is, how hard bicycling is, and how to create his miracle baby, Luke with IVF.

Excellent reading"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'll start by noting that I am not a cyclist. That said, I highly recommend Armstrong and Jenkins work. They paint a gripping picture of Armstrong's battle with cancer and chemo while giving the reader great insight into the doubts and fears he had during that time. They also show the critical role his medical team, mother, &quot;stud&quot; wife, and friends played in his recovery. I was captivated by his story and made to truly empathize with his plight as I read. And I'll cheer for him now as he chases a third Tour de France title. I also found the text on his post-cancer training regime to be extremely informative and it convinced this reader, for one, that he is winning the right way. Perhaps the French press ought to give this book a read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One must honor this guy. And you have to love this book. Here's the story of a teenage smart aleck who transformed himself into an authentic human being. Basically, that echoes every kid's journey into adulthood. But not everyone becomes a first rank athlete and gets cancer along the way. Testicular cancer transformed Lance Armstrong into a mentsh. Thank god, luck, chance, and science he survived. His are the lessons for being a better man.Bikes are for kids but this isn't a kids' book. It's difficult, even excruciating, when we witness the physically weakened cyclist -- in the company of his mother and his devoted friend Lisa -- seeking and then enduring the medical torture that supported his survival. Yet it's part of an uplifting lifestory. Armstrong was secretly given a 2% chance of survival. To his credit he had a child's ability to ignore the odds and percentages. &quot;I had two options, medically and emotionally: Give up, or fight like hell. I had no other choice but to hope.&quot;Although I've made it clear this isn't a children's book, I can't resist thinking that writer Sally Jenkins does for Armstrong what E.B. White's Charlotte did for Wilbur. Charlotte &quot;wrote&quot; in her spoked web the saving words that hailed Wilbur to the world as &quot;Some Pig.&quot; Jenkins introduces the reader to the sensibility of a world-class human being who is some man: A caring, responsible, and brave adult.Lance Armstrong isn't a saint. But, as you will discover by the last page of this life enhancing sports biography, he knows how to offer comfort in the dark.Picture a teenage boy pedaling his bike out into the Texas countryside -- under open skies, hope rising off the ground. In a few days, we will have the opportunity to see that kid's adult incarnation competing with his Amerikan teammates in the 2000 Olympic Games. Good luck to him, them -- and all of us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you thought you liked Lance Armstrong before this book, you will fall in love with him after you read this book. If you want to be inspired, truly inspired, read this book. It's not about bicycles, it's about life and what can happen to you, to me, to anyone. It's about survival, failure, truth and identity. You will also not put it down. Run, do not walk to the nearest bookstore, (or online store) and buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers here that Armstrong comes across as very headstrong at times, and is not exactly modest about his achievements. But I'm sure that's exactly the reason why he came back from cancer to win seven Tours De France. If nothing else, this autobiography demonstrates the incredible self-belief, confidence, and downright pig-headedness that are necessary to succeed as an elite athlete.There are basically three parts to the book: the first and third dealing with cycling, and the second a more personal study of his cancer and his then-wife Kik's attempts to conceive via IVF.The most interesting parts of the cycling sections are the discussion of tactics and the hierarchical structure of each team. Every person in team cycling has a specific role, and Armstrong goes into some detail describing the various strategies that each team, and each individual within the team, employs. Armstrong portrays himself as someone who started riding purely out of anger and boredom, and it is only gradually that he develops the experience, focus, and discipline to become a truly great rider, culminating in his Tour de France wins. Another interesting aspect is the almost gentlemanly traditions of the European classics, such as not winning too many stages yourself, allowing other riders to win their home Stage, or not attacking when the leader is making a \\"pit stop\\".The second part of the book deals with his cancer, treatment and recovery. And here, we see Armstrong's bull-headedness work against him; the symptoms of testicular cancer with brain/lung mets were there for a while, but it was only when his swollen testicles affected his riding that he admitted something was wrong. His descriptions of the side-effects of chemo, the helpless frustration of remission, and his aborted first attempt at a comeback are very affecting . Another eye-opening part of the book deals with he and his then-wife Kik's attempts to conceive via IVF; it's certainly not a simple process, and what Kik goes through in the way of injections and examinations is quite disturbing. To be honest, I think it's pretty poor that Lance (by now back cycling) couldn't be around more to support her, given her support for him during his remission.Armstrong is certainly no shrinking violet, and you can call his enormous self-confidence and belief \\"arrogance\\" if you want. But \`Not About The Bike' puts a human face on Armstrong's machine-like determination, and presents quite a well-rounded picture of the man. He's certainly not perfect, but he is interesting, and that's all that counts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this book up 9 years after the copyright date. Worth the read? Absolutely. Not because it is a well-written book; it is not particularly. Not because Armstrong's attitudes and resentments make for a warm and fuzzy story; they are, though, the bedrock of his success. The book will give you perspective about what can happen in the decade plus beyond a serious cancer diagnosis. Even if you are not a big cyclist fan, you can follow the 2009 Tour De France carrying with you with at least one version of the back story. It makes it infinitely more interesting.I particularly recommend this book for those who love someone at any stage of cancer diagnosis, treatment, or survivorship. Armstrong's response to cancer are the words of every man's and every woman's journey through this disease. Sometimes verbatim. I have just seen an extremely close friend through a cancer diagnosis and treatment and, like most of us, know far too many people who are coping with this disease. I have underlined every phrase spoken in the book that my friend has also spoken. My book is heavily underlined. Armstrong may have more lung capacity, but their drive to kick cancer is equal. This is an extremely important message to those facing cancer and for those who love them."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After finishing this book, I sure had mixed emotions about this famous cyclist who has won the Tour de France seven times. This autobiography finishes with him winning his first Tour. A decent chunk of the book deals with his bout with cancer.In a nutshell, I came away from this book with an even-greater appreciation of the guts, dedication and talent - and honesty (he tells us exactly how he feels about things) of this famous athlete. I also came away with a lower opinion of him as a personality. He comes across as an immature, hot-tempered, selfish mama's boy.He seems to be a guy with plenty of friends and plenty of enemies, which is one reason he's such an interesting guy.....and the book is a good read. Props to him for making a very readable book. This was hard to put down, although parts of his descriptions of the chemotherapy treatments and such are horrifying and will haunt me for years.I still don't quite know what to think of Armstrong. He's a very complex man. Hopefully, one day he'll discover there's a He, not just a he (as in himself). Lance appears to be the kind of guy you love one minute, hate the next. A bunch of his ex-girlfriends can attest to that!One thing: that kind of guy makes for a fun read, so this book is highly-recommended, and not just for cycling fans. I'm not; I just like good autobiographies."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book begins: \\"I want to die at a hundred years old with an American flag on my back and the star of Texas on my helmet, after screaming down an Alpine descent on a bicycle at 75 miles per hour.\\" When I first read those words, I found the book impossible to put down.I purchased my first copy ofIt's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Liferight here four days after it was released in the spring of 2000, and read it immediately. I read many chapters of it to my youngest son over the following years, and we discussed its message even in his early grade school years. Lance Armstrong became a personal hero to him, as he has been to me.Have given this book as a gift, sometimes in itspaperback formand other times as a hardbound, and only once have I given it to a fellow cyclist -- it's often been to friends who have gone through a battle with cancer, either themselves or with someone close to them. And now I see that it's available here in aKindle Edition, so I'm sure that I'll be giving it again... and if I ever get my own Kindle, it's going to be the first book that I get in that media.I'm a cyclist of the mountain/trail bike variety, but as the title of the book says, \\"It's Not About the Bike.\\" I've never had cancer, but have had numerous close family members and friends who have been victims of this most dreaded disease, including my mother and my oldest son's mother. This is perhaps why I find Lance's story so inspirational. It's more than a story of his amazing athletic achievements and cancer recovery, this is a true story about the triumph of the inner self.Since the book was originally published, 'Maillot Jaune' (Lance's nickname in French for 'Yellow Jersey') has gone on to break so many cycling records. In his final tour before retirement in 2005, he crossed the finishing line on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es on July 24th to win his 7th consecutive Tour de France title. Since his retirement, he has focused his efforts on the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which provides support for people affected by cancer. And yes, I'm one of those who wears a yellowLIVESTRONG wristbandon a daily basis in support of his efforts.Lance has also written a moving and insightful follow-up to this book,Every Second Countswhich offers another facet to this inspirational athlete who is both motivated and motivating. And now we hear that Lance Armstrong, at age 37, will be making his pro-cycling comeback, and he's already in training, and put in 20-24 hours a week on the bike throughout October. He's pledged to continue with his national call to action on cancer prevention and survivorship program.If you're looking for a book about cycling, this isn't it. Read the title and that will tell you that. I found his message of optimism to be quite stirring, and hope that you will as well."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Whether or not you are a fan of Lance Armstrong, this book is incredibly helpful. Helpful for getting a grip on the implication of testicular cancer diagnosis and treatment. Also helpful for tackling the mental battle that comes with this disease. It is full of hope, and an important read for those diagnosed with Testicular cancer,and their significant others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is GREAT. But reading it in 2008 will give you the feeling the end is missing in this book. No Sheryl Crow and no seven tour victories. This book covers Lance's dealings with cancer and his bike up until his second tour victory.What I really admire about this book is the way it has been written. No subjects are pushed to the back and the man Armstrong really comes forward. His battle with testicular cancer has been known throughout the world, but when you read about it in great detail you can actually grasp his battle for the first time.This book can be a great gift. Ever catch a person whining about something trivial? Then make him humble by reading this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to LifeLance Armstrong's life changed greatly when he was diagnosed with stage three testicular cancer. His prognosis was not good because the cancer had spread to his lungs and brain. When Armstrong was told that his chance3s of survival were slim, he decided to fight the disease in ever way he could. He sought and received many different expertise opinions on how to treat the disease Armstrong gathered information and studied the disease so he was able to decide the best possible treatment for himself. Because of his cancer, Armstrong was forced to put his professional bicycling career on hold. After three months of intense chemotherapy, Lance's body positively responded to the chow, which successfully eliminated all cancer cells from his body.After Lance recovered from cancer, he began to train for the Tour de France in the challenging mountains of France. Armstrong's relentless determination and strong will propelled him back onto the international cycling circuit. The next stop for Lance would be the classic Tour de France. This book also explains the courting of Lance's wife and the birth of his son. It's Not About the Bike is an inspiring story about the spirit of Lance Armstrong's struggles and successes. You will walk away from this book with a true understanding of what strength and determination are."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not only is the book wonderfully written, it is eye-opening in every respect. Everybody knows somebody with cancer, but who really knows what they go through? This book brought me one step closer to understanding what it means to be a cancer patient. I was also fascinated by all the cycling references and stories. I finished it in 3 days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a huge Armstrong fan, and have been a fan of cycling for years. I really like this book by Lance, as it's honest, and real. Lance does have an ego, but it's one he's earned. He talks about his younger days, family, his mother, racing, and his struggle with cancer. At moment's he can be a bit unforgiving, and tend to think the worst possible things in people. Something about him seems distant, and hard to relate to. But, at times he's weak, open and honest. The book is interesting on many levels, him as a person, his childhood, racing, the sport iteself, cancer, and so much more. It's a great read. Lance is an American Legend already, and the book is written so that it's easily read, and is interesting. Like many American hero's Armstrong has had his share of difficulites to overcome, and look where he's gone in life. It's motivating!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a truely inspiration book. After reading what Lance Armstrong encounted through his child hood and battling his fight against cancer it shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most people know Lance Armstrong as the 2-time Tour de France Winner, but first and foremost, he is a Cancer Survivor. Whether you're into cycling or you are familiar with the struggle, mentally, emotionally, and physically, of battling cancer, this book will draw you into itself and not let go of you until you've finished it. It is written in a very conversational tone, which makes it very easy to read, and there are some good life-lessons to glean from his experience. You'll learn quite a bit about dealing with cancer, as well as a thing or two about the athletics and politics of bicycle racing. This is not just another athlete spending 200+ pages talking about himself - this guy has something worth saying ... and something worth reading."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the most challenging athlete's story I've read since Jabbar's GIANT STEPS. It is filled with wonderful juxtapositions. Armstrong is arrogant but honest, tremendously focused yet capable of shallow flightiness, loving and predatory. In other words, he proves to be thoroughly human.As a recreational cyclist and longtime fan of the sport, I followed with great interest the career of this young Texan. I remember hearing the devestating news of his illness and like many other people was shocked to witness perhaps the greatest comeback in sports history. This book gives the reader a behind-the-scenes perspective on these events. It is well-arranged and paced so that the inspired reader hits no dead spots. Don't, however, expect to find a completely likeable guy. Armstrong's competitive nature makes Michael Jordan look like, well, a boy scout."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is an excellent read. It is long on real-life and short on pity. There is a good look at life on a cycling/racing tour, something many Americans have never experienced. Lance Armstrong does a good job portraying his growth from a loud-mouthed, obnoxious teenager to a warm, caring adult. Although he does devote much of the book to his diagnosis, treatment and recovery from cancer, it is written in a matter-of-fact way, not a &quot;poor me&quot; way. He presents a good lesson in not ignoring unusual symptoms and getting to the doctor...had he done so when he first noticed changes in his body, he might have been spared much of the treatment agony he had to endure to save his life. This book is also a good lesson in exploring your treatment options, and seeking second, third, and even fourth opinions to save your life. This is an excellent book, easy to read, and gives us a realistic picture of the man behind the bike. Many good life lessons for all of us exist between the pages of this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A good read. Makes you think about your own life and values."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a survivor. It's that simple. His book recounts his tribulations and is extremely inspirational without being sappy.In the military it's important for warriors to read Prisoner Of War accounts so all will know that, if captured, ANY situation can be survived.Everyone should know and understand the trials of Holocaust survivors, not only to prevent a recurrence, but to learn from them. When your chips are down, you will always understand that people have survived much worse.Certainly there are cancer patients out there who will not survive, but where there is a glimmer of hope, Lance's book is a beacon in the abyss. Against the odds, he not only beat stage gazillion cancer, but went on to win the worlds most grueling athletic event. Twice!It's Not About the Bike is a fast read. You'll love it. It's too bad it took this horrific disease to turn America on to International Bicycle Racing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong has been through a lot in his life. This book is uplifting in that it shows how someone faced with one of the most dire situations - he was diagnosed with late stage testicular cancer - deals with the situation by relying on friends and family to pull through. However, he not only pulls through, he gets back in form to win the most grueling sporting event in the world, the Tour de France not once but twice. More interesting is the transformation that takes place in Lance's own outlook on life. He goes from being a brash, overconfident, naive young athlete to a man who learns that life is more than winning races. His priorities totally change and you enjoy the change in his character and priorities. If you enjoy reading about what it takes to win a major sporting event, or bicycling in general, or motivational stories you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As the title states...it's not about the bike. This is so inspiring that I recomend it for everyone. Everyone can learn and gain from this. It will raise the bar you are currently challenging yourself at both mental and physical. Even my roomate who spends most of his time in his room and can't even begin to think of competitive cycling could benifit from this. I hope he and anyone in the dumps reads and becomes a better more solid person. Lance is a true Amercian hero, as well as his wife, and many around him. As you'll learn, the top of the list, he is a &quot;Cancer Survivor&quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book speaks eloquently on many levels, and there are insightful lessons for everyone here. The difficulty of getting back to &quot;living&quot; after a battle with cancer, the disenfranchised feelings of a teenager in Plano, Texas, the value of one devoted parent, the grinding life of a professional athlete were all aspects I didn't expect from this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When i first brought this book i thought ok about a man who is a top class athlete who's going to rant about his life like other biographies then tell about how he got cancer, surveved and did the superman act and win the tour de france. From the first chapter i was so wrong. This was the life of a top class athlete. But also a winnner who beat everyone and everything. It is a story of courage will determination and bloody hard work. Parts of this journey are moving yet others in a way funny. The way in which Lance never gave up is somethinng the rest of us could all learn from and the way he fought back to the top an achievement worthy of any prize. But Lance already had his prize his life, his wife and son Luke. This book is a story of someones life and even though im a keen cyclist as the title says 'Its Not About The Bike', its also a brilliant journey of someones highs lows and the bits in between. A must buy this book WILL change your perception on life and other people."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong gives an incredibly moving and heart-wrenchingly honest account of what it's like to have cancer, to go through the unfathomable degradation of chemotherepy and to come out the other side. I went through much of what he specks of with my sister when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and my husband when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. While my sister did not survive the disease she left a gift for each of us who went through it beside her. Lance has given his readers the same gift. It is not something you can name but when you read the book you will recognize it. This is a must read for anyone who may ever encounter this horrifying disease in anyone they know. That would be just about all of us. You will cry, you will ache for Lance and all the millions of others who have gone through what he faced and you will feel joy for the triumph of each new day. Thank you, Lance for sharing your disease and survival with the rest of us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the autobiography of Lance Armstrong, now three time winner of the Tour de France, quite arguably the most grueling athletic event in the world. This is the story of how one man fought cancer and became &quot;the first American, riding an American-made bike, on an American team ever to win the Tour,&quot; catapulting the sport of cycling, before, a primarily European sport, into the awareness of Americans.In short, Lance was a promising biker when in 1996 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He went through brain surgery and difficult chemotherapy to eventually lick the disease, and then returned to biking to win the 1999 and 2000 Tour de France. (He's also won the 2001 Tour, but the book doesn't go that far.)But the book is not just about the cancer. For a reader who is new to bicycle racing, it makes a fairly good primer on racing, explaining the different events, the terminology, and the tactics; and introducing the reader to the big names in the sport. It is also a love story of how he met his wife, Kik, and goes almost as in-depth into the in-vitro fertilization process necessary to have their son, Luke, as it does into the cancer treatment.The book charts Lance's transformation from a young, brash competitor who usually angered the other racers, to a more disciplined, thinking stategist. It's also interesting to note that Lance, now considered the man to beat in the climbs, used to be a sprinter before the cancer transformed his body.The only thing that I found disappointing about this book is that Armstrong neither depends on a faith in God nor develops any through his ordeal, so it fails to be the inspirational story that I had hoped it would be. Despite that, I found the book very interesting, informative, and difficult to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The most inspiration story I have read in a long time. Lance Armstrong a world-class athlete nearly struck down by cancer, only to recover and win the Tour de France, the bicycle race famous for its grueling intensity is a winner by all accounts. As serious and difficult the race may be the race to defeat cancer is even more difficult. And that is the core of this book which includes serious medical detail from chemo to surgical procedures to his wife's in vitro fertilization, you won't be spared a single x-ray, IV drip, or unfortunate side effect. Lance Armstrong is a winner in regards to life, death, illness, family, medical setbacks, training setbacks and personal triumphs.

The first chapter is gripping, and clearly establishes the &quot;this is who I am, no apologies necessary&quot; tone. Even though you know how this story plays out, it's told with enough insight and detail to make it interesting. The recognition of growth moves this book a couple of notches above the standard self-congratulatory sports fare.Some phrasing is repetitious; &quot;X was great; they were there when I needed them&quot; appeared a few too many times (I get the idea!

Before we knew it, we had a bike-trailer for our son, panniers, backpacks, and a baby-seat for our daughter. Every weekend last summer was spent on a trail. On bikes we saw our home state of Massachusetts as we had never seen it before.We know nothing of professional biking. But we would buy an occasional biking magazine. The name \\"Lance Armstrong\\" came up in them again and again.I did not know he had cancer and, despite this past summer's publicity, the words, \\"Tour de France\\" meant nothing to me. But the title of his book, \\"It's Not About the Bike,\\" intrigued me. (The last thing I want to read about is bike racing.)In the book, Armstrong describes his denial of his physical symptoms. How he failed to tell a doctor friend about how much blood he coughed up in his sink. But a severely swelled testicle and the urging of the same doctor brought him a battery of tests. Within hours, this racing-star iron-man discovers not only that he is sick, but that he may soon be dead.But his fame works for him. On the advice of a letter received by an interested biking doctor, Armstrong begins to re-examine his cancer treatment. Eventually, an aggressive series of treatments that would destroy his lungs is abandoned for a treatment that might not only save his life, but also put him back in the literal saddle.It is at this point in the book that as a reader, you realize that we continue to be captains of our own lives, even when we are extremely vulnerable. Under no circumstances is there a clear set of \\"answers,\\" even when renowned experts give us those answers.As a cancer patient, Armstrong had to be vigilant and continue to persevere more so than he had to in any race. Armstrong was a biker known to push his body beyond all limits. But to save his own life he would have to push his mind and body to levels he had never before known.But Armstrong is not alone. He has a devoted mother, a girlfriend, good biking community friends, teams of doctors, and even strangers interested in his care. It is this combination that probably not only saves his life, but saves his biking career as well.The place where I was a little annoyed with the book is when he goes to France with his new wife. He rambles on about how his pregnant wife Kik understood it when he had a bad day at work. (Riding.)\\"If we both hadn't been equally committed to the life style it would not have worked.\\" He may as well said if they both were not committed to \\"me\\" it would not have worked. He goes on:\\"Unlike me, he (a fellow biking friend) had no one to come home to in Europe. When he returned from a race or training camp he came back to an empty apartment, and some times spoiled milk. I had fresh laundry, a clean house, a cat and dog and everything I needed to eat.\\"The fact that her issues, being pregnant via in-vitro fertilization (high risk), leaving her career, leaving her town and her country, received no consideration because she had to make sure that Lance's milk was off the counter and in the fridge seemed obscene to me.Lance Armstrong seems to have an invincibility charged by the inability to focus on anything but Lance and by surrounding himself by others only concerned with Lance. (At least in his presence.) The cancer set him back, reminding him that despite his amazing lung and athletic capacity, he is still made of flesh and bone.Still, despite his self-absorption, there is something likeable about this man and certainly undeniably amazing about what he did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"this book has inspired me to be the best that i can no matter what happens in my life. with me being a male, this has shown me that something as big as testicular cancer can take something huge away and put it in the back of your mind for a long time. anyone who needs some inspiration in their life needs to read this book. it was a little shocking at first since lance was so young when all of this stuff happened to him. however i was very inspired to be the best person that i can be even if there is a lot of tough stuff that comes up in my life. if anyone is going through some tough times, whether it is cancer, death, divorce, or any other issue, read this book because you will be inspired to be the most positive person and come out on top of things when everything is back to being that way that it was before all of the bad things happened.

It isn't often that I encounter someone that I would like to meet in the books I read, but he is definitely on my list. It would be an honor to know him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm not a big reader, but I read this one pretty fast and I was thrilled! I have never been close to a cancer patient. That's why I wonder, if cancer is such a common desease, why then all this information is so new to almost everyone. After reading the book, Lance is like a brother to you, and you'll never look at a bike the same way again. Congratulations for this great book Lance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cyclist, I followed the tragedy of cancer and the triumph in the Tour de France of Lance Armstrong closely. Fortunately, this book has so much more detail of the true struggle he, his friends, and family faced during the days, weeks, months and years following his diagnosis with testicular cancer. The openness about his fears and how he overcame them make this book a volume of encouragement to anyone facing severe illness. Cancer definitely &quot;picked the wrong body to live in&quot; and Lance's own words will show you why. The book has just enough cycling jargon for the non-cyclist to understand what he is talking about, but not so much that it reads like a technical guide to cycling. An exceptional book, easy to read and hard to put down. I read mine in 3 days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By the end of the book the reader feels as if he has walked a mile in a cancer patients shoes. Obviously, the struggle a cancer patient faces is greater than most of us will ever experience. However the author does an excellent job to realistically describe the daily regimen of a cancer patient. This is an uplifting book that stirs the empowering thoughts we all have within us. The only disappointment I have is that Mr. Armstrong went to great length to describe in detail how reckless he can be while riding his bicycle. I only hope that the younger readers will disregard Mr. Armstong's tendancies to speed through intersections with caution thrown to the wind. I also am hopeful that Mr. Armstrong has now realized just how precious life is and that he will change his behavior."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Things may change fast in your life as this book shows. But you are what you think you are and you become what you think you become. Lance shows that it is true. If you think your life leads nowhere or you are bored by it, then read this book.

Reading this book really makes you appreciate life and encourages you to keep fighting and never give up hope, whatever your situation.I thoroughly recommend this book.Carpe Diem."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book does not cut any corners. Lance is completely honest and forward with all aspects of his life. The detail in the cancer treatment section was amazing. Lance seems pretty full of himself. Not without reason though. He is the best rider out there and he has beaten cancer, and he will not let you forget it. It was a very interesting book and I ripped through it very quickly.

I have never seen a finer example of self determination."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As my title suggests, this was a must read from the first page onwards. A remarkable story of one man's battle and subsequent success against cancer. Apart from this, the book obviously reflects on his well known cycling exploits. Regardless of whether this man \\" cheated \\" in his achievements is neither here nor there, as the vast majority were doping in some form or other ( there has been enough documentation substantiating this subject in the last couple of years ) thereby still proving that he was the best of his generation of riders, doping or no. What really grates, is that there \\" seems \\" to be so much more to be read between the lines and the constant denials by this man, mean that the reader can never be sure what is the truth and what isn't."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was excited to read this book as I am an avid cyclist and triathlete. I was very disappointed. Lance describes his journey through his career in an almost cavalier, \\" I deserve it all\\" sort of manner. He lacks an attitude of appreciation, humility, and respect that I believe other elite athletes have shown (e.g. Mike Singletary, Arnold Palmer, Joe Montanna, etc.) I must admit his experience with cancer was horrific and I am glad that he can be an inspiration to others that face the same trials. Unfortunately, the predominant theme that I took away from the book was his attitude of arrogance, pride and self-indulgence. Before reading this book, I was prepared to root Lance to his fifth Tour de France Victory. Now I hope he looses, it would do his tremendous ego some good."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Inspirational. His journey back to life was indeed a rough one. My focus was on his illness and his road to recovery. It was truly not about the bike for me.It was a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a huge Lance Armstrong fan and this book is great. If you are a fan of Lance, cycling, sports, or just inspirational stories I would highly recomend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book tells us of his inspiring journey back to life. He tells us of his strength of character and determination to live in a somewhat conceited way. His fight is definitely admirable. However, modesty is not the only thing missing in the book. Being a cancer patient and Tour de France winner is not an excuse for shoddy writing. I'm only seventeen and I found one grammar mistake after another throughout the book. \\"Criterium\\" is not a word that an English dictionary recognizes. Perhaps it is a cycling term that Armstrong did not find necessary to clarify for those of us who are not familiar with the lingo. Perhaps he meant \\"criterion.\\" However, either way, by not explaining it to us Armstrong indirectly meant his book to be read by ardent fans of cycling. Surely this isn't the best marketing ploy to use?Don't get me wrong, I think Armstrong is a truly great man who has seen too many hardships in his life, even if he does come across as someone who's head is so inflated that his treasured maillot jaune wouldn't be able to get over his head. I understand that his childhood was turbulent and he had to prove himself over and over again to the world. I admire his mother because I know that if I were in his situation, my mother would stand by me the same way. It couldn't have been easy for her to raise him as a single mother in the midst of Southern-belle-manners. His story truly is \\"the stuff of legends,\\" as Independent eloquently puts it. I completely empathize with him. However, he isn't the only person in the world to have gone through cancer and come out triumphant. Armstrong comes across as someone who looks at himself as God. Even his pseudo-modest moments come across as forced. As an objective critic who is analyzing the writing, and not the story, I have to say that I've seen much better. His editor overlooked some major errors.What also struck me was Lance's garbage about his wife. Had I not known about his divorce, I would have believed him to be a completely devoted husband and father. He gushes about Kristin and how she \\"is a stud\\" over and over in the book. Where did Sheryl come in, then? This bit of knowledge makes the book seem even more fake. It makes me wonder, were any of the sentiments he expressed true? Did he just make them up to seem like a victim who mustered the strength to ressurect himself from cancer? His battle is inspiring. But are all his sentiments true? Even if they aren't, the fictitious sentiments, at least, are inspiring.I remember my first thought when I finished the book. \\"You disgust me.\\" And that still stands."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"On a technical level, this book is an amateurish read despite the presence of a co-author.In terms of content, I was embarassed for Lance most of the time. He knows just enough to understand that a story like his SHOULD be inspirational, but by recounting (even relishing in) petty achievements like owning an expensive car, driving it fast, and talking down to most of the people he encounters, gives away the fact that as a human being, he's less than the sum of his accomplishments (which are limited to riding a bicycle).I have a thousand times more respect for the majority of cancer victims who fight quietly and win or lose, manage to maintain their dignity in the end."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I loved the story. But I was frustrated with the amount of errors in the book. Many times the paperback bounced around, you would turn the page and the story would be either further advanced or re-visiting previous chapters. The page numbers were all correct, but I'm sure parts of the story are missing. I went to the publishers website. It said to return the book to them and they would replace it. I called their customer service and asked if they would pay for the shipping. They said &quot;no&quot;. I said I didn't think that was a good way to do business - after all, my reading pleasure was ruined by their mistake. They said &quot;sorry, it is our policy&quot;.This is the first book I've bought with this type of problem.So beware of Penguin Putnam Inc.

I can't say anything about what's going on with Lance's career at the moment and no one can know for sure what the truth is, except Lance. That being the case I really tried to go into this book open minded. I was not disappointed. I was astonished at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never really been a cycling fan and never really followed Lance's career so I really didn't have any opinions going into it. Although I found it interesting to see what happened to him during his time of cancer, I was actually much more interested in his history in cycling. How he started, what his trials were in the beginning, the things he thought he did wrong, and the things he thought he did right. Probably the best part of the book for me though, was him talking about his first Tour win. I was literally on the edge of my seat as I read because the description of the Tour was so interesting.I know of a few people that haven't been able to read this book because of their own ideas of who Lance Armstrong is, based on his newest news coverage, but I really don't care about what the news says. Regardless of the real and actual circumstances now, he is still an amazing athlete and has done fantastic things in his life and career. I just thought it would be important to mention this because of the few people I know who couldn't get interested in this book because of current affairs."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book chronicles bicyclist Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer and his return to professional bicycle racing.

It is just another book written by a typical American for other typical americans.Yes sure to fight cancer and then win the most difficult road race on earth is amazing, but not as amazing as this book makes it out to be. Lance Armstrong was privileged as a child - he had the opportunity to become what he became! People who do not have the opportunity (the money maybe) to pursue their talents and then to create an opportunity, and in the end, win, THAT's inspirational! This book is about Lance Armstrong, and only about how great Lance Armstrong is, period. It is boring and uninteresting - just another person's life story, except this one had talent and used it - yay! for him!Sorry to be so cynical, americans should wake up out of their perfect little \\"american dream\\" world, and maybe read about something that describes what is really going on in this world, and maybe even something that is really inspiring!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First off, this is a great story of how grim determination and luck beat the odds against the Big C and reached accomplishments far beyond the normal person's dreams. I can't imagine anyone not being inspired by LA's tale and happy for him &amp; his family. On the down side, LA's ego also appears to be world-class and as sometimes seems the case in autobiography, he tends to take every chance to point out instances where he is superior. I would have rated the story much higher had it been written by a third party, but at any rate, the Armstrong story is terrific. Good luck at the 2001 TDF, Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspirational book, especially considering his latest achievment!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book held me almost breathless throughout. It is not for any specific type of reader or person, athelete or scholar. It is a book for anyone and everyone. It is a book that can truly be appreciated by anyone that has ever taken a breath of human life. I had never thought much about cycling or the Tour de France before I had read this book and was worried that parts would bore me. I could not have been more wrong. It traces his life in an interesting and entertaining way, but most of all lets you know what it is like to face death and survive. Lots have done it, but few have put it so eloquently as Mr. Armstrong and his co-author. This is truly a book that should be read by anyone that wants to live a life of purpose and meaning."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished Lance's book two days ago and I found it heartwarming and inspirational. I can personally relate to his struggle with cancer as my husband was diagnosed with stage three testicular cancer in 1993. We went through the chemo, the fears, the blood tests, the cat scans and all the side effects. We already had a family-seven kids aged 9 months to 11 years at the time, and it was a great struggle. My husband never talked much after his remission and eventual cure. I am grateful to Lance Armstrong for being a spokesman for this disease and for his courage. And I agree with him-&quot;It's not about the bike.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is fantastic.

Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thought the book was excellent. I also started the book and couldn't put it down until I had finished. Lance is truly an American Hero and everything in this book says so. From a cancer survivor to a biking legend and still going. He is going to have to look out for those walls on the way down the mountains though if he wants to continue biking. Luck lasts just so long. Greg Lemond had similar feelings about continuing biking after his hunting accident."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance, it's not about the bike. It's about generalizing your pain to other people, it is about tolerance, understanding, kindness, compassion, forgiveness. Unfortunately, you just didn't get it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As an amateur triathlete, I couldn't wait to read Lance's story. I was eager to delve into the mind of one of my heroes, hear how he survived cancer and became a legend. Boy was I disappointed! This poorly written, extremely repetitive book had me cringing early on from the style; it was easy to see the book had been hastily published and hadn't received the editing attention it deserved. And the content! Armstrong reveals himself not as a noble, courageous human but rather a selfish jerk. I expected inspiration from reading this book but didn't take that away at all. Part of it could be my recent cancer experience, and part could be that my expectations of Lance were simply too high. Nevertheless, I no longer see him as an athlete or an example-- he's just another jerk who's good at his job."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Based on all of the fabulous reviews, I purchased this book in its used state. It was worth reading, but it is not a great book. The story is honest and miraculous, but lacks sentimentality. The quality of writing appeals more to the average cyclist than the average reader, with lots of slang fragmented sentences and intentional arrogancy. I find that annoying, but you may not. I race and love Lance, plus I'm glad I read it, because I now know the story. Not a great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Yes, I agree with all the other reviews that it is GOOD.

The fight that to live or die. This is a story of a hero who fought one of the deadliest diseases that kills people everyday. Lance Armstrong found out what the greastest things in life were while he was challenged with this horrible disease. This time he had to fight the cancer and get to the finish line first before the cancer could finish him off. I thought this was an outstanding book that gives everyone who is facing lives greatest challenges hope to live and to go on. It teaches you that greatest things in life are family and friends. Lance Armstrong learned that no matter how much money he was still going to have cancer. He learned that no matter how much he had in life that he was not going to able to defeat cancer if he did not have faith. He soon learned what his priorties were and he learned that the best thing that could ever happen to him is that he had to face death. He looked at death in the eye and he was not going to give up on the greatest thing in this world which is to have family and friends. He learned that no money in the world was able to show him that until he was faced with this great challenge. I rate this book a perfect ten is one of the greatest life stories I've ever read in my life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"With all the troubles in the world and just about all you read in the newspaper or see on the television set, it's time for a good story to be told. Lance Armstrong is a winner and in this book it talks about winning, not the tour de France but the game of life. Lance Armstrong can ride a bike like no other and he can also face death in the face and ride right across its path to win the Tour de France.The battle with cancer was a long one full of pain and surgeries, not to mention chemo. He fought back with everything he had to get back on the seat of that bike and win again. A must read book that will make you re-think any troubles you have and give you what it takes to win in life and in any type of game or sport.

And a searcher. This is for sure...I'll be tuned in to the Tour De France in July."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Meet Lance Armstrong, the illegitimate son of a single teenage mother in Texas, who became the fastest thing on a racing bike this planet has ever seen. At the height of his early career, Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer and beat the disease and the odds to survive, thrive, and prosper, often in the face of naysayers who said, \\"he's finished.\\"I'm not a cancer survivor or a cyclist, so neither of those things drew me to this book. I wanted to read how a champion, someone who's always been a winner, handles adversity. I didn't come away with any formula for success; for one thing, Lance says explicitly in the book that he'd seen people with no strong will to live survive cancer while others who were absolutely determined to beat the illness died from cancer. Looks like it simply wasn't Lance's time to go. Since his recovery, he's helped many other people with cancer and devoted a great deal of his time and resources to those struggling with the illness. He says that once you have cancer, you are forever a member of what he calls &quot;the cancer community.&quot;Lance didn't strike me as someone with a sense of entitlement, a case of \\"that will never happen to me.\\" He was too busy pedaling. But when he was diagnosed, he wasted no time applying the same tools and tactics to fighting cancer that he applied to racing. The consistent thread between his illness and his championship bike racing was his approach to both: he's in it to win and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed. This is a man with true commitment, a very rare quality in today's hurry-up-I-want-it-all-right-now culture.This story has a happy ending-he beat the disease, he won the Tour de France, he got the girl, and the happy little family walked off into the sunset. That's the short version. But it's no fairy tale. Lance's story has given hope to many and enjoyment to others. An accessible, conversational tone runs throughout the book, and we get a sense of the Texas boy who grew up riding through the Texas prairie with a very determined will and a good sense of his natural gifts. Easily polished off in a focused weekend.*It's Not About The Bike* is also a great tribute to single moms and the power of a mother's unconditional love and support. Linda Armstrong is a champion, too, and Lance never lets anyone forget it. Right on!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike is a Hero's journey of a poor street boy who became a great athlete and a great person. The book is about the change of a Lance Armstrong and to his becoming a winner of the Tour De France, the greatest competition bike ride around. This book not only tells about stories of biking but it tells life stories and life lessons. It tells about how his struggle through testicular cancer and how he became a husband, a father, and an amazing person. This book shows what kind of stuff it takes to win. It shows what kind of hardships people must go through to have a good life and what how hard work pays off. Lance's book demonstrated that no matter how bad your life is going there is always worse so one should go through life with a smile and be thankful.I would give this book a five star rating because it meant a lot to me and I could relate to a lot of it. This book is real and gives the truth without trying to sell it self. This book leaves no secrets and shows a true hero's journey and a true hero and how he can affect the world. I shared this book with my friends and family and l have not put it down until they where finished. They all agree that this is one of the greatest books ever written. This book gives a strong viewpoint of how you should treat people. It tells that you should be nice to everyone but at the same time do what you can to get yourself and the people you love on top. Everything he says makes sense because he seems to have a greater understanding for things and doesn't write or do stuff to make people happy. He does what he thinks is right. He did not begin with a good life, he fought for it and that's what I like best about the book, the story of his struggles to get through life.I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. Whether you like biking or to read does not matter. This book will relate to anyone and it will mean something different to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Its Not About the Bike Book ReviewStricken down by the chains of cancer, Neil Armstrong recovers to win one of the greatest events on earth, the Tour de France. This story is about one of the greatest athletes of our time. It enthralls you in emotions, good and bad, and leaves you with a feeling of self-accomplishment and joy. The fantastic thing about this book is that it is all true.In the story you hear about the difficulties faced by a low-income family with only one parent. The mother of Lance was young and barely managing, but gave Lance everything he wanted. He said, \\"she would make things like a squishy at 7-11 feel like getting a new bike.\\" When Lance was in high school he wasn't like everyone else, he was different. When people were walking to school in kakhis and Calvin Klein plaid shirts he was swimming, running, and bicycling in triathlons. When he was sixteen he was smoking 30 year old pro athletes. He was on his way and had his goals set.Years later Lance switched completely to bicycle riding and was great. He made a high income and had a perfect life.

The story is told through the eyes of Lance himself, and readers will discover a refreshing candidness that makes this a revealing, provoking and inspirational book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"First of all, I wasn't sure about buying this book. I'm an avid cyclist and therefore felt obliged to buy this book as Lance had just won the third straight championship of the Tour de France.I ordered this book from Amazon along with few other books in different genre--beat poetry, real estate, investing, etc. I figured I'll read this book last, becasue I was never sure whether I should have really bought this book or not. I flipped though some pages as I took break from reading other books, and I just couldn't stop. I ended up reading this book in one sitting, before I finished reading any other book.This book really grabbed me by the heart. As the subtitle suggests, this book &quot;is not about the bike&quot;. I must admit that my interest in cycling helped me get into this book right at the onset. But as I read on, I really enjoyed this book as a &quot;story&quot; of one man.In that, I would like to send accoladates to Sally Jenkins, the co-author. The underlying story of Lance is definitely an excellent material for a book; however, Sally took the story to a higher level and made this book more novel-like, an excellent read for just about anybody.If you are a cyclist, you will definitely enjoy it. If you aren't, I THINK you'll also enjoy reading a wonderful story written in such beautiful verse.Oh by the way, I deducted one star because Sally's writing is so sensitive that it definitely downplayed the true jock-like character of Lance Armstrong. (OK, nothing is perfect.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A friend of mine passed me this book because I follow bicycle racing, but as the title implies, there's more to it then that. Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins do a great job of telling a story that one minute sounds super human, and the next, painfully human. Lance Armstrong's story before his fight with cancer would have been incredible enough. His struggle to simply stay alive and how that transforms his outlook on life is what makes this story fascinating. On the light hearted side: if you've ever listened to Lance Armstrong during a TV interview, you'll appreciate that none of his style is lost in how his story reads."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong fits the prototype of a typical jock, but he's an honest jock. This well-written account of his battle with testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain is noteworthy not only as a &quot;I beat cancer&quot; story, but as a straight-shooting portrayal of a rather arrogant young man who faced the very real possibility of death, survived, and became a better human being.Mr. Armstrong certainly doesn't try to canonize himself, and that's what's refreshing about It's Not About the Bike. He's completely up front about his weaknesses such as a nasty temper, impatience, and tendency to be brash. There are interesting and honest accounts of his bitterness toward his real father and stepfather, and the complete devotion of his mother. And while, like most Americans, you may not be a bicycle racing fan, the story of how he regrouped and eventually won the sport's crown jewel - The Tour de France - is exciting and inspiring.Mr. Armstrong has the wisdom to know that his victory over cancer had as much to do with the Gods of good fortune as it did his own determination and fortitude. He says, &quot;Some of it is not easy to tell or comfortable to hear. I'm asking you now, at the outset, to put aside your ideas about heroes and miracles, because I'm not storybook material. This is not Disneyland, or Hollywood . . . Good, strong people get cancer, and they do all the right things to beat it, and they still die. That is the essential truth that you learn. People die. And after you learn it, all other things seem irrelevant. They just seem small.&quot;There is also a relevant section about the difficult process of in-vitro fertilization that his wife, Kik, went through. (Mr. Armstrong became sterile after his cancer surgery and treatments.) Happily, the procedure was a success that culminated with the birth of a healthy son, Luke David Armstrong. The candid and sometimes graphic description of IVF is of value to any couple who would like to consider this option.Kudos also go to Sally Jenkins, the co-writer who did a beautiful job of organizing the book and capturing Mr. Armstrong's voice and personality."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Good book. Too bad, probably should be renamed -- \\"Its all about the Drugs\\". Drugs, Doping, Illegal payments, it just went on and on and on."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Those who know me, know that I am not one to have heroes. That is why I find Lance so flippin amazing...because he has certainly become one to me. I've been following his career for quite a while, ever since he became pro (yes, I'm an American male who actually follows Bike racing in Europe, from the early Spring Classics, to the late season races in October). I remember vividly the elation when he became World Road champion, the pride I felt when he won the tour stage honoring his teammate that died 2 days earlier, the sadness when his cancer was discovered, the hopelessness when it spread, and all the mixed emotions last year when he won The Tour. Now, this book IS NOT just for sports or racing fans...my Mom read it for Christ's sake. She cried. It's inspirational in a &quot;real&quot; sense...none of this mumbo jumbo garbage that is so prevalent in modern day &quot;feel good&quot; books. There is no talk of god or religion or miracles. Lance just credits Science, the Doctors, and his own incredible spirit. An easy read, funny at times, always amazing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book back in 2004 and was convinced that Lance Armstrong was a liar. I gave a review (then unpopular of course) of another of his books that also appeared to be full of lies. I was an athlete in the marathon - I knew what it took to be dedicated, train hard, and perform honestly... and most importantly to live every day with honorable athletic values that our children should be raised to expect from adults. The biggest discredit this book has paid is not even to the lives of real athletes (like Greg LeMond, who honestly won the Tour de France 3 times and who spoke out about Lance's illicit drugs and blood doping, and in return Lance destroyed Greg LeMond's biking business and attacked his family) -- that was a blight on the history of cycling that is inexcusable. But the bigger discredit is to the youth of our country and the world - the young people that deserve to know that a real athlete is true to their values and their families. Lance Armstrong brutally dumped his lovely former wife Kristin -- and their 3 children - he sold his soul long before we all had the recent evidence. It is for the youth of our world that I believe this book should be retitled or at least have some sort of correct \\"truth fact sheet\\" attached to it. No child who is interested in sports and athletics should ever be subjected to these lies by Lance Armstrong -- without a corrected \\"truth fact sheet\\" attached to this book.The worst part of it all -- it is now documented (as I had suspected) that Lance Armstrong took performance enhancing drugs before his testicular cancer - that is probably the reason that he came down with testicular cancer in the first place! Betsy Andreu heard Lance telling the doctor this while he was getting treatment for his now famous testicular cancer. WOW what a super fraud he is and this book also truly is! Our children desperately deserve to know that Lance Armstrong not only most likely induced cancer cell growth from his cheating with performance enhancing drugs (steroids kill T-cells, our critical immune cells that in turn delete cancer cells and virally infected cells), but that he made an entire cheating, lying, profit-oriented empire from this \\"oh poor me I have overcome my cancer to win the Tour de France\\" story! PLEASE put some sort of \\"corrected truth fact sheet\\" on the cover of this book so that nobody who is vulnerable will be misled again - what a fraud to our children and to the many cancer survivors that are drawing false inspiration from this fallen person's book! Lastly, I hope that Armstrong genuinely does go on to not only further redeem himself, but that he can ever make up somehow to the people whose lives he destroyed -- Greg LeMond and his family (he obliterated their Trek biking business), Frankie and Betsy Andreu, Emma O'Reilly, his many fallen and not so fallen team members, and the poor children and aspiring athletes that read this book of deceipt. Yes it's not about the bike -- it's about the truth for all our youth and impressionable athletes to read. And it's also about Lance's former wife poor Kristin Armstrong... what a super hero she still is and always has been and always will be."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No it isn't about the bike. We know that now don't we. Not much point in reading this now can I have my money back."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Anyone who thinks they've had a tough lot in life should read this book. Lance Armstrong details his early life where he is the son of a single mother, feeling like an outcast in his upper-middle-class neighborhood and high school. He is a restless angry teenager who finds that he has the physical ability and drive to become a great athlete. He finally finds the perfect sport in cycling and relentlessly pursues his goal to be the best. Just as he is gaining some recognition in the sport, he is told that he has testicular cancer. The odds against him are overwhelming, but he researches his options until he finds the hospital which he believes will give him the best treatment. He details the agony of surgery and chemo. and the reader begins to understand just what it must be like to be a cancer patient. Not only does he recover, but he goes back to cycling and becomes the best in the world. This book gives interesting insight into what it takes to be the an outstanding athlete and is inspiring for anyone who is facing difficult odds. It shows the gradual maturing of an impulsive and restless young man who is tempered by illness and who is finally able to be a world-class athlete and a family man."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm an avid cyclist who is in the midddle of a round of chemotherapy - so I can totally relate to this book.I've read a lot of books on cancer and attitude since being diagnosed, but none drove home the point that ANYTHING is possible as well as this one did.Winning the Tour would be enough of a triumph - but to come back from chemotherapy and surgery and win it...awesome! Believe me - Lance is not overstating the affect that treatment has on your body - the comeback is astounding. It's given me a lot of courage and renewed my determination - I think it will do that for a lot of people. I literally had tears in my eyes as I read the account of his ride into Sestriere.And it's not just about cancer - if you love cycling it's a great cycling book too! The behind the scenes information of what goes on in the peloton is a great read.Thanks Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a wonderful book about how to live life. I bought it the day after I did a half-ironman, and I read it in one sitting and it even inspired me, in all of my soreness, to exercise again. This could be a book that could equally appeal to an athlete or to someone struggling with a mental or physical illness. It provides some very real answers about why we continue to fight and struggle through life. Armstrong comes across as one of the most compelling, and humanly fallible characters, that I have ever seen in literature. In addition, this book is extremely well-written. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. I recommend it both as an athlete and as a Ph.D./Professor of Literature."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life is an entertaining read that gives the reader insight into what it's like to live with cancer and lose a dream. Lance's journey back to the bike is inspirational, and it showcases his love of his sport. Lance's determination to race even after a life-threatening disease makes this a worthwhile read for anyone who is facing a significant obstacle in life.One positive feature of this book is its description of cycling races. Not only does Armstrong inform the reader of the competitive nature of the sport, such as the insults exchanged while cyclists are racing, he also describes how a team works together during a race. Before reading this book, I believed that each racer's goal was to win. In reality, racers are part of teams, and each team member works for the good of the whole so that one person from their team can be victorious.While this book is a stirring read, it has numerous faults. I agree with Bryan Castro's review when he stated that Armstrong is often annoying. While his wife and friends make huge sacrifices for him and are very supportive before, during, and after his battle with cancer, Lance does nothing to alert his reader to the ways he is equally supportive in his personal relationships.For example, Lance and his wife, Kristin, moved to France so Lance could get back into cycling after he recovered from cancer. His wife had to quit her job, give up her dog, her friends, and her entire life. They spent a few weeks in France before Lance decided to quit biking and moved back home. He then lived like a bum, while Kristin had to find a way to get her life back. This selfish act is one of many which has lowered my opinion of Lance Armstrong.In the beginning of the book, Lance describes how he excelled as an athlete from a young age by competing with older, more experienced athletes. While part of the mindset of being a professional athlete is being confident in one's own abilities, his cockiness is often overwhelming. I had hopes that after his illness he would become more humble, but that voice did not come through in his writing.Lance accomplishes his goal of telling the story of living with cancer, and how he overcame this challenge to get back on the bike professionally. Unfortunately, his egomania and cockiness subtracts from the message of the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having read TUESDAYS WITH MORIE in 1998, I found Armstrong's story valuable for similar reasons. Neither book is about dying but rather about living to one's full potential. I did not have cancer, but last year I was seriouily ill and was in the hospital for almost five months and underwent three operations. This book helped me understand that my emotional state in the aftermath of this horrendous experience is not a solitary one but rather universal. This book put into words what I have not been able to articulate to my circle of family and friends. I feel anyone, cycling fan or not, would benefit from reading this story and learning the many valuable life lessons it has to offer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read a lot...a helluva lot. I am jaded and I admit it.But this book, and the story of Lance, his friends, his wife and his caretakers, and his mom, is simply one of the best reads I can remember. While Lance may not be the world's nicest guy, his story is one of love, devotion, unbelievable physical and mental strength, pain of unspeakable levels, terror, and miracles.As I write this he is winning the Tour deFrance. That achievement, his recovery and maybe even the man himself, are of mythic proportions.A most satisfying experience...the nicest part is that there are still chapters to be written."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After Lance's recovery and courageous return to cycling, I found myself swept away with the crowd. &quot;Yea Lance!&quot; &quot;Tour de Lance!&quot; In the euphoria, I even presumed to identify myself with Lance as a bike rider.This book, well written, openly descriptive and painfully private, served as an eye opener for those of us in Austin donned in yellow t-shirts and jumping around like school children. I would have been just as proud, but much more reverent, had I known at the time the history revealed in this book. Sorry Lance, I had no idea...I recommend this book without reservation. It's a quick read, yet contains the lessons learned by a man on the way to true greatness; and no, I'm not talking about the bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is so honest it hurts. And Armstrong is not your usual celeb because he didn't glitz it up and make himself look good. I cannot remember a book so unsparing and unflinching. And so compelling."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As an avid fan of bike racing, I thought I knew Lance's story pretty well. Turns out that what I didn't know is far more interesting than what I did know. I read the book in two sittings. I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book does an extraordinary job of taking you inside the heart and soul of a great athlete whose life was transformed by cancer. From one perspective, it does not come across as great literature. As an autobiography, however, you feel is if you are listening to Armstrong himself. For anyone facing a life threatening disease, it offers invaluable guidance, especially in terms of getting second and third opinions and going to the best, however much it might cost. I read this in large part because I love cycling, but the title is exactly right!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is about surviving. It is about getting through the tough stuff and going on from there. The author appears to have achieved an understanding of his life and has chosen the direction to take from here. As the author states at the beginning it is not a pretty story. I highly recommend this book. It is especially insightful for those with a chronic disease. I found it inspiritional."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband is an avid cyclist, and was at last year's Tour de France watching Lance win the yellow jersey in one of the stages. Therefore, my interest in him and the sport is purely through my husband. This book gives such intimate insight into the mind of the athlete and cycling in general. Not only that, it is a moving story not &quot;just about the bike&quot;, but about a man who has an unfailing determination to live life to the fullest. What a great read it was! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not the most avid reader, but I like biographies of sports &quot;Heroes.&quot; This book is in fact the best I have read.

AWESOME!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent ! If cancer were to strike us ..could we handle it as well as Lance did ? Before reading this book I had doubt ! when I finished reading its not about the bike ...and jumped on my bike the hills of the road had now become my medicine ."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are several stories in this book. Lance's battle with cancer is the most familiar. There is also a story of a suburban punk, the story of professional cycling (I didn't know this was a team sport), a story about personal growth, and more. I couldn't put this book down once I started it, then it was passed quickly through my family. Both men and women liked it equally and enthusiastically."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book will make anyone realize how lucky each of us our to simply be alive. Lance meticulously describes his cancer therapy and the people that stayed with him during his hardest times. The racing stories are wonderful, especially if your an ametuer road racer or a bicycle enthusiast. I don't read auto-biographies but I'm glad I read this one. This is the first book I read from start to finish in one day. It was hard to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After his interview admitting all of his lies and PED use, you have to wonder if his early drug experimentation led to his cancer, before he was able to hire the best doctors and drug experts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"FANTASTIC book!!! I received this book as a gift right after my first chemo treatment last Christmas- December 2002. It has been my key inspiration over the past six months of chemo, radiation therapy and cranial irradiation. What is \\"breakthrough\\" about Lance and his experience is what he has achieved since. Now all Cancer patients (and people worldwide) can reset the bar for what is possible after successful Cancer treatment.My only caution to patients entering treatment is that there have been great advances in preventing the nausea associated with chemotherapy. Nausea during treatment is not as severe these days due to the addition of steroids to increase the effectiveness of nausea medicine given along with chemo IVs. I had the same chemo and very minimal/treatable nausea in 2003.When you read about Cancer, always note the copyright of the material. Treatment advances are coming daily."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I write this in early May 2002. About a month ago, I was diagnosed with cancer, and since then I have had surgery to remove the tumor and begun a series of radiation treatments to make sure that I have no remaining cancer cells. To be honest, this is not a book that I would have ever thought about reading. My reading is primarily literary and academic, and I just don't read many books about popular entertainment figures. But a friend who I thought was merely a pediatrician but who turned out to be a pediatric oncologist strongly suggested that I read this book, and I am very glad that I did.This is not primarily a book about bike racing; this is primarily a book about cancer, facts that are captured beautifully in the title. My cancer is not nearly as serious as Armstrong's was, but nonetheless so many of the emotions and feelings that he describes struck familiar chords (mine was caught very early, whereas his was discovered quite late and had spread to a number of areas of his body). I can't imagine anyone reading this book who has or is suffering from cancer and not deriving a good deal of benefit. It is comforting to know that someone else has experienced many of the same things that you have. And it is inspiring to see how at least in one case someone has come back successfully from it.Lance's story is especially valuable for men. If you look through a health section of a bookstore, you can find many, many books about women cancer survivors, but very few books by men. Let's face it: guys who are struggling with cancer are going to feel more kinship with someone suffering from a particularly male form of cancer than a woman writing about breast or uterine cancer.This book is a very interesting and easy read, which is a very good thing. If someone happens to be reading it in a situation such as mine right now, these are tremendous virtues.One of the things that struck me while reading the book was the depth of Lance Armstrong's attachment to his family and friends. In particular, his attachment to his mother and his obvious love for her is especially impressive. And unless it is merely a literary conceit, he seems to have a great deal of gratitude and affection for a very large number of people. Much of this hints of a very strong social group that helped get him through an excruciatingly difficult time.The sections dealing with bicycle racing are fine, also. But it is the sections dealing with cancer and his efforts to survive it and then recuperate from it that are the most moving, by far.I suppose that for those who want just to read an inspirational story, or for fans of competitive bicycle racing, this is a book they will thoroughly enjoy reading. But for anyone who is actually experiencing cancer first hand, this book will be invaluable."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to sit down and talk to Lance Armstrong for a couple of hours, now's your chance. Open, honest, thoroughly accessible, this book is one of the best I have read in years. It isn't a jock book and it isn't a \\"let me inspire you with my fight against cancer\\" book. But by the time you're through reading it (and just try to put it down!)you're awed by Lance's tremendous atheletic achievements and inspired by the way Lance and his family and friends looked probable death square in the eye and dealt with it the way any of us would - being scared, courageous, unsure of what to do, impatient to do something, in other words - like humans.Lance is interesting, funny, brash, dedicated, a survivor, a monster athelete, and he puts his money where his mouth is on and off the bike. When you put the book down, you'll know that the title of the book is perfect. It's not about the bike, it's about the heart of the man riding it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I enjoyed reading about Lance Armstrong's experiences as a cancer survivor and a champion cyclist. I did not know that fighting cancer or the Tour De France was as long and gruelling as he describes in this book. He has the fierce determination to be successful at whatever he does. This is what makes Lance Armstrong's story so interesting.I loved reading about the main people in his life. The influence that these people. have had on him is so interesting. Being raised by a single mother, Lance learned independence and toughness. He learned that life is precious and should never been be granted. This is of course from the compassionate doctors and nurses who treated him during his cancer treatment. The trials and tribulations Lance and his wife Kik go through trying to have a baby are very personal. Lance Armstrong's greatest victory is not winning the Tour De France 3 times. His greatest victory is his journey back to life as the title of the book states. This is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I must say after just finishing this book, I am seeing life with a new perspective. I have not had to fight the illness that Lance triumphed over with such dignity but I have had many obstacles in my life as well that I am not completely over. I also battle an illness though on a different level. From learning about Lance's childhood, his mother, his hometown, how he got into cycling, his battle and courageous win over the &quot;Tour de Cancer&quot; and the &quot;Tour de France&quot;, I have the utmost respect for this great guy!! He is an angel himself showing us all the power of perserverance and the power of positive thinking. I am so happy to hear he is healthy, married and happy, a proud father, and most of all...a tremendous HUMAN BEING!!! Thank you for telling your story. That could not be easy to open up to the whole world on many private battles and it just goes to show what a fantastic guy you are! Lance, you are the GOLD!!!! You have earned it in every way!

So the title first attracted me to this harrowingly personal book. Lance is a Texas tough-guy whose daddy did him wrong; his step-dad was no prize, either. He lays it out honestly, and describes his move into the persona that could win one-day classic races on anger and defiance, but not the long-haul tours (which demand strategy and a willingness to lay back and let your team do some of the work). Cancer changed that for Lance. It changed his attitude, his place in life, his relationships, his focus, his mind, and his body. In allowing a medical team to bring him to the edge of death in the interest of destroying the cancerous cells in his body, Lance gained the ability to rely on others in accomplishing a goal. Tourists and racers who think that their team or group is everything would do well to study the relationships that deepen between Lance and his mother, his wife Kik, and his new son. It may be true that \\"everything is bicycle\\" when we're riding one, but we live in much larger networks, and most of us depend on those networks to sustain us in the parts of our life when we're not up on two wheels."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book can truely touch your life. Think you are having a bad day? Think your life is hard? Read this book! It will give you amazing perspective. After you read of Lance's journey through his disease and what the human spirit can do, your problems seem quite small.I can honestly say no book I have ever read has made this kind of impact on me. Do yourself a favor and read this book.Lance Armstrong is a true AMERICAN HERO. May we all learn from his tenacity, passion, and giving sprit.He has taught many people to realize that life is a gift that you need to cherish everyday.Brett Richard"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Mr. Armstrong is a world-class athlete and champion, and he battled back from a deadly disease that should have taken his life. He's highly disciplined in a manner I can scarcely imagine and he regularly engages and overcomes adversity. He is an inspiration to all and especially to those in the throngs of cancer.What does not work is this underlying pretense epitomized with the book's title. He is only about the bike, or rather himself. Every other character in the book seems to be an object he can manipulate or castigate. Of course, he is no different from any other successful athlete, businessman, or president... Such success requires an intense, self-absorbed focus.I recommend this book for the inspirational value, but be prepared for the surface sentiments and contradictions."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I found the book after checking the recent Tour standings and seeing that Lance was in first place. My husband and I emailed Lance when he was first sick and have followed his career with great pride. I bought the book as a surprise for my husband, who is not an avid reader. Since we received the book, he has been unable to put it down. I walked into the bedroom last night and he was crying. He was crying over the hardship and the determination and the honor that Lance demonstrates through a very tough battle. Kudos Lance! We will continue to watch and are with you in our hearts."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cyclist (aggressive tourist) I follow the cycling culture. Of course, a book by/about Lance Armstrong would be on my list. While watching the 2000 TdF I finished reading about the 1999 TdF.Lance had a hard but interesting youth. His bouth with cancer was a life changing experience. There is enough detail about the chemo and what happened to make anyone realized how unusual his recovery and subsequent victory in the TdF are.Pain, trial and tribulation can either destroy or make an individual. Lance was made through this trial by chemo. There are lessons there for all of us.Note: Sally Jenkins does and excellent job of telling Lance's story in a creditable manner that pulls no punches and can lead you to tears."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"a powerfully engaging and inspiring story of a determined young man in concerted pursuit of his athletic dreams, the entertaining and driving tales of him getting there, and the miraculous overcoming of profound, nearly deadly obstacles in his way.In terms of shear human will, and man conquering near-impossible challenges while fulfilling astronomical aspirations, Hollywood could not have scripted a better story. To cancer fighters everywhere, and loved ones who are undying in their support to those who suffer from cancer (and I am quite familiar with this area), there is a significant and deeply moving message that becomes resoundingly clear. You must harness the best medical talent available to you; dedicate yourself to the fight for survival, and stay the course with the immeasurable aid of powerful, enduring confidence and will.He is honest in his realization and expression that some sufferers survive, and others do not. There are no guarantees. Does fate always make sense? Is it fair? Of course not. (On a highly subjective note - that may admittedly tick off a few people - I do not care whether he took performance-enhancing chemicals, or not, when riding competitively. The fact that he underwent significant chemical and surgical modifications in order to survive serious cancer - imagine losing one of your testes, then winning a championship of any sort - mitigates those accusations in my book. It's sort of like admiring bodybuilders and having to accept that they take steroids; it sort of goes with the territory with most of them, don't ya think? Don't know if it's always true or not, but my attitude is grin and bear it.)Deftly and refreshingly avoiding grandiose and popular flights of fancy in the areas of religion and fantasy, Lance focused instead on intelligent, rational tools to empower him in his goals and motivate so many others. He dedicated himself to a personal win, and survival, that translated - through his highly effective global exercise in cancer awareness - to ongoing wins for the masses. He has helped a great number of people: you cannot take that away from him!Whether you're into sports or not, or whether you find Lance Armstrong controversial or not, you will discover time-lasting, monumental lessons about what it takes to become a hero: to intensely grasp life by the horns and live to your ultimate potential no matter how much time you are given. Be here now.Rock on, you infinitely inspiring and accomplished mystical man! You have moved heavens and earth; and for this we are eternally grateful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An honest and inspirational account of Lance Armstrong's struggle and triumph over cancer. Armstrong speaks candidly about all of his fears and struggles he experienced in the face of the ultimate defeat: death. I was a bit disappointed that through all the pain and personal growth he hung on to the anger he felt from childhood toward his biological as well as adopting fathers. He also hung on to anger from petty insults; I found that side of him very off-putting.I totally agree with Armstrong's assessment that winning any struggle whether cancer or Tour de France is not about the physical strength but about the heart.Armond Mehrabianamehrabian@portofinosolutions.comTwitter: @armond_m"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I BOUGHT THE BOOK FOR MY NEPHEW ,WHO IN RIDING IN THE MARIN CENTURY 100 MILES BIKE RACE AS I TYPE.

Some people seem to feel he's self-absorbed, but it didn't come across that way to me. He writes about his struggle with cancer, acknowledges those that helped him along the way, and then describes his comeback. Hard-fought and inspirational."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book is about his early promise as a great cyclist in a sport that is not well-known or admired in his home country, the US, his affliction with cancer by the time he was 25, his recovery and subsequent stunning and courageous comeback as a champion cyclist to win the most gruelling of all endurance sports - the Tour de France. Along the way he writes about his mother who loves him and stands by him all along, his many many friends who stand by him during his illness and comeback and also about Kik, his wife who gives him everything without so much as asking a question or voicing a complaint. There are also the many specialist oncologists to whom he owes his cure and a special nurse - La Trice - who comes off as a very special person.The book brings to life the many nuances and dangers and thrills of a gruelling race like the Tour de France. In his writing, you can feel the thrill of a bike racing down the Alps and the Pyrennes at more than a hundred kilometres an hour and its associated dangers to the cyclist. One can feel the viciousness of the French press in trying to discredit him by accusing him of using performance-enhancing drugs during his stunning victory in 1999. One can get a grasp of how cycling is a team sport and how much a winner like Lance Armstrong is possible only because of the sacrifices of other cyclists in the team in providing the best possible conditions for their prime rider to win. One can feel how much he loves his mom, wife and friends. He also brings out vividly the intensity of 'feeling ill with cancer', the pain of chemotherapy and the uncertainities of survival after the illness and the cure.However, there are a few tedious and jarring notes in the book as well. His elaborate paragraphs about his wedding and the birth of his baby are of interest only to him but writes about it as though his experience in this domain is so unique. I also wish he hadn't portrayed himself as one who had it hard and made it to the top in spite of his background.He rants against the French firm Cofidis for wanting to renegotiatehis contract once he was down with cancer. Unlike most people in their lives, he had a mother,a wife and friends who have all been very loyal and supportive of him ina self-sacrificing manner. He had Nike stand by him thru thick andthin. He had the CEO of of some big firm threaten the insurancecompany that he will take his business elsewhere if they don't coverthe costs of his cancer treatment. His friend Bill Stapleton stayedwith him in spite of his unfair complaints about Bill not doing hisbit as his 'agent'. And he had endorsements running into millions. Butin spite of all this, he can't handle one company wanting to keeptheir relationship as 'business first'. Most people in much poorercountries accomplish as much without having any of these supportingstructures.All in all, it is a very good book to read and should give everyone hope that one must keep trying in spite of being afflicted with a deadly disease such as cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book will motivate you no matter who you are or waht you do. Whether you are an athlete, student or just want to be a better person this book will make you want to do it better.

It was a gift for my brother who has cancer and I thought he would enjoy reading about Lance Armstrong's struggle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I first read this book in 2000 when I started grad school. He inspires through his life experiences told in his own words. It is as if you were reading his personal journal. A well balanced book filled with a lot of emotion."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have cancer (different from Lance Armstrong). Reading this book gives me hope and encouragement! I highly recommend it for anyone fighting against cancer. If Lance Armstong can beat cancer then so can I and he gives you the strength and drive to do so."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstong's Story is truely an inspiration for anyone that has experienced an inner struggle, sickness or just dealing with an everyday obstacle that zapped the spirit. You'll want to read it over and over. This book holds the true value of life!! A MUST HAVE!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Totally inspiring, the absolute example of human courage and strength of spirit. TRUITY Williams from Wanabelong.com Australia. A book I highly recommend to my clients!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an amazing book. It is so well written and not the usual sports biography. Lance opens his life to you in this book and speaks candidly about cancer, riding and IVF. He is such an inspiration. I would recommend this book to anyone; you certainly don't have to be a cancer survivor or cyclist to enjoy this one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike - My Journey Back to Life\\" by Lance Armstrong was truly an Inspirational Story. From the first page to the last page of the book it describes the struggles that Lance Armstrong has overcome. Lance Armstrong describes very specifically about his cancer and brain tumors. I thought that it was amazing how he overcame his disability and then went on to win the Tour De France. It really takes a lot of courage, pain and guts to live in his life. Usually everyone believes that he is rich and has the good life. Well out of all the biographies I've read. This story really changed my views on his life. It was very sad, and cheering at the same time. After reading this book, I will try to see positive in all and all that I encounter. I really do recommend this book to all age groups. It will change your life as well as it did mine."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have a new value for athletes and cancer survivors! This book has made me want to take better care of myself and set out to get my body and better shape so if I ever have to face cancer, I will be able to fight it myself!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although I was familiar with Lance Armstrong via the media, I did not know the details of his story. Also, I am not usually a fan of nonfiction, but this is one of the best books I have read in several years. It gives tremendous insight into the man that Lance Armstrong is and what has helped to make him that way. He doesn't claim to be a wonderful and great person in addition to being a wonderful and gifted athlete. What he does is tell his story, simply and with great candor.Through the book, the reader discovers what true determination and discipline are. Now, when I think that doing aerobics for an hour is sometimes difficult, I think of what Lance Armstrong and others like him are capable of. I realize I don't even know the true meaning of pain and suffering.For anyone interested in cycling, this book is a must-read. For anyone interested in a story of cancer survival, this book is a must-read. And for anyone interested in what carries a person through some of the darkest and most painful days of his life, this book is a must-read. You don't have to admire every character trait that Lance Armstrong possesses in order to admire him as an athlete and a person of great strength, courage, determination, discipline, and tenacity."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm in awe of Lance Armstrong. I was hit by a car in 1988 and know what it takes to recover. This story brought tears to my eyes multiple times. By some standards Lance Armstrong is dysfunctional. The lack of a true father figure in his life shapes him in interesting ways. I couldn't put this book down. The sacrifices his wife Kristin makes for him were phenominal and I found myself extremely disappointed that they recently split. It shouldn't be a surprise based on what you'll read. For a second, I thought Lance Armstrong might even believe in a higher power at the end of it all...the book seems honest to a tee. A must read for bikers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is life changing! Thank you Lance for sharing! It truly shows your spirit. A million thanks to your mom and Kik... how they perservered through some very trying times. I am sorry to see you now apart from Kik after reading all the trials that she went through with you to bring life to your profession as well as to your new baby. This book will make you laugh with life and cry with triumph. \\"How them apples?\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend who is an avid cyclist, and he loved it! The book came in great shape."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is great if you want to know why Lance is so famous. His story of the battle with cancer, love, and cycling is inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a book that is hard to put down. What a fascinating story of Lance's battle with cancer and what it takes to win, whether in life or cycling. After reading this book I wanted to know more about Lance and read two more books, another by him: Every Second Counts, and one written about him: Lance: The Making of the World's Greatest Champion, both wonderful accounts of his personal life and the incredible journey to winning seven Tour de France titles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"STRENGTHS:Hard cover withstands most crashes.Quality paper repells bicycle grease better than most.Just fits in my CamelBak M.U.L.E.The ink doesn't run after riding in a typhoon, though it takes a long time to dry out the book.The ink smells of adrenaline.WEAKNESSES:Heavier than a paperback, making hill climbs more difficult.Dark blue cover is hard to see during a night ride--requiring the addition of reflective stickers or a flashing light for safety.\\"Hey! This book really ISN'T about the bike. Dammit!!\\"SIMILAR PRODUCTS USED:I graduated from an ivy league college, so I've read a couple of thousand books both for study and enjoyment. I could probably wear the maillot jaune in the Tour de Waterstone's, but I can only think of five books out of all of those that I enjoyed as much as this one.I am also an avid cyclist of both road and mountain bikes.REVIEW:For one thing, this book is SO GOOD despite that the writing doesn't come across as the work of a professional writer. Sally Jenkins managed to maintain Lance Armstrong's voice on the page, so that it mostly reads like a very long e-mail or conversation over beer with Lance Armstrong himself. You would never get this kind of personal-style expression and energy out a person in an interview, giving me the feeling that this really is a book BY Lance Armstrong with significant guidance and help by Sallie Jenkins. The ink smells of adrenaline.A couple of the chapters do read like professional writing, but it's not overdone and strengthens the readability and enjoyment of the book.I can only think of one chapter--which was entirely about the bike--that started to get boring because it was full of Lance Armstrong just blowing his own horn. On the other hand, it was kind of Mohammad Ali, \\"Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee\\" of him, and showed the real mind of a competitive athlete. All of us who have competed in a hardcore sport on a national or international level have that attitude about ourselves, and it just serves to show that Lance Armstrong is/was no different. It served to connect all of us jerks to the one we admire the most, to evaluate our attitudes and then get a lesson from Lance Armstrong's experience of fighting for his life and his humanity rather than just fighting to win more.What makes this book really great is that it seems like it's several books, but they're all tied together well. Yeah, it is about the bike at some points, about the Tour at others, about racing, cancer, and his mother--but it's not a jumble of these things. Nor is it some junkie book about a person who just happened to catch national attention, like The Amy Fischer Story or whatever crap is out there about Tonya Harding or some of our instantly famous heros who cash in on that first fifteen minutes of fame. It's not understated, and not overstated.Will people who are not athletes or related in some way to serious athletes enjoy this book? I have no idea. Maybe they can't relate, maybe they'll like it for some other reason, but for us titans out there--in sports or business or whatever--this is a great read.What the Book of Five Rings is to teaching people how to be more competitive, this book is to teaching competitive people to be more human.BOTTOM LINE: I had to stop myself from reading this book all in one day and managed to pace myself out to five days. I'm a rather careful reader, but this was one of those books that I couldn't put down--which is unusual for me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The autobiography It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life by Lance Armstrong is the story about his fight to overcome testicular cancer and return to biking. The doctors that first diagnosed him with cancer said that there was not chance for him to return to biking, so he went to a different doctor who said he would try to get him back on a bike but acknowledged he had a low chance for survival. He overcame all of this to return 16 months later to ride in the Tour de France.This book about Lance Armstrong's journey is very excellent. It was a quick read and really gave me a good perspective on a cancer patient, although Lance Armstrong was way more focused than most people. The book was extremely informative as to his recovery with chemotherapy and surgery, but it didn't really delve deeply into the actual biology of the cancer on a cellular level.The book affected me a decent amount. It was an extremely well written memoir about an extraordinary journey. Since the person I really have relation to that had or has cancer was my grandfather who died 25 years ago, this book helped to fill that emotion gap. I can definitely apply the ideas in the book to my life. Armstrong just never gives up. He was only given a 20% chance to survive in the beginning. I would certainly have crumbled under such circumstances. Overall, it was a very good book that I will probably take with me throughout my life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I really valued reading this book after someone very close to me was diagnosed with the same cancer as Lance. It was informatative and emotional. Thanks to Lance for his Foundation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Its not about the bike, in fact there are only two paragraphs in the whole book that talk about the bike. This book is about Lances diagnosis, his struggle to accept his new reality, the aftermath of living as a cancer survivor, and trying to have a baby using frozen sperm. Oh yeah, and also winning the Tour De France.I enjoyed the book because I like the \\"overcoming really bad odds and still becoming a champion\\" type of story. I do not cycle, unless you count the sporadic bikes rides with my kids. I was hoping the book would not be loaded with unrelatable stories and details about the bike, training, and the actual races, and luckily for me it wasn't.This book was a personal account of a serious athlete struck with cancer. It gets a little whiny in a few places, but I have to give him points for being honest. I am sure I would be whiny if I was struck down in my prime and had to endure the horrors of chemo and brain surgery.The writing is excellent and you can almost feel the rain hitting your face during his grueling training rides in the mountains of Europe. My legs are burning right now just thinking about sitting on a bike for 6-7 hours of non-stop riding. Wow.To me, this book left the message of be happy because it can all change fast. Enjoy what time I am given and try to forget about the small stuff. Its a great book with a great message."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"as I was mid-way through this book, there were only two thoughts going on in my mind -1. this guy is human/normal like us with all frailties/insecurities2. and gosh what extremes are humanly possible!!... the triumph of human spirit! very humbling. very inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A page-turner like no other, once I started it, I couldn't stop. Without a doubt, Lance is one of kind athlete, but that's not the point. The early achievements, the cancer battle, the return to the sport - it's an amazing story of the resilience of the human spirit, both on the account of people around him, and Lance himself. It's a gem of a book and an inspirational read, it reminded me of what we are all capable off."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this book with trepidity. Having read scores of biographies from succesful sportspersons, I did not expect this one to be any different. They struggle, they compete, they succeed. I started reading this purely based my wife's strongly recommended this.And it just did move me completely!Once I started reading, there was no looking back. This is gripping cover-covcer. I guess the cycle races are such. We get so involved in the sport. Whern Lance talks about Cancer, it is not in absurd medical terms or over-simplification. He did carry me long - thtough his journry. I could vicariusly experience being with him in the ward in Idianopolis or at the Finish line of Tour De France.A narrative style that takes the audience at a leisurely pace, keeping the reder hooked and attached to the strory.Truly inspirational. A day after I finished the book, today, I am shaving my head for a cause - cancer patients!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Perhaps the most noticeable part of the book is its sparse, honest, Texas style. In what was mentioned in innumerable reviews before, Lance discusses cancer, and how that affects his career choice, which happens to be competitive bicycle riding. Hey, we all have careers, Lance points out. The book isn't really about the Tour de France, and it is, simply, a boon for other men reading about cancer.But that's not what makes the book great. It's the sheer honesty, sort of editor be cursed personality that bleeds through pages, that makes the book special. Probably there are many books written about cancer, and how men can survive it. There probably aren't as many books written as if you were hearing it from a guy at a bar.Plus, much to the jealousy of biography and autobiography writers everywhere, there are no false, contrived moments here. Not that this dude has to make up anything anyway, but there's a honesty of what he experienced, his suffering, and hope. Simple, straightforward, honest. If you ever go to Texas, you know what I mean."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This past holiday I was looking for a real life story. I wanted to read a true story on drugs, AIDS, drinking, smoking, or some other issue that is current. But when I found Lance Armstrong's biography entitled \\"It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life\\" by Sally Jenkins, I had found what I was looking for. From the first sentence of the book, to the last one I couldn't stop reading. In the end of every chapter I wanted to keep on reading, until I finishing it. This is a book for all ages and genders. No matter who or what you like, you'll relate to his life. It'll inspire you to make your dreams come true, let your inhibitions out and not care about anyone else. Although these terms are overused, I have three other people I know that have read this book and can agree with me.This book is a flashback starting when Lance Armstrong was born, taking us through his beginnings, through his battle with cancer, to when his baby is born. It narrates every detail, every thought or feeling of him, how he started riding the bicycle, about cancer, his wife, his mother, his friends, and his life. He explains how his life changed after cancer, how everybody turned their backs at him, and had to prove to them and to him how much stronger, and valuable he was now. If you really want to read a book about a soul survivor, and his amazing life, this is the book you have to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Inspiring book for anyone living with cancer or as a gift for anyone that is. I Have Recurrent malignant brain cancer and this book was given to me by the parents of one of my best friends who himself is a cancer survivor. I will treasure this book always!Buy it today! everyone could use a new hero to look up to!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong presents insights about his struggle with impossible adversity which clearly demonstrate a miraculous overcoming unimaginable odds. As a scientist and an endurance cyclist, my skeptical response changed shortly after swallowing whole the first few chapters as though they were but a page in length. Besides the respect most cyclists share for the 3-time Tour de France Champion, like prose set to motion, this book generated an exponential respect for Mr. Armstrong as person of heroic proportion. Very well done, indeed..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Phenomenal! One of the best books I have ever read. Not only extraordinarily inspirational, but also extremly informative and interesting. I don't think you can walk away without a thirst for more after reading this book. Lance is a winner in the truest sense of the word, and the writing is straightforward and honest. No punches are pulled - the good, the bad and the ugly are all dealt with. His triumph is truly exhilarating, and can serve as inspiration for us all in trying times. &quot;If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way.&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The worst thing about this book is that it ended. You don't need to know anything about bikes to read the book and become inspired. Lance Armstrong is a true American Hero - not for winning the Tour, but for using his fame from winning to help others. In the book he speaks as if he is just the guy next door, whe has gone through a terrible ordeal but was victorious."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was not a Lance Armstrong fan, until I read this book. I was influenced by (pre-cancer) media-driven statments about his arrogance and attitude, but this was before Lance became LANCE. He has changed the American perspective of professional cycling, and also given hope to people's fear of hearing &quot;I have cancer&quot;.Throughout the book, you can see how the 'old' Lance becomes 'new' through this personal attack on cancer. I enjoyed seeing his transformation into a mature and genuine human being though the thoughfulness of the other people in his life, namely his wife 'Kik' (what a stud).Whatever your physical limitations may be, this books speaks inspiration and in &quot;Rocky-eisque&quot; fasion, motivates all who are willing, to conquer the 'hills' that we overcome throughout life.Way to go Lance, you are a Hero."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have always been a fan of professional cycling overall, and Lance Armstrong personally. When I was called upon to choose a book to read for independant reading in high school, I chose this one. Not only was I satisified with my purchase, but I couldn't put it down. I finished it at two thirty that night.Lance Armstrong not only had a story to tell, but he told it in a fantastic way. He didn't hold back on any of the details, and this sets him aside from all other sports autobiographies. At 2:30 am, I wanted to go biking or just give my parents a hug. That was of course not possible at that moment, but all the same, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an incredible story about an incredible person and his fight to beat overwhelming obstacles. It's much, much more than a book about a bicyclist and Lance's story will inspire all who read it!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had heard good things about this book and picked it up to keep me company on an airplane. I knew nothing about cycling, and a little bit about Lance Armstrong, cancer survivor, TdF winner, etc. I didn't expect much. WOW. This book blew away my expectations. His story is incredible and an inspiration. Last year, we lost my fiancee's daughter to cancer and are familiar with the roller coaster cancer will put you on. The thing that kept this book so entertaining was the tone of it. This book could have been a conversation with Lance about what he'd been up to the past few years. It's a very light read given the heaviness of the subjects (cancer, chemo, childbirth). I have given this book (in audio) as a gift to my dad. That's how much I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a huge Lance Armstrong fan, and I loved reading this book. It shows all the struggles that one man has endured, and not only this one man, but all the people that are around him. I'm so glad that I decided to purchase this book, it shows the softer side of Lance, and it makes me realize what this man has gone through in order to be one of the top athletes in our world today. This is a book that I have told everyone about. It changes the way that I look at my life and others around me. I can't wait to read the follow up book.LIVESTRONG!!!!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An autobiographical \`truth' of a man who overcame testicular cancer and life's disappointments to become a true bike racing champion. I was particularly impressed with Lance's easy-style and insight into life.I like the fact that he's truly dedicated to staying on top of his game by eating right and eliminating his vices like caffeine. A study has shown that coffee has been linked to pancreatic cancer. I understand he's found a coffee replacement that taste just like coffee. Its made from soy, called soyfe e, and soy has been shown to fight heart disease. I bought a bag online at www.soycoffee.c om. I simply love it.Any adult, young student, or life skills classes could benefit from Armstrong's motivational message and down-to-earth story. Sally Jenkins, author of Men Will Be Boys, and the coauthor of: Reach for the Summit and Raise the Roof (both with Pat Summitt), and A Coach's Life (with Dean Smith), go's along for the ride with Lance in this in depth chronicle of a boy-turn-man, who overcomes tremendous odds to compete and win. A must read for fellow cyclists who need to reach deep within when they climb to the summits in life. Each will experience the hard work ethic needed to win a Tour de France victory. Armstrong will be a sixth time winner of the tour in 2004, in record time"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Essentially two books in one. One is about Lance's cancer, and the surgeries and treatment of that cancer -- especially concerning chemo. If you don't know what chemo treatments and the suffering associated with this procedure is...then this part of the book will certainly open your eyes. Very informative, and readable. The other part of the book is about professional bicycling and more specifically -- The Tour de France, and Lance's wins of that tour. And though he could have detailed professional cycling more so for the reader; he does give enough overview of team racing and of the Tour, and the techniques utilized to race it -- certainly enough to whet anyone's interest to learn more. You don't have to be into bike racing to enjoy this book. Just the information concerning cancer is enough to make this a valuable read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book wasincredibly detailed, and it awesomely displayed his life beyond the bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"These days everyone has heard of Lance Armstrong, but before he was known worldwide he was a cancer patient. In his autobiography It's Not About the Bike, he tells the story of his youth, his rise to become a champion, and, most of all, his battle with cancer. Armstrong tells the story of what it is like to be diagnosed with cancer and how he himself dealt with it. he describes in detail his treatments and the people who helped him through the tough times during his chemotherapy.Lance Armstrong's book about his fight against cancer really helped me understand what cancer and cancer treatment is all about. He described his experiences in a way that anyone reading the book could understand. It also helped me understand chemotherapy so that I could apply it to my project. Although he never got scientific with his descriptions, he broke everything down to give you a taste of what he went through. Reading this book gave me a perspective of cancer that I had never known because I have never known anyone close to me that has gone through it.Personally, I thought the book served its purpose well. It was not a long, drawn out book, but a story of Armstrong's amazing life put into a few day's worth of reading. I also enjoyed how he explained the medical terms so that they would not go over the reader's head. Not only did Lance talk about the medical strains of cancer, but he explained to the reader how cancer can effect a person emotionally and socially. The whole book, not just the parts about Lance's battle with cancer, really taught a lesson about what it meant to be a positive human being. Overall, I felt that the book makes us look at who we are and ask ourselves what kind of person we are. It was a written lesson on how to be a fighter and a survivor."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's recovery from cancer was amazing and inspirational. This book tells you all about it, but also includes other aspects of Armstrong's life that non-bicycle racing fans might find a little boring. You already know he's going to win the race.But as a person extremely interested in recovery, I admire Lance and learned a lot from him. I quoted this book three times in my book, The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.David Spero RN www.art-of-getting-well.com"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In Lance Armstrong's book \\"It's not about the bike\\" I thought it was an excellent book.The book is very well written. He explained how he had a rough childhood and how he started cycling, he took us through his races, and he described his cancer in every little detail not a single thing was left unsaid. He made you feel like you were on the bike next to him or sitting in the hospital room with him. He took you on an emotional roller coaster ride with all of the emotions running through his head you will have the same feelings reading the book. If you read this book it will motivate you and inspire you not to give up on your dreams and when an obstacle gets in your way you have to try your hardest to get through it and eventually you will overcome it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In this book LA tells you his story... Everything from how he got his first bike, how he raced on it, what he felt, what he thought, all the way to his come back after cancer. I greatly recommend this book for inspiration and to help you understand what a GREAT athlete is made of."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There's truth in the title: it's not about the bike, not even about Lance, although he's the one generating the narrative, and a good one it is. Joseph Campbell spoke about the &quot;Hero's Journey&quot;, which is what this book outlines. Some come to enlightenment through study, others through life-altering experiences, most never get there at all. With feet of clay, and a pretty good-sized ego (necessary for world-class athletes), and help from more gods and humans than anyone has a right to expect, Lance arrived on that windswept peak that overlooks life in this world. I thank him for sharing that with us, as painful as it was, and for helping us understand that we all can rise to that peak, but we cannot do it alone.In the words of the Hollywood reviewers, &quot;I laughed, I cried, I was changed.&quot; If you read this and aren't, you're not human."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In the opening chapters we are introduced to an athlete driven by success. Someone with an inflated self-serving ego who was obstinate, insulting and ruthlessly competitive. His mouth had no gatekeeper to prevent the insolent, unkind remarks he hurled at others.Then came a diagnosis of cancer. It jolted him into a new reality; one where other people shared an importance that he held exclusively for himself. Reading about his cure and transformation were both encouraging and inspiring. After the cure he expressed his gratitude by serving others unselfishly and magnimously.On a different, more entertaining note, I really enjoyed reading about the Tour de France.At the book's conclusion, I felt Armstrong should be awarded an honorary degree in philosophy from a distinguished university. His learning experience, which he shares through his candid autobiography is anything but abstract. It is life altering.Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins have written a tour de force. I give it high marks for content and style. Reading each page felt like having a personal conversation, except my comments to Lance went unheard. I look forward to a sequel."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was one of the most wonderful and inspirational books I have ever read. It says a lot for human nature and for what we as individuals can overcome. Even if you do not like biking or you have never had Cancer, you can relate to this book because you are human!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"We get to see the self-described Lance Armstrong with a large assist from Sally Jenkins on a journey from a somewhat disadvantaged childhood where Lance and his mother battled mostly economic odds to the present as a well-to-do Tour de France winner who has found a measure of contentment with a wife as devoted to him as was his mother and a newborn son.The book is pretty well balanced between describing Lance's cycling and his difficult battle with testicular cancer. There is no doubt that the book is part of an overall effort to capitalize on Lance's amazing Tour de France win in 1999 and after, but the sometimes angry, sometimes cocky Lance may be a little difficult to understand or tolerate by some.Lance acknowledges a great deal of good fortune in surviving cancer but does so rather disingenuously. The fact of the matter is that over 99% of the population would have never had the instant access that Lance had to specialists all over the country who as it turned made all the difference in his recovery. In addition, Lance was quite fortunate in that a bike store owner in Texas took Lance under his arm when he was very young and developed his cycling ability virtually from the ground up. It is vintage Lance Armstrong when he has falling out with his patron just as he is starting to gain some national recognition of his cycling talent. On several ocassions Lance benefited from the right guy entering his life at the right time to provide the right kind of help with his cycling. It did not have to happen that way.Some may find the book inspirational and it is to a degree. Others may see just how thin is the thread that separates success and even life itself from failure and even death."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a triathlete I've always been interested in Lance the cyclist (who used to be a triathlete) and never really cared for Lance the man. In fact, there are few professional athletes that I care to understanding outside of their sports realm as they are usually arrogant. Though it is their arrogance that makes them such great athletes. That was until a friend recommended I read his book. Wow! His story of survival is truly an inspiration to us all. Forget about the 3 tour victories. Here is a man who understands that we need to cherish every moment we have and take life full force. Be it good or bad, this is the only life we have so make the best of it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a true American hero. He has conquered an international sport and he has conquered a disease that affects so many people. We all know someone who has or has had cancer and this story is a message of hope. He had about a 1% chance of survival when he was diagnosed. Yet, he was able to overcome the odds and he is now cancer free. He also details his mental struggle with cancer and the trauma of returning to life. Very compelling stuff. For anyone who has ever ridden a bike or watched the Tour de France he is an inspiration. The last chapters are his first hand account of the '99 Tour. Great Stuff!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Don't make the mistake of assuming this one is only for jocks, those interested in sports, biking or memoirs written about athletes. I don't fall into any of those categories and I LOVED reading this book, which actually focuses on the positive side of having (and surviving) a life-threatening illness. Armstrong makes the intriguing argument that he came back from cancer with a new, stronger focus, a new perspective on his life and a determination to make the most of every day after that. Not only that, but he was able to win the Tour de France in spite of having NO sponsor (none of them were willing to believe he would succeed), many detractors and the knowledge that his body had endured a massive assault of chemicals, chemotherapy, etc. But his atheltic achievements are really a small part of the larger picture - his emotional and spiritual renaissance, a testimony (and inspiration) for any reader."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is one of the most moving personal success stories I have ever read. From the history of Lance's difficult childhood, to his hot headed youth, to his battle with testicular cancer, to his wife's pregnancy, to his amazing win of the 1999 Tour de France... I loved it all. The section detailing the 1999 Tour de France actually got my adrenaline flowing. Like the title of the book says, it's not about the bike. Instead, the book is more about how Lance Armstrong dealt with cancer, and what it has meant in his life. You will not be sorry you read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Received this book as an X-Mas present and two days later I was sending it back to my mom so she could read it. Very quick read and an unbelievable story. I like to think I'm a &quot;Man's Man&quot; but this guy makes me weep like a little boy on the first day of school. He is a stud and he should be the &quot;Athlete/Personality of the Century. Tiger is cool. MJ is also cool, but LA is the Bomb!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Not unlike many readers, I read this book with fairly limited knowledge of Lance Armstrong. At this point, most know of Armstrong's triumph over tesiticular cancer and winning of biking's greatest challenge, the Tour de France -- we don't know much of Armstrong the man (or husband or father as the book cover proclaims). All the ingredients were in place for a typical celebrity autobiography -- trouble kind turns life around by becoming world class-athlete faces life-threatening disease and comes out on top. However, with some mild guilt, I never found myself liking Armstrong that much and in fact he was a bit of a jerk.I expected to be swayed when Armstrong's life was rocked by cancer. To some effect it did -- but Armstrong's cocky attitude towards his own life did not sway as he stard death in the face. But then I realized that there was something very refreshing to this about this. Though this could have easily fallen into the drippy sentimentality of a &quot;disease of the week&quot; TV movie (and probably will some day if Hollywood has its way), it did not. While the above Amazon review says the story will &quot;melt the most hard-bitten soul&quot; I hold true to that mine was merely &quot;thawed.&quot; I hope my soul is not alone out there, but my gut tells me that Armstrong's intention was not to have anyone feeling sorry for him.Overall, the book is an informative look at the world of bike racing and cancer treatment. I do respect Armstrong's life journey and truly miraculous comeback. I just find his machismo something that would prevent me from sharing a friendly beer with him in the real world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An absolute must read for anyone who needs a little inspiration. I laughed, I cried, but most of all after reading this book I am reminded of all the treasures in my life. This book will help you to ground yourself and recenter your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My wife and children bought me this book for Fathersday and I finished the book last night. It was one of the few books I have encountered in a great while that grabbed me in such a way that I literally could not put it down.The book is written so that anyone can relate and understand what makes such an incredible man tick. Adversity combined with the will and desire to succeed and never quit, regardless of the situation is a lesson often lost in today's society.Lance gives a brutally honest account of his life and conveyed it in a way that I found to be inspiring. Every time I think I personally have it bad or am being challenged in a way that I can't handle, I will remember this book and what it teaches us about life and the true meaning of sacrifice.This book should be required reading among our youth. Lance Armstrong is a true hero and someone to be looked up to and learned from."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an inspiring book. As a cancer survivor and a cyclist, Lance hit home on many subjects. His account of cancer (&quot;You don't know it yet but we're the lucky ones&quot;)is so true. His account of Plano, TX (Not very favorable) is so true. His account of the tour was very inspiring and educational. It lets you see him as a person, and not the 1999 Tour De France winner. Read this book. Give it to someone you know fighting cancer, and hopefully they will one day realize they are &quot;one of the lucky ones&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a cycling friend...I had been working hard to get back in shape after baby two and on a &quot;longer&quot; cycling ride (only 35 miles) I was passed on a hill by an older women on a mountain bike...I was a little depressed by the incident and my friend chuckled and immediately said, &quot;...you should read Lance Armstrong's new book.&quot; I did! I purchased this book because I thought it would give me motivation to workout, but Lance Armstrong's story gave me soooooo much more. His story is so inviting and personal that I felt it more than I read it. And although this is a book about Lance's triumphs, he's not the only extraordinary person you'll read about. I drew inspiration from many of his closest friends and family, especially his mother and his wife. When I read the last paragraph and closed the cover, it was late and quiet....and there was just one single word left in my mind and my heart....THANKS."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Amrmstrong and Sally Jenkins did a wonderful job sharing the pain of such a terrible disease, the truth behind what really happens, and how this disease can actually change you for the better!I bought this book because I work in the dot.com world and needed to &quot;get down to earth.&quot; Even though I used to cycle, my hope was to find a book that could help me create some balance in my life and provide some direction. That it did. What I did not expect, was to be so moved about this incredible relationship Lance had with his mother, coupled with the unbelieveable obstacles (even if you are a cycling fan, you will still be surpprised) he had to overcome not just to survive, but to be able to get back to a professional level of cycling.I've always respected Lance as a cyclist. But learning more about him as a son, a father, a cancer survivor, a husband, and a human being has created a hole heck of a lot more respect (even bigger than Texas!)for the kind of man that he is.You will never forget this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a heartbreaking and eventually victorious story -- a great read and I would highly recommend it to anyone going through their own cancer treatment. Even though I read it after he won his 6th Tour, I was silently cheering as I read in this book about his first Tour win. It is bittersweet to read about how much he loved Kik since they are now divorced. But, if this book is one thing, it's hopeful. Lance is more than a cyclist and a cancer survivor. He is an inspiration, and these days that is something rare and very special."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like a lot of Americans, I didn't have a clue about The Tour de France until Greg LeMond won it in 1986.After that, I became a fan.Before he won his first tour in 1999, I knew more about Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie than I did Lance Armstrong. I watched in amazement as Lance rode, amid the swirl of publicity about his triumph over cancer. He became the embodiment of the underdog....cocky young man, cut down in the prime of his power...has doubts...finds love...tries to return...quits only to dig deep and find something extraordinary inside.I disagree with reviewers who say Armstrong is overly arrogant and self-centered. He gives all credit for his tenacity to his nurturing mother. He says he only deserves the zipper in his yellow jersey...that his team mates own the front, back and sleeves. He even gives credit to the mountains in North Carolina for helping him finds his way back to competitive cycling.In creating the Lance Armstrong Foundation, he's put his substantial profile and his checkbook where his passion lies.....in cancer research. How many other elite riders have given back like that?Professional athletes can't survive without egos. It's part of what makes them so competitive. Lance has ego to let. But, remember one thing....he has four yellow jerseys and a clean bill of health to back him up!As for his temper, I think he showed remarkable restraint when he crushed the competition in the first time trial of the 1999 race and then got to walk by members of the team who had dropped him when he was in the fight of his life. Oakley, Nike and Giro hung tough with Lance. Confidis caved. Personally, I wouldn't have just said \\"That was for you,\\" when he passed members of the Confidis team...the men who Armstrong felt \\"...had left me for dead in a hospital room.\\" I woulda decked 'em.Sally Jenkins did a terrfic job of getting Lance's story down on paper. In fact, her style was so compelling that I read the book in one sitting, not even noticing the time flying by. I can't wait to read their second collaboration, EVERY SECOND COUNTS in October.Ride, Lance, Ride. It's what you were born to do. Live, Lance, Live."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Have you ever seen a miracle before? Do you want to see another one? In this admirable book written by Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins you will read the most interesting and amazing story of fighting against odds. It is about the Lance's courageous life: his survival of cancer. You will see how the devastation of cancer changes Lance's life physically and emotionally. The disease itself brings his ego from 100% to 0%. During his disease he gets to a point of not moving because of the effects of chemo, riding another bike again wasn't important for him, he just wants to live. He goes from having everything he desires to having less material things and to really valuing the things he has. His personality also changes. He goes from being a bully in the racetrack to being a real gentleman and respecting everyone on it. During his cancer, to make matters worse, Cofidis, his main sponsor, retires and his family finds out that he doesn't have a health insurance.One day, after his five cycles of chemotherapy are done, LaTrice Haney phones him and gives him the good news \\"You are clear, cancer free\\" but the risk of still coming back was there. Lance gets strength and starts training to compete at a professional level and he does. He finishes 14th and in another similar positions in some tours. When he was riding the Vuelta (a race) he decides no to compete again he was done.With this mentality, he moves back to his home in Austin with his wife (they were living in Nice) and doesn't ride on a bike in some time. A coach, Chris Carmichael convinces him to try the bike again. He trains hard and all his training pays off when he swept the 1999 Tour de France. Training for the 2000 Tour De France wasn't a walk in the park. He had several crashes in the Pyrenees and hurt his head, but he recovered. In the 2000 Tour, he proves that he is the best cyclist when he beats his closer competitor, Jan Ullrich in a time trial in Metz.In my opinion, this is a must read book for every athlete or for everyone who would like to see how a man can change. The two main themes are: love and survival. This is not another biography; this is a life changing one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very disappointed...The book was recommended to me as a deep book on his life changing event....although a very powerful story I found it very shallow and with very little deep meaning and it leaves you understanding how his ego led to his marital affairs,divorce and abandoning his family...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong had all of the experiences and had developed all of the tools to become a great athlete and full blown narcissist. Had cancer not intervened, his views of himself and of the role of those around him might have become even more aggrandized than they did in real life.His loving and lovely wife we can see was the ultimate support mechanism, very little is spoken of what he gave to her other than the once in a lifetime chance to be with himThere is a good story about dealing with cancer and how it has the potential to change one but in his case not enough.The history of the last decade has confirmed what the book foretold"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm not a biking enthusiast, but I read this book upon the recommendation of my husband, who would give it an emphatic 5 stars. I thought that I would be uplifted and inspired, but, well, it actually made me like Lance Armstrong a little less. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but, according to the book, he wasn't really very nice to the people around him as he went through his ordeals, and he doesn't waste much time thanking anyone. And did he really get the owner of Oakley to force an insurance company to cover the costs of his cancer treatment? Great for him, but all he did was pass the cost of his treatment on to other policyholders who made sure that their premiums were paid. I wish I would have like this book, but I can't say that I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins other book \\"Every Second Counts\\" about three years ago and finally got around to reading this book, which was their first collaboration. I enjoyed both but gained more insights into Lance the human being as opposed to the super athelete in this book. Lance comes across as a bit of a jerk at times. I was thinking at times what an a hole. The story itself, his foundation etc. is a story for the ages but I couldn't help but see the man behind the glass. I remember attending the first Ride For Roses bike event and participating and seeing Miguel Indurain and Lance with his then new or soon to be wife Kik and thinking, what a magical story. After reading this book and seeing his attitude about that ride and other insights into his personality I came away a bit turned off to Lance. Previous to reading this book I was a big Lance fan; I still am but not to the same degree. I still think he is a miraculous athelete but his halo has been tarnished. I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone. As a cyclist and the son of a cancer survivor this book really hit home. It really is a touching story, in spite of Lance coming across as a bit of a jerk. Read this book to see what makes Lance tick and see what you think about him. Is he an over inflated egotistical driven machine or a caring warm human being who just happens to have been the best rider on the planet? Probably a little of both. Anyway, check it out , you be the judge, the ride will not be dull, it is a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this book is difficult to put down. It is not because it is fine literature that will endure the ages (it isn't, and it probably won't), but because it reads like Lance Armstrong rides...all out. It was truly inspiring reading about the impact cancer had on Lance and how his life changed because of it. He writes that he has become two different people - 1 before cancer and 1 after. As he has now won his second Tour, devotes time to raising money for cancer research, and is a proud father, he has become a inspiration for all of us. Congratulations, Lance...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This fantastic person, Lance Armstrong, faced cancer, nearly died, survived, and as I write this (July 22, 2000) is about to win his second Tour de France since his brush with death. He is a superb athlete and an extraordinary human being. The adversity of his disease and its brutal treatments changed him for the better both as a sportsman and as a person; and it is his bike that runs through this book as the unifying force and the symbolic icon for what Lance does. Yes, many of the important aspects of this book have to do with things of the spirit and not with pedaling; but it is on wheels that he first encountered fame, the lack of those wheels that brought him to near despondency, and the triumphal return to his wheels that signaled his being whole once more.There is no self pity or sentimentality in these pages. This is not a book of the \\"inspirational\\" genre; but few will be able to read it without being changed for the better. Here is a man who at every stage of his life could have yielded to excuses or victimhood, but who systematically said \\"no\\" to everything except excellence and self discipline. A true winner. An exciting, fast-paced book. A great reading exoperience; about the bike and about many other things, too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is such a great and inspiring book. It's amazing how he and Bristol Myers-Squibb allowed him to overcome his cancer. And what's even more amazing that he won the Tour de France. This book is plain great!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book because of Armstrong's amazing result in the 10th(?) stage at Hautacam. What stood out to me was his intensely close relationship to his mother, fixation on numbers (cancer, cycling, and financial), jockish attitude in dealing w/cancer like a stage race and dilemma in selecting a cancer treatment (two completely different methods of attack).Luckily, no one close to me has had any form of cancer and the outlining of his treatment was somberly edifying - a process you don't want to know about and yet you should. He also writes about something I've always wondered about - whether survival rates have any relationship to attitude and overall well being.I got the impression that he does have sort of a cocky athletes are superior attitude (he mentions on his riding w/a non-cyclist that normally he wouldn't ride w/such a novice), but that's the way athletes, professional or amateur, in general, are. I chalk it up to attitude as motivation.Overall, a good read. I can only hope that I have as good a perspective on life as he does."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Our book club read this book this month and we all agreed that it was a surprisingly good and quick read. To read how cancer took hold of his life and how he and those around him dealt with it made for a powerful story. It is especially interesting to anyone who knows anyone who has or had cancer. Well done."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"My husband read this book out loud to me in a day and a half. Once he started, I wouldn't let him stop reading. I cannot think of a better book to encourage teenagers to read. There is a true American Hero alive and well today - his name is Lance Armstrong. He embodies everything good about the human spirit, and he wrote a great book, too!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a avid reader and cyclist. I am generally reading two to four books at a time. When I started to read &quot;It's Not about the Bike&quot;, all my other books remained closed until I finished this one - cover to cover. My twelve year old son is starting to read it now and while some parts are a bit graphic, the inspirational material is exceptional."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an amazing individual. . .this book read like one of John Grisham's page turners, but with a ton more substance obviously. The strength and beliefs of Lance are simply unmatched. The book is very inspirational and ranks right up there with &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; in terms of content and the issues it questions of readers. A must read, for both athletes and none athletes ."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Make no mistake, this book is about cancer and how Lance Armstrong survived it; he describes some races, and includes details about his life, but they are minimal in comparison (the discussion of his son's birth covers only about ten pages). His determination and will are admirable, but his bravado and arrogance are repulsive. At one point in the book, just before he is to have brain surgery, he relates the story of how he began to contemplate his existence and his life. His conclusion? Basically that if he did not survive, he would look God in the eye and say &quot;if I wasn't good enough, then fine, do whatever you've got to do.&quot; He does explain his agnosticism to an extent: a bad experience with his adoptive stepfather who was a professing Christian. His wife, however, is Catholic, and he tells a story in the book about how he bought a crucifix for himself and a friend of his who had cancer also. On the topic of religion, like virtually everything else, including cycling, Armstrong comes off as a person who thinks he can do whatever he wants and not have to answer to anyone. In this way, he is little more than a misguided rebel. That having been said, however, he does display some redeeming qualities in addition to his stubborn will to beat cancer: his efforts in founding a charitable foundation are commendable, and his understanding of his &quot;duty&quot; as a survivor of cancer to others who struggle with the disease, as well as the families of those who have fallen victim to it, are both praiseworthy and insightful. I cannot help but come away with the impression that Armstrong is still very much in the process of self-discovery, and that this book is just his journey so far."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. A fantastic book about an interesting character that has little to do with sports and more to do with the human spirit. This book details Lance's early life as he addresses his cocky, immature nature that quickly goes out the window when he begins his cancer battle. Lance is alive because his is famous. His cancer was so aggressive and mature that IMO what saved him is the unsolicited email from the doctor at Vanderbilt that eventually led him to the doctors at Indiana University. I like sports and would never have read a book just about cancer survival but this book was so highly recommended and for good reason.The book finishes with Lance mentally battling to get back on the bike and on to greater glory. There is much to learn here also but the one downer would be listening to him describing his ideal marriage when of course it has already broken up.I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHER. You will not be disappointed. And yes, you will start following the Tour de France."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm female, I ride my bike for fun, I'm Canadian and I've never survived cancer and I only know where France is on the map but Lance took me through the life of an athlete, the life of a cyclist, what it means to truly survive cancer and I won a tour de Franc with him.The story of cancer survivor and cyclist, Lance Armstrong is truly inspirational. It have me new insight into meeting my goals and how fortunate I am for good health. In his twenties, Lance fought off one of the deadliest diseases out there. He fought through the chemo - he survived the chemo and he taught himself a new life lesson - life is worth living. To come back from such trauma and win not one but seven consecutive tour de franc is amazing.If you know nothing about cycling or have never experienced cancer in your life or family it doesn't matter you still need to read this book.Lance will inspire you to seek your own journey back to life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I think this was a good autobiography because it kept me interested, unlike most boring, textbook-like autobiographies. You can learn a lot about life from reading this book, and it puts a lot of issues into new perspectives. Lance tells stories with descriptive detail in a way that makes you want to keep reading, and he projects the personalities of the characters well enough that you almost think you know them after a while. He has a talent of taking an event or situation and getting it onto paper so that it's easy to picture. Overall I'd say this is a good book for people looking for inspiration, knowledge, or just entertainment."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.I truly enjoyed the way he described his fight surviving cancer and how he one his very first Tour de France. I recommend this book for 7th graders and up especially for adult's. Overall this is book should be rated as a 5+ star book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Written By A 7th GraderDel Mar School"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"OMG. Man oh man I just recently read this book and all I can say is what a guy. I recommend this book to anyone who basically likes good books. Lance Armstrong tells a story of the battle against cancer that brought me to tears many a times. And the story of his first Tour de France win. This book gives so much insight into the life and personality of Lance. He is so wonderful and ironically right now I am watching Stage 8 of the Tour de France 2004. I read this book probably 5 months ago and this book still lives in my memory and is one of my fav books. Read Immidiately or be kicked."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstong's book, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;, is a wonderful book about how he battled cancer. Armstong shares his stories about battling cancer, growing up without a father, and how he won all his tour de france's. This was a great book to read. It was very informative on cancer and the reality of the disease. This book was very inspirational because lance beat the odds of surving only having about a 3% chance to live. This is a good book that was fast and easy to read, and i recomend the book for not just cyclist, but for everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excellent book, Lance can really write. He gets his feelings across really well on paper. His thoughts on cancer, his cycling, and life in general are things that everyone should spend some time dwelling on.And no, you need not be an expert cyclist. Lance's dedication to the sport comes through even if you haven't ever ridden a bike in your life.I can't say anymore, you just have to get this book. It's not hokey-pokey, fairy-tale stuff. He is a realist, and always took everything full force."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an incredible book--&quot;How do you like them apples!&quot; :-) A thought-provoking, profound, compelling story that evokes every emotion imaginable--I laughed, I cried, then I read it again."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Ever hear of a &quot;one call close&quot; in sales ?? Well this book is the equivalent of that. I read it in one sitting. Quite simply Lance spoke in brutal honesty and reflection about his experiences with cancer and world class cycling. Even though this was the focus of the book, the real story is about the human spirit.Lance is an incredible person who literally &quot;willed&quot; himself to his current position as &quot;cancer survivor&quot; and Champion Cyclist. The story lives up to the hype of the celebrity. He is the real deal.There are some other heroes in this story, namely the Doctors who helped Lance (they are amazing), his nurse and most importantly his mother.After reading this book and learning of the adversity Lance has overcome, it makes our own lives much clearer in terms of the artificial limits many of us have in place."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Q: How do you write a book to tell a story when everybody already knows most all of the story? A: LIKE THIS! People know about the bike, people know about the cancer, what people don't know is the how and the why. With this brutally honest, sometimes excruciatingly explicit (in the chemo stories) story of who Lance Armstrong really is.Lance the survivor and bike racer is known and admired for all that he has overcome, and for the amazing person that he has become. This book shows how he became such an amazing person. It's not all pretty -- not even most of it is pretty -- but it is HONEST. Lance is not shy about addressing his own mistakes and weaknesses, while trying to show what (and how) he learned from them. In wonderful style, he shows that it really ISN'T about the bike, by spending more time discussing his failures, his losses, and his mistakes, than his victories -- because that's what he could learn from. Lance is even more of a hero and a role model for the world because of this book, because he was not afraid to say &quot;I was wrong&quot;, and was willing to grow and learn through the experiences."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As good as it gets in a biography. Fiction could not have been written any better: teen single mom raises her baby to never quit or take the easy way out.Bike racing cancer victim Armstrong seems to hold nothing back in this inspiring probe into his life, where he states that he would rather claim the title of cancer survivor over race victor, and that having cancer was the best thing that happened to him. Giving his mother's care and never give up example and his &quot;stud&quot; life partner of a wife all the credit, Armstrong's story filled me with tears at times, a belly laugh at others, and most of all the encouragement to look at obstacles as opportunites instead of stumbling blocks. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book basically tells you the biography of lance armstrong. How his childhood affected him and his comeback from cancer. Its a very good story telling you that life is meant to be tough and only the strongest will succeed. Alot of stories about lance's childhood, his mom, cancer treatment and how he came back to win the Tour De France. Alot of many cycling and business aspects to this book as well. However the language is abit crude and story lacks transition. Its almost a story telling book with alot of random stories, mumblings, and then moves on to another part of his life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A fierce will to live.

Lance is an amazingly courageous guy and a terrific athelete. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm not a big fan of bike racing, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like to read a biographer about a bike racer. And written by him--just because he is a good athlete doesn't necessarily make him a good writer (but he has Sally Jenkins there to help with that). But this memoir wasn't just about bike racing. It was about cancer and surviving it. In fact, more about cancer than racing. There was something spiritual about Armstrong's experience, both on the bike and with cancer. Even if you aren't a big fan of the sport, this is still a good memoir to read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading this book, I have a larger respect for the Tour de France and the athelets who participate in it. This is the story of Lance Armstrong's journey back to his racing career, and more importantly, life, after his battle with cancer. My heartstrings were pulled as I read. As an athlete I can understand somewhat of what he goes through, with the training and all. I even used this book for some of my college essays! Go out and read it, it's an autobiography like none other!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is easy to see why Lance has been so successful in his life. He has an amazing capacity for attacking any obstacle that gets in his way, whether it be cancer or the French alps. As a fellow cancer survivor, I could so relate to his battle. Mine was not as advanced as his was, and many times I felt like just giving up. I cannot imagine having to endure surgery, and chemo, and still managing to get on a bike. There are times when Mr. Armstrong comes across as arrogant and obstinate; probably what gave him the strength to persevere in the face of the naysayers who had already given him up for dead."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I red this book on a flight to Miami almost two years ago.It has became my bible: this is not about the bike at all. It's about the love of a single parent raising her only child facing so many challenges, it's about true friendship (something that is really hard to find nowadays...), it's about passion and efforts to reach a goal in one's life. It makes you think about how easly your life can change and you cannot avoid it, all you can do is find the energy to fight back as good as you can.I red this book over 25 times, I now it all. Forward and backward. And it still suprises me and I can still discover parts that give me a new impulse. It changed my life. I keep this book right beside my cupboard.And now I'm waiting for Lance's sixth victory.sabyne moras"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspirational book. Not just for the bicyclist. My wife started it as soon as I was finished. She couldn't put it down either. A look at Lance Armstong's inner make-up. What he wants you to know about anyway. A great book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was one of the most inspiring books that I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you are thinking your life is the greatest or the worst, you have to read this book. This case is about the cancer, about the triumph, about the way with better things than others.Lance Amstrong, no doubt, is a shining case in the cyclism history and a proof of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This should be removed from Amazon's store...actually it shouldnt even be published any longer. Armstrong is a liar and scumbag. If you like fiction, buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This autobiography from Lance Armstrong gives one a good sense of who he is (amazing cylcist, cancer survivor, somewhat-spoiled superstar athlete, etc.) and what drives him. The book focuses on his struggle with cancer and comeback to cycling. It's really quite amazing what he did and what he keeps doing. The story is told in a very conversational manner which is very easy to listen to (I was listening to the Audio CD). I imagine it is a very quick read too.AUDIO CD WARNING - Be forewarned if you listen to the Audio CD - it is very poorly formatted. There is only one track per CD and it will immediately start repeating as you finish the CD - so you find yourself thinking \\"Hmm, this sounds familiar\\" and then notice you have started over. Most Audio CDs are savvy enough to put music or at least a pause in."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Very few people will ever see the extreme lows and highs that Lance Armstrong has faced. Few fictional stories will ever be as unlikely as this true story. This book will remind you of what it is possible for a human being to accomplish.As a cyclist and long-time fan of Lance Armstrong, I found it interesting that I finished the book with even more respect for his accomplishments, but feeling like I wouldn't actually enjoy the man if I were to meet him. I see it as a credit to the writing and to Armstrong's openness in the book that I responded this way. (By the way, I fully acknowledge that he's well beyond needing to care one bit about what I think of him.)Highly recommended."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"To be honest, I didn't know much about Lance before reading this. I knew he was a cyclist and I knew those trendy livestrong bracelets that all the celebrities suddenly had, had something to do with him, but that's about it. The topic of Lance Armstrong came up after my history class a few months ago. My teacher and I were talking about positive quotes, and he read me one from \\"It's not about the Bike.\\" I was instantly moved. My teacher asked me if I would like to borrow the book for the weekend, and I automatically said yes. I couldn't put it down, I read the entire thing in under 48 hours. It moved me in ways I never thought possible, brought up emotions I never knew I had. A family member of mine passed away from cancer a few years back, and it took me back to that summer, I saw things from a different perspective. I have urged many of my friends to read this, and convinced a few of my friend's parents too. All of them have enjoyed it. Me, being a 16 year old female, who was never ever intrested in cycling, was skeptical at first to read it, but it is now one of my all time favourite books. Read it, you won't be let down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a great lesson of ambition, strong will and determination that can be useful to anybody. First, it's about fighting and beating cancer and then on a second level it is about the world of cycling. I am not and have never been a competitive cyclist or even a fan of the sport, but you don't have to be a fan to read this book - it's just a wonderful and emotional testimony of a very dedicated cyclist fighting a deadly disease.It is not a literary masterpiece, but there is a very good lesson about survival on almost every page of it.You will find this book very easy to be read, with a style that is simple and concise. But most importantly, you will find out what is like to become sick and unable to do something once taken for granted, from a very active and hard working athlete and then return to the stage and win one of the most difficult contests in the world: Tour de France.You will find that the best way to win in life is to turn a serious obstacle into an opportunity and make a negative become a positive. I think these are ideas that should guide us all the time.Was the hero's survival a miracle? Or just determination? Lance wonders himself: \\"The question that lingers is, how much was I a factor in my own survival and how much was science and how much miracle?...[P]ersonally I'm content with simply being alive to enjoy the msytery.\\"I recommend you to buy this book: I think it will change your vision of things a great deal and I promise you, you won't put it down until you finish it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The greatest books are those that captivate an audience that knows little or nothing about the subject. Before reading &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;, I had absolutely no knowledge of bike racing and (thankfully) little exposure to cancer. Lance Armstrong lays his life wide open to the reader, and the result is a touching, informative, and honest account of this man's life.Armstrong opens with the diagnosis of his cancer and the emotions he went through as the cancer spread and he was forced to decide between treatment startegies. He takes time to recount his childhood and his introduction to biking, explores in vivid detail his chemotherapy, discusses his psychological recovery from cancer, and closes with his return to professional bike racing and his &quot;second life&quot; as a cancer survivor.&quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; is written in a simple, straightforward way. It is amazingly honest and open from the start, a quality it seems fewer and fewer autobioraphies possess these days. Armstrong doesn't try to create an image for himself or attempt to hide his mistakes. He doesn't shy away from difficult subject matter or even private pieces of his life. He tells his story with dignity, modesty, and a survivor's desire to let readers know that anything is possible."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I AM A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT OF READING A NOVEL ON A CONTEMPORARY ISSUE; CANCER BEING ONE OF THE MANY LISTED. I CHOSE TO READ LANCE'S BOOK AND READ IT COVER TO COVER IN ABOUT 2 HOURS. THE PROJECT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST ABOUT 8 WEEKS. OOOPS! THE BOOK WAS VERY POWERFUL TO ME SEEING AS HOW MY MOTHER HAD CANCER, MY STEP-FATHER MOUNTAIN BIKE RACES, AND I LOVE READING. THE BOOK IS GREAT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WHO READ THIS!!! :)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is kind of funny, I raced thru this at a pace that I usually do not read at! Like I had some race to finish! It is told with such ease and openess that you forget that you are reading! Be prepared to open some emotional floodgates! Especially if you are motivated by victory and like to see people succeed! The only problem I had was putting it down when I finished!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Up front, I am a father, husband and athlete. I say that so that my comments below do not get dismissed as being from a female perspective. Unlike many of the reviewers, I did not read this book until May, 2003. First of all, this is a great and fast read. It is very entertaining and educational. It is an uplifting story of a son raised by a single mother, who did not fit in with the popular groups in school and who chose cycling as a way to escape, both physically and emotionally. It is a great story of the American Dream come reality. He literally worked to get where he is today, a champion and millionaire. It is also a great account of combat with a deadly disease, complete with excrutiatingly detailed descriptions of the horrific battle cancer patients fight. Simply put, there is much about the book and Lance Armstrong to admire. That said, I agree with many of the negative comments about Armstrong being self-absorbed and self-centered, although that is not relevant to a review of whether this is book worth your reading. After reading a recent magazine article which revealed that he now has been separated from his wife I found the book to contradict reality, at least as it goes to his loyalty to her. There is no doubt that Armstrong suffered and had to fight for his life through cancer, and that his subsequent 4 straight victories in the Tour are a remarkable achievement. But I now find myself questioning some of the things he states in his book. I think the reader will come away with one distinct impression that perhaps Armstrong himself cannot even realize: He has been able to do what he has done due to the love and support of two women, his mother and his wife. Another thing that he seems blind to and takes for granted are the many friends who seem to bend over backward to support him. One disturbing example is his repeated accounts of his previous girlfriend's love and support during his cancer battle. She repeatedly appears at all places, then when he goes into remission, she is dismissed from the book with one or two lines about the battle having burned her out on the relationship. He never mentions her again. Then when he writes about meeting his future wife, he makes it a point to state, &quot;I know I am supposed to say the light changed when I first saw her, but it didn't.&quot; Some of the sacrifices made by his wife to support his return to cycling are almost unbelievable. But the fact that he seemingly now has chosen his bike over his family is not surprsing if you read between the lines of the book. That said, he tells a poweful story and is a role model for athletic work-ethic and drive, if not for being a great human being. He is the kind of person you'd want your son to emulate if he is going to be a world-class athlete, but for any other role, I'd avoid his example."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I know I'll catch it for this review. The book itself gets 5 stars from me. I enjoyed the read, I shed a few tears and I kept hoping that somewhere it would eventually turn Lance Armstrong into one of my heros. It never did. In fact, I pray to God I never meet Lance Armstrong and never get in his path, and I pray anyone who ever has to does survives the encounter. Sally Jenkins gets kudos on pulling off what was a difficult task. How to write his biography and story with him watching over her and to tell the truth. She did it. She pulled it off by writing between the lines like no other. She is truly the hero here. Make no mistake, the book is good, the hero is not. He is, without a doubt the single most arrogant and egotistical person I've ever read about in my life. I wanted him to be my hero so bad too. I have just gotten into cycling and was looking forward to having someone to watch, follow and emulate. Lance is not that guy. You'll read things that will blow you away. How he fully expected his French sponsor to pay him his 5 million dollar contract even when he was taking chemo and was not riding for them, they even offered to give him a contract, just not 5 million and he was outraged. He freaked on might having to sell his $300,000 worth of furniture and &quot;art&quot; to pay for his treatment. Why oh why have all forsaken poor Lance he wonders. Supposedly a boy that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Plano, Tx, but give me a break, there is no &quot;wrong side&quot; of the tracks in Plano. Even though he was only raised by his mother, it's obvious people took care of Lance. Riding his expensive cycles that were given to him out of the goodness of one man's heart, and then he doesn't speak to this guy for years on end. I could continue, but I think the world needs to read this book to learn about this. Lance's story is not over, he still hasn't learned what he probably was meant to learn. I do not suggest buying this book for someone with cancer or a teenager. It's not inspiring in the least, no one can afford what Lance had to get him through his terrible cancer ordeal. And, if a teen reads this, he or she will expect the world to give them everything on a silver platter just like Lance expects. One curious note I can't yet figure out. Never once does Lance tell the world he didn't check himself monthly for testicular cancer and that if he had, he could have caught it before it spread to his brain and lungs and recovery would have been comparably easy. With many pages devoted to pictures of he, his wife, his baby and mother not one single page printed a diagram on how to check yourself for testicular cancer. Seems a hero would have had that thought first and foremost in his head, especially since testicular cancer never has gotten the same PR as checking for breast cancer. I might read his other books. Maybe he's learned something along the way, but that is highly doubtful."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was excellent for both cycling enthusiasts and not. It takes you back from Armstrong's past showing where he gets his drive, determination and fight from, to his life as a cancer patient describing, in much detail, the road he followed and how he felt both mentally and physically, all the way through to conquering his cancer and winning the fight. It is both uplifting to the general public and enthusiastic for us cyclists. And now, after the book, having his first child, &amp; winning his 2nd consecutive Tour de France, all after having cancer, is even more inspirational to see that one can not only conquer the deadly disease, but go on w/ one's life and follow a positive pathway."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book on a Friday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon. Each chapter presents a new stage and an identifiable struggle, which is every bit as tangible as the challenges life serves us, even to given athletes. By the end, you will have experienced the struggle and may even taste a bit of the success brought by the '99 Tour De France rider, Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have followed Lance's progress since his Tour Du Pont days and thought that I knew much more about him than I actually did. He is an american hero and his story would be compelling enough if only for that. Instead this story moves you to tears and then has you laughing again all in one page. You will not be able to put this down and when the last page is turned you will be sad it is over and wish you had not read it so quickly. You will hope for a sequel. Maybe a 2000 Tour de France win. But you WILL NOT be dissapointed in this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Duh! I've never read the book. No point in it anymore. He confessed that he cheated. Hence, the appropriate title is: It's About the Dope."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was given this book during my fight with cancer. This book injected hope, courage, heroism, compassion, to live no matter what, humour and bravery into my blood system along with the chemo poisions... thank you for sharing your fight with the rest of us!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was incredible to read and inspired me in many ways. It was recommended to me by a co-worker. I've read many books in my lifetime, but this one tops them all. It's because of this book that I took up cycling, which I now love. Aside from what he has accomplished on the bike, his fight against cancer simply floored me. For anyone to come back from those odds is just incredible. This is an absolute must read, and not just for cyclists or Armstrong fans. It is a story of courage and determination. And don't forget his follow-up book as well. I cannot wait to read his mother Linda's book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is awesome, I recommend it to everyone. Especially those with cancer or those with loved ones that are battling cancer. Lance Armstrong is an inspiration to us all. What he has done with himself and his life is amazing. I am not much of a reader...but this book is one of those that you just don't want to put down."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, like Jeff Blatnick, has taken advantage of an international stage to show the power of faith, friends and family, combined with medical research and skilled medical professionals. As I read Lance's book, I thought of what Carl Mays wrote in A Strategy For Winning: (quote) Jeff Blatnick won a gold medal in Grecco-Roman wrestling for the United States in 1984. I think he won even greater respect of the entire world by the way he adapted to and bounced back from his bout with cancer prior to the Olympics (end quote). People such as Lance Armstrong and Jeff Blatnick make Americans proud, and make the international human race proud, not merely because they win medals."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One word. EXCELLENT!It doesn't matter if your a fan of bike riding or not. Lance's book is just plain excellent and he is extremely inspiring!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an excellent book about an outstanding person. Yes, Lance is a cycling hero by any standard, having already won the Tour de France four times, but to have showed such perseverance in the face of life threatening and body wrecking cancer is just amazing. Most people would have never considered making a comeback after something like that, but Lance not only came back- he triumphed. This book gives the reader all the details of the battle with cancer, and much much more. By reading it, you get to know Lance as a person, and get inside the psyche of this great champion. The book is a real page turner, too, as I hardly put it down. An excellent read even if you have no interest in cycling. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I grabbed this book several years ago when I was looking for some summer reading. As a teacher, I often look for inspirational, non-fiction books to give me a \\"lift\\"....bascially; success breeds success.I was on my way to summer camp (I volunteer at a camp for deaf children each summer). i sat on the veranda of my family's North Georgia cabin and read this book from sun up to sun down until I was finished....two days I think.In this book, Lance is honest, bears his soul and lets us all know that NOTHING is impossible! I am a true Lance Fan!His co-author has also published a book about Pat Summit -- Ladies Football Coach for the University of TN -- also a great read!This book will inspire you to be better, set high goals -- and achieve them!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Maybe the title of this book should have been \\"It's Not About the Doping.\\"I bought this book for my mother, who was a Lance Armstrong fan, when the paperback was first published.After reading a few pages, wondering if I should invest in a copy for myself, I just couldn't get past the man's ego.If the stories hitting the news in the past few days turn out to be true, perhaps the man's overinflated view of himself will finally crash and burn along with his reputation.Somehow, however, knowing how these personalities self-justify their lives and actions, I doubt it.On the brighter side, I did learn something useful from reading a small portion of this bio; even someone who writes for the Washington Post can write poorly."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Quite an interesting account by the man who ought to know. Found Armstrong to be quite immature and narcissistic at times. However these features have added to the power of his winning method.Lance seems to forget that there are so many people who cannot jetset around America to find the Oncologist they think is best. Many people would not get extra help from Oncologists, etc. because they are NOT Lance Armstrong.Good luck to Lance, but I'm sure there are many other 'heros' who have faced greater odds and survived...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I believe that sports fans and athletes will enjoy a lot this book because will understand how hard it is to be a professional athlete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Dude this book was insanely awwwwwwsome. This was one of the greatest books that I have ever read. I really doubt that I could find a cooler book. But that's beside the point, the book showed his battle to be great since his child hood and through cancer. Putting down this book is like trying to walk on asphalt in the middle of summer, it was nearly impossible because this book was so good. The book goes into great detail on not only his battle with cancer but also with his childhood and his precancerous races and biking teams that he road on before his fight with cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"LikeOpen: An Autobiography, this is a sports autobiography which defies the genre and is a terrific book in its own right. Written in 2002, when Lance Armstrong had two Tour de Frances under his belt (he went on to win seven), this is the story of his early career as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer when his odds of survival were perhaps as low as 20%, his subsequent struggles to regain motivation and then his determination - and work - to secure a Tour de France victory. It's a fascinating and inspirational story, written in such a way that even non-cycling fans are bound to enjoy it.What I loved about the book is that Lance doesn't hide who he is - whether intentionally or not. Yes, there is much to admire: his courage in the face of cancer, his will to give back and inspire others, his single minded focus (to the point of obsession) on achieving a goal, his loyalty to his friends. But there is also the child whose mother couldn't do enough for him, who went on to treat even his closest friends like doormats on occasion. While he sings his (now ex) wife's praises, he also expects her to revolve her life about him and his needs. He is quick to take offence, bears grudges, has extremely high expectations of everyone on his support staff and is often rude to his fellow competitors.Regardless of how you feel about Lance Armstrong, he is a charismatic individual and this is a riveting autobiography written by a driven, inspiring and complex man."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I got this book from the used book store where I live.

I recuperated from that but before the end of side A of tape 1 were subjected to foul language 2-3 more times. I had to eject the cd and we listened to the radio for the remainder of the trip. It is a shame that we cannot be warned of these things in advance. I am not opposed to this type of language, per se, but I choose not to expose my daughter to it and am so upset at the lack of a warning, will probably never finish listening to the audiobook."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"To be perfectly honest, Lance Armstrong, has (with the help of Sally Jenkins) written a fine memoir about his recent battles (mostly bike races). His close call with cancer was extremely close and a heartwrenching, touching experience. I certainly feel for him. I used to be an avid cyclist, so I was quite interested in the book after a friend from Ireland (Paul Gourley) told me he loved the book. It's worth reading for anyone dealing with cancer or who loves bicycling. It's just not on my HIGH list as far as literary achievements go. If there's one thing I learned it's that Lance loves to WIN--no matter what the race/game/fight. Now I hear he's dating Sherly Crow, so I wonder what happened to 'the love of his life', the woman who had his child, Luke (wonders never cease as time goes by)."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Excelente libro, Ver como logro tanto en tan poco tiempo y como logro vencer al cancer atravez del deporte. ."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Finding inspiration , validation and having my heart moved and touched in the best way possible, giving me a shot of LIFE is was this book does for me.

He sounds pompus and spoiled and of course from what I heard he is not well spoken either. He maybe a champion in others eyes but not in my book. Grow up Lance lets talk in 10 years."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"People who can't write a book on their own should not write one at all. Let's just be frank about the writers of this book: A moron with a \\"Professional\\" writer. This book is not even inspirational. It is a 200+ page self-loving, repetitive, and masturbatory look at an individual who is not amazing. So you can ride a bike and swim. Who gives a hoot? There is no spirit, no humility, and no substance to this book. Morons who buy into this guy's story are just perpetuating another generation of Americans more concerned about celebrity all-stars and professional athletes than their status as citizens of the greatest country on Earth.I was forced to read this garbage as a summer reading book when I was in high school. It's a great message to send to young developing minds: I am awesome because I have mutant lungs. Let's forget about the great American heroes like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, and FDR. The fact that this crap gets published sickens me to the core. If you want to inspire people, give them an inspiring story: perhaps one of a great American like Washington, or one of Francis of Assisi, Marcus Tullius Cicero, or Churchill.A biography of Stalin would be more inspirational than this."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's biography is one of the best told stories, and most exciting, that I have ever read. It starts out with the chapter \\"before and After\\", this chapter tells about the basis of his life as a star athlete and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He then goes on to tell about his childhood and his gimped family. He grew up without a father, and with a young, not so wealthy mom. He tells about his struggles as a kid and how his mom was always there for him. He also tells how he came by his first racing bike and the triathlons he was in with it. He talks about his first races and how inexprienced he was. When he became more exprienced, he started to win some races then he started to win almost all of his races.His career was very successful, although he was very young. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 25, on October the second. His testicular cancer wasn't just in his testicle, it had spread into his lungs and his brain. While reading about the Chemotherapy treatments he had to undergo, I felt as if though I could relate to him. He told about how scary it was to go through with his brain and testicle surgeries, and how hard it was to be sterile. After he was done with his treatments, he met and married a girl named \\"Kik\\". She was there when he was planning to race in the \\"Tour De France\\". He wrote about his training and his struggle to get on a team. It was very exciting to read about him winning the tour. Lance Armstrong then had a son with Kik, and proceeded to race in the next years Tour De France, which he won again. He then took the Bronze in the 2000 summer olympics.Lance Armstrong tells his story so well, I could imagine every situation he was writing about. He describes things in a way that readers can really understand him. And he doesn't describe anything too much so that the reader would get bored. He writes with inspiration for those who ever were against odds. If the reader has cancer, I believe this book is perfect for them. Even if the reader is a normal everyday person this book shows us how to appreciate and live life to the fullest. If I learned one thing from this book its to never give up. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been against the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book really engaged me the whole way through. Some people mention the graphic telling of his medical procedures, but I didn't think it was that graphic. he loses a testical and freezes some sperm which later becomes his son, that's about it.It's just plain good writing, and he's someone you'd like to read about. he tells about his life all the way from childhood to the time of writing.. there's no boring spots, no blank spots, it's all proportionate, parts are dramatic but nothings exagerated.. (except perhaps how great his wife is, it's hard to imagine a woman that great, you might fall in love with her by proxy, or the closeness of his friends, it's hard to imagine that many people being that involved with ones life, but I guess that's what it is to be famous)..there's no big ego seeping through.. my resolution is that he's a fairly ordinary guy and that extreme successes become that by being extreme.. and that we should proceed in the direction of our natural abilities."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is the most incredible book I have ever read. Throughout the entire book I was in total awe. It shows how low someone who is on top of the world can really go. Armstrong draws in around of any age no matter what he does, biking or writing. He uses personal situations that everyone can relate to, even if the haven't experienced them first hand. Like when he describes having testicular cancer, he describes it with such detail one can only cringe with astonishment.This book is not set out there for any one specific group but more of a book for anyone who will listen to his story. This is not a book that will preach about how to be successful or how he became famous. It's simply about a man that found the true meaning of life.He sets up the autobiography very nicely starting off with his disadvantages even before he was born. Although his mother was young when he was born he and she both overcame the odds and lived their lives how the wanted too. Next he moved onto his early stages of riding, his first steps to stardom. Then out of the blue he was struck with this life threatening disease. He felt his life was over. His sense of true character came out and he came through. This is not just something that people just snap their fingers and their body is cleansed of viruses it is a time consuming process that is very mentally and physically exhausting. The chemotherapy drains the body completely.How the book was written it felt like I came out knowing him as a person that great competitive nature that almost made him succeed not only in racing but simply living.This book is so inspirational that it will keep anyone's mind on track even when they're having the darkest times."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is not the most eloquent biography, nor is it deeply philosophical. It is, however, an honest, moving and truly extraordinary story about one of America's greatest ever and surprisingly unsung heroes. I read this book in 24 hours, I wish I could erase my memory so I could enjoy it again. If you have any sort of a heart - buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An inspirational story that made it hard to put the book down. A story of courage and overcoming the worst odds. From cancer to coming back to beat the best bikers in the world in the greatest race in the world, when nobody gave him a chance...it made me view life a little differently."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like many others, I picked up this book when the shipment arrived from Amazon and I could not stop reading it. It's an amazing story about facing adversity and taking control of your own life. My hat's off to Sally Jenkins for making this story so darn readable that there is just no place to stop and put it down. You won't be sorry that you read this book.."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book over the past week after not knowing all that much about Lance Armstrong. I not only feel I &quot;know&quot; him now, but his struggle and triumph are truly inspirational. I am a clinical psychologist who works with people every day in an attempt to help them overcome the obstacles in their lives, both internal and external, and find true meaning and happiness. This book embodies one brave man's successful efforts to do this and to find and maintain his integrity as well. Without any ego or pretense, he describes what all of us aspire to learn about our lives and ourselves: that we can make of our time what we want to, that attitude is everything, and that the sweetest moments are often found with the perspective of loss or injury clearly in mind. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks common wisdom and understanding in their own life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book to find out more about this brave person.I wanted to have an exceptionally brave role model in these trying times. At first, I was disappointed because the style of writing interfered with the content. It is choppy with very short declarative sentences. Then, as I continued, I realized that the confrontive style is a reflection of how he lives his life: focused and confronting the overwhelming adversities he faced.This is one of those books that sticks with you long after you've finished it. Don't be put off by the STYLE in which it is written. It is wonderful. He is so admirable. I'm glad he shared his perspective with us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I don't read a lot of books. Typically, I limit my reading to newspapers, political journals, and magazines. But when I saw &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; in the bookstore, something told me I had to read it. And am I ever glad that I did!This book is probably one of *the most* inspirational stories that I have ever read. It is a book about hopes, dreams, challenges, defeats, determination, and triumphs.Lance and co-author, Sally Jenkins, do a masterful job in describing how Lance grew up. You get a very clear idea of how his childhood and teenage years were spent -- what he liked to do; what he did not like to do; his interests; etc.You follow Lance as he comes a world-class cyclist in his early 20s. Then, in his mid-20s, cancer strikes him. As a cancer survivor, I feel that Lance's description of the disease -- how he felt at the time of diagnosis; during treatment; and in the years that have followed -- is the most vivid and accurate that I have ever seen.Following the battle for his life (and his career), you then follow Lance as he experiences his greatest victories yet, both professionally and personally. Thanks to terrific writing, you will &quot;live&quot; these victories with Lance. And when you are done, you will be as excited as if they had been your own victories!&quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; touched me deeply. If you have any interest whatsoever in Lance Armstrong, cancer, and/or cycling, then I strongly recommend that you read this book.You won't be disappointed!Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is an excellent, heartfelt book by Lance Armstrong, arguably the best cyclist of our generation. I have followed cycling for many years going back to the success of Greg LeMond, but Lance Armstrong has definitely stood out. He admittedly was arrogant, rude, and stubborn, but almost losing his life to cancer completely changed him. It should be impressive to anyone to realize how dramatic it is for someone so close to death and so damaged by cancer therapy to dominate the most grueling sporting event in the world, the Tour de France. Lance should inspire many to fight against devastating diseases and circumstances, not only from this book but also from his cancer charity and his pure success. I admire him for revealing his weaknesses and troubled past to show how human he is and how genuine he is now with his life. His story is very touching, and I am glad that he and his wife have been able to have children together in spite of the cancer treatments. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to see just how strong the human spirit of endurance and survival is and the change it can bring to someone's life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"There are givers and there are takers in this world. This book clearly demonstrates that Lance Armstrong is a taker, both before and after his cancer treatment. It isinteresting to read only to have an inside view of an unabashed self-obsessed person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was hoping for more but this is a typical subpar athlete's autobiography. Lance's story is incredible because he fought and came back and should inspire those in a similar situation. However, other than the cancer, Lance Armstrong is not an interesting individual and reading about his mundane conversations with his wife was a waste of time and was out of place for subject of the book. It was very interesting to read that Lance does not love cycling - he did it because he was good at it and it was a well paying job. I can appreciate that kind of honesty."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"At the time it came out, I found this to be a very good read. It is very well written and Lance is a very interesting individual. In and of itself, I think it's likely a 5 star autobiography.That said, recent developments established that it is pretty much complete fiction when it comes to Lance's training techniques and drug use. For that, I would give it a 1.By averaging the two out, I got a 3, which is what I rated the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who is going through a cancer battle. This book helped my husband get through his treatment for Lymphoma. Lance is an inspiration and his story is so amazing and scary. I read the book as well and have given it to 2 other people who are beginning their battle with cancer. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"With the odds of surviving his quickly progressing cancer in the 0-5% range, Lance conquered the &quot;Big C&quot; and has shot off like a rocket since! A very informative, sometimes choppily written, always interesting autobiography and it actually leaves you wanting to know more about this inspirational man. Quite surprised he gives no credit to God, his agnostic beliefs overshadow some of his exploits, however his will to live and succeed is very evident. A great story and a great individual!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By page 50 of this book I had already cried twice. Armstrong's reflections about his early beginnings in Texas were heartfelt, poignant, and it struck an empathetic cord with me. I think this is the strongest part of the book. Later, his riveting accounts of bike racing, especially the Tour de France, left me wanting more. Armstrong's precise descriptions of what it takes to rise above the grueling tedium of riding and how to learn the discipline made me admire him for his passion. However, I was a bit disappointed with the rest of the book. I was hoping for the moving and rewarding insights of a book such as Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther, instead I felt short changed. Armstrong's words to express things became more mechanical and almost third person. While I will credit him for his perseverance in fighting for his life, he seemed never seemed to give us the readers nothing much to go on. It never felt to me that while he was in treatment that he experienced a moment of truth. In fact sometimes I thought he was kind of belligerent to the medical staff. There didn't seem to be a change from pre-cancer Lance from post-cancer Lance. His recovery then seemed to play out like a movie of the week script -- starts foundation with rich Texan venture capitalist, beautiful rich girl finds boy superstar, have beautiful baby boy and live happily ever after in Santa Barbara. It just didn't seem real anymore to me. In fact he seemed a bit full of himself. Maybe what really happened to Lance was that he just grew up and was not a boy anymore. Nothing more."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is about the money. I quite enjoyed this book until I got to the part where he refuses to work for the paltry sum of 120 K a year, three times what the average North American will ever earn. At that point the book is revealed for what it really is: a cynical marketing ploy designed to enhance his image amongst both cyclists and non-cyclists alike. Boo hoo. Poor Lance--he might not be able to buy back that Porsche."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong isn't a very interesting person. He's an athlete, who, before being struck by cancer, seemed to be exclusively immersed in his own sporting endeavours. There seemed to be nothing else in his life other than his very nice mum. Post-cancer add his wife, a son and a little more humility and wisdom. I've had the cancer brush with death in my 30s - my wife has recently undergone extensive chemo. I'm also a daily cyclist and Tour de France enthusiast. So I enjoyed the journey -envy for Armstrong's natural talent and his incredible resolve - engagement with his struggle against illness.However I ended up thinking here was a pretty boring guy with little understanding of the world and with few interesting life experiences.What prompted me to purchase the book was a fascination with how someone ravaged by chemotheraphy could less than two years later win probably the most gruelling sporting event in the world. There wasn't really much of an answer given - simply hard work and resolve. That's it. No magic potion, no special training techniques that we could all learn from.So the conclusion is that Lance Armstrong is perhaps one of those rare athletes (in the pantheon inhabited by the likes of Tiger Woods, Ian Thorpe, Jesse Owen and Pele) who is so gifted and so focused that they end up making all their fellow competitors seem like minnows.It's not a very dramatic story - but I guess the truth can be simple and basic. If Lance Armstrong was an interesting person he probably wouldn't have had the focus to be what he is - both as a cyclist and a survivor. He'd probably be dead."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"While i commend anyone who fights cancer, regardles of if they beat it, I was simply aghast at Armstrong and his wife. Pity poor Lance--he has to sell his Porsche! At one point, he moans that a sponsor is \\"only offering $180,000 a year\\"--and this not to do anything, but simply as a gift while he trains. His wife, she's the real kicker here: she must ...Lance's sexism (he refers to his wife as \\"a skirt\\"), his wife's vanity, all conspire to undermine the essentially valiant story of a man beating cancer and winning the hardest race on earth.I think his story deserved a biography; as autobiography, I simply found his persona too icky to root for. Maybe I am not \\"stud\\"."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When I first read this book a year ago, I said &quot;Wow&quot;. I mean, here's someone who beat a bad disease and did something tremendous. And the credit he gives to his wife for helping re-build the person after his sickness is inspiring.Until...Until you read that all of the sudden he's dumped his wife (oh, the woman in the book who &quot;is a stud&quot;). Just like that. And running around with Sheryl Crow. That sucks. I've lost faith in this man. I think the book is just a story now, not what he really thinks or the way he really is. I am depressed and dissappointed, as someone who I used to think was inspirational is really just an egomaniac who gets a lot of press.It's not about the bike, but if it's about a life, at least make it a true life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A well written,inspiring story of an exceptional athlete, son, husband and now father!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I wish more people had the will and determination to accomplish what Lance does after he is diagnosed with cancer. He was an good cyclist before he had cancer, but after he was done with the chemo treatments he became an EXCELLENT cyclist and an individual. Best of luck Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I don't read many books, but this one was well worth it. First, I admire Lance Armstrong's determination. This book does a great job of detailing his path from his pre-cancer life to post. Easy, fast read, but get out the Kleenex."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Too bad there's not a rating higher than 5 stars for Armstrong's book - I read cover to cover and was blown away! Finally, a person willing to tell it like it is - from paying tribute to supporters to speaking the truth about those who let him down. An absolutely fantastic account of someone who does not know the meaning of the word &quot;quit&quot;."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"You don't have to be a cyclist to appreciate this story. Lance Armstrong has every reason to just lay down and die. Worst yet, most people expected him to do just that! Instead, he fought back and with a little help from his family and friends he won the most grueling sporting event in the world.If you ever had a hard time dealing with adversity, you ought to read this book. His story is an inspiration. You will laugh and cry throughout."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It may be said about many books, but I couldn't stop reading this book. I have told everybody I can think of about this book and they glance at it and agree it sounds great. Lance Armstrong will impress you with his arrogance and his openess and his weaknesses. This isn't a jock book that makes you wonder why it was published. This is truly enjoyable even if you are not a cycling fan. This is a book about a person with a will to live."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was like everyone else, once I picked up this book I could not put it down. It is told in such a down to earth friendly manner you swear Lance was your best freind and he was retelling his story to you personally. My sister-in-law Stevie bought this book for me knowing how much I admire Lance and how much I love to cycle. Once again Thanks Stevie!I have sat for more than one lunch hour reading this book and crying my eyes out with his stories of dispair, hope and love.I have to agree with others, this is one book not to miss and the best book I've ever read. Nothing has ever touched me so deeply as Lance's story of his battle with cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was looking forward to reading Lance's book for a long time and was not disappointed when it became available.Being a competitive rider for over 20 years and having followed Lance's career and done the Ride For The Roses in Austin a few times, I thought I knew the story but I didn't. This book sets the record straight.From his difficult upbringing, his early days in Europe and then as his career began to take off, this is a great account of his story. The behind the scenes look at what he went through with his cancer treatment was a real eye opener.....Also some great accounts of the Tour, from his perspective.A great book for anyone who has been influenced by the accomplishments of Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is about surviving. It is about getting through the tough stuff and going on from there. The author appears to have achieved an understanding of his life and has chosen the direction to take from here. As the author states at the beginning it is not a pretty story. I highly recommend this book. It is especially insightful for those with a chronic disease. I found it inspiritional."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The appeal of this book should extend beyond the usual audience of bicycling enthusiasts. The story is compelling: man climbs the ladder of sports success only to be stricken with life-threatening disease. Man fights disease and returns to greater success.The prose manages to remain true to Lance's he-man attitude, but is also quite readable. The first chapter alone is a stunner. Definitely should be on your summer book list."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have a simple review for this book. It is not about bicycling. For the most part it is about love and determination. Lance goes from having almost no chance at all for survival to winning the hardest bike race in the world. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I like this book. It is very interesting and very hopeful book. I highly recommend this book for everybody. It is very easy to read and very interesting book. I t is also a good source of information for bike riders and for ordinary people, because nobody knows what they may face in their future: good health or a disease.This book is hopeful, because even though Lance got sick, after he thought about himself as an invincible person, he got a good treatment. After three years he fully got back to himself and become a big winner of &iexcl;Tour de France&iexcl; for three years in a row. I hope he will win this year too. One day at the press conference Lance said &iexcl; I&iexcl;m determined to fight this disease. And I will win &iexcl;I think this is the most important sentence in this book, it is not only important for his disease, bat also for his life. I guess the &iexcl;will to win&iexcl; is very important for everybody&iexcl;s whole life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In our ESL Class of the New York City Technical College, we read Lance Armstrong's book &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;. It is about Lance's real life.When Lance became a famous cyclist racer, he got testicular cancer. After the long treatments of chemotherapy, a miracle happened. The cancer disappeared. He is free now from the illnes and stil very famous because he won the Tour de France 3 consecutive years since 1999.I wonder if all cancer cases have the same happy end. But unfortunately not everybody has the same fate.I love this book and I invite everyone to read it. It's a wonderful story.You would see a beautiful end. Thanks to God for this miracle."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"AN INSPIRING BOOK June 4 2002Reviewer: J.Alfonso Gutarra NY USAI am fascinated with the story of Lance; I used to follow the la tour de France all those years when Miguel Indurain was the winner. And I know this struggle to win those inches in the race, that why when I read this book I could imagine Lance's comeback, from lying in the hospital with cancer, going through the chemotherapy, facing the death and still keeping in the heart the idea of being a champion, That is amazing.No doubts than Lance is an\\" extraordinaire\\" person, who has a very candid relationship with every person in his world, blessed of a great physical and mental strength, and I think he is going to win again in those important races in Europe.This is an inspiring book for everybody. It is, about somebody who came back practically from the dead, somebody who never gave up. Also he is a classical winner, a beloved man, No only for his mother, and his friends everybody love Lance, He is a lucky man too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book goes past the sport of cycling and appeals to all readers who like a truly inspirational and uplifting story.Lance begins his story with a brief history of his childhood and his wild ways. He moves through his triathlon career and into his early professional cycling career. In his early days, Lance was all energy and youth and would often tire out before the end of the races. As he matured, he harnessed his energy and became a more strategic racer. After winning his first Tour de France, he got the bad news.Lance's battle with cancer and his ultimate triumph is a testament to all human beings. It is proof that the human spirit goes on in the face of adversity. Lance was helped through his treatments by his wife, friends, and extended family. He emerged from cancer with a chance to rebuild his body and did so with the intensity of a man half his age.Lance's renewed dedication to his family and his career, his post-cancerous Tour win, and his worldwide success are all parts of the most inspirational story of our time. After reading this book, you will be ready to climb mountains, run a marathon, or tell your family you love them.Lance's renewed outlook on life might not be just about the bike, but his success in beating cancer and his worldwide fame are.I highly recommend this book to anyone with the time to read it. It is a fast read and you do not have to be a cyclist fan to appreciate it. There is a reason this book has been on the best seller lists for so long, pick it up and find out."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Is the Lance portrayed in the book a little bit &quot;sanitized&quot; or packaged by good PR? Maybe. Regardless, who can help but to be inspired by one of if not the most gifted and admirable athletes of our time.The book is worth it solely for the discussions of world-class cycling and the tactics involved; the story's of Lance's life and his battle with cancer make it inspiring."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a person who rarely reads biographies, I have to admit that I picked up the book and read it based on the incredible triumph of Lance at the Tour de France. It is a wonderfully written and the pages fly by. It reveals the honest truth about the horrors of cancer and the power of believing in yourself. A definite must read for anyone in need of inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Have you ever wondered if it is possible to survive cancer and become a famous athlete? Well in the book Lance Armstrong written by himself along with Sally Jenkins just that happened. Lance got cancer when he was at the height of his biking career. Fortunately, he was able to recover and start his career again from scratch, not even knowing if his cancer was going to come back. This book represents a good role-model,is new, and is full of details. I really liked this book and I would recommend it to anyone to read.One reason this book is so good is because is represents a good role-model. If everyone was like Lance, we would be living in a perfect world. Everyone would be full of motivation and get around any obstacle that gets in their way. Crimes would be washed away and crimes would fall along with them. Everybody needs a little Lance Armstrong inside of them.Another reason this book is so good is because it is so different. This book is much different then any other book because the author tells you everything. The author even tells you personal information that most other author's wouldn't share with the reader. Lance's life is also different than many other lives because many people don't live through cancer then build up a healthy life again. I found the diversity of this book very interesting because I learned many new things and didn't hear what I expected. This book is really different than most other books.This book was filled with many details which makes it very exciting and interesting. The book gives you Lance Armstrong's entire life story within such a small book and still makes you feel like you know everything about him. The detail are so clear and precise, they make you feel part of the book and experience Lanes life along with him. This book was really interesting with all of it's details.Readers will enjoy Lance Armstrong. The book represents a good role-model, is different, and is filled with many details. If you are tired of reading the same old books with the same old endings, this is the book for you. This excellent book is perfect for anyone and should be read over and over again!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an amazing book. Lance did such a great job writing it. He did indeed give credit to those who deserved it. His life story touched my heart. As an runner and biker I can relate to him. However anyone, whether you are an athlete or not, will view life differently as you read about his couragous battle with cancer and his journey back to his bike and life. I can't say enough great things about this book. I think everyone should own a copy!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Yes, this is really that type of book. I know that I echo most of the opinions here when I say that it was hard to put this book down. Hardly fifteen pages would go by where I didn't get my eyes all watery - this book is triumphantly emotional, heroic, fascinating.Lance isn't the best person on Earth, and he doesn't hide it. Yet he's strong, and always a fighter, and succeeds despite having all the odds placed against him.This is not a complete, exhaustive biography. It's a quick-paced read - no unnecessary details are included, just what's easily digestible and most interesting. No wonder this book was on the New York Times bestseller list for so long; it's easily a crowd pleaser.I was disappointed a bit in the last chapter, because Lance doesn't delve into much detail about his Olympic experience in Sydney. But who cares - I got more bike and Tour de France excitement than I thought I would. At times, Lance puts you on the seat and tells you how painful, how incredibly arduous it can be to climb thousands of feet of mountains, pedal at speeds of up to 70 mph, and stay on the bike accident-free for 7 hours a day.Amid all the remarkable stories in the book, some are especially worthwhile. When Lance had cancer and his insurance wouldn't cover him because of a pre-existing condition, the CEO of Oakley, one of his sponsors, stood by him and told his insurer to cover Lance or he'd take his business elsewhere. They covered him.The back cover, and other reviewers, tell you exactly what you need to know: it doesn't matter if you love or hate sports, or even if you've heard of Lance. This book will touch you because it's very human, very real, and very relevant to our days."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In my opinion this is one of the greatest books ever written. Lance's story is incredibly motivating, and Jenkins captures the essence of this American hero. Her use of cycling diction, race scene description, and team orientation help clarify this highly European sport for her American readers. Her use of metaphor extends the reader's understanding of how the cycling world ticks. Lance's many dialogues in the novel add substance to the work, while providing a better understanding of his battle with testicular cancer. Also, Lance's use of subconscious feeling helps the reader understand his attitude toward certain situations. He delievers a wonderful story that will touch of the heart of even the most skeptical readers. His message is clear, no obstacle is to tough to overcome with motivation, perserverence, and dedication. This book is wonderful for anyone looking for a good &quot;pick me up&quot; to motivate them to get in gear!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In Lance Armstrong's autobiography, realism is a major point. Lance puts the reader in his shoues in every situation. Even if the reader has not had an experience such as Lance had, the reader gets the feeling of going through the same circumstanceswith Lance, and at the same time as Lancedid. Lance has a graphical way of describing situations to the reader that captivate the reader with wonderment and awe. Lance wants the reader to understand and be interested in the facts of life such as cancer. Lace gives detaild discriptions of the process of chemotherapy and how it effects the body. He also describes his struggle to get back on the bike and the conditionsof his body through the entire process.The authors tone throughout the book is blunt but sincere. Lance states exactly how he is feeling at every moment that he discusses. Lance also seems to think that telling something to some one straight, they will be more interested or the point would be better understood. Lance uses his tone to express realism through the book. Tone is a way that Lance gets his point of view across while allowing the reader to expressfeelings for themselves.Complications made this book a book. Without the complications and struggles to survive them, Lance would be a normall professional athlete. Because of the trouble he went through to survive cancer and win the Tour de France, he becomes a hero and role model to many people of today's society. Lance uses his complications to help him thrive to a more meaningful life. Complications are what make Lance who he is today and without his tough times he would be like many people know, famous or not, in our world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I rate this book five stars even though the quality of the writing should put it at a three and a half or four, because of the extraordinarily inspirational quality of the subject matter. It is a real-life fairy tale. If it had been fiction, I would have scoffed at the author's unbelievable ending (three Tour de France victories). But the fact that it is real, and true, leaves the reader with a sense of wonderment and a renewed belief in the power of an indomitable spirit to conquer the impossible.This book is gripping in all its phases: pre-cancer, cancer treatment, post-cancer doldrums, and the comeback. And the sports aficionado will not be disappointed: it includes wonderful stage-to-stage accounts of the Tour victories. It is a quick read and can be read in a few days.The writing can be clich&eacute;d at times, and the tone has a tendency to get a bit self-congratulatory. However, it does not detract from the uplifting spirit of the book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"How Armstrong, a world renowned champion cyclist and cancer survivor, could turn such challenging experiences into a loathsome exercise in egomania, is beyond comprehension. His idea of 'surviving' is by showing a total lack of kindness and compassion to himself and others, treating others on a far lower level than his pedastal, and asking the reader to show mercy on his situation - only those that involved him losing his corporate sponsorship, or Porsche. With the help of co-author Sally Jenkins, Armstrong brings the concept of &quot;self-absorbtion&quot; to a whole new level. What should have tipped me (and other reader's) off was the book's jacket, which lists adjectives beneath his name: Winner of the Tour de France, Cancer Survivor, Husband, Father, Son, Human Being. The last one listed is most beneficial for the readers; lest we forget."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a purely recreational cyclist and have honored what this young man has accomplished as an athlete. I had hoped, however to see more sense of greatness and a personal transformation story than what we get in this well-written book, but no, it would seem that besides the ability to withstand the most horrific of treatments, his recovery and comeback are both the result of good medicine, a seemingly endless supply of money, and a lot of Texas-style bravado; and the proud claim to be an agnostic, after all this, is frankly beyond the realm of cluelessness. I wish him well, actually, I wish him better."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book for my wife after she had been wanting it for quite some time. As I sit here on the couch watching tv she keeps reading me little excerpts from the book because she is enthralled. She is huge into bike riding and this is a great gift for someone like that. She knows all about the accusations of Lance doping throughout a fair amount of his Tour De France wins and is somewhat skeptical of him now but says the book is a great read nonetheless."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was a good book, based on what he is willing to give up at this point. We will be waiting for the full truth in the future."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although I did not read the book...I purchased it a gift to give to my brother. My brother was suffering from \\"Colon Cancer\\" and he'd always been SO Athletic all of his life? I wondereed HOW could this happen? Why? How can I help. He was quietly depressed.I saw this book and thought maybe he could relate and I just wanted him to know I cared. I only know...that from speaking to his son that he did read it. He talked about it. Talking and expessing your feelings is always a good thing. That is probably the first step in dealing with it. Talk about your feelings...let them out. Don't let them \\"fester\\" inside you.I think it's very safe to say that anyone who has any form of cancer...could relate. Feel that they aren't alone and maybe the book would give them that little bit of extra \\"faith\\" to say...\\"hey...I'm gonna fight this thing\\"...I'm not going to lay down and die w/o a fight."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was telling a friend that I was buying a new bike (my current one is 15 years old) for a cycling trip I was planning. I have recently started to enjoy cycling for exercise, and although I am not one for speeding down hill, I love the challenge of climbing up the hills. Anyway - she told me to read this book. Which I did. Although I generally knew the story, but getting the first hand account, and in so much detail of Lance Armstrong's illness, recovery and subsequent Tour De France wins (he talks about 2 in the book, but he actually won 7 altogether) was really enlightening!The intensely personal account, coupled with really interesting insights into how cycling races work was riveting. I stayed up way past my bedtime a few nights in a row to finish this easy to read, compelling book. This book shows how resilient the human body and spirit is."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The first of two of Lance Armstrong's books, It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life, is so inspirational. By all accounts of his battle with cancer it's amazing that he is alive today. I have marked pages so I can go back, re-read and receive a great dose of uplifting. It's amazing he is not only alive but living so well and energetically. He does more in any of his slack days that most people do in their most energetic days. He overcame adversity and international criticism to become the supreme athlete and human being that he is today. He's an example of how to live life to the fullest. As soon as I finished this book I had to order his second book Every Second Counts from Amazon. An amazing follow-up to the first book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book covers Lance Armstrong's life - from birth, to his first bike, initial cycling successes, cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, returning to cycling to win the Tour de France, and becoming a first-time father. The book is hard to put down, and well-worth reading.Lance's mother was only 17 when he was born, played a very large role in his development, and continues to be very close to him. His father left before Lance reached his second birthday, and she worked two jobs while finishing school and raising Lance. She taught Lance never to quit.Lance got his first bike at age seven, and loved it. In high-school he tried football (not coordinated enough), then swimming (the 12-year-old was initially put in with 7-year-olds) and soon became quite good. At age thirteen Lance entered and won his first jr. triathalon, followed by another in Houston, and by age 15 was entering adult competitions, going from 15th place the first year to 5th the second. Lance began earning $20,000/year as a competitor, and then ended up winning the World Championship in Norway. Before this happened, however, Lance had to learn racing tactics (eg. saving himself until close to the end), and as often as not became too eager and faded before the finish.Then came cancer - described by Lance as the \\"best thing that happened to me.\\" Early symptoms were attributed to \\"bicycle injury,\\" or \\"flu.\\" However, after coughing up blood, Lance sought help - eventually resulting in the diagnosis of advanced testicular cancer which had spread to the lungs (12 locations) and his brain (2 locations). Initial testicular removal and chemotherapy took place in Austin, with little adverse impact. Getting a second opinion took him to Houston, and a third in Indianapolis, where brain surgery and much more aggressive chemotherapy were undertaken. Lance not only lost all his hair, but also ended up with prolonged daily retching.Along the way, Lance clearly conveys his worries, willingness to confront the disease and question medical authorities, and ultimate bond and admiration for his medical team. His negative blood marker (HCG count) went from about 50,000 at diagnosis to 92,000 at peak, and then down to 9,000, and finally 96.Recovery, however, had only begun. Lance recounts being passed by a 50-ish local woman riding a heavy mountain bike, and the nagging worry that the cancer would return. After about a year, he returned to Europe, and quit almost immediately. Finally, in 1999 he was able to sustain a return to cycling and go on to win the Tour de France.Other \\"high points\\" include Lance deciding that he had a higher purpose than cycling - helping others through cancer and cancer research. Organizing his first charity event resulted in meeting his wife (\\"Kit\\"), and the eventual birth of their first child - Luke (via previously stored sperm).Reading the book reinforces the reasons Lance Armstrong gave for quitting cycling - to spend more time with his children, and to pursue his \\"responsibility to help others with cancer.\\"Truly an inspirational story and individual!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a very brave man.

An amazing and inspiration story!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was a huge inspiration to me. What I got from this book was: no matter what struggle I go through in life, I can always overcome it. Not only was this book a huge inspiration, but it was a great read. It gave tons of information about his life experiences, and his fight through cancer. I thought his story about how he became a cyclist was extremely interesting, and his accomplishments of being an American rider in European countries. This book did a great job of explaining why he was a cyclist, and how the pain pushed him to try harder and be the best. Its extremely hard for an American to be a succesful rider in European cycling, but Lance made it sound easy. I highly recommend reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I truly appreciated the intense honesty with which Armstrong shared the darkest days of his life as a near terminal cancer patient (with a 3% chance of survival).Be forewarned that at times the story is very tough to read, and that nothing is left for the reader to mentally conjur up regarding not only Armstrong's battle with cancer, but even artificial insemination.I was not a cycling fan before I read this book, but I became a Lance Armstrong fan about 20 pages into this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was very factual and interesting. when i first got the assignment to read it i thought it was going to be boring but it turned out to be a great book.

He has overcome a lot in life and I guess that led him to be so egotistical but none the less he did it so he can say it. This book is well worth the read as it is inspiring and motivating and really gives you a sense of what it takes to perform at the level he does. It also gives you, if you look for it, a clue of the other side of fame and what it does to some people. Great book ... just feel sorry for his wife and kids who he left amidst his fame like so many before him"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I found \\"It's Not About The Bike: My Journey Back to Life\\" to be very motivational and quite positive.

A very touching story of one man's struggle in life and a man growing up during a fight to survive a fatal disease.The 7th tour had just ended, with me watching every minute it was shown and the book just touched me even more after seeing the accomplishments Lance acheived after the struggles he was forced to face head on without a choice in the matter.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cycling, Lance Armstrong or even someone who may not be especially a sports buff as I am. Because it was written with a definite story to tell and losing a parent to cancer as a young teenager, I could form an association with his fight for life and knowing the tour as well as I do, the visualization was easily obtained of the first win in the final chapter.Judy Trueblood (I was the one who ordered the book) but both of us read it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's an interesting,book fill with love,depresion,and hope,it's abaut a men that is an example for everyone.I love this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong gives us details and insights on his life growing up, winning races and dealing with cancer.

It is about the unfailing human spirit that never say die. It is about hope when everything goes wrong. It is about learning how great athletes are made. It is about suffering, it is about pain to the top of the ladder. It is about rise of a \`Phoenix' who never said die.There are parts in the book that reduce you to tears of sorrow and to the tears of bliss and joy. It is about sharing the toughest time of one of the pioneers, a role model, a warrior, a saint...My life is never same, after reading this book.All I can think about is \\"How did he do that?...\\""},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was sixteen and in hospital with an eating disorder when my friend gave me this book, and I read it in two days. It turned my life around.While I was on the verge of quitting swimming (I had to forfeit the World Championships that year due to my poor eating habits - my own fault, I know) I suddenly felt a new lease of life after reading about Lance and though it sounds lame, if I hadn't read the book I would never have made the Olympic team for Athens.Lance got told he was gonna die and he pretty much laughed in everyone's faces when he got back on his bike and subsequently won seven TdFs. If you read one book this Summer, it should be \\"It's Not About The Bike\\". If you ever doubted the man, you won't after reading about him. I hope he wins the NY Marathon"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read Lance's book right after I read James Frey's book: A million little pieces. Unfortunately, the former makes the latter look silly, especially in light of what we've learned about Frey's book, which is admittedly, still significant if he was being completely honest about the depth of his addiction and his struggles to get clean. What seperates this book is, obviously, the fact that we know that Lance is telling the truth, and the complete truth. I cried about 8 times when I read this book. And alot of light was shed on my previous preceptions about Lance's personality as a cocky, rude, hot-head. And while, indeed he IS still a cocky hot-head, I now have a more complete idea of who he is fully, as a man, a truly sensitive person, and a father. He also happens to be a great writer, and I'm already looking forward to reading his 2nd book. His details of the strategies involved in training and racing are just as fascinating as the survival aspects of his story, and I also got a complete crash course on in-vitro fertilization and childbirth. Lance Armstrong just shot straight to the top of my own personal list of the most significant athletes ever to live. I can't recommend this book more highly, for anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book is really a combination of two books, one about bike racing and that whole scene and the other about the author's experiences with cancer. I think by combining the two, the author dilluted both books.I picked the book off a rack at the MD Anderson Cancer center who as one might imagine had several copies available. I thought the book was definitely a mixed bag. Armstrong while certainly corageous to beat the cancer comes off as a real selfcentered person who likes to use the first person singular pronoun a lot, and doesn't miss many opportunities to tell the reader just how great he is. His account of the 1999 Tour de France was enlightening for folks like me who don't pay much attention to professional bike racing. However, I was struck by most of the book being about biking rather than beating cancer, this after the title of the book would lead one to think otherwise. And, not much attention at all was given to Armstrong's wonderful foundation that has provided significant dollars for cancer programs.I will admit to Armstrong's later splitting with his wife and kids and hanging out with Cheryl Crowe and the Beautiful Crowd probably affects my objectivity. And then there are those nagging drug allegations fom the 1999 race ( can we say Raphel Palmeiro )."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's autobiography \\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,\\" is a great book for anyone out there. It appeals to anyone who likes to read because it has many different stories. Lance tells stories about his childhood and growing up with his mother when he first started to bike. He then writes about his life after his childhood leading up to when he finds out that he has cancer and his life during his cancer and chemotherapy treatments. After all of this, he then goes on to tell stories about post-cancer life, and how he has become the worlds most dominant cyclist, the worlds best athlete, and how he has inspired many young kids to always try as hard as they can and never let life's obstacles stop them from getting to their dream.This is probably the best book I have ever read because it had all of the elements that a book needs. I do enjoy cycling and mountain biking, so I can make that connection to myself. But the rest of this book and Lance Armstrong's life has a completely different background than mine. I have never had cancer, I live with both of my parents, I go to a good school with many teachers that care about me and what I do in the future. Lance Armstrong had cancer, he lived with his mom and her husbands that she would marry then divorce a few years later until he was about 18 or 19, and he had teachers who didn't think he was headed in the right direction in life because all he would do was go to triathlons and cycling events.For Lance Armstrong to accomplish as much as he did in life is still amazing in my mind. I don't know anyone that could amount to anything like that when they have all those things happen in their life and survive cancer when given less than a 10% chance to live. This book is very inspirational and anyone who reads it will automatically become one of Lance Armstrong's many fans, even if you have never touched a bike in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a Dutchman I am almost naturally interested in cycling. When Armstrong first started riding his style was attacking and funny, though not always very smart. He got better at tactics and started to race better. Then all of a sudden he was gone from the newspapers, having been diagnozed with cancer.This book is a fascinating account about how his career evolved, became pro and was diagnozed. And of course how he got back and won the Tour de France, the sports hardest race.His fight against cancer is something which is a big and important part of this book. People who have never been around cancer patients and never read about but like cycling or sports will have a chace to read about what it is like, it opened my eyes.it may also give people who don't know a lot about the sport a good insight in how it really works. Cycling is a teamsport with its own unwritten rules and Armstrong talks about this a lot.It's a good story about an American in a European sport (think a Frenchman pitching for the Yankees) and how he managed to survive,"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The Lance Armstrong story is pretty well known by now. If you want to know the details of exactly what happened, and how he survived, then read this book. As everyone has mentioned it is not very well written, but that makes for a quick read. Lance's return from cancer is inspirational, and his cycling achievements since then remarkable. Thus, I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Lance Armstrong.Lastly, I will mention that one reason I read the book was to see what kind of perspective on life Lance has after coming so close to death. It is nice to see that someone is talking about the life and death issues that we somehow neglect in our modern world, but I must admit that I was disappointed by his ultimate answers and conclusions.As a Christian, I cannot fathom keeping God from my life, especially when I need Him the most. Lance's belief that it was the miracle of medicine and his own willingness to fight that brought him back from cancer seems somewhat shallow. I hope and pray that he continues to search for the answers to life's great mysteries."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Say what you want about Lance Armstrong but if you read this book it's hard to consider him anything but an inspiration.Last summer I was in Austin, Texas during the end of the Tour de France attending the Texas Age Group Swimming Championships my younger brother was competing in. That city loves Lance and there wasn't a person in the streets who wasn't eager to talk about the Tour; yellow banners supporting him were more common than Texas flags, and anyone who knows Texas knows that that's saying a lot! Following that experience I knew I had to read this book and I wasn't disappointed in the least.Having read the book, I can't regard Lance Armstrong as anything less than a miracle. He didn't survive cancer - he conquered it. He proved that a cancer diagnosis doesn't have to mean an end to anything unless you allow it to. This book is a very blunt and unapologetic account of his life before, during, and after his diagnosis and treatment. He's not the nicest guy ever, he's not the humblest guy ever, he's just a guy (who may or may not be the greatest cyclist in the world, it's not my sport, someone else will debate that).If Lance Armstrong had never competed in another race again, his survival would still have been incredible. But he did compete, and he's sure to be a legend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a woman. I'm not a cyclist. I've never had cancer. I read mostly fiction. But this book absolutely blew me away. So much more than an athlete bio, this is a wonderfully told, brilliantly written story of a real American hero. The play-by-play cycling coverage is fascinating even to a non-cyclist and the detailed discussion of Lance's illness, treatment, and recovery is beyond inspiring. The look inside Lance's childhood, his love life, his amazing journey into fatherhood, and his role as a cancer activist is what brings the whole story home. So much more than a story of athletic achievement and cancer recovery, this is a story about triumph of the human spirit. I can't wait to root for Lance in this year's Tour de France and in the Olympics. Hopefully we'll be cheering him to victory for years to come. I have been talking about this book to anyone who will listen to me. Listen to me. Buy the book. You will not want to put it down. It is a story you will never forget."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had and beat testicular cancer just like Lance Armstrong, so I could truly relate to the incredible obstacles that he described in his amazing book.This sincerely is an amazing story. I just wish I could have read it when I was going through my intense radiation treatments in my recovery, because I feel it would have made things easier for me. In his book, Armstong brings this disease into the public view, and allows people to see that it truly doesn't have to be a part of death, but, in fact, a part of life.There are many stories within the book. His childhood, his attitudes towards his father figures, his early racing career, his battle with cancer, the stuggle to get back on top of his game, his love life, and, his extemely personal march towards fatherhood. Each and every one of these minor stories gives an overall inspirational journey into Lance Armstrong's remarkable life.The writing is nicely detailed and allows for a good, easy-flowing read. The racing-scenes are action-packed, and make you feel as if you are right there on the bike with him. Armstong tells his tale using candid language and relates his stories of life with honesty and a pure heart. This book is a true inspiration to anyone. Please read this book. You cannot go wrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a physician and a bicycle racer and when I heard that LanceArmstrong had metastatic testicular cancer, my first thought, likemany in my field, was &quot;He's dead.&quot; But Lance Armstrong's story has the happy Hollywood ending nobody expected four years ago. This isn't Shakespeare, but I found it to be compelling reading (a stay up til you finish it kind of read). I am especially appreciative of the insight into the human condition, how one responds to adversity by either giving up or fighting back. Many of his homilies such as &quot;turning negatives into positives&quot; struck a nerve with me, as I've come to expect setbacks to be followed by unexpected success because it's happened to me so many times. I'm pleased that the book is so popular, because maybe the rest of the world will stop thinking people like me aren't such freaks riding our bikes 50 miles in January. It offers a glimpse into our sport that most people don't get to see. But I mostly hope others find the human message of hope as inspirational as I did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After recently recovering from Cancer, my wife suggested that my &quot;story&quot; would make for a great book. I told her that there aren't too many people who would want to read about a nobody from New Jersey who went through a miserable experience with Cancer. I'd have to be a &quot;somebody.&quot; Well, Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins wrote my book.When I most recently saw media coverage of Lance's story and book, I was angry. I didn't want the public to believe that Cancer had a hollywood ending if you work hard and don't give up. There's nothing hollywood about Cancer and I resented the attention Lance was receiving. Then, I read the book.IT'S REAL. Through the wonderfully constructed words of Sally Jenkins, and the raw, honest sentiments of Lance Armstrong, this book tells it like it is. Lance Armstrong is just like anyone else who happens to be diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. He is not a hero. He is not superhuman. He is human. And, in this book, he doesn't pretend to be anything but that.This book takes you through all of the emotions of being a cancer patient; fear, sadness, anger, resentment, pity, hope, and so on. Though every patient is different, Lance's feelings echo those of myself and countless others who are in the survivor's club.As a marathoner, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Lance's cycling career. However, you don't have to be an athlete to appreciate his incredible drive, determination and accomplishments on a bike.His story both on and off the bike is truly inspirational.This book is for cancer patients and survivors. It is for their families and friends, who just can't fully understand what it is like to endure the physical and emotional challenges of the disease. It is for athletes of all skill levels, shapes and sizes. And, it is for ANYONE who needs a little perspective on just how precious life really is and what's important.Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"So I bought this book because I wanted to read an inspirational biography. I was happy with it until the truth came out!This was not the inspiration I was looking for, instead it is an example of what some people would do, all the lies and cheat, in order to have power and money. This book should be classified as \\"Fiction\\" instead of nonfiction biography."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book 11 years ago or so, when it first came out. Good book. Well written, entertaining. But, unfortunately, as subsequent events have revealed, the book is fiction. Because it was, well...it was about the bike all along. The bike, the money, the power, and the ego. This is a man who would stop at nothing to feed his need for power, including treating former employees, fellow riders, friends, even wives and girlfriends like dirt. The doping could be forgiven, but the bullying? Never."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most inspirational biographies I have ever read, and comes from the truly remarkable life experiences of a determined young man. I loved every word!Early in the book, Lance Armstrong says &quot;. . . that cancer was the best thing that happened to me.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;When I was sick I saw more beauty and triumph and truth in a single day than I ever saw in a bike race.&quot;Overcoming cancer and becoming an athletic champion in the grueling sport of bicycle racing require a toughness of spirit, mind, and body that is hard for most of us to imagine. This inspirational book portrays beautifully how one can start with the right spirit and overcome enormous obstacles.Although his doctors told him he had a 40 percent chance of surviving stage three testical cancer, this was mostly to keep his morale up. After he had recovered, his doctor admitted that is chances were around 3 percent, instead.While he was being treated for the cancer, no one thought that he might ever race again. He did decide to go through treatments that would leave open the possibility that his lungs (affected by the cancer) would still be functional and his coordination (through delicate brain surgery) would be unaffected. Within two years, he had won the Tour de France, a grueling race he had never done well in before he had cancer.Growing up, Lance Armstrong had little reason to suspect that he would become one of the world's greatest athletes. He was well into high school, still trying pretty unsuccessfully to make the football and swimming teams, before it became clear that he could become a significant cyclist. Pleased with the money that success brought, he had a tough time building the attitude of a champion to go with his remarkable endurance skills. Overcoming cancer helped him with that, as well as seeing the beauty around him.He met his wife at the press conference to announce the beginning of his foundation to fight cancer. They were married during his recovery, and recently became parents through the miracles of modern medicine.Of such wonderful stuff are role models made, something we have too few of these days.The story is told in a very open and matter-of-fact way. He is not trying to make himself into something that he isn't. Clearly, his purpose in writing this book is to help all of us fulfill our potential rather than to glorify himself.Please share this book with people who need this inspiration."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It all just sounds too good to be true to me. Perhaps this book could be re-assigned to the fiction section? Or great crimes of the 21st century?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"His claim is that he has been competing all his life so he deserves to compete once again. What he fails to acknowledge is that he never competed in his life since doping is not a competition, it is a crime. After making his money illegally by doping, he harassed, sued, threaten everyone and anyone who made any statement not to his liking and now he is looking for forgiveness. He should be sent to a prison and allowed to preach his senseless vision behind bars. He should be treated as a criminal and pay for his lies, manipulation and disregard to all rules of a sport and humanity... A white color criminal, the lowest form of human being, a true disgrace. I truly feel sorry for his siblings since they will have to endure difficulties for a sick parent like him when they had nothing to do with his actions. Wish his siblings health and happiness."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was somewhat torn as to what to rate this book. On the one hand , Armstrong does an excellent job of expressing what it feels like to be a world-class cyclist and the emotions that go into racing in the Tour de France. I particularly enjoyed his description of his training. He is indeed an incredible athlete.I was also impressed with his recovery from cancer. It was a miracle of both modern medicine and his incredible faith and fighting spirit that he not only survived, but went on to improve his already impressive racing career. He was very thankful of the doctors and staff that helped him along, as well as being appreciative of his friends and family who supported him.All of this being said, I found it hard to read at times. His writing was not great, and sometimes I found him to be a annoying. Not having had cancer, I cannot claim to understand how it feels, but I don't think it gives him the right to be a jerk as he sometimes comes off in the book. I understand that some of his cockiness is why he is so successful at cycling, but he mistreats his wife and some of his friends throughout the book as they try to help him through depression and the physical torment of his recovery from cancer. He passes these times when he is inconsiderate or selfish as \\"they understand that I it was not a time to talk to me about this...\\" or \\"she's such a stud because she understands why I need to do this.\\" I didn't find many places where he did anything for his wife/girlfriend...it was mainly about how she sacrificied for him. At other times, I disliked how he whined about how teams wouldn't pay him top dollar when he came back--\\"They only wanted to pay me $250,000 which is like the minimum for a rider like me.\\" We should only have such problems. In any case, I found it hard to like him during these times and wanted him to get back to the cycling parts.One other thing I almost laughed at everytime I noticed was that he tries to throw in a bunch of \\"one-liners.\\" They may have had a different effect when he said them in person, but when he quotes them in the book, they come off as cheesy and amateurish writing.I guess the main thing is that I enjoyed reading the book. My thoughts were that it was really incredible that a person would kick cancer and then go on to be one of the best cyclist in the world. I found the details of his training and racing as well as his cancer treatment fascinating and inspiring. However, as I read it, I wished the person who accomplished all of this would have been a nicer person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Before reading this book I knew that Lance Armstrong survived Cancer to win a bike race, how naive I was. First off, the Cancer was mostly in his brain and required an incredible surgery and a large amount of painful recovery. Secondly, the bike race was the Tour De France which is a 2,000+ mile race around the circumference of a nation. His tale is so much more than that of an athlete trying to complete a dream. This might sound cliche but this was a story about the power of the human spirit to overcome social, emotional and physical odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong was a strong, single, 25-year-old world-class athlete that was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October of 1996. It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life is his story. Through x-rays and severe symptoms, the doctors finally pinpointed his disease and Armstrong embarked on the most aggressive form of chemotherapy as soon as possible. Although being testicular cancer, it had metastasized through his entire body to even his lungs and brain. This man even underwent surgery before his chemotherapy treatments and afterwards. Before his treatments to remove the cancer his chemotherapy could not and afterwards to fix and smooth out complications brought up by the chemotherapy. You will have to read to find out what exactly those complications were. Even before his final chemotherapy treatment on December 13, 1996, Lance began to ride again, but this time for a different reason, for the love of it, not because it was his career. He even said, \\"it was something I had to do for pleasure--like poetry.\\" After Armstrong's grueling fourth cycle of chemotherapy he began to ride again and train. Yes, as a career, but with a new sense of passion and accomplishment. He had married a woman he had met one month after his treatments and went on to race in the Tour de France, which you all can guess the outcome. Lance was now a \\"record-breaking seven-time winner of the Tour de France, a cancer survivor, a husband, a father, a son,\\" and of course, \\"a Human being.\\"Although this book does not go into extreme details of how cancer forms and specifically testicular cancer, it does talk about the multi-cellular level and what stages this cancer undergoes. With this absence of information, the reader is able to concentrate on the emotional appeal brought up by the spreading of cancer, treatments and the overall affect of this great athlete's life. However, overall this book was extremely informative. It gave great experiential information and therefore a chance for the reader to understand the steps of a process such as cancer and how it affects the person who has it but the family and close friends as well. As the book progresses reader's began seeing cancer as monster, and questioning its reasons for taking over a man's life and why it would inhibit the natural ways of life such as marriage and reproduction. But as readers, we are triumphant over cancer just as Lance Armstrong was, because we are with him during this time, and through his description we are able to understand closer to what cancer truly is and how people overcome it, even when its at the most dangerous stage and the survival rate is only 3%. Anyone can read medical pages with boring facts, but to read this book is true meaning behind the word cancer.I personally have not had cancer, but I have had plenty of family members that have, including my cousin having testicular cancer. Although he overcame it in the early stages and before I was old enough to understand what was going on, this book really came me a true insight to a little of what he and other victims of this disease must go through if they want a chance at a normal life afterwards. Armstrong writes in an empathetic way, not only for himself but in a way that makes people want to help everyone in their own lives and societies. Lance Armstrong even did this himself by creating the Lance Armstrong Foundation which helps to research for cures and treatments for cancer. After reading this book, the word cancer has an entirely deep, empathetic, and different meaning."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A frank and honest portrait of one mans struggle. This is not a 'wow, aren't I great' book, but one that shows the awful journey people have to take and what gets them to \\"over come the odds\\".The achievement of the subject of this entertaining read is his amazing recovery from cancer which was followed shortly afterwards by spectacular sporting success. The book is undoubtedly compelling, and was simply, clearly and strikingly written.Even if you're not into cycling you will love this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The story of Lance Armstong's life up until 2001 will be a challenge to put down for even those who are not fans of cycling. This story unfolds as an enthralling voyage taken alongside one of the greatest athletes in history from his very low points facing apparent death by brain cancer to the high points of full recovery and winning the Tour de France.Lance is extremely strong willed, bold, determined, and presents a story for the ages with his first autobiography. His story is so compelling that I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a great book for his fears, fight, hope and established interest in cancer. It is an inspirational story for those with cancer as well as their friends, for information and support. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a little bit about the bike, but it is an excellent book to give hope to those with cancer to be cured and survive."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance's book was an inspiration to read from the stand point of overcoming obstacles and also remembering to stay passionate about your work. In his book, Lance portrays himself as the quintessential underdog, fighting against great odds to become somebody important, a goal that would materialize in the form of winning the largest bicycle race in the world seven times -consecutively.Lance seems to have the deck stacked against him with challenge after challenge in life. Each obstacle in itself seems like it'd be devastating to any normal person, but Lance tells how he used trials to build mental grit that would be required for the ultimate challenge -the Tour de France. He shows how he compartmentalized and attacked each problem using what he refers to as \\"a dumb focus\\", which is also the unique character trait that inevitably ushers Lance to the podium, stage after stage, and race after race.As I read his book, I thought it should be called \\"Racing from behind\\", not only because Lance started from behind in life as he portrays, but also because that is how he likes it, -racing from behind. I really think Lance enjoys positioning himself behind the leaders, where the pressure is off, where he can observe, calculate, strategize and plan his swooping attack to the finish line. No matter what Lance is doing in life, he always has his mind focused on some sort of finish line; that's where the performance really counts. It's a philosophy that while very successful at leading to victories in the most popular bicycle race, probably isn't the best approach for life in general.As enjoyable as it was to read about one of my personal heroes, it was sobering to realize that Lance is not as super human as I have made him out to be in my own mind. I will like to see a more complete picture of Lance Armstrong written at a later date reflecting a well rounded character, a little closer to the super human image I have built up of him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this, yet i am not an athlete, nor do i know much about the sport of bikes.Cancer is the devil,and Lance doesn't back away from the ugliness of it.Yet, he survived it,and you can to.I have given this to 2 friends who had life threatening illnesses,and both said they loved it.Be good to yourself, and think positively! I think we can all benefit from that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a fellow cancer survivor, I really enjoyed Lance's book. I had wanted to read it for a long time and was not disappointed. For an athelete, he is a very good writer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE gives you a wonderful, inside view of Lance Armstrong. A great read. But only half the story...Don't miss out on the \\"outer view,\\" Lance through the eyes of a good reporter. LANCE ARMSTRONG'S WAR: ONE MAN'S BATTLE AGAINST FATE, FAME, LOVE, DEATH, SCANDAL, AND A FEW OTHER RIVALS ON THE ROAD TO THE TOUR DE FRANCE by Daniel Coyle is simply marvelous.The two books belong together.Dr. Kirtland C Peterson"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is an inspiration. It shows the hardships of battling cancer and the effort of recovery. Lance Armstrong is one of the most driven individuals I've ever read about; I could not put it down. Recommended for anyone and everyone, MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am pretty busy, so as much as I love books, I generally have to fit them into the little spaces of time here and there and it takes weeks to finish one. But this book arrived Thursday afternoon, and by Friday evening I had finished it and was wishing it could have lasted longer. Okay, the first third of it is a bit slow. It contained more detail than I needed about how he won his early races. But the last two-thirds, his battle with cancer and his comeback afterwards, were absolutely enthralling. Inspiring? Of course. I hope never to have to fight for life as Armstrong did, but if I do I know Lance Armstrong's ability to beat 97% odds will be in the back of my mind, pushing me on. Meantime, if Armstrong can cycle through the Alps with saddle sores, what more might I be able to push my own body to do?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Lance's journey really sent home the message that we can all turn our lives around. And I don't mean medically. Lance's transformation into a more &quot;human&quot; caring person, shows us what is possible for everyone. This book was a great read. I highly recommend it.Another book on personal transformation that I thoroughly enjoyed is by Ariel and Shya Kane called &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work.&quot; This book shows how, in easy to understand terms, people's lives can be totally transformed by adding a simple awareness to their way of seeing. It too is a wonderful read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you've never been profoundly effected by a book, then you have to read Lance Armstrong's story. Yes, it gives you great insight into the cycling world, but even moreso, the book opens your eyes to the physical effects of cancer and how to conquer them emotionally. Lance doesn't hide any details of his diagnosis and treatment but chooses instead to lay them all out for everyone to see. His experience has made it easier for men to freely talk about testicular cancer and to take the early steps to prevent its progression.I am not an avid cyclist or a cancer survivor, but Lance's book read so well (I finished it in 2 days) that I could totally relate to him. I enjoyed every page and even laughed and cried as I read. I have never rated a book on Amazon before, but I was so moved by this story that I couldn't help myself. I even contributed to the Lance Armstrong Foundation today through Lance's web site in order to help other cancer survivors. You can help, too. It's a good cause, and you never know.. one day you might need and appreciate such a donation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After knowing what I know, why would anyone read this lies? I for one would burn that piece of crap if I had it purchased."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong came back from testicular cancer to win the rugged Tour de France bicycle race, twice. And his emotion-drenched memoir, written with sportswriter Sally Jenkins, should be especially useful as an example to cancer patients.He rode herd on his own treatment, insisted on multiple opinions and relentlessly questioned his doctors. The book concludes with an almost inch-by-inch account of the three-week, 2,290-mile Tour de France, which Armstrong inevitably calls &quot;a metaphor for life.&quot;There's suspense and spiraling inspiration; anyone reading the book knows who won. Still, there's lots of drama, and as cancer success stories go, Armstrong --- is the champion."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance holds nothing back, in &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot;. Relationships, (both good and bad) throughout his life, vivid descriptions of healthy life and competition, and of course gut wrenching detail of cancer treatments are presented throughout the book. The final chapters put the reader in the tour, exposing the strategy behind the race, as well as the battles fought in the mind, and against the other competitors.It's the ultimate comeback story of a world class athlete, young and on the rise, who is faced with his own mortality when cancer intervenes. Lance begins with his early days, competing and winning with brute force, no strategy just an all out attack. Like any competitive athlete, he expresses his feelings of invincibility, and continues this belief until cancer just can't be ignored. The medical procedures, the chemo, and it's sickening effects are described in vivid detail. Cancer becomes the opponent, and ultimately Lance wins.It's a book about growing, maturing, and pushing on in the face of adversity. Following the battle with cancer, Lance battles himself, when making a comeback to the competitive circuit. On several occasions the decision is made to throw in the towel, to retire from competition. With the support of those around him, Lance is able to dig deep within himself and find the courage and determination to come back and win the Tour.Truly and incredible autobiography, about living, learning, growing, and maturing. An amazing book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a great reader. But Armstrong's book is hard to put down, easy to read, and incredibly inspirational. He puts real-life skin on old standards: tragedy and triumph. While Armstrong's honesty and frankness, at times, reveals a young maturity level, they also reveal a growing character, and a hard to come by balance between a satisfaction in whatever life may bring and a determination to make the absolute most with it. I cried when I read his encounter with an &quot;angel,&quot; and e-mailed the passage to my friends. The wake-up call?: Get back in the saddle... and ride."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The word \\"hero\\" is defined as a person noted for acts of courage or nobility of purpose. Being a hero is something decided by others, not by oneself. For example, when Lance Armstrong told Kelly Davidson (another cancer patient from Texas) over the airwaves from the Tour de France that \\"this [race] is for you\\", that simple but profoundly noble act certainly was certainly heroic to her. This is probably the most notable example of heroism to be found in this book, but it is not the only one. The loyalties exhibited between the author and the people closest to him as he fought to save his life are examples of heroism that we all experience.Despite the book's title, the description of the author's progress as a racing cyclist (both before and after cancer) is every bit as riveting as the story of his battle with cancer. My only disappointment with the book was the relatively little attention given to the need for a new training regimen after the cancer treatments--a focus toward maximum aerobic effort and reduced anaerobic effort. While the effect of cancer treatment on Armstrong's muscular system necessitated this change in training, it proved to be just the thing he needed to win a long, grueling contest such as the Tour de France. By maximizing aerobic effort, Armstrong was able to minimize the production of lactic acid--a definite advantage over the competition."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Being an athlete myself, this book was completely inspiring and motivating, not to mention Lance's ability to beat cancer with less than 2% chance to survive. This book is easy to read and great for ANYONE to read. It is a book about life, family, and love. He is a self-motivator and gives hope to anyone reading the book. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong in his book recounts the transformation that happened in his life out of finding out at age 25 that he had very advanced testicular cancer. Incredibly, he was able to beat very unfavorable odds and come through cancer free. The cancer in his case seems to have worked as a tool that helped him transform and wake up to the richness of his life. He discovered how loved and supported he was by his family and friends, he discovered and was able to appreciate the dedication and incredible talent of others who collaborated to save his life, he discovered his inner resources and his passion for living, he rediscovered his love for the Bike which he was taking for granted... Out of this experience he won the Big Price: Huge professional success and a very fulfilling and loving marriage. If you are interested in transformational experiences and in discovering the state of being where success, love, satisfaction, self expression and aliveness reside, I highly recommend that you also read the book WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book is a gem and it delivers all the keys to personal transformation and enlightenment. I highly recommend it to anybody who, like Lance Armstrong, is willing to challenge the limits of what we think it is possible to make happen in our lives."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's life is a fascinating tale and Sally Jenkins tells it very well. The basic outline is well known. From a tough background in Texas, Armstrong entered the world of professional cycling and won the world road racing championship. It appeared that he had a great career ahead of him but in 1996 he was struck by testicular cancer. By the time that he visited a doctor, the cancer was advanced and had spread to his lungs and brain. Despite the poor prognosis, he recovered from the disease and went on to return to the highest levels of professional cycling and win the Tour de France, the sport's blue ribbon event.Sally Jenkins is an accomplished sports writer and she has done a fine job to render Armstrong's story into a gripping and fluid read. I finished this book in one sitting and I think that many readers will do the same. In terms of gritty detail, there is more about cancer treatment than about the Tour de France and the detail is explicit. Reading this book will give you a vivid picture of what it is like to face a course of chemotherapy.I do not want to make a judgment on the man himself. Some readers will be in awe of his achievements while others will be exasperated by his faults. I cannot recommend this book as an inspirational read either. Anyone who can complete the Tour de France let alone win it posesses levels of physical and mental toughness that are so far beyond normal experience as to seem superhuman. Rather than being inspired, a cancer sufferer given this book to read could just as easily see the message that if you are superman, you can fight cancer. Seen instead as a fascinating tale the book is a compelling read.Even if you have no interest in cycling, this book is still worth reading. I am very glad that I read it and I think that most people who pick it up will feel the same way.You will probably want to buy one of the later editions as they contain additional material relating to Armstrong's second tour win in 2000."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Here is truly a story that can inspire everyone regardless the hopelessness of their situation. I was held spellbound by this story and the way it was told. I could personally relate to it well, as my 28 year old son-in-law was faced with a similar situation and survived and succeeded against all odds. He was striken with a yet unknown illness that kept him on life support for an extended period, with little hope from the doctors for a successful recovery. As pointed out by Lance in his book, you should never give up. Give it all you've got and you will succeed. This book is a must read for all those with major problems and certainly for those without the problems, but feel depressed by minor issues that keep them from overcoming them to greater success. It is a well written work, full of enthusiasm, emotion, the will to survive and prosper and inspiration. Read it and share it with others. We'll all benefit with a better life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book three times; now I feel like an idiot. Please recall this book or pull it off the selve. At least re-class this book as fiction so my childern won't buy into the lies."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As all the words devoted to Lance's racing career have turned out to be a complete and utter fabrication, I can no longer put any credibility in the rest of the work either.It's really unfortunate that what seemed to be such an inspirational story turned out to be just another scam."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lances Armstrong's book Not About The Bike: My journey back to life is an inspiring book that is great for just about any reader. This book is very detailed from the time when he was 12 years old to the Olympics and from the Olympics to the battle with cancer and from cancer to his experiences to in the greatest and most brutal bike race in the world the Tour de France. One of the most captivating parts of this book is his battle with cancer. He talks about how he struggled with the chemotherapy and how it made him feel weak, but he also talks on how all that time that he had gave him a new outlook on life and how this inspired him to race even harder and live everyday of life like the last. It also inspired him to push himself harder than he was before. The book also makes you think, is there something bigger out there and is life set out by an all powerful being; because anybody in lances condition would have died from the condition that he was in. This book also gives you some insight on lances life and shows you that lance is an extremely strong person and shows you how he beat cancer and made a comeback and won a record setting 7 Tour de France races. Over all I think this book is an amazing piece of work and I recommend it to anybody who's interested in Lance Armstrong or amazing comebacks."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I didn't know anything about Lance Armstrong until I got cancer last spring. Lying on my couch, sick from chemo, I watched the Tour de France. I was so sick, but wishing I could be outside riding a bike, too. Well, why not, Lance did it! So I bought a bike and started riding my way through chemo and cancer, motivated by this incredible man.I read his book after I finished chemo. His chapter on treatment so accurately captured the experience of being a cancer patient that I found myself crying.This book is for single moms, athletes, cancer patients and anyone else who needs a kick in the butt to get busy with the things that are important."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was an outstanding book. You don't have to like sports to enjoy this book it's also a book about life, and how to deal with adversity. Lance talks about his cancer treatments, you really get a feel for what he went through and how close he came to dying. He talks about his mom and how much of an inspiration she is to him. The part of the book where he talks about his comeback after surgery was awesome. All the hard work and training leading up to it was unbelievable. It is a fine book that will teach you about never giving up in life, and will help you to understand the affects of cancer on those who experience it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have never read a book cover to cover until this one. As an avid athlete since the age of 7 I gained a huge appreciation thru this book of what it means to be alive. This book is about bike racing but it is about so much more. I have given this book to people as a gift and they have had the same response. Read this book, then go out and bike, run, hike, walk or whatever. This book will make you happy you are even here to do those things."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book before reading a review and decided to stop by and check out what people were saying after I read it. I LOVED the book! I've always known who Lance was, but I was interested to read his story, mostly for the story of his move into fatherhood. Well, I became engrossed in every word even though I've never been a cycling fan. I had tears in my eyes several times while reading about the Tour de France. I couldn't put it down, and recommend it for everyone! This is a book about an extraordinary human being, who beat the odds, and came out fighting! You don't even have to like cycling to be able to feel the emotions shared in this book, and if you're like me, you'll form a new view of bike racing and become a fan! I look forward to his future races and can honestly say I'll always be a fan of Lance Armstrong!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not an athlete, nor interested in sports, but I am always fascinated by how different people react to what life hands them. That's why I chose to read IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE, and I was not disappointed. The book itself is very easy reading, and each chapter chronicles the changes in Lance Armstrong from cocky, maverick competitor to humbled cancer patient (&quot;I was brought low, and there was nothing to take refuge in but the philosophical: this disease would force me to ask more of myself as person than I ever had before, and to seek out a different ethic [p.99].&quot;) to the winner of the Tour de France who had learned from his suffering to be a more compassionate, tolerant, and understanding human being. Indeed, Armstrong made an acronym out of the word cancer: Courage, Attitude, Never give up, Curability, Enlightenment, and Remembrance of my fellow patients, that will hold him in good stead for the rest of his life. After reading IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE, I find myself wishing that Lance's life will be a long, healthy, and meaningful one. Something tells me that it will..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love cycling, I love underdogs that come back to crush the competition, and I love how candid Lance was in this book.

It's am emotionally moving book, and it is a must read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Its Not About the BikeI thought it was a pretty good book. I thought lance Armstrong's arrogance and egotistic views were a little much at times but it was a very emotional book, all about his hardship fighting cancer and how badly he wanted to survive. I thought the story about him going from a nobody to a legend interesting. The chemotherapy and Lance having to get surgery done had to have been really hard not only on him but also on his mom and all of his friends. All in all it was a good book it really opened my eyes on the hardship of cancer and how scary it would be to have to face it. I thought Lance was very persistent he was always in a good mood and ready for the next trial and tribulation."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I liked the book, because the part about the cancer was interesting. At first i saw Lance Armstrong as some sort of superhuman. But after i read the book I saw him a normal guy. His description of chemo and the hospital stay was enlightening, but kind of scary. HE obviously has a lot of passion and that really comes through in the book. I found his arrogance somewhat refreshing for moments of comic relief when he was on the verge of death. I would recommend this book for someone who does not like sports books, but does like to be told and incredible story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Detail is reserved for the chemo and select personal highlights. Other than that the TDF is boiled down to a few chapters with scant detail and pre-cancer cycling is a prologue to the stages of cancer and its treatment. The story is compelling. Its a quick read. It lacks substance and good writing."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Highly motivating story of one of the world's elite athletes who suffered cancer throughout his body, conquered the cancer, and came back to win the Tour de France, the most grueling, physically demanding sport event on Earth.

The book is undoubtedly compelling, and was simply, clearly and strikingly written.Through the many flaws of this character portrayed in the story you learn that our heroes are actually human after all. But this is something we never seem to remember. What was critical was this man's drive to succeed, his confidence to ensure that he would beat the odds, and his determination to leave no stone unturned. As an athlete he had the potential to perform, and he captured the necessary requirements to make it happen.The story makes little reference to Lance's partner through his period of cancer, Lisa, which leaves a big gap in the story. I can only suppose this was out of respect to his wife at the time, Kik. However, we miss the chance to explore this important relationship.I can recommend this book, as a chance to learn something about a sporting hero. It's a good opportunity to learn some lessons of life, and the exposition of our lives' stories make for valuable education - for the stories of us mere mortals though they be just as valuable will never see the print on the pages of our books.I sincerely applaud Lance for his efforts on behalf of those affected by cancer. That is the key message of this story, and I hope that people do get the message, its not a book about cycling!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong makes you want to get on the bike yourself and try what he's done. Even after I read the book, I felt as though I'd just been through all of the races, being right up there with the almighty Lance. If you want to know about starting a bike career you should try this book. It explains about his emotions in life while speeding up and down the hills. He brings you in-depth, further than you could imagine, into his racing and personal life. It's quite a heroic book for road bikers."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A great look into the life of one of our greatest athletes. It was strange though having him talk about being a good husband..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was much better written than many celebrity autobiographies, and provides a compelling view into the struggle required to overcome cancer. We begin with Lance's somewhat troubled childhood and his early successes on the bicycle before we delve into the real meat of this book, his fight against the cancer that almost took his life. Armstrong is quite candid about personality flaws and early bad behaviour, which provides an air of honesty that makes this book all the more powerful. His comeback to the pinacle of the bicycle racing world is truly remarkable, but given his personality, perhaps it shouldn't surprise us as much as it does. Here is a remarkable athlete, and a man who appreciates the second chance he's been given. A truly inspirational and enlightening book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was a great book. It has a lot of information about what testicular cancer is, and Lance Armstrong's life as a Tour de France racer. The message I got from this book is to never give up if things don't go your way. Lance just kept going and going, even when he had cancer and even when he got hit by a car. He just gets up and keeps riding and never gives up. This book also gives you a lot of information about bike racing and how the races work. I learned a lot about determination and what it takes to be the best. I give this book 4 stars because it is such an awesome book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was probably the best one that I've read in a while. The reality of what Armstrong went through and how he triumphed over it is an amazing story. The book was hard hitting and made me realize that some people have no idea how hard it is to deal with the idea of having cancer. They take life and all its perks for granted, not thinking about what some people go through on a daily basis."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong takes us through his life in his best selling novel \\"It\`s Not About the Bike - My Journey Back to Life.\\" He allows us to experience all the hardships and obstacles that he has undertaken. I was blown about the fact that after surviving cancer he was still able to win the tour de France. The details about his first encounter with cancer are very graphic. At first I was taken back about what he was explaining. I never knew what type of cancer he had until I read this book. He gives you a pretty detailed outline of each stage of testicular cancer. After reading this book, I concluded that if you don't give up hope and with determination there is always a chance to over come the hurdles in our lives. Overall, I would recommend this book and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who had to face cancer or any other hardship."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Absolutely the best attitude adjustment book I have ever read!It's about the yoga of bicycling: the union of body, mind and soul while riding a bike. I felt inspired to read this biography after watching Lance Armstrong soar down the streets of Ojai, California, where he made a surprise visit on April 10, 2005, to ride in the second annual Garrett LeMire Memorial Gran Prix. A life-changing, heart-opening book that I look forward to sharing with family and friends.Suza Francina, bicycle rider, yoga teacher and author, The New Yoga for People Over 50. www.suzafrancina.com"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This great little reminder sits on my shelf to jog my perspective whenever a \\"pity party\\" sets in. This iron-man's focus and determination is awesome. I only hope that he takes time to enjoy other, smaller, things in his life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a fantastic book, much more than just a biography of the world's best (and most famous) cyclist. Lance Armstrong provides a heartfelt look at his amazing life, including his cycling feats (of course), growing up without a father, his illness, treatment, and recovery from cancer, his struggles to have a child (wife's vitro fertilization), and more. He outlines his triumphs and challenges, setbacks and victories in a compelling and interesting manner. I'm a martial artist not a cyclist and frankly have very little interest in the sport. Regardless, I could not help but be inspired by this fascinating book.Lawrence KaneAuthor of 'The Way of Kata' and 'Martial Arts Instruction'"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"If you think Lance is an awesome cyclist - you are correct. But this book goes beyond that. He takes us in side his illness and his journey back. I highly recommend this book to anyone. And if you think you are having a bad day go back and reread this one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I myself have gone through a family crisis, quite similar to that of which the great Lance Armstrong endured. My uncle had testicular cancer and most of my family had been devastated. Although it wasn't life threatening, he had yet to be married and won't be able to have children. But I purchased this book for my uncle and it's inspired him to look beyond the cancer and lift himself up. He is no longer lying in his bed all day complaining about life. He reads this book with incredible attentiveness. Matter of fact, he's lying in the living room reading this and he doesn't know I am writing about him. I've read portions of this book and it is a great book to read on your off time. Very inspiring is all I can say and it will lift your spirits.I recommend this book to all even if you're not a fan of bike riding or the Tour de France. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am a beginner runner. I picked up this book because I wanted to know more about Lance Armstrong. This book has taught me how much mental and physical training are required to be the best, consistently. I have enjoyed reading this book because of the humor, the clear and direct expression of ideas, and Lance's candor in his failures and triumphs. I am sure I will pick it up and read it again periodically."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Written with raw honesty, It's Not About The Bike shows what it's really about -- courage, passion, persistence, and the indomitable human spirit. Lance reveals his childhood -- including his struggles as a swimmer and his wild antics -- the rejection he experienced, his triumphs, his battle with cancer, and his relationships with two very special ladies -- his mother, and his wife. The photos are fantastic; like the text, they portray the very human side of a champion. I highly recommend this book to everyone -- and most especially to athletes and cancer patients.-- Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is highly recommended! An easy read - but the material will inspire you - no doubt!

You'll learn about the horrors of cancer and the intricies of cycling. When I was reading the book I couldn't believe how horrible the cancer was and what that and the chemo did to his body. You'll also learn that cycling is much more than riding a bike and what really goes on in the races. I think anyone who reads this book will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike is the story of an up and coming star, cut down in his prime, only to return with more passion and fury than before. Lance Armstrong had just won the World Cycling Championships, and was receiving contracts from some of the biggest sporting companies in the world.Suddenly, he becomes aware of his body starting to give way on him. Concerned, he goes in for testing and is diagnosed with a severe form of Testicular Cancer. Within a few weeks he is undergoing intense chemotherapy, and left to reflect on his life thus far. He is faced with the realization that his life, if not over, might never be the same. His friends and mother stand by him through the entire ordeal, and after months of fighting, he is in remission.He struggles as he pieces together a new life, but meets his future wife, Kik, who helps him back on the bike. He doesn't perform like he had in the past, and drops out of the sport for a while. Kik, once again talks him back into riding. This time though, he was determined. He focused all of his energy into winning the Tour de France. He trained smarter, and lived healthier. He was no longer the overbearing and egotistical boy of his past. He was a man now, one with something to prove, to himself, and to those who said he was finished.He wins the Tour de France, but quickly changes his focus to the future. He wants to spread his story, and live a more complete life. He and Kik look to have a child. Lance's chemotherapy had made him sterile, and the process is long and hard trying to get Kik pregnant. It required multiples surgeries, countless needles, and a supply of Lance's banked sperm from before his fight with cancer. He later becomes a father to Luke Armstrong, and his life is reshaped.After all of Lance's success though, there is still some doubt among the cycling world. To put an end to the speculation, he again sets himself up with intense training to repeat as champion of the Tour de France. He, in a way only Lance Armstrong could, succeeds.It's Not About the Bike is a very well-written and personal story. It is very articulate, and in no way falls under the expectations of an athlete's autobiography. It does not bask in the glory of athletic achievements, nor does it try to leave the reader feeling as thought he athlete was immortal. The story takes the reader down a long hard road of Lance's life. He builds up his immortal status in the beginning, simply to shatter that thought in the reader's mind. It is a very well thought out, and crafted book. However, it does truly live up to its title. It focuses deeply on the feelings and motivations that surround Lance, rather then the actual actions that are taking place. Even in the two chapters of the book that are dedicated to him winning the Tour de France, they focus much more on his thought process then telling what happened. There was also a large amount of detail placed in his reminiscence of childhood. However, this same level of detail is not matched during more critical times in the book, such as the meeting of his wife, or birth of his son.Overall, the book is inspiring and personal. It leaves the reader with the feeling that they truly know Lance, and have a bond with him in some tiny way. It is an almost addicting book, and an absolute must read for anyone who's life has cancer surrounding it. It was a book made by Lance Armstrong the man, not the cyclist, and it carries a message for us all to take in."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Amazing, inspiring, even life changing.

An autobiography of a man who survived testicular cancer and won the Tour de France as well as many other races internationally Mr. Armstrong is able to do something that many people cannot when writing about their lives-delve into the minutiae of many areas of his or her life equally and take us with him.I hadn't expected to learn SO much about what makes this man tick but after reading the book I feel that he has written one of the best autobiographies or biography that I have ever read.Presented NOT in chronological order the style of the book works well because picking up the book we're thinking &quot;Lance Armstrong, Cancer Survivor&quot; but there is also much more to him. We feel the impact of some of the many people who have influenced Lance's life including his wonderful mother, many friends and one helluva nurse as well as the Doctors who treated him for a disease that would have killed most of us.He's right.

I recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who have decided to fight cancer. It is a guide book for courage and perseverance."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong writes a touching memoir of his struggle through cancer in his self-proclaimed novel \\"It's not about the bike.\\" it doesn't take long to get absorbed into the dialogue included; I immediately became entranced with Lance's story and how he had accomplished so much, to only learn that he could possibly die from testicular cancer. I've personally never became accustomed to the art of cycling, but the grueling measures and long hours that bikers must pursue, make it one of the hardest sports known to man. Despite that, Lance went on to win the hardest race, the Tour de France, not once, but six times. He had quickly become an international superstar, and had all the fortune he had ever dreamed of. However, I felt the biggest point that he wanted to make was that cancer can happen to anyone, even the most privelaged and talented of people.One of the best aspects of the book was the simple diction. It made it one of the quickest reads I've come across, but also depicts what it is like to be battling cancer. Cancer is not an easy concept to understand by any means, as I quickly learned in AP Biology, but Lance is able to put his situation in better perspective to those that haven't taken such a challenging course. Cancer information needs to be spread to the general public, and awareness needs to be spread to all so that hopefully cases can be prevented. Knowledge is our biggest advantage over the fight against cancer.Just as Lance ignored all of his symptoms, telling himself it was simply a sore or bruise from riding, many cancer cases are not able to be cured because people ignore their warning signs. His life could have ended any time during his illness, but he ended up getting top-notch help to cure him, along with a few miracles and prayers. Cancer is very real and a large part of our modern society, and people need to start treating it like it is. Don't wait to go to the doctor of you're suspicious, go right away. If Lance wouldn't have been so determined and lucky, we may not have been able to experience one of the world's best cyclist."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Two years ago after being diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer, an RN friend recommended I read this book by Lance Armstrong. My first reaction was that I didn't even like riding bikes, why would I read about him at a time like this!I understand, now. Lance's journey through cancer was amazing and encouraging to say the least. His honesty and forthright attitude about himself and the disease was comforting and very encouraging to me. I admire his courage and found his recovery to be a true miracle. If he did it, so can I. Subsequently I've recommended the book to several fellow \\"survivors\\" and now this book was sent to a very dear friend just diagnosed with cancer in her lungs, brain and bones, in hopes Lance will inspire yet another cancer patient to fight the fight and join the \\"survivor's club\\". I highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I love autobiographies and this was a great one.

I enjoyed it and it is a page turner.When I was done, I was not sure if I would hand this to some one with Cancer though.On one hand he does a good job showing to fight cancer with every fiber but on the other hand he reports on his temper out breaks and lack of faith.For a book about Lance Armstrong pre Cheryl Crow and more then one child, this is a good one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was given this book by a good friend of mine in 2004. When he visits me in Seattle we climb mountains, we drink good beer - and we bike every day he is in town. He is not sentimental in the least, but gave me this book with that stoic glare that perked my interest.Well - I am reading 'It's Not About the Bike' now for the third time lol! Right before Lance rides one last time in the Tour I wanted to read it again ... and it's just as amazing and powerful as before.Please read this book - if you are not cynical you will cherish it for the rest of your life. Books like these make you proud to be no less than human.I already miss him even though I have the next three weeks to watch him in the greatest athletic sporting event in the world: The Tour de France.LANCE YOU RULE - BEST SPORTS STORY OF ALL TIME - BEST COMEBACK STORY OF ALL TIME - AND WITHOUT ALL THE DAMN BLING!!!!!

Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was by far one of the best books I've ever read. It is very inspirational, and proves the fact that absolutely no one is invincible. It moves very quickly for a biography, and it allows you to relate to the author and his problems. Pick this one up if you can."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Never I've heard of a celebrity discuss his negative sides also in such a detail. He never hides the fact that he, too, was really afraid that he'd die because of cancer. It may be an obvious fact, but how many of the so called &quot;celebrities&quot; are willing to accept their weakness? Though the author blatantly criticizes those who were unsupportive during crisis periods, he heartily remembers everyone who have played a major role in moulding him as a person. This is very rare to see even in ordinary guys, leave alone a person of world fame.One thing this book teaches is that even the people who have made it big are still human beings with all kinds of joy, sorrow, weakness and other countless emotions. It instills belief in the reader. After reading it, I feel life is a great gift and make it truly joyful for myself and others in the world."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Anyone who's remotely interested in leisure reading should make a bee-line for It's Not About The Bike. Along w/ Sally Jenkins, Armstrong paints us a picture of his life starting as an angst-filled up and coming athlete to his cancer diagnosis to his physical and mental battles and finally to his first Tour de France victory.The book is funny, candid, action packed, and truly moving. I mowed through its 270 or so pages in one evening. I couldn't put it down. When he described the searing pain of chemotherapy, I winced. When he talked about the thrills of hurtling down the Alps at 70 mph, my eyes widened. Lance exposes himself not as a hipper than thou athlete, but a regular human being humbled by life itself. He's blunt, but not preachy. Funny a lot of the times, but serious when need be. And he never forgot his roots.I can see why people drew such inspiration from Lance by reading his book. When you've been to the very brink of death, a place where the odds are crushed against you, and then you come all the way back to not only beat cancer, but also develop into the best athlete in your sport, you can't explain it. Instead, you just hope. You fight. And even if you don't make it, at least you get to go out in a blaze of glory. Lance gives hope to people who have none, because as bad as they think they're in for, he's been in worse--and he beat it.Read the first few pages of it here at Amazon.com. If you're not drawn in by the time you're done, you have no soul."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong, whose basic story will be well known by nearly anyone who picks up this book, surpised me. I of couse knew that he was a multiple winner of the Tour de France and had conquered cancer, but this story delves much deeper into the incredible hurdles that faced him in both situations. His honesty about the disease, his relationships and the consequences of cancer (sterility and a failed romance most notably) was refreshing and made this story much more immediate and moving then I had expected. It also made him much more real and seem more amazing then I already imagined him to be. Of course, this is a biography and Armstrong has a healthy ego to begin with, so it is of course biased in his favor, but at no point did that lessen my appreciation for what he has suffered through or accomplished.This book is not very well written (though there is nothing wrong with it at all, in fact it is very easy, quick reading) and it is a bit self serving at times, but its message of hope and can-do spirit is inspiring. I respect Lance Armstrong a great deal after reading this book and appreciate what he'd done more then ever before. I think everyone will appreciate this book and get something from it, whether you are a biking fan, a cancer survivor, an endurance athlete looking for motivation or someone who is interested in pop culture and notable people. It is a very well presented story and does not require much time or effort to complete."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"After reading Lance's book, I felt I could accomplish anything if I set my mind to it. Lance is an incredible athlete, although, this book reveals the humanness of Lance. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 16. If it weren't for the bad language and other negative parts, I would recommend it to anyone. I learned much about Lance, the Race, life and even childbirth from this book. You will too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like the title says this books is not (all) about the bike. Since you probably know the story, I won't rehash it here. I'll simply repeat that it is an unbelievable story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"From beginning to end, this book kept me hooked. I learned so much from it and from Lance's story. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I first read the book last summer. My stepsister was reading it and I picked it up when she set it down and we fought over who was going to read it for the next day or so. Only that long becuase by then we had both finished it. Enthralling...Tantalizing...leaves you wanting to know more. One of the best modern biographical writings. Can't wait until he writes another one to follow up on the this years tour and the last two as well.A must read for all athletes. Inspiring and motivating. Lance Armstrong writes nearly as well as he rides a bike. It does him great justice to have this fine book to his name."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is very important and interesting book. I hope this book and Lance Armstrong, personally, help a lot of people who have cancer, thanks to Lance people will find a power to fight against this disease, because Lance did not surrender and finally he won this competition where first place is life. I hope also this book will be translated into the Russian language and Russian people can read this excellent book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I disagree that this book is primarily about glorifying Lance Armstrong. Lance Armstrong describes himself in his younger days as a tragedy waiting to happen, an extraordinarily gifted young man who literally amused himself by playing with fire. He was full of bravado and, he admits, full of fear. He was long on attitude and raw talent, but short on introspection. He was a diamond and he knew it, with the kind of strength that cannot be taught. But looking back, he describes a very rough diamond, one that could not have reached anything like its potential without extravagant patience and help from others. He could have been such a sad case.As I read it, this is not a book about how important Lance Armstrong is because he succeeded in becoming a famous professional athlete. It is about how important it is to become you. How important you are if you are a parent. How important you are if you are a spouse. How important you are if you are a doctor, a nurse, an ultrasound tech. How important you are if you are a coach. How important you are if you are a loyal friend, or even a decent stranger. How important you are if you have a business that gives back and sticks to putting people first.This book teems with gratitude. It is possible to read this and internalize what Lance did for himself, without seeing him pointing to the difference between those who did everything for him and those who did nothing, or worse. If you miss this, you have missed one of the main points of the story. Although this book would be inspiring to anyone battling cancer, not many of those who read this will become another Lance Armstrong. Most will find themselves every day in the position of his mother, his doctors, his nurses, his mentors, his friends. Your everyday choices make such an enormous difference. Don't wait to get cancer to realize that.Another main point is that success isn't in bouncing out of bed every day with a go-getter attitude. It is not even about always knowing what your goals are-you have to search, sometimes. It is about slogging through when the attitude isn't there, about getting up after failure, about making negatives into opportunities-an attitude he learned from his mother, whom he rightly adores. He writes, \\"Some of it is not easy to tell or comfortable to hear... I've read that I flew up the hills and mountains of France. But you don't fly up a hill. You struggle slowly and painfully up a hill, and maybe, if you work very hard, you get to the top ahead of everybody else.\\" His book makes it very clear that he did not, could not, get up those hills alone.The unspoken prologue, of which we all are too aware, is that his marriage with Kristen did not last. Here is a man who was raised with no father he would give the title, whose mother was thrice divorced, from a country where 50% of us don't manage to stay married. He is an exceptionally independent man who had no track record of stable long-term relationships before marriage. Kristen is an independent, self-possessed woman. Their marriage had to be navigated through the waters of fame, the medical ordeal of becoming parents, and the rigors of a professional bicycling career. This was one time when Lance Armstrong didn't manage to beat the odds, even for the sake of his children. Until he or Kristen asks us to feel sorry for them, I would be embarrassed to raise the sentiment for their marriage. Both strike me as people who are far past needing the pity of strangers.Read the book. Your life is not about what you think about Lance Armstrong. It is about what you're going to do about you."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By now all of Europe and the Americas know of Lance Armstrong, the Texan who beat cancer and went on to win the leader's jersey of the Tour de France three consecutive years in a row - something never accomplished by an American riding in the European peloton.In part one of his book Armstrong presents a biographical tour of his life from childhood, the relationships which shaped him and the natural abilities as an athlete. He is honest about himself, his character and subsequent flaws. He places a lot of emphasis on the deep and meaningful relationship with his mother.In part two the book deals with the discovery, diagnosis, battle and remission of cancer. Armstrong is once again very open and honest in sharing his emotional state with the reader. He writes in detail about the disease, the process of chemotherapy, and the many professionals, friends and family who supported him through very dark and uncertain times.The third and final part of Armstrong's book is actually too good to be true. In it he describes his recovery or remission, if you will, the fact that he also gets the girl and goes on to prove the entire cycling establishment wrong by winning the 1999 Tour de France as a member of the USPS team. Of course none of the pages are sugar coated. Lance describes in detail what it feels like to be dropped by sponsors, to struggle back into racing shape, and how to cycle arguably the most grueling race in the world.Anyone can clearly profit from reading the book and perhaps even receive an education in sheer courage and determination.Of of the finest quote from his book is this: &quot;If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way.&quot; Lance Armstrong certainly did."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book chronicles the life of Lance Armstrong through a fatherless youth, a promising adolescence, a devastating disease, his 1st Tour win, and the birth of his son. It is well written and should be easily understandable even to someone that doesn't care at all about riding a bike. Probably the only criticism I have for this book (and this is true about most autobiographies) is that Lance seems to take particular joy in striking back at everyone he feels has wronged him in his life. So we are treated to stories of incompetent father figures, sponsors that gave him up for dead, and even revenge at high school classmates that dressed differently.Overall it's an incredible story and well worth reading. Despite the title of the book, I found that most of the story did revolve around Armstrong's cycling career (after all, who would read this book if Lance had survived cancer but given up cycling). It is an inspiring story that anyone can relate to, no matter what the hills are in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This may be an unpopular opinion but I felt a bit lukewarm on the book. Lance sounds very real and as a marathon athlete myself I truly admire his determination and drive as a champion and cancer survivor but the references he made to his father (ie: DNA donor, opportunist)and stepfather left a bad taste in my mouth. I am by no means implying that he needs to love or be involved with them however I don't believe someone who is at peace would belabor those references in the book. For what purpose? To hurt them? I felt stabs when I read them I can only imagine how they felt. Even IF they were the worst people on earth, I would much rather Lance focused on all the positive he has to offer and 2 wrongs do not make a right so why advertise bitterness? Tell your story and let the reader draw their own conclusion on some things. One would think looking death in the eye and beating it would bring about an epiphany and more perspective---perhaps forgiveness, or at the very least, peace? Lance seems to me as if he still needs work in letting go of his bitterness there, for his own sake. Here's to continued cancer free for him though...!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Unlike Lance Armstrong, I never have had cancer, and I had both of my parents, so in a certain sense I have been &quot;luckier&quot; than he was. And do I ever feel lucky that there is a guy like this in the world and that he chose to share this incredible story with us. For all of us who feel that life is giving us a &quot;bad deal&quot; or when we're just having a bad day, remembering this book and Lance's story is enough to keep me going. And yes, he got me back on my bike, too! Read this book, you will be richer for it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have never been as inspired as I was after finishing Lance's book. Lance shows us what it is like to thrive in life. I truly feel that his determination is what cured his cancer. He shows us that attitude is everything. Anyone who is serious about life and making the most of your life should read this book. Lance's story is PURE INSPIRATION."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Plain and simple, this book is inspiring! It's Not About the Bike : My Journey Back to Life not only makes you appreciate Lance Armstrong's personal achievement but can be an inspirational push forward for each of us. Thank you Lance for sharing the naked truth of your struggles. You have provided me with the inspiration needed to take the next step in my life!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked up this book and couldn't put it down until I finished. A great read, not about the bike, as the title states. It's about a strong, courageous and stubborn man who, although quite human and with many of the same weaknesses of the &quot;ordinary&quot; person, achieves that which only the the &quot;extraordinary&quot; person can achieve. Well written, this book does a great job in taking the reader through the changes in Armstrong's life, and the evolution of his attitude. A definite inspirational read!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It is now clear that most everything Armstrong says is a lie. Most of this book is based on lies and readers should consider a class action law suit against Armstrong, Jenkins and the publisher Berkley to get our money back for the book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I picked this up as I climbed late into bed last night. Two hours later, as dawn was creeping over the sky, I folded over the first page and slept for just 5 hours. I picked it up and continued reading until I folded over the second page and made a coffee and toast while the bath ran. Must confess I stayed in the bath until it was finished less than 10 hours (and three bath refills) after I had initially picked the book up.Its like listening to your best friend telling you all the things that have happened to them, with all the quirky and peppery details you would expect, whether amusing, moving, amazing or interesting to them. Its just that I dont have a best friend who has been through the kind of wringer Lance Armstrong has been through and come out the other side.I had a problem with the photos in the middle. When I got to them, I only looked at the ones that been covered by the story to that point. I then carefully read the book to the end and then went back to pour over the remaining photos to go with the rest of the story.What is the book to me. I guess if I had to put my finger on it, it is an example to me of how I could live life. Abosolutely not a trace of self pity or ego in this book.Diamond."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in honest courage. The Tour De France has been called the most grueling of all athletic events and Lance Armstrong's comeback is argueably the greatest in all of sport. I could not put this book down. I bought several books for friends."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never really took the sport of cycling too seriously until I started riding myself. Now I look at it in a different light. These athletes have strength and stamina I only dream I will one day achieve. But in Lance, the strength and stamina is multiplied by 1,000. I have read many biographies and auto bios; this one is without a doubt the most touching, sincere, and thought provoking book I have ever read. In at least three different points of the book, I cried (a feat that can only be done by a song or a movie for me and being a guy). First, when he found out he had cancer, he wondered if is was going to ride again (not live). Secondly when he came out of surgery, he asked for his mom. Thirdly, when he visited a very young cancer patient, after Lance won the Tour de France, and the child asked him for the box of cereal with his picture on it. &quot;Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day.&quot; Lance makes us believe in the human spirit and the belief that we can beat anything. Nothing is greater than the spirit; and Lance helped me find it again. Lance is the GREASTEST AMERICAN HERO; and a hero to me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a cancer survivor, I was told this book was inspirational and 'not about the bike'. I was disappointed- because it is about the bike and the huge ego of the rider. Yes, his fight was amazing and his Foundation is a thing of beauty for all survivors - but the book was too much cycle for me. It's also hard to read about his commitment to his family - written before the divorce and multiple girlfriends. Some of his experiences with the medical profession, made it worthwhile for me."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike; My Journey Back To Life, written by Lance Armstrong himself, was an incredible book. Lance Armstrong had to overcome many hardships in his life. Cancer being the key element. I could not imagine living life through all the bicycle pain, then, on top of that, having cancer. I don't think I could endure the bicycle pain, alone. He had to deal with a lot of it during his races. He had to live through so much pain before he got cancer. It is amazing how he battled through it. He said that cancer has changed his life, and I agree. He said it was the best thing that had ever happened to him. I was confused. How could cancer make you happy? BUt I realized soon what he was talking about. His attitude changed dramatically after he had cancer. He found joy and triumph that he couldn't find in any bicycle race. He knows he was lucky to have survived cancer, because most people don't. I think that from this book anyone can realize that you should take life for granted and appreciate all the things you have. It was not only a great book, but a great story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Sure, Armstrong is a walking (riding) miracle, and his book is an interesting story. However, I certainly didn't like the Lance Armstrong that was described in the book. This man is totally egocentric, self absorbed and lacking in appreciation for what he has and for those around him. He has three great achievements: beating cancer, staging a great comeback, and becoming one of the best bike racers in history. I give him credit for the last one. As for beating cancer, his doctors did that. His wealth and celebrity status got him those, along with financial help from sponsors he later trashes. As for his comeback, he quit in the middle of it. His business manager, his wife and some friends gave him the will to persevere. It wasn't him. He loses his temper at innocent people, makes unreasonable demands of his wife, friends and sponsors, and shows no remorse whatsoever. It's a shame that so few people can maintain humility and a perspective when they become celebrities."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"When you feel death is around the corner, because you are suffering a fatal sickness, you really must be experiencing a lot of transformation, feelings you have to deal with, from love to hate. LANCE who was a professional bike rider, many time winner in different circumstances of his life, a strong body, is facing the greatest challenge in his entire existence; running against his more dangerous rival CANCER.This book shows us, how a human being can fight against any obstacles, no matter how difficult they are. Love played a strong role in his cure, in which his family, friends and doctors were involved, even if his real love was to ride a bike and to be the best professional cyclist in the world. When this fatal disease came to his life, he realized that life is not only a bike-It has many other ingredients such us children, wife, the beautiful world beside the bike.I compare Lance's stages of life with the different bike races in which he has participated,--because in both he is supposed to show self determination, courage, endurance and how to work together in order to get his goal."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's auto-biography with Sally Jenkins, It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, is an inspirational story anybody could enjoy. In It's Not Aboutthe Bike, Lance Armstrong is a hero for anyone to look up to, since not only is he an amazing world renowned cyclist, he is also a normal person, who was forced to overcome many hardships to prove his heroism. I think the title itself symbolizes theproblems Lance was forced to go through, and the hardwork heused to overcome them because it states that it was his strength and ability that got him through, not the equipment or luck he had. Since he was forced to grow up fatherless in a lower classfamily, had to endure going through cancer while at the peak of his career, and then fought his way through recovery to becoming the great cycling entity he was before, he was well tried before finally accomplishing dreams like winning the Tour De Francethree times in a row and ever even being able to perform again in his career of cycling at all.Lance Armstrong at first sight would seem like a very privileged man for all of his accomplishments and his amazing strength and physical ability, but that wouldn't be true.Lance grows up in a poor family with just him and his part time working mother after his father left him at a very early age. Along with school, Lance was forced to work at a country club to keep bringing money into the family, along with his mothers income from her two part time jobs. Lance owes much of his life lessons to his mother, since she worked two part time jobs, still went to school and studied, and took care of her sonwhile he was growing up. Lance grew up cycling in the small amount of spare time he had, working very hard and training on his own. Lucky for him, he lived near the local bike shop, and soon became friends with the owner, Jim Hoyt, who would later help him to get into races and purchase bike equipment. Even though he did not have the best living situation, along with hard work and a little luck, Lance was able to start ridingearly, and eventually was noticed as a natural athlete, especially at endurance.Cancer is a problem not many have experienced, so not many know the pain and suffering it causes, especially on a person who's career is based on athleticism. At thetime before his diagnosis, Lance had just broken into the rank of one of the top five cyclists in the world. Lance Armstrong's case of cancer was a severe form of testicular cancer which was diagnosed extremely late and spread quickly into his lungs and brain. To fight through the cancer, Lance has to undergo serious and painful chemotherapy along with many surgeries. Continually Lance repeats the phrase \\"You have to fight\\" in his book and it is a strong belief of his. He says that if he wouldn't have fought and been optimistic, he would not have survived. Armstrong never gives up, even though the doctors tell him his chances are less than 50% and that his career is almost definitely over. Lance shows strength and bravery all through his cancer episode and throughout his life, since it is one of his most possessed traits.Armstrong claims that the time after his cancer went into remission was worse than when he still had cancer in his body and he was undergoing painful chemotherapy.When cancer goes into remission, there is nothing patients can do except wait to see if it returns, and once it returns, there is basically no way to treat it and it is a death sentence.During remission, Lance found extreme pain and psychological problems, because he knew he had no power over treating the problem. This problem test's not only Armstrong's bravery and strength, but his wit also. While he is waiting in his first year of remission, he starts training again, and attempts to get back into his life. He does so with the help of his friends and his newly-wed wife. This trial tests another of Lance's traits,wit, proving his ability finally as a hero, and allowing him to win.Lance Armstrong's auto-biography is a brilliant story. With the help of Sally Jenkins, the writing in the book keeps the reader hooked, talking about cycling, the disease of cancer, the problems faced by everyday person and how Lance overcame them. It's a complete cover of life, and shows everybody that anything can be accomplished, if your strong and willed. Lance Armstrong fought and beat many problems, and passedthem all to win himself hero status, by finally winning the Tour De France. The story of Lance's life can be enjoyed by a cycling enthusiast, cancer survivor, or the everyday person looking for a good read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's a good story but written a bit too much like a movie and also sounds like a 3rd grader wrote it. I liked his struggles and triumphs. Sucks it's somewhat of a lie now..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I can't remember exactly what I was thinking when I started reading this book, however, whatever it was, I am happy that I was thinking it. I was not a cycling fan at the time and will most likely never be a hard core fan and that is what is great about the book. It's not about cycling. Well, some of it is, but the parts that are about cycling are more inspirational than anything.I had absolutley no idea that Lance's fight for cancer was as grueling as it was. I didn't know that it had spread and that he wasn't only fighting testicular cancer. I also had no idea what he went through to get rid of the cancer. I know now and that is why I have such respect and admiration for Lance. He is a true fighter and is what we all should strive to be when faced with the adversity that he was.If you are looking for some inspiration then this is a good choice.With that being said, Lance's personality is somewhat brash and most likely a side effect from being famous, however, it appears to me that he stands up for what he believes is right and will let you know when he thinks you are stepping on his values or morals."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The Lance Armstrong story is well known. His triumphs in cycling as well as his fight with terminal cancer are the stuff that newspapers are made of. Trying to elaborate about those triumphs had better be compelling, or the whole account in book form becomes a dead letter.And, Lance Armstrong is definitely not a dead letter. His autobiography, 'It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,' keeps his legacy, just like his life, fresh and alive.As I accidentally fell upon this book at the library, I discovered early and often that Armstrong gives plenty of evidence his story is worth retelling. From the first chapter, the narrative is accessible enough for readers to take his journey vicariously: Riding the Tour de France and recovering from cancer was grueling for Lance Armstrong, but while the details take one vividly and perceptively through his life, one never feels that reading about it ever is. Never is there a wasted word, scene, or explanation.Deciding how this can be so is the crux. My first impression is that Lance has great expression. Even though he's down-to-earth, his color, flair, and personality are conveyed throughout. He's able to elaborate well about his life. He's good with words, and he's closely in touch with his feelings. He's able to describe life events in a fluid fashion, and his choice of what he tells is a constant exercise in good judgment.Speaking of details, without giving away the store, Lance is great at recounting when he was first diagnosed with cancer, remembering his feelings, the reactions of significant others, and what they said at key moments of his life. He's also an able writer, recalling the challenges of racing in general as well as for each individual race. His memories of dangers, competitors' strengths and weakness, and the fabric of all his personal and career ups and downs are varied and complete.It is an intimate account (enough to fascinate) without being merely a long, drawn-out addendum or answer to gossip tabloids. Furthermore, he integrates the fossilized charges of \\"doping\\" skillfully (including an honest account of what went through his mind before, during, and after his press conferences) and without overdoing it.Without diminishing his writing accomplishments, one can imagine that whenever Lance faltered in his writing, co-author, Sally Jenkins, reinforced his efforts with excellent feedback and editing. Just like his fellow team members for the Tour de France, Lance has singular achievement, but nothing he has done has been without group support..As a whole, 'It's Not About the Bike...' is a terrific read, a lucid account by an articulate man who's generous and resourceful with information. This is the best jockography I've ever read (although I\`ve only read about six.). The mere fact that he had me in suspense nearly every step of the way for an autobiographical story I've already known is a fact that speaks volumes.(*My title is a quote from Armstrong himself who is speaking about bike racing during his recollection of his first Tour de France triumph. It's a bit of a misnomer, for, as anyone who has completed the book can attest, all the suffering he recalls is very significant to him.)"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was truly fascinated with this book, and for different reasons. I went in to this one knowing only that Armstrong won the Tour de France a gazillion times and that he survived cancer. With every turn of the page I was fascinated with the life that he had lived to that point.What blew me away the most was learning that he was a world class athlete before he was diagnosed with cancer and that he hadn't even competed often or well in the Tour de France at that point. We see a string of podium finishes and a lucrative career, but for the most part Lance was an unknown quantity in the United States. So Lance had to build his story. Learning that he was a great runner and swimmer as well surprised me, and to learn that he was placing against grown adults when he was 16 took me back. You read about child prodigies but I certainly didn't think Lance was one. Then the meat of the story: cancer. The title of his autobiography says it all. The bulk of the book focuses on his bout with cancer and what it did to his life before, during and after. This is what made Lance into the person that he is today.He was literally broken down and torn apart. This was another great aspect of this biography because he was able to shed light on cancer, something most people don't know about, myself included, and to make people aware of what not only he went through but what other cancer patients were going through as well. This was the eye opening part and, in fact, was what I most interested in reading about once I got in to it. I mean I really enjoyed reading his day by day account of his first Tour de France victory, but his story was much more captivating as you read about him struggling against impossible odds.This bio is certainly \\"Not About the Bike\\" and is more about cancer and what it did to him. The main focus certainly kept my interest and book ending it with his riding career made this bio a nice and polished account of an accomplished man. A definite recommend, for the cancer experience more than his biking credentials.5 stars."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am an 18 year breast cancer survivor.

Every oncologist should read and recommend this book. Every family member there to support a cancer patient should read this book. Every mother should read this book. Every wife should read this book. His struggles and battles are mine and yours. His fears and shortcomings you will relate to.

I learned quite a bit about the Tour, about cancer and chemo, and even about in-vitro fertilization.I thought the book was well written and easy to read but I can't help wondering how much was Lance and how much was Sally Jenkins, the co-writer.

This book is for everyone and anyone. Even non sports fans will love this."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting to read about successful people, what drives their passion and why they succeeded when others did not, this is a frank story of an athlete with fantastic credentials and terrific accomplishments but for me it was not a story of heroism. The book did not dampen my admiration of the feat accomplished, but it did surprise me, living with that much bitterness inside, it was as though his physical cancer was healed but the mental cancer was growing. Here was a man born with a natural physiological advantage, a hardworking mother and supportive mother, numerous people who gave him free equipment, money, support and indulged his personality, friends and family who stuck by him through every challenge in his life, opportunities to travel and see the world at a very young age, but still, he is angry with the world because everything did not come automatically to him. A privilege is anything that sets you apart from the rest of the world and he had countless privileges, but for him the only one that seemed to matter was money and since he was not born into it he hated the world. The endless bashing of anyone who denied him an indulgence he felt entitled to changed what could have been an insipiring story into a spite-fest. This continues after the book, since there is a review on the Amazon page by the co-author who unprofessionally indulges in even more public spite towards anyone who did not like her book. It seemed that humble beginnings did not inspire him towards sympathy for the truly underprivileged but simply gave him the desire to become privileged as fast as he can. Again anyone can desire to be privileged but not everyone has the means, he was born with the means, most people are not.Certain stories particularly bothered me - he was a multi-millionaire, earning millions even while lying in bed fighting cancer, his mother still could not afford to miss a couple of weeks of work; he expected corporate america to subsize his life but despised the people who make up corporate america, those very plano-ites he hated so much go into their offices day after day and the money they make allows a life different from theirs, he did not aspire to a tract house near a strip mall failed to grasp that those homeowners were funding his passions; a millionaire panicking about health insurance, what about the people without the millions or health insurance or a porsche to sell; he had support from millions of unknown people, his family and friends,his knowledge of the treatment that saved his life came from a stranger interested in him and lending him support, what about the lonely, poor people who sit alone in their homes with their cancer; his friend dies of cancer inside three months, hers is incurable, so was his curable all along; he asks for sympathy for his wife alone in France, nothing to do but explore, learn the language, furnish the new house, for many women working in offices to pay Lance his millions, and then rushing home to take care of their families, I think that would be their dreams come true.I do not know the Armstrongs and I do not know how accurately this represents them, this is just my review of a book and the story it told. FOr me this was just a story, a good one and one I enjoyed reading, it was human because it said that successful people were not necessarily great and wonderful human beings, they can be arrogant, spoiled, nasty, oblivious to the rest of the world and still succeed, sort of gives hope to the rest of us, doesn't it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's not about the bike... it's about the dope.\\" What a joke. I want the $$ back I paid for this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book offers so much brutal honesty that you will not be able to put it down (I finished it within 8 hours of starting it). I never much cared for Armstrong (and his over confidence) early on in his career, but I have to count myself among his many admirers now. His climb from cancer to to the top of the podium in Paris is remarkable, but that is a nearly insignificant portion of the story. If you are a fan of his work, though, you will granted some very candid and enlightening views into the maturing and development of a world class athlete.In a time when superstar athletes get away with murder and have no appreciation for their good fortune, Armstrong sings a very different song. You may or may not become a fan of cycling after you read this book, but you can't help being a fan of the man. You might think, as I did, that this book was simply a well spun public relations event, but when you read the intimate and graphic accounts of his chemo treatments and the various medical procedures that were performed you quickly realize that this was not done to put the guy on a pedestal. It was done to show the devastating, human side of cancer. And yet despite all of that the message that prevails is that we, even in our worst times, still need to have hope and that we have so much to be thankful for. You will never look at this man or the disease in the same way again."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"[T]his is one of the best books I have ever read.

Congradulations Lance"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Once I began to read this book, I could not put it down. Everyone knows of Lance Armstrong's against-all-odds win at the Tour de France. Equally interesting is his description of how he grew into the man who accomplished that feat. His descriptions of growing up in a single parent household in Texas and his love of all things daring grab your attention and never let go. He is so truthful and open that you can imagine knowing him. His rise among the ranks of racing, the behind the scenes politics are unbelievable. His unflinching description of the discovery of cancer and how it invades, and changes life are unsparing. I finally understood what my own mother had tried to tell me about how chemo had altered her ability to eat when I read his explanation of his struggle. It is a story of cancer and of survival. Its greatest strength is it deals with facing what comes our way and learning to live with it. This is a marvelous wonder of a book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's not about the bike. It's about the dope, dope! It's well-known that Lance doped his way to the Tour de France podiums. But the book says he didn't dope. His co-author has finally accepted that he did dope, though she justifies it. (Check her column this week in the Washington Post.) I wonder whether she and Lance will revise this book? If you want an inspirational story, find it elsewhere."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33 and read this book in the hospital while recovering from my mastectomy. I found it incredibly inspirational and it encouraged me to take an active participation with my treatments and recovery. I was shocked to learn of his lying and bullying. We don't know what caused his cancer, but doping, could have potentially contributed. Cancer prevention is just as important as cancer cures. What he should have done was confessed when he was diagnosed and used himself as an example of the serious side effects of doping. He could have still started Livestrong. He may not have become as famous, but then he would have been a hero instead of a fraud."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is not a profound book, and it is not great literature. It's not even an objective account of Lance Armstrong's life and career. But what it is is more important than all that: the book is an inspiration with few peers. I have read it more than once, and each time I read the last page I close the cover, put the volume aside and think: I can do anything I set my mind to doing.As the title says, the story is not (only) about the bike, as its lessons of hope and perseverance are relevant to anyone facing adversity. But it is probably best enjoyed by those familiar with cycling, since it also offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of someone who does what he does better than anyone else.If there is anyone who doesn't already know the general outline of Lance Armstrong's history, he overcame a deadly battle with cancer to win the Tour de France, considered by some the most grueling and difficult endurance test in the world. And it's a story that is still current: Lance won the tour twice more after the book was published and will be vying for a record-tying fifth title this summer.As I wrote at the beginning, don't buy this book if you want a philosophical tome about overcoming a life-threatening illness, or a spin-free look at the complex life of an athlete who is probably still under appreciated in his home country and at once admired and resented in Europe, where he spends most of his time. But if you want an easy-to-read real-life story to inspire you and illustrate what is possible -- and what could be more important than that? -- this is the book you want."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Having never really been interested in cycling I bought this book since I wanted to know about Lance's fight with testicular cancer which killed my best friend three years ago in his early 30s. I was not just positively surprised but literally stunned and finished the book in two days.Lance's life from his upbringing to early achievements, his fight with cancer to becoming the King of the Tour de France are written honestly and interestingly. Reading the book took me along the entire emotional spectrum and I enjoyed every minute of it. With a less than 3% chance to survive I am convinced that contrary to the title, his survival is about the bike. It tought him to fight, to personalize the challenge and to give it everything he has got.Being German, I wanted Jan Ullrich to win the tour this year but having read what Lance has overcome and seeing him on the crucial day after falling due to spectator involvement, I now hope that he will win his sixth (and final?) Tour in 2004 to take his rightful place as the best rider who ever lived.I felt compelled to write this review since I read some of the other reviews. While I understand some of the comments about him being egoistic, that is part of him too. He is not claiming to be perfect, far from it, and I do not judge the man but simply recommend his book as an uplifting and interesting read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In light of the wall of evidence suggesting Lance's aggressive use of doping materials to gain his competitive advantage, this book's central thesis of winning through dedication does not account for the incredible investment in dishonesty and deception that made these wins and his spotless image possible. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As a former and current cancer survivor (I am currently going through my second bout with cancer)and having lost my mother to cancer I can relate to Lance's experience with this dreaded disease. His childhood memories of him and his mom parallel some of mine. The father that wasn't there, having mom take all the responsibilities of raising a child and then marrying someone whom you really didn't care for. That also happened to me. I escaped that by joining the Navy and making a career out of it. But back to the book, chapter five \\"Conversations with cancer\\" puts it all in perspective for anyone battling cancer or having a family member or friend suffering from cancer. He puts it best on page 113 and I quote \\"Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day. And it will beat you. I didn't fully see, until the cancer, how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world, how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism. Dispiritedness and disappointment, these were the real perils of life, not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday. I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and inevitable death, it IS the very definition of cynicism and loss of spirit. So, I believed.\\" That pretty much says it all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I usually do not read biographies written by people (mainly athletes) with less than 30 years-old. It's simply arrogant, selfish, preponderous to write a \\"biography\\" when you barely began to live, when youhave not even (in most cases) become a mature and complete person.But, in this case, I allowed myself to break my own rules, because in reading Lance's biography I could win two games: I would know a lot more about a great champion's routine and history, and at the same time I would know a lot more about batlles against cancer, that damned adversary that takes so many of us out of this world.That said, I must saythis is a great book. The \\"real\\" writer, Sally Jenkins, did a very good job, and the book is almost a page-turner (exception being the boring, VERY boring chapter about in vitro fertilization... ugh..!). Also, since the book was written in 2001, you should not take into consideration about a lot fo the wonderful things writeen about his marriage and his wife, since in 2003 they were already divorced.A good book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like many others have said here, this is a book about triumph over hardship, the battle fought against an adversary like no other-cancer. While reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Lance Armstrong was a jerk.\\" But, then you can almost see him grow and mature as the stroy unfolds, you can see the bitter battle he fought and won.I am a fiction lover at heart, but this book drew me in and held my attention. I consider myself an athlete, but what Armstrong went through pushes the envelope of human endurance. Read this book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike\\" is mostly not about the bike. Lance Armstrong spends the better part of his book talking about his fight against cancer and how it changed him as a person and as a professional cyclist. It's easy to get swept up in Lance-mania, hearing the guy describe his awful experiences with his illness and his improbable return to athletic greatness.Despite the catchy title, the bike really does matter. Cycling is so central to Armstrong's life that his bicycle is always with him. He sees it as part of his treatment, whether riding between chemo treatments, or discussing the nuances of bike parts with his nurse. Just as interesting are descriptions of key races that he competed in both before and after falling ill. You'll feel like a real dweeb when you learn all of that cycling vocabulary, particularly if you use it around the office. You may also take a keener interest in next summer's Tour de France, whether or not Lance is there to compete.The book's key weakness is that it's tough to reconcile Lance's personal life with how he describes himself in the book. He barely pays lip service to an erstwhile girlfriend who was with him during his battle with cancer, but he fawns incessantly over his now divorced first wife Kristin. Sheryl hadn't shown up yet. Oh well, that's the elephant in the room so it had to be mentioned. But don't let that stop you from reading this book. It's a good read and it'll give you a profound respect for those who have battled and survived cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Keep RidingBy: Lance ArmstrongLance Armstrong is the best bicyclist in the world. I chose to read this memoir because I've heard of Lance's survivorship from cancer. Lance grew up loving the sport of riding fast on a bike. When he got older and more experienced, he became one of the legends in cycling.Lance had a tough childhood while growing up. His birth father, whose name was Gunderson, divorced his mother when Lance was only two years old. Then after they moved, they lived across the street from Richardson Bike Mart. His mom (Linda) got a deal from the owner (Jim Hoyt) and Lance got his first bike. At the same time came a new step dad for Lance named Terry Armstrong. Lance became very good at riding a bike and also at swimming, so when he saw a flyer for a triathlon he went and tried and won. Terry Armstrong didn't last very long as Lance's stepfather, because when he and Lance were going to one of his triathlons, he was secretly writing to another woman. So not long after it was just Lance and his mom. Meanwhile Lance was beginning to excel in cycling winning triathlon after triathlon. He was also earning prize money along the way and then he bought a car. Then in one of the bike races Lance got in a fight, and Jim Hoyt, his sponsor, got so angry that he took his car away. So Lance skipped town and joined the U.S. National cycling team. Lance was winning a lot of races and training and racing in Europe. Then when Lance was at the high point of his career his life fell apart- he found out that he had testicular cancer. In his mind Lance thought he would die but luckily there was a doctor in Indianapolis that treated his kind of cancer. It was Dr. Nichols, and first Lance started taking sessions of Chemotherapy. After eating healthy, and with more sessions with chemo and drugs, Lance and the doctors thought he was cured, but there was still a chance the cancer could come back. It did not, so Lance started his rehabilitation. To show his thanks to his doctors, he hosted a fundraiser: The Ride of the Roses. There he met Kik, his future wife. He started cycling again and slowly worked his way up to the point to where he could race again. So he went to the Tour de France, one of the most grueling races of cycling, but few people believed in Lance. Lance showed everyone that he had made it back by winning the Tour de France. After he won this race, he became a father, when Kik had their son Luke. Lance talks about picking Luke up from his crib and when Luke cries and kicks, Lance whispers to him \\"Yeah, that's right, go on\\", meaning that he should try hard to make it in life, whatever it takes.When he rebounded from cancer Lance was determined to accomplish one of his goals, to win the Tour De France. Lance was in shock when he first got cancer and he almost fainted when he heard the odds of him living. Lance took cancer seriously, not breaking any rules and taking his medicine. He said, \\"Let's kill this stuff. Whatever it takes, let's do it.\\" That quote says that Lance just wanted to be well, no matter how painful or difficult the treatment.When Lance Armstrong walked out of that hospital he was in remission from his cancer.Lance showed that some people survive cancer and can continue with what they began before being diagnosed with cancer. He learned a lot about cancer and how it takes a lot of hard work from dedicated doctors to treat it. But sometimes that doesn't work and the cancer kills them. He also learned that you have to believe in yourself and to not give up something that you have always dreamed about. I learned that you always have to believe that you must try your best. I have some uncles and aunts and friends with cancer, and I hope they will keep fighting."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong survived Testicular cancer, and had less than 3% chance of living, and post-cancer won two Tour De France Champion titles for two years in a row. This man is a hero. I am not the only one to say it as well. There are over 100, 000 thousand spectators at each stage of the Tour de France, and 75% of them are there to see him. I have seen him before, racing down the hill and it is unbelievable to think how he survived. I always wanted to learn more about the American Champion who wins so many years in a row. This was my opportunity to read about one man who is a true American hero.Lance Armstrong was born and raised in Plano, Texas by his single mother Linda, who was seventeen when she gave birth. In Lance's last year of high school he was invited to join the US National Cycling team which train for the Olympics. After participating in many aces with his team he decided to turn Professional. He signed a contract with Cofidis, a French racing sponsor. His first race was the San Sebastian Classic. Unfortunately the day of the race it was cold and foggy, it is the worst condition to ride in race. It is a day long but you go up and down many hills. He arrived in last place, because he was so uncomfortable with the conditions. He continued riding and won first place in The Tour Du Pont in 1996, which ranked him as number one cyclist in the world. He then raced in the Tour De France but dropped out because he could no longer continue. That year in October he found out he was diagnosed with Testicular cancer.He was feeling a lot of pain in his left testicle, but thought it was only normal because of biking. Until one night he started to cough up blood. He had a neighbor who was a doctor and contacted him immediately. His neighbor made him an appointment to go and see a doctor that night. The doctor had to take x-rays and did a very thorough exam. Lance didn't understand why they were testing so much. After all the evaluating was done the doctor told lance that he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and it had already spread throughout the body; most importantly the lungs and the brain.The doctor had already made an appointment for his testicle to be removed and for them to bank sperm cells. After his surgery he said, \\"I spent the rest of the weekend on the couch recovering from the surgery, the anesthesia made me woozy, and the incision was excruciating (pg.84).\\" He had support from his mother and all his friends. His main concern was that he wouldn't be able to get back on the bike, and that his career was over. Lance immediately started searching for ways to cure his disease. The best play for him to go was where the first cure of testicular cancer was discovered, Indiana University School of Medicine.The two surgeons who were to help him were Dr. Scott Shapiro and Greg Nichols. They had a plan for Lance so he could still go back on the bike afterwards. Lance and his mother were surprised to hear that because everywhere else they went, they were telling Lance they had to use chemo that would destroy his lungs, which meant good bye biking. The plan would be more to fit Lance. They would have to give him certain type of Chemo and a brain surgery to remove 2 lesions in his brain.Lance was strong throughout the whole process and wanted the cancer to go away more than anything. When his brain surgery came he was scared because where the lesions were located, could be a tricky spot and were near the vision field and the part of his brain that controlled balance, so if Dr. Sharipo messed up, he could loose his sight and his balance.He woke up from his surgery alive, and he could still see. He was relieved that the surgery went well. After the brain surgery he had to go through chemotherapy. He had cycles and would have it injected in his body 5 days a week. LaTrice Haney was the nurse who would inject it into his body. Everyday Lance would ask LaTrice questions, at first about what was going into his body, then if he was going to live and as well about everything else. Lance describes LaTrice as an angel.Chemotherapy wasn't exactly a party to Lance. He would suffer from nauseas, vomiting, and weird looking spots on his body. He said it was a lot worse than climbing up an Alp during a stage of the Tour de France. After his long treatment of several months, the doctors said his cancer was gone. Sadly there was still chance of it coming back so Lance would have to watch out. The doctors would continue to check up on Lance throughout the year, but his blood tests only proved to be better and better. After one year since he was diagnosed, Lance was cancer free.Post cancer Lance decided to start a foundation, The Lance Armstrong Foundation. Their first event was called Ride for the Roses, it has now become and annual event since 1997. As Lance was organizing this event he met Kristin Richard, better known as Kik (Keek). At first Kik and Lance were only friends but several moths later they started dating each other and decided to get married. They were very in love.Lance decided to start to train on his bike again. His goal was to win Le Tour De France. They moved to the south of France in a city called Nice (Pronounced Niece). At first Lance was having a hard time getting back on the bike. So he gave up and they moved back to Texas. Kik was very supportive and left Nice, even though she had a difficult time. When they moved back to Texas Lance became a TV Bum. He stayed at home doing nothing and eating Mexican.Kik finally convinced him and said to him you should stop wasting your time and mine because I am bored to. If you really love biking, go back to the bike. Lance and Kik moved back to France and Lance began his crucial training for Le Tour De France. He practiced every day with his U.S. Postal Team, because Cofidis ended his contract because Lance was ill. He pushed his limits everyday, practicing all the routes he would be doing in the stages.When the race finally came he was prepared. He was not a favorite to win. No one thought he could win because he had just gotten over cancer. But deep down inside Lance knew he could do. This is what he has been training for. In the Prologue race you each go once at a time. It is more like a time trial. Whatever place you get is the place you start out with in the ranking during the tour.When Lance went he zoomed through. He described his experience, \\"I was pushing to hard, not realizing it. I sat down, and focused on the execution and on the science and technique of the ride (pg. 231).\\" He finished that stage at 1st. Place. He had one the maillot jeune (Yellow Jersey) for the first time in his career. He had called Kik to share his happiness. \\"All I hear on the other end of the line was \`Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god!' and she burst into tears (pg. 231,232).\\"Lance continued to win throughout the stages. At the end he had won, overall, best time out of all the other cyclists and wowed the audience. News reporters went crazy. Nobody could believe that Lance had won, he just survived cancer. It was a true miracle and it proves how hard somebody works to follow their dreams, no matter what gets in their way!Kik and Lance had a baby boy a year later. They had to go through a long process in order to have the baby, because Lance's sperms were in a bank and frozen. After a long process though they were able to conceived a boy named David Luke Armstrong.Lance discovers that the hardest event he had to go through was cancer, and if he had to choose over cancer and winning the Tour De France he would pick cancer. \\"If you ask me to choose between the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer. Odd as it sounds I would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winning of the Tour, because of what it has done foe me as a human being, a man, a husband, a son, and a father (pg. 265).\\" Because of cancer Lance learned not to take advantage of life, all he did was wanted to win and didn't respect other cyclists. He didn't realize how many people died every day of cancer. Lance learned not care about how much money he has or what car he drives, but to care about whom he is and that's what he needed to find in himself."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Daniel Dupon9/ 30 /05Period 4Keep RidingBy: Lance ArmstrongLance Armstrong is the best bicyclist in the world.

This book was well organized and well written.Somethings I've read about him were put together so poorly I hardly knew what it was they were trying to say."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"By now it seems just about everyone -- certainly anyone interested in this book -- knows at least something about Lance Armstrong's story, and probably expects the full story to be inspiring. Well, this book certainly delivers, meets, and often surpasses those expectations.I think there is a wide cross-section of readers who will find many parts of this book totally absorbing. As for me, I love reading about cycling tactics and the drama that unfolds in and around the pro peloton. There are many details about cycling in this book. (Though, of his TDF victories, only the first is described in full. The 2000 tour is described in an \\"Encore\\" chapter.) Among the most interesting to me were the few pages about a heated topic that is rarely addressed by the parties involved -- Armstrong's sponsors -- which companies vowed unconditional support, and which company all but abandonned.Though I didn't expect to find details about cancer and its treatment as interesting as the cycling details, that part of the story is among the most inspirational. It provides another example of Armstrong's intensely competitive nature and astonishing capacity to remain confident in the face of unthinkable pain, suffering, and adversity. In Armstrong's narrative, the story reads like that of some insane, year-long time-trial, cooked up by TDF organizers just to see if Lance will crack.Finally, perhaps Armstrong's greatest strength as an autobiographer is his willingness to candidly describe his weakest and most desperate hours."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life was an amazing book. This book showed all of Lance Armstrong's struggles and victories. I always see him on T.V. and never thought twice that he had it really hard and his life was on the line. I am amazed by what he has done and now I am more educated by reading this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I live in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. I do some Olympic-distance triathlons (in other words, small potatoes). The bike training I do would be considered a ride around the neighborhood by Lance Armstrong. I read this just before a hospital visit for surgery. I have a couple of friends who are cynical enough to announce that to be such a champion in the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong uses drugs stronger than aspirin. This is the same kind of thinking which inspired the idea that the 1969 moon landing was a hoax created for television. Doesn't anyone believe in greatness anymore?This book is enough to make you go back to church and renew your belief in a higher power. Lance tells it like it happened and he leaves little out. He talks about his upbringing, his initiation into the cycling world, his first races, his arrogance, his discovery that he had cancer, his experience with treatment and medical personnel, the reactions of the cycling world and of his sponsors, meeting his future wife, his first child and his winning of the Tour de France. It's a long road to cover and it never flags for one second. No wonder it won Sports Book of the Year for 2000. This book is so compelling I bet it Mr. Armstrong didn't relax until he finished it.When Lance Armstrong talks about his cancer nurse LaTrice who said to him \\"I hope someday to be just a figment of your imagination,\\" I was deeply moved. I'll be watching the Tour de France in 2004. I won\`t miss a day. And guess who I'm rooting for?! GO LANCE GO!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I've been following Lance from his first Tour de France win. Yes, I am one of those people who didn't know who he was until then. This year, while he was after win #5, I thought I would pick up this book and hear his story. And what a magnificent story it is!He doesn't go into detail about his childhood. He tells you about the stepdads that he had, and the father that he didn't. But he doesn't dwell on it. He and his mom are a team working together to support each other. He goes into detail about his cancer diagnosis, and the treatment. He doens't plow you over with big medical terms, he puts it so every one understands. He goes into detail about his recovery, both emoionally and physically, and his comeback to the podium. He tells his story, and doesn't hold anything back. He doesn't want you to feel sorry for him, he just wants you to know what exactly he went through.This is a great story for everyone, not just the cycling enthusiast."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a man of character and integrity. But it took a chronic illness to change him into the human being he is today. His story about his bout with cancer is not one of great inspiration or motivation but of survival. I finished the book the same day I started it. It is a quick read and an invigorating tale of one man's struggle not only with a physical illness but a mental battle to overcome all obstacles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance touches your heart with the real details of his life...he is honest about being an amateur cycling cocky Texan; he is honest about his motives to win; he is honest about what he went through mentally and physically with cancer. He intimately describes the fear, the uncertainty, the determination to recover from his diagnosis and the cancer treatments. Lance opens the door to his life to help others understand the reality of being diagnosed with cancer and the mission to overcome the fear and get on the path to life again....A path to a better life...a more successful life than he would have had or REALIZED if he had not had to take a new perspective because of his cancer diagnosis. Thank you!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance offers a bit of something for everyone in this book. Something for the athlete that needs motivation, something for those overcoming serious illness, something for kids to admire, and a wake-up call for adults who think life is so damn rough.His childhood is somewhat slow reading but does make the point that even the most under-privileged kid can make something of themselves. Highly recommended for the young who just need the realization that everyone can overcome life's obstacles."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have followed Lance's career and still can't believe what he has overcome and what he has accomplished. He didn't have an easy life as a child, but he refused to make excuses. Some might call him cocky, but you don't get to be the best by being a patsy. My friend gave this book to a co-worker who was dying of inoperable cancer, and it provided a great lift for her. She's still in dire straits, but everytime she feels like giving up, she picks up Lance's book and it provides her with the needed passion to continue her fight. The Tour de France may be the toughest physical test there is, but Lance conquered it four times, just as he conquered cancer. Is he bitter? What would you feel if your boss fired you while you lay on your death bed, leaving you with no medical insurance? Unbelievable strength and inspiration is what this book provides."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"He may be a d--- in real life, but you have to hand it to him about the journey he has taken. In reading the book it was refreshing to believe that he was writing the book in his own voice (very personally with anger, vulgarity, and fast paced). The book was inspirational to the point that here was this guy who had the chips stacked against him and although I don't think most people will just roll over and die at the news (most people do choose to fight the cancer), he not just survived but was able to rebuild himself to become the best at what he does. He pays tribute to the other cancer patients he meets and vividly describes the battles he and everyone else has with the cancer, the treatments and the 'loss of self'. He doesn't paint a pretty picture about anything that happens except in the network of patients, survivors and some healthcare professionals he mwt along the way. Another refreshing aspect to the book that adds to its validity is his honesty about his roller-coaster of emotions, where at times he wanted to give up certain pursuits and had to rely on the strength of those around him to go on. It is a strong dose of reality for everyone who reads it, and educates those of us fortunate not to have cancer on the debilitating effects on the body and soul it has. The bike and racing is a side-bar story that just adds to the strength of character that many survivors have after they beat the disease, on their \\"new lease\\" on life. This was a great and humbling book that I could not put down when I started it."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a good book to read when you are feeling &quot;blah&quot;...While I wasn't annoyed when Lance got resentfully back at some people that he feels let him down in life (after all, he is human, just like all of us!), I read with much interest his accounts of his battle with cancer, and of the Tour de France.Whether you like Lance Armstrong or not, whether or not you are into cycling,you have got to admit he's got guts, drive and resiliance. I don't think Lance aimed at being depicted as perfect in this book. Rather, he aims at being the best he can be. And for this alone, the book is worth reading.This is a good reminder of what you can accomplish if you work hard enough for it. Remember the famous quote &quot;never, never give up...&quot;?"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life\\" is a remarkable story. Armstrong doesn't pull any punches or paint himself as a hero. He offers insight into the mind of a world-class athlete and opens up the thrilling world of bicycle racing for those who would never otherwise have any knowledge of it. He shares his life with the reader in a way that is honest and at the same time not self-critical. He shows us his best and his worst, and there were certainly times in his life where he felt horrible and it seemed to get the better of him. In the end, though, it is apparent that it has been in his nature since childhood to give it his all....It caused him to see the mundane as miraculous and view each day as a gift. This is not an unusual experience to have for people with life-threatening diseases or that have had near death experiences, but few realize they can have this experience right here and now. If you would like to learn how, I recommend \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. In it they describe the secrets to living in the moment that can start you on your journey back to life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A Man Who I Want to Follow\\"It's not about the bike\\" is a wonderful and inspiring book. In this book, it talks about Lance's pre-cancer life, cancer life and post-cancer life. His life, especially his cancer life tells us about the relationship of family, friends and the other people, and how to deal with it. His life also tells us about health and sickness, life and death, happiness and sadness, about the fears and difficulties; and how we should face them and deal with them. He told us \\"Make every obstacle an opportunity,\\" \\"Make every negative a positive,\\"..........I'm not a cancer survivor or cyclist, but I know how difficult it is to ride a bike. When I was little, I attended an elementary school, which was 15 kilometers away from my village. I had to ride my bike home to get food every week. There were a lot of ascents, it was very difficult for me to climb them. But I had to climb them to get home. Sometimes I had to ride home and then ride back to school in a day, I rode almost 30 kilometers a day. This continued until I went to college in 1994. So I had the cycling experience too. But I lost this hard spirit when I came to the U.S.A. I always thought about going back to China, because I felt it was very hard to live here. I didn't know the language; it was very hard to find a satisfying job. I always felt upset. But after I read this book, I learned from this book that the road under my feet is not always smooth, it sometimes will be up and sometimes will be down. So I must follow Lance Armstrong that I must make every negative a positive, I must conquer every difficulty I meet, I must make my road smoother and smoother.Dada"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I've read many biographys about many athletes. This is without a doubt the best one yet!!! I couldn't put it down. I'm not a tremedous cycling fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this pageturner because &quot;it's not about the bike&quot;. It's about courage, determination, strength, and perserverance. When he crosses the finish line at the 1999 Tour de France, you'll get chills up and down your arms. Lance will inspire you to get off the couch and get on a bike. He'll inspire you to make the most of your life. A Great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is fascinating on several levels: First, it's a very frank analysis of Lance Armstrong and his rise from a less than ideal family situation to his perch atop the cycling world. Second, it's an amazing account of his mother's strength and devotion in raising a son, often as a single parent. Third, it's a troubling account of the overwhelming difficulties facing cancer patients -- from insurance runarounds to loss of jobs to contradictory assessment and treatment recommendations from the doctors entrusted with their care. This is truly an incredible story. Four years ago Armstrong dropped out of the Tour de France and bombed out at the Atlanta Olympics. Over the next year he discovered he had a very advanced form of testicular cancer,tumors in his lungs and two in his brain, underwent brain surgery and four rounds of chemotherapy. Not long after, he was competing in Europe again. The rest is well-known: Tour victories in '99 and 2000 and a real hope for Olympic gold this time around. This is a frank, well-written account of Armstrong's incredible journey. I think it may be especially well-received by those undergoing cancer treatment or their families. The story goes far beyond an account of two-wheeling through the Alps."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like Lance, I too am a cyclist, but this book is not about cyling. This book is about taking each day by throat and living. It's about not ever giving up, regardless of the odds. It's about reveling in your family, friends, and loved ones. It's about living your life on your terms and only having to answer to yourself. It's about not stressing over the little things that no one will remember ten years from now. Every human being whether they're an athlete or not, a cancer survivor or not, should read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of the most talked about books on the scene today and for good reason. You learn a lot about bicycle racing which subject I was most ignorant and...it is interesting. You learn a lot about intestinal fortitude, focusing, planning and goal setting; and you learn about facing and beating a killer like cancer and what you have to go through to beat it. A number of times throughout the book tears dripped down my face sometimes in sadness and sometimes in joy. A book to treasure and help one appreciate their fellow human beings."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an inspirational book! It proves that your life isn't that bad after all and that you can overcome some of the biggest hurdles of a lifetime. Well written and even with pictures for a personal touch, I admit I shedded a tear or two. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is wonderful. Not only does it take you step by step with how Lance dealt with cancer, it takes you step by step into the competition to the Tour De France. I couldn't put the book down. It teaches you never to quit and to go after your dreams."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read the book in one sitting...it's that captivating! Whether you are a cycling fan or not this is one you shouldn't pass up! At times I felt myself angry over the way Armstrong treated his friends, coaches and family but then...you have to consider what he was going through at the time. Yes he is brash but when you're as good as he is and have been through what he's been through it's not without cause. A truly inspirational and uplifting story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book because I got caught up in the 99 Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's story. What I discovered was much more interesting. The will to live...The fight of cancer patients...The struggle of the cancer patient's family.Not long after reading this book, a friend's son in law was diagnosed with testicular cancer. I gave her Lance's book and sent her the Lance Armstrong Foundations web address ... so that she could get further information on the disease."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although I really haven't followed Lance Armstrong's cycling career, I was compelled to get this book. I found it very interesting and although I haven't personally been very close to someone dealing with cancer, it was a great story of hope. I think this would be an awesome book to give someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. No matter how grim of a prognosis someone may be given, Lance Armstrong is a living example of how there can always be hope. I also think that when people are fighting cancer, they probably want to read success stories on those that have overcome cancer so that they may have hope."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have read many books in my life, but never one quite like this one. The whole time that I read this book I was thinking to myself, &quot;..and I think that I have had some bad days!&quot; If you have ever found a more inspiring example in a human being, let me know, I'll read their book. Lance Armstrong was near the top of his sport, and he finds that he has cancer. What would you do if someone told you that not only were you losing your health, your ability to work, and maybe your life? Did he quit and give it all up forever? Not only did he NOT, he battled back from cancer and beat death, but he attacked it with the same energy that he used as a cyclist. He got his life back, found a wife, and won the Tour de France. What a role model. Read this book. I hope that this athlete can become a role model and an example to all."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is somewhere around 3 and a half stars. I bought the book not because I am a cancer patient or, knows somone who is. I bought this book because I thought it would be nice to try and understand what drives a Lance Armstrong. Lance lets us into his life of how he prepares for cycling races and how he trains for six or seven hours straight! I learned some things about cancer treatment that I did not even realize nor would I have thought about before.Side bar: To become an elite athlete is the ultimate dream to me because you get paid to workout and be recognized so, just to read about the lifestyle of Lance was worth the cost of this book which I bought used.I suggest you buy it used as well."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Kyle WilliamsIt's not about the bikeLance ArmstrongThis book about Lance Armstrong describes how he went through things in his life that changed the way he thought about life. He tried his hardest to live and set a record for the Tour de France. Many struggles caused him to try as hard as he could that changed the way he will think about things and that life isn't perfect. You must undergo challenges that will pay off sooner or later. What challenges will he go to in order to live?When Lance was a kid he was given his first bike and he loved it. One day he saw that the bike shop that he always went to had a sign for a triathlon. He signed up and he started to ride his bike, swim, and run so that he could win. On the day of the triathlon his mother came to watch and he ended up winning. As the years went by he started to go to more triathlons and the bike store started to sponsor him with all of his bikes. His mom and him started to travel to places such as New Mexico.He got sponsored by Oakley and Nike and got a coach by the name of Chris Carmichael. He started to travel to foreign countries to join bike races. He joined the U.S. team and would always ditch his team and gun ahead of everyone. Lance came is first a lot but then he started to come in 11th and 12th place because he would lose energy early in the race for trying to go ahead. His coach was always encouraging him to take chances and go for the win. That is exactly what he did and he ended up winning more in foreign countries.Then he got cancer! One day while he was riding his bike he started to feel pain in his right testicle. He quickly went home and looked at it. It was three times larger than normal. He went to the doctor and instead of it being a twenty-minute appointment it ended up being over two hours long. They took x-rays and the doctor told him he had testicular cancer and they would remove the testicle the next day. The testicle was removed but the cancer had spread to his lungs. He went through chemo and brain surgery and the cancer was removed. He went to win three more Tour de France's before he married and ended up retiring.In this book the author learned that life is more important than the bike and that fighting through will help you get through it. Lance learned that being the best would get you somewhere but that your life is way more important then being the best. When you get a disease your life can become more important and your family members are always by your side even if you are really sick. They will always care for you in any struggle during your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a great book ... especially since Lance has now won seven Tour de France races ! I admired his perserverance getting through cancer and climbing back on the bicycle to continue training. He is definitely right that cancer makes you think about the people near you much more -- his girlfriend / wife and eventually his son. The details of his emotional reaction to learning about his cancer were very helpful to understand what cancer patients go through."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's not about the bike was so inspirational.It was real ,it was touching.A book that gives HOPE."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life\\" by Lance Armstrong is one of the best classic books I have read in my life. In it, Lance describes his journey through childhood, his first years of cycling, cancer and his return to cycling after being cured. I am a huge fan of Lance Armstrong and after reading this book my respect for him has grown even more. The best thing about the book was the way Lance Armstrong presented the bike races. His detailed part-by-part descriptions were truly fascinating. It made me feel that I was there riding the bike with him.The book would be a great source of inspiration for everyone because it inspires within us the \`great spirit' to achieve higher and better things. The book also motivates us to overcome all obstacles without wavering in our path. Moreover, this makes \\"It's not about the bike\\" an apt title for the book, because it is not only about Lance's great achievements, but it's about the immense value of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Well...I won't rehash what everyone has written...but I will say that I love the story. Hollywood could have never written a comeback story such as this...no one, and I mean NO ONE would ever believe it!I love Armstrong's description of his saviors...his Doctors and especially his \\"Angel\\", La Trice Haney. I could feel his vindication as he walked by the management of Cofidis Racing at the Tour. It is especially interesting reading his fondness of Kristen \\"Kik\\" Richard, his future wife. Now that he is divorced it is interesting to see how one's perspective on another can change so dramatically.If you are either an Armstrong fan or interested in him, this is a great read. If you are an Anti-Armstrong person, avoid this like the plague as you will think it is only propoganda..."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life by Lance Armstrong is an amazing book. After reading this book, I looked at life differently. This book teaches a human a lesson about how you have to live your life to the fullest and complete every journey through life in a positive way. I thought this book was mind-blowing, and I couldn't believe that one famous human being could have dealt with all this. After reading this book, a person learns the beauty and truth of life. It teaches a human being that cancer cannot be cured by a miracle but by an ordinary person but all they need is courage. Not only is this book sad but happy at points, the character Lance Armstrong gives humor and sorrow at the same time. Armstrong never stays in the same lane, he makes it emotional at times and then at other times he makes it adventurous. This book is so wonderful that giving it five stars is so less, not every author or writer can tell their life to everyone and reveal it, but this book let's out Lance and us out into the world too."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is probably my favorite athlete on the planet because he's won the most grueling test for human endurance 7 times. He explains how his bout with cancer changed his perspective on what is really important in life. Remind me that I never actually want to be diagnosed with cancer, because he went through hell in order to live, but I respect how he views it as a blessing. My father recently went through it this year, and I see that things have changed in him as well. I'm sending him this book as a gift for him, which I think he'll love. Everyone should read this book in order to get some form of insite on how a person who is extemely ill feels during their ordeal. Even though you only get a small glimpse into his trials, you see how it has truly changed him. It really isn't about the bike, just like it's not about the stuff we accumulate. Read this book!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For anyone who is going through the cancer journey, has a friend or loved one who is or even has in the past...this book will touch your heart and soul like nothing else has. It is someone's account of what it is like to be diagnosed, fight the battle of treatment and emotional turmoil and try to continue on with a normal life. It further explains how life after cancer is never \\"normal\\"...but maybe even better! It will make you laugh and cry and feel inspired beyond words. I loved the audio CD because I was able to listen to it in my car and finished it in 2 days..quicker than I would have if I had to sit down and find time to read a book! I loved it and if you are reading these reviews and considering it - I KNOW you will love it too!Cheers to Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book because someone close to me was diagnosed with cancer and I wanted to understand what a cancer patient could possibly go thru both physically and mentally.Wow! Lance tells his own personal cancer story with such honesty, I had phantom pains! His story is truly inspirational and that he just won his 7th consecutive Tour de France is quite frankly, miraculous! Congratulations Lance.Thanks for giving me such an insight. Your positive power of the mind should be a lesson for everyone!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I liked this book very much. The reason I chose this book was because I like watching the Tour De France and my dad wanted me to read more. The book is about Lance Armstrong's life through his child hood through his battle with cancer and through him winning the '99 tour. My favorite part of the book was when they talked about his's childhood."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"In my best professional opinion, this book will go down in history as the best books ever. I've never read a more touching story. I was brought to tears many times. I've never had the luck of experiencing cancer, first hand, and let me tell you, now I don't ever want to. This book inspired me like nothing else before. He has given me strength to overcome a number of my problems, including rickets and ADD. Without him I don't know what I'd do. I used to hate vitamin C. Now, with Lance's encouragement, its not so bad. I've read many autobiographies in my day, and none are as deep or interesting as this one. His writing style is very easy to read. This is important to someone with ADD, like me. It also makes it fun to read. This book is a good bathroom reader, which is where I do the majority of my reading. I've read this book twice so far, and I plan on reading it again. I truly love this book. Anyone can read it, not just bicycle enthusiasts. Because, as we know, its not about the bike. If you want to be taken on a journey, a journey back to life, I suggest you pick up this book. Lance Armstrong is a great writer, and I'm no slouch either. Well, I shouldn't sell myself so short. I'm a fantastic slouch. Happy reading! BEANS!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I had seen this book on the top sellers list for the past few months so I figured it had to be good. I'm not a cancer survivor nor a current patient. I picked up this book partly because I am fascinated by world class athletes but mostly because I wanted to become better aquainted with Lance Armstrong(one of the best American athletes ever).I figured that Lance would go through the entire book commenting on how he was able to survive cancer. The fact of the matter as he so brilliantly brings to life is that he is no different from so many other cancer survivors. He has no magic powers because he's a world class cyclist. He suffered like everyone else. He didn't die simply because he wasn't ready to. He must have been heeding the words of another famous cancer patient - Jim Valvano:\\"Don't give up, don't ever give up.\\" The biggest reason Lance gave for not giving up was that he was without a family (i.e. a wife and kids). This would later change with his marriage to Kristin (Kik) and birth of son Luke (through IVF).We all hear about his accomplishments at the Tour de France but there is so much more to Lance that many people don't know. Lance has grown up without knowing his biological father and like so many other athletes before him, many people could see greatness in him even before he reached his teens.This book is not solely for Cancer survivors/patients. It is the ultimate self-help book without self-help as it's primary goal. You not only learn about his struggles through Cancer and life, you learn about Lance the person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"About six mnonts ago I read It's not about the bike: My Journey back to life. Since then I have devoloped such a deep appreciation for Lance and the sport of cycling. I did not know much about Lance or cycling before I read the book, but now I feel that I truly know Lance. It is my favorite book, and Lance is my hero as a human and also as an athlete and cyclist. I think of him as such a hero. So many children and adults alike have heros because they score a lot of touchdowns or score a lot of homeruns. But it's not only about that with Lance Armstrong. It is all that he overcame and proved to everyone. He not only broke records, but he broke them as someone who went through hell on earth! In reading the book, I learned, to sum up something indescribeable, how terrible chemotherapy really is. For Lance to not only survive, but to come back and win four Tour De France races, makes him, in my eyes, and ideal hero for everyone. I would recommend this book to anyone in this world who wants a heo."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A hero is one of the most respected positions a person can be. To be a hero means to have people look up to you for help in times of trouble. Defined in the dictionary a hero is: a man of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds. Lance Armstrong is my hero and a hero to many others too. Sure he has his enemies, but are they only enemies because of jealousy? His book not only made me eye Lance in a new perspective, but the entire world opened up before me. I learned what life should be, and view my strengths and weaknesses differently. Lance is my constant motivation, and the book led me to view him in a new, better way. Before I read his book, Lance was just the guy they talked about on t.v. that won the Tour de France. Now, after seemingly getting to &quot;know&quot; him through the book, he is my hero."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What can you say? Dead man walking. To have survived advanced stage testicular cancer that had spread to his brain was a story of pain and suffering and self doubt that no one wants to endure in their lifetime. The writing style was pretty choppy, which made it sound like a jock wrote it, and I enjoyed it all the more. It was like Lance was talking to &quot;you&quot; and not some writer telling the tale third hand."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I'm a 14 year old, and Lance Armsrong is my hero. This book is about Lance's life, his fight against cancer, riding and being a good father. Anyone who loves bicycling as much as I do should love this book.

Up to his win in the Tour!I don't want to give it a way all I have to say is, Way to go Lance!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am an avid runner and a recreational biker. I understand what it takes to train and to push when you really do not feel like it.After reading this book, I was so inspired. The subject of the book makes you realize how precious every breath you take really is. This is an amazing story about an amazing man. I just kept saying over and over again, &quot;How did he do this?&quot; Where did he get the guts to come back from this? It is very hard to understand how the heck this man was able to come back and win the Tour de France after what he went through.After reading the book I vowed never to complain about running in bad weather, or blow off a run when I didn't feel well.It is truly a book you MUST read. It will help you in ways you never thought possible. This is not a story I will forget."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I like his style --- both in story-telling and life-living. His message is simple and strong. He tells us that our lives are full of challenges to overcome so we just make our mind to face it and do what we can do. On the other hand, of course, he is just a human-being like us. At first, he felt fear to face his cancer and avoided doing what he could do to prevent his cancer to ruin himself. He says in this book, &quot;I thought I knew what fear was, until I heard the words You have cancer.&quot; For him, the cancer was the real fear that he had faced. And after suffering from fear of dying of cancer, he had to get through the chemo. He says, &quot;The question was, which would the chemo kill first: the cancer, or me?&quot; The answer is clear to us because he is alive. But so to him? He says again in this book, &quot;People think of my comeback as a triumph, but in the beginning it was a disaster.&quot; Comeback to life is a problem itself. And so, what is a life? He can't be what he had been before cancer attcked him. Cancer changed everything. He has to start from the beginning. He has to re-live his life again. But he tells us that it's a wonderful experience and cancer is a part of life. Why he is so calm telling his disaster? I can answer the question, but I only hope you will read this book because he told everything in his book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is the most inspirational and entertaining you could ever find !

Obviously not a literary masterpeice, but it was nice to get the personality from Lance through his book. You can tell he is a very arogant and gruff kinda guy, but you gotta hand it to him for all hes made it through. Having been a Lance fan before I read the book, I left with some disapointment to find out some more personal opinions of Lance that I felt were a bit misguided, but hey, its not for me to judge.

I am proud to join the multitudes of others who have joined Lance's Peleton Project and Ride for the Roses cancer projects.The book is well written. It brings you to tears out of tragedy in some areas, and brings tears during some of the triumphs. I read this 280 page book in 3 days - never regretting a moment of it.If you have an interest in cycling, the Tour de France or cancer - pick up this book.

I've already written my review, but now I can add that my kiddo loved it too -- and Lance is such a hero that I was happy to share it with her. It's a great book to promote parent-child discussion -- &quot;so, what did you think about Lance's relationship with his father? His step-father?&quot; is a great opportunity for all Dads-at-a-distance (and moms too) -- and a great opportunity for single parents when the other is absent; to show a kiddo that someone else has overcome this adversity. &quot;What about his mom?&quot; &quot;What did you think about his 'homeboy', the guy who owned the local bikeshop?&quot; -- these are great questions to discuss good parenting relationships and mentors. &quot;What was different in his attitude toward other racers before, when he was good but erratic, and now that he's a great champion?&quot;This is truly a great book to read with kids, and provides wonderful character teaching lessons along the way.

It's been a little over a week since we heard the diagnosis. On that night, I was not in good shape; upon hearing about this, my good friend walked to my house and gave me the book for me to start immediately. The book holds nothing back. There are details in there regarding Chemotherapy that make one cringe, but for some odd reason I respect the honesty. Because through this honesty came a way of educating.

And I know of him now--someone who cares about the sport, and, above all, people. I did the Ride for the Roses for the first time this past April, and I will participate for sure in the future. People came from all over the nation to participate, and after reading this book, I know why. If you have a chance to take part in it (the next one is in October 2003), I suggest you do so.For someone to take time off of his professional career to take part in something he feels so strongly about, I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for this man. And if his wife and mother are 1/10th of how he describes them, wow.Go Lance-a-lot!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is a three-time winner of the Tour de France, an achievement that in itself is extremely praiseworthy. But what is amazing about Armstrong's victories is that he achieved them after recovering from cancer - at one stage the doctors had believed his chances of recovery were less than 20%. It's Not About the Bike is the story of Armstrong's life - his growing up, his riding, his becoming a father. Most of all, it is about his battle with cancer, and how it changed him for the better.Don't fear - this is not some airy-fairy new-age hope story. Armstrong is very down to earth about the whole process that he went through, and is not afraid to share details (gory, icky details). This book achieves a lot that other autobiographies miss - he drops some pretty big names and doesn't shy away from comparing himself from the greats in cycling, yet you never feel he is boasting. You get a lot of detail - what goes into chemo treatments; his wife's injection &amp; drug regime for IVF; a run through of his 1999 ride of the Tour de France - but it never feels boring or superfluous. Rather, Armstrong comes across as a guy that manages to be amazing and reassuringly normal at the same time - he likes to kick back and drink beer, he loves his Mother, he is proud of being a Dad. He just happens to be one of the greatest sports people competing today, and after reading this book you realise how hard he works to be so good.You don't need to be a cyclist to enjoy this book - while there are sections on his riding, nothing is too technical, and all cycling terms used are explained. As the title says - it's not about the bike. It is about an amazing man that went to hell and back, and made the best of the second chance he was given. I guarantee this book will manage to make you laugh, make you think and inspire you all in the same reading. And there's not much more you can ask from in a book than that."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most biographies of athletes tend to focus on their achievements on the playing field, highlighting the records they've broken, the awards they've won, the heights they've reached. But Lance Armstrong's greatest achievements have occurred away from any race course, outside of any competition. He has dealt with and surmounted more challenges in his 29 years than many encounter in a lifetime. Oh, and he happens to be one of the greatest cyclists ever, but that comes in second to what he has achieved as a human being, because as he says, it's not about the bike.Armstrong's voice is clear and honest, yet humorous and poignant as well. He tells his story in a very straightforward manner, not mincing words as he describes the brashness and cockiness of his youth and the devastating, sometimes humiliating lows of his bout with testicular cancer. His current condition makes it hard to believe that Lance Armstrong could have ever been anything other than the healthy, consummate sportsman and gentleman that he is, but his story tells us otherwise, describing a cancer that left him with an extremely low probability for survival, and nearly ended his cycling career, not to mention his ability to have children. But Armstrong has overcome all of those obstacles. Not only did he recover from the cancer (which eventually spread to his lungs and brain), he returned to cycling. And not only did he return to cycling, he won the Tour de France, the most difficult sporting event on the planet. And he did this three years in a row.This book was recommended to me by my father, an avid cyclist and cycling fan. He read it not only because Armstrong casts such an imposing presence upon the world of cycling today, but because of what he has learned about life, both on and off of the bike. You don't have to be a cycling fan to appreciate this book--it is a very human story about a very human person."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance tells us he loves speed, and the story he has to tell (and what a story it is!) moves along fast, like Lance on a bike! Every cancer survivor has a story and his is particularly harrowing, but his telling of it it makes irresistible reading because of his personal insight and total absence of self pity. Cycling fans will levitate during his chapter on the Tour."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I went into my read of this book practically worshipping this guy. His accomplishments both on and off the bike are nothing less than extraordinary. The book does have an inspirational message, but I found myself often distracted from it by a constant thread of egomania. Where there is modesty it tends to ring false. If anyone is entitled to feel good about himself it is Lance, but enough already."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is full of inspiration in creating and maintaining a meaningful and rewarding life. Lance's story of his physical and emotional struggles and triumph over them is a true motivation. I am an investment banker living and working in New York, and have a great life which at times has disappointments. I particularly found encouragement in how Lance chose to see his illness as part of his life and not as a departure point from living and enjoying his life, bicycling, family and friends.If you enjoyed this book, I recommend you read another great book called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book has facilitated a consistency in all areas of my life as being rewarding and satisfying. Both these books are full of insights into how to enjoy the uphill as well as the downhill on your bike ride, where you are the winner over the finish line of your life! ps If you like audio tapes check out the Kanes' &quot;The Roots of Satisfaction&quot; it's great."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a truly amazing novel. Lance shows no signs of being avaricious but isn't afraid to tell it like it is. The book begins talking about Lance's childhood and racing before cancer. It painfully documents his onerous battle with cancer. But the reader is rewarded at the end with a truly uplifting payoff. I enjoy this novel so much that I could not put it down. I don't recommend to children under twelve because of the cursing. It is more of an adult book. But other then that, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What a book! I defy anyone with a modicum of sensitivity to put it down willingly before getting to page 275. Lance's wonderful closeness with his mother, his resounding praises of the extensive medical team that oversaw his treatment and recovery, his description of the other riders and promoters of road cycling, his delight at his marriage and birth of his son express the essence of one fascinating young man. It doesn't take a rabid cycling fan to appreciate his recapturing of the '99 Tour de France. Masterful, Ms. Jenkins."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I wasn't prepared for the emotion that poured out of Lance Armstrong, but I was totally captivated. It is a superbly well-written book that tells a harrowing tale of authentic heroism and true bravery. I couldn't put it down and for four days, carried it with me everywhere I went, until at last I was regrettfully finished. It stayed with me long after I was through, too.He's right when he says it's not about the bike. It's also not about cancer or toughness or amazing support and courage. It's about life, and there are not many books that can say that.Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it. And next year, you'll find yourself up at 3am to watch the most fabulous sporting event on the planet--the Tour de France--and cheering on our own cowboy."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Although not a literary masterpiece, this book will leave you inspired if not teary eyed. It is easy to pass judgement and call Lance Armstrong arrogant, self absorbed and self centered(descriptions I noticed that other reviewers used to describe him) How can we truly judge anyone unless we have walked a mile in their shoes? I can't fathom how I would react to the news that I have cancer. I don't know for sure that I won't get it. I just pray I have as much strength as Lance Armstrong does. This book reminds us that we need not get cancer to truly LIVE. The only way you will be disappointed with this book is if you come with preconceived notions, and a judgemental attitude. Lance Armstrong may be an agnostic but who are we to criticize him for his beliefs. Anyway, cancer doesn't care what religion you follow."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a cyclist, and I do not follow sports or athletes on television. My fiancee is an avid cyclist with an injury that has prevented him from riding for the past 12 months, so some of the terminology in Lance's books was somewhat familiar. However, I can honestly tell you that this was one of the top books I have ever read. I do not generally read autobiographies, I generally read fiction, brain-candy type books. The only reason I read it is because my fiancee purchased it. He didn't encourage me to read it, he didn't suggest that I read it. I simply picked it up one afternoon and could not put it down. I finished this book in just a few days and I will be recommending it to many people and will be purchasing it for friends. Lance's story is so honest, raw, inspirational and real. It is incredibly well written. Thank you to Lance Armstrong for sharing his deeply personal and inspirational story with us."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"It amazes me how such a man can go from Cancer to TWO TOUR DE FRANCE WINS in a matter of 2-3 years. This book that he has written explores how he came in contact with the disease and conquers it and then doesn't think &quot; Oh i will never ride again&quot; and takes us on a journey through his eyes of his tour de france victory. This book is so Inspirational and keeps you cheering at every page you turn. This motivates me to accomplish and excel in every thing i do. Thank you Mr. Armstrong for so a wonderful book."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book was written with such simple language and words, yet the message is direct and strong. Read the words and look deep into their meanings. These are the confessions of a proud man, a fallen man, a revived man and a victorious man. Although we might not be able to associate ourselves in Lance's situation, we all can learn one lesson here : Hope and Willpower can sustain life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I am not a bike rider, but I am a cancer survivor. I really liked the positive message from this book; having cancer does change your life, and it can change it for the better. I have given this book as a gift to several friends undergoing cancer treatment as well as their family members in the hope that they will benefit from that positive message."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Like Lance's mother, I'm a single parent in Plano, Texas. I know well the streets and schools, the apartments and swimming pools and ice cream shop he talks about. I've bought bikes for my kids from the guy who gave bikes to Lance. Perhaps ghost writter Jenkins was playing up the &quot;struggle to grow up&quot; angle, but chapter two really ruined the book for me.At seventeen, Lance was racing his new Z28 Camero through the streets and had sponsors sending him on trips to compete. He cut school for 6 weeks and then pitched a hissy when the school officials told him he'd actually have to do the school work to graduate!At seventeen, my daughter doesn't cut school and drives a five year old Geo Metro back and forth to a $6 an hour job. She didn't learn how to swim at a country club, and she doesn't wear designer labels. I've personally met hundreds of Plano kids like her over the years. Many have imigrant parents with limited English; they walk and ride the bus to school, work and study hard, shop at Walmart, and nobody sponsors them but God.I see two main differences between the young Lance Armstong portraied in &quot;..About the Bike&quot; and the Plano kids I know: 1. The kids I know don't have world class VO2max, like Lance, and 2. unlike Lance, they don't constantly whine about not being treated with the deference they think they should be treated.It would be easy to write this off to the immature perspective of a teenage boy, but the city of Plano has been trying to name a park after him and have a &quot;Lance Armstrong Day&quot; for the past year. Neither Lance or his agent will return their phone calls or answer their letters."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading his amazing story. It definitely made me ride much more after I finished. I would recommend picking this book up."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"The book came very fast, but was not in the condition described.

Through this book, we could see how lives are difficult and incredible. You read Lance's story for learning about his fight with testicular cancer or to learn about training for a bike race. You can learn many new things from reading how he faces life's challenges. Also, as a mother, I learned even more from Linda, his mother and how hard she worked. She always was strong and supported Lance in everything!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Ever wondered what drives a champion? Do you liked being inspired? Then this book is for you.It would suprise even Lance Armstrong to know that he was able to win 6 Tour de France in a row. But reading his book and realizing what he does to prepare for these races. One can see the heart and dedication it takes to go from champion to legend. The book chronicles the progress of a champion cyclist and the making of a cycling legend."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"\\"It's Not About the Bike\\" is an autobiography of Lance Armstrong, a world champion cyclist, and how he dealt with cancer. Lance was born in Plano, Texas where he grew up fatherless. Consequently, his mother was a very important part of his life. As Lance went through high school he was never part of the \\"cool crowd\\". This was mainly because he didn't play football, and that was not socially acceptable. Basically, any game that consisted of a ball (basketball, baseball, ext...) he was not good at. Lance joined the swim team at the age of 12. He was so bad at swimming that he was put in the class of seven years olds. Lance as he did with most things in his life gave it his all and within a year, with the help of his coach, Chris MacCurdy, Lance became the 4th best in the state in the 1,500 meter freestyle. Lance was swimming about six miles at practice, and was riding 20 miles on the bike to get to practice and to get home, everyday. Lance enrolled in his first triathlon after he saw a sign at his school. A triathlon consisted of swimming, running and biking. Those were Lance's three strengths. Lance blew the competition out of the water. He entered every triathlon he would find. Most were with adults much older than him. He always won. He eventually moved to Russia to compete, which caused him to miss much of his schooling, forcing him to graduate somewhere else. Lance did poorly in Russia because he was a beginner racer who had no sense of pacing himself. Eventually, he was called by Chris Carmichael to be part of the U.S. Nation Cycling Team. Lance went to Europe with the team.Cancer hit Lance when he started doing well in cycling. He won a few races in Europe and was starting to make a real career in the sport. The first cancer he was diagnosed with was testicular cancer; that devastated him. He had to have his testicle removed. Following this he found out he had 11 cancerous tumors in his lungs. This was devastating for him to hear. He called up his cycling team and told them his career was over. To him, hearing those words that he had cancer in his lungs was the most devastating thing he had ever heard. He learned everything there was to know about cancer and ultimately went to Indiana to be treated. There he learned that he also had two cancerous tumors in his brain. There was one tumor right next to the vision portion of his brain and one directly over his coordination center of the brain. He had surgery to have them removed and luckily his doctor was one of the best in the world. The operation went smoothly. Lance still had tumors in his chest though, and they were growing at an amazing race. The treatment he went though was chemotherapy. Chemo was the worst thing that he had ever experienced. \\"It literally felt like fire flowing threw my veins, burning everything in it's path\\" as Lance states in \\"It's Not About the Bike\\". Chemo would be so intense that he would lose all of his hair and drop over 20 lbs. He was already in perfectly lean cut muscle before he started the treatment, and he would be known to be lying in the fetal position very often. He would vomit numerous times a day, and he often thought he was going to die. It was so intense that Lance decided to quit cycling. He thought his body couldn't' handle it. He would never be the same again. This was all untrue. Lance called this phase \\"survivorship\\" because it was how someone thinks they will never be the same after cancer. This was completely untrue. After a year or two of doing nothing, his family convinced him he needed to be back in cycling. It was where he belonged. When Lance finally did come back to cycling, he did it with a bang. He was horribly out-of-shape but he worked and worked. He would ride 7-8 hours a day on his bike. He was finally making a miraculous comeback. He ultimately won the Tour de France to complete his life dream and show everyone with cancer that there is hope for recovery, no matter how stacked the odds are against you.Lance Armstrong's autobiography was truly an amazing book to read. It moved very smoothly from topic to topic and gave a full overview of his life. It showed Lance's emotions through every phase of his life. It showed how great he felt when he first went to Russia to win his first major bike race, to his devastating feelings when cancer struck. Cancer is such a horrible thing. It is hard to imagine for someone hasn't had it. Lance did an amazing job of showing every last emotion. Lance was able to tell exactly what he was feeling throughout the whole book. I also got a taste of Lance's gut wrenching character though the entire book.The book did have some minor negative points though, don't get me wrong, they took no joy away from reading it. The only thing I did not enjoy was how it got graphic in some points of the book. Although it might not be pleasing to hear about a person's battle with cancer, it is the honest truth. Some of the things that happened to his body, like vomiting, are sad and gross, but a reality. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone. It was enjoyable and always kept my attention."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"No doubt this is one of the best biographies I have ever read.

In this book Lance is a real lance, even his name is very similar to his success.Lance had a lot of endurance to fight the life, the cancer, and the chemotherapy. Really he was lucky in his life when he was saved from the death, from the cancer and got his life back again. He is lucky when he has a mother like Linda, when he has a friend like Bill, when he has a doctor like Nichols. Rarely, we know people like that.When you read this book, you know that, there are champions around the world make a surviving thing over the history, like Lance Armstrong.

Lance Armstrong, a great figure of cycling, had to deal with all the consequences that this disease brought. It's so terrible to know that meanwhile he was a healthy man everybody wanted to sign a millionaire contract with him, but after his sponsors knew he had cancer, they didn't want to know anything about him. Was this fair? No, I think it wasn't.But Lance wasn't alone. In this world there were so many good people that were able to help Lance. To mention some of them, Bill Stapleton, who always tried to understand Lance when because of his frustrations he became bad-tempered. Dr. Craig Nichols, and Dr. Shapiro, because they showed they loved their career and they gave the best of them to cure Lance. I think this was a wonderful experience for Lance to be surrounded by good friends and good professional people.Lance Armstrong had had a good example from his mother. She had taught him always to see every \\"obstacle as an opportunity\\". I believe these positive thoughts helped Lance to deal with the adversities he has found in his long path.All what I can say to Lance is: GO AHEAD BOY!

When he got testicular cancer, how you can imagine he didn't believe the doctor's diagnoses and try to get different doctors opinions and they were always the same \\"cancer\\", When he realize the truth his life became different to him, he knew that he wasn't the person he thought and he could really know that life it's more than the race; the bicycle; and any material thing he had and he realize his life wasn't only about the bike, was a race to life.I want to encourage you to read this book because it can make a big difference in someone life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Even for me, someone who wasnt into the sport of Bicyling- It was so intereting from start to finish.

Sports fans would enjoy this book, anyone who has been touched by cancer would enjoy this book, and anyone who has had to overcome great odds would enjoy this book.Lance Armstrong accomplished probably one of the greatest comebacks in sports history, winning the Tour De France three years in a row, after surviving cancer. His descriptions of his races were very entertaining. As a young kid Lance was a striving athlete. He won all the races, and events he entered in. He was a swimmer, a runner, and a biker; he even did all three, a triathlon. He did all of that despite many odds. He won the Tour De France despite many odds, one being cancer. Cancer destroyed Lance's sports life. He rebounded from his cancer and returned to his sports as a better athlete, but also a better person. Lance inspires the reader to do the very best they can at everything they do. \\"Make an obstacle an opportunity, make a negative a positive.\\" Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is one of those books you could go on and on about. &quot;It's Not About The Bike&quot; Exemplifes all that an inspirational story should be.

Lance Armstrong's autobiography is for all readers, it is not discriminatory to any walk of life. I would suggest this book to anyone, no matter the type of reader they are. The writing allows the reader to just flow through the entire book without even knowing that the hours are flying by, becuase that is exactly what happens-I picked up the book thinking that I would get a good start on it and before I knew it I had finished it.The Book is divided into eleven sections or chapters. Every chapter deals with a different perspective of Lance's life. The majority of it is devoted to cancer and it's effect on his life and the ones around him. This book is well written all of the way through especially the sections that deal with cancer. The detail that he goes into will make anyone realize the severity of cancer. At the same time, he never writes too graphic or too detailed, so as to keep the reader interested. Along with doing an excellent job describing his experiences with cancer he also describes cycling extremely well. Going into this book my knowledge on cycling was limited, after finishing this book I feel like I have a better grasp of the sport and find myself looking for anything that will tell me more about cycling. Lance Armstrong begins the book with a \\"Before and After\\" chapter that explains the diagnosis of his cancer. This is a wonderful explanation of his life changing experience with this death sentence of cancer. Following the introduction chapter Armstrong explains his cycling career and this is what allows the reader to really understand the kind of person he was,the hated American athlete with a huge ego in an European based sport, before the cancer and how he changed his ways into those of a wonderful humanbeing that anyone could consider their best friend following his diagnosis.My overall view of the book is that it is very well written and keeps the readers attention. Throughout reading it I felt as though I was watching a made for television movie based on a true story. This book will hook the unsuspecting athletic fan and turn them into a supporter of cancer patients. It will also hook the reader who picks it up to read about cancer and turn them into a cyclist fan. No matter who the reader, at the end you will be a Lance Armstrong fan."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a excellent book. I read it while training to ride my first century bike ride in Claxton, Georgia. What a incrediable man Lance is. What a inspiration for me to keep riding, keep training. This was a book I could not put down. A friend who is a speed reader read the book on our flight from California to Flordia. It is worth the read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For not being a cyclist, father (or a man for that matter), or cancer survivor, it was remarkable how involved I was in this story. It is an excellent display of human courage and strength. I am now definitly a huge fan of Lance's. It is an excelent story!!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"He might have lied about doping but he didn't lie about surviving cancer or about what he went through. I know because I've been through it. However, if you can't over look the cycling parts in exchange for his will to win at everything including cance, then it might not be for you."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong book, is an amazing book. It tells about his life and how he overcame adversity to become the champion cyclist he is today, but it also tells what he went through to survive cancer. He provides incite into a sport most people don't know or understand and makes it easy for non cyclist readers to grasp the fullness of the sport. Its about how his mentality changed almost instantly after the realization he had cancer.Early in the book he talked about turning negatives into positives and that line really stuck with me. Then he went on to say how cancer was the best thing that had happened to him, because it opened his eyes. Most people would not imagine cancer as something good let alone the best thing in their life, but that's because, like he said \\"I saw more beauty and triumph in one day than I ever saw in a bike race.\\". He opens up this extremely sensitive part of his private life to the public to show that even when the odds seem down you can still make it back and win, and that's not just in a cycling race.This is one of the best books I've ever read. The book is not about telling a story in the most poetic language but it gives you the truth strait and you wont want to put it down till you've reached the back cover. I'm glad its popular because it could really help someone trying to cope with a life changing disease. It can also inspire and motivate you to go out and give everything you've got to win something you desperately want.I highly recommend buying and reading this book. You will probably find yourself reading it more than once and it might even inspire you to go out and change something in your life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A riveting quick read, that can make a reader think.Before I read &quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; I knew virtually nothing about the sport of Cycling. This sport is definitely one of the more physically grueling and mentally demanding. Mainly because of the lengthy races, and the lengthy training time required to compete at the professional level.A dedicated hard working athlete that trained relentlessly, Armstrong also had a genetic advantage, like most world champion athletes: he has enormously high levels of VO-2, which is the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the body from the lungs. He also produces extremely low levels of Lactic Acid, which is the natural chemical in our body that causes a burning sensation in our muscles when we exert them strenuously (Spaghetti legs and burning, for example). That is why when many of the world's top cyclists were burning out at the end of a race, Armstrong could charge up a long and steep hill to overtake them, or strategically sprint to the end.Some of the Cycling lingo a reader will learn: pulling, Peloton, sitting on someone's wheel, fricking, dafting, &quot;Give an inch, gain a friend,&quot; and &quot;bonking out.&quot;To train for events and stay in tip-top shape a cyclist has to obviously ride a lot. 6 hours straight, at times. Getting run off of the road in Texas by a Ford F-250, crashing onto the pavement, and getting actually hit by cars happened to Armstrong several times. I could relate to him tell how he shook his fist and middle-finger at a passing vehicle as he lay on the ground, gravel embedded in him, with his bike on top of him. Crashes will happen, and one of the most dangerous parts of a race are the descents. Racers go at high speeds, through hair-pin curves. I slight error can mean serious injury, or even death, as one team member of Armstrong fractured the back of his skull and neck.Cycling was significant but not exclusive part in this this book about Lance Armstrong's life. He shared a lot about his private and personal beliefs, fears, tragedies and triumphs. I liked the fact that this auto-biography didn't paint just the pretty pictures that most auto-bios do (after, these people are writing about themselves). Armstrong often candidly provided the reader with interesting little things about him, as well as his thoughts and feeling about issues, both big and small. This info. on the little stuff is what I am often most curious about. Armstrong is a Gen Xer, and this is evident throughout the book. Quoting from the movie &quot;Goodwill Hunting,&quot; Armstrong has a favorite quote from a dialog between Matt Damon and a Harvard preppy after they have an intellectual debate. This quote means a lot to Armstrong, and he applies it to his life:&quot;You like apples?&quot;&quot;Yeah, I like apples.&quot;&quot;I just got her phone number. How do you like them apples?&quot;As for the sport the reader will learn the tactics, strategies, and politics of Cycling. Like any popular and lucrative sport with many athletes participating and dedicated fans involved, there is hard-core and fierce, competition. In Italy, some local fans were so unsettled with the fact that an American was beating their favorite son (Armstrong in the lead), they threw tacks onto the road hoping to pop Armstrong's tire. In another incident, a person sprayed pepper spray into the Peloton (pack of racers), causing some riders not to be able to finish the race.CANCER &amp; CHEMO:When he began to feel pain and have diminished energy he thought it was just another part of being sore from training and racing, because soreness and pain came with the extremely demanding physical training. After going to the doctor he learns out of the blue that he has a terrible prognosis. He is knocking at death's door. The cancer had spread to his lungs and his brain. 24 years old. A world-class athlete. Facing death.Lance takes us through his fight and the reader will learn a lot about the disease, what it does, and what is used to fight it. After he beat Cancer with a combination of foods and 4 cycles of Chemo therapy, he recovered, then returned to training. The cancer and it's destructive effect made me cringe and Armstrong described the chemicals, methods, and side-effects of chemotherapy.Caner: up close and personal. What it does to your body. How it kills. How Chemo kills you, and how it kills cancer. What is it like to look death in the face? Everyday. Most of us have not experienced this.Another scary scenario was that when he was diagnosed with Cancer and was to begin treatment to save his life, his insurance company refused to pay. He technically had no health insurance, even though he had had medical insurance (he was switching jobs and there was contractual &quot;fine print&quot;). Only in America.After he beat the odds, he got back into Cycling: Victories started to come again. Armstrong eventually triumphed in the Tour De France, the most demanding of all Cycling competitions. People had wrote him off as dead. When he returned to Cycling, some previous sponsors would not even tough him. They thought he was finished.After Armstrong's success, funny, that the French media began spurring rumors and unfounded allegations that Armstrong was taking performance enhancers, without having any proof at all. In fact, Armstrong was one of the very few Cyclists to live and train in France, which has the most comprehensive drug testing laws regarding athletes in all of Europe, while other riders trained elsewhere, avoided the possibility of random tests. Yet, the French media had to start false rumors.Armstrong noted the suburban isolation of the &quot;soul-deadened&quot; alienation of the suburb, Plano, Texas. Home to wealthy polo shirt wearing country-club members, yet Plano has one of the highest rates of teen heroin addiction and teen suicide in the U.S.&quot;It's Not About The Bike,&quot; will make you think...."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This was easily the best book I have ever read. You honestly do not have to know anything about biking or even like the sport. This book is about way more. You feel simpathetic and have a great respect for Lance Armstrong after reading it. It is amazing what all he went through and what is even more amazing is how he survied it all. I highly recomend this book to everyone that can read. Your whole life prospective will change after reading it. It is a must have"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I didn't expect to finish this in a mere 24 hour time period and I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I know virtually nothing about pro bike racing except that I've heard of Lance, obviously.Reading the book, you can just picture exactly what Lance is like. He reminds me of an irritating stubborn brother, but one you can't help but love and admire. It seems hard to imagine, but he explains how cancer was something POSITIVE that happened to him. You have to read the book to understand what he's talking about.The book has also made me more likely to watch the Tour de France next year. I never knew it's such a chess game and so grueling!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's book truly isn't about the bike, it is about life, family, cancer, courage, compassion, fear, commitment, and a host of trials, tribulations and successes. It is an inside look at the man who won the Tour de France and the challenges and obstacles that he had to overcome. The book is well worth reading, even if some of Armstrong's comments do appear to be somewhat on the macho side.From his youth to his recovery from testicular cancer, this is the story of a man whose greatest victory was not in a bicycle race but in the battle for his life. The majority of the book deals with his fight against cancer, and throughout the book, the reader will marvel at his courage, emotional strength and unwavering family support. For anyone who has cancer, this book will, no doubt, be inspiring; however, those who have escaped this horrific disease will benefit from the lessons learned. They will realize that life takes on a new meaning. One has a deeper understanding of how important it is to live each and every day to the fullest, to appreciate the simple things in life - a beautiful sunset, the smile of a child, the touch of a gentle hand, and the importance of living for today and doing whatever good one can possibly do, for tomorrow belongs to no one."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"An interesting book about the simple life of a sportsman fighter.His cancer ,pain ,fight,love and anguish.Easy to read its a good reading for young people who have there projects of life."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"What an exceptional biography. There is nothing this book witheld. I read it quickly and cherished every moment. I cried, and cheered and laughed, and I was proud to be an American and a Texan. What courage and determination this young man portrays. I feel like I know him; like he's my friend. A remarkable story indeed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong is sure to inspire anyone who reads this book. He beat the odds, not only to survive, but to win the Tour De France. This tells of his hardships and ultimate triumph. Being struck with cancer, he wasn't expected to live, but pure dedication and the love and support of his family and friends got him through it. This story is one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"For most people, giving them some paper and a typewriter is like giving them rope to hang themselves with. And this book is an excellent example. Lance Armstrong wastes no time in demonstrating his staggering vulgarity and total self-absorption.Apparently, rather than tax himself with the task of being a good person - something that seems not even to have penetrated the outer edges of the universe of his ideas - Armstrong considers himself to have made a compelling case for greatness simply by being a good cyclist. And apparently many, many readers cannot see anything wrong with Armstrong's narcissistic totalitarianism and in fact drink it down like water. You want the book boiled down for you? Lance Armstrong is a piece of ... who happens to ride a bike."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I FOUND HIS STORY TO BE VERY TOUCHING AND ONE THAT IN A WAY I CAN RELATE TO. I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH MANY OF THE EMOTIONS EXPRESSED IN THE BOOK."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I never knew about Lance Armstrong until I read his book. Lance survived cancer not because he was strong physically or spiritually, but because it was made to be so.His book taught us how to fight the negativity in our lives. He fights the good fight and afterward the Light shines upon his head. Human beings don't like to suffer, but sometimes it's good to have this kind of experience.I believe everyone of us experienced some kind of problem. If it's not sickness, it can be a friend or a member of your family who is trying to harm you. At this point, you need to have 1) faith, 2) self confidence, and 3) courage to face whatever obstacles that happen in life.Lance is a world class champion in biking, but now he has become one of the best humanists in the world.All human beings are scared of death. Who knows? Life might be better over there, where there is no jealousy, no envy, no enemy, no hatred."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I think this is one of the most amazing book about one og cycling's living legends. Definitely a must read for all cycling fanatics. Two Thumbs UP"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Great read! Sally Jenkins style of writing Lance's story is wonderful. Makes you want to become a better person and set new goals."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book shows you in 288 pages what life is all about."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"As an autobiography, Lance's story is one of the best that I've read, although he plays a little fast and loose with the facts regarding bike racing and his career. I found a few inaccuracies, (such as when he stated he won the 1995 Clasica San Sebastian before the 1995 Tour, when in reality the Spanish race is in August or September, while the Tour de France takes place in July).These minor inaccuracies do nothing to detract from the far more powerful and more important part of his story, which is his struggle with testicular cancer, how he met and married his wife, and fathered a child, in addition to overcoming his disease and callous French employers and journalists who first thought he was finished as a professional cyclist, and when he proved that he wasn't, accused him of using drugs. Lance overcame all of these to win the 1999 Tour de France, 10 years after Greg LeMond's (the only other American to win the Tour) own incredible comeback after being shot and nearly losing his life in a hunting accident.Like the title says, &quot;It's not about the bike.&quot; This story should prove to be inspiring not only for bike riders and racers, but for cancer patients and anyone who has overcome ultimate adversity to achieve a dream."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I got this book for inspiration from a high-visibility athelete. I thought it would be interesting to read about Armstrong as a top representative of the athletic commmunity and a cancer survivor. Armstrong testified to his early problem childhood which I can understand. Frankly, though, I am glad he wasn't a neighbor! As I read along, I was hoping that his cancer experience and the blessing he had with remission would show in a changed person, somebody I would want to see emumlated in others and someone better for himself and his family/friends; someone who had truly changed and was thankful to the Almighty that he had gotten a second chance. He certainly had plenty of time and money to spend thinking about life. I waited and waited and finally gave up midway through the chapter on the Tour. His language was foul before and after his cancer and I wouldn't want a young person to read some of this stuff. I gave up when he added his own foul-mouthed enhancement to Matt Damon's answer to &quot;Do You Like Apples?&quot; in that chapter. This book could have been so much more to inspire those beseiged with cancer and for amateur athletes. Instead, it is a self-serving testimony of a boy high on himself."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"One of the most amazing books I've ever read. Once you begin, you can't stop. An excelent opportunity to rethink your problems and focus on the good side of things."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Prior to this book, I didn't know much about Lance Armstrong. I admire Lance's will to beat cancer and to live; However, he is a selfish and arrogant man and at times I found his attitude distasteful. Having said that, I did find this book enjoyable and learned a little something about cycling. Worth a read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most inspirational book I have read in a long time. It made all of my problems dissapear along with all of my aches and pains. The pain Lance went through in winning 7 Tour de France paled into insignificant compared to the pain of his treatment for testicular cancer."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong shows us the entire range of his incredible life: stratospheric places where mere mortals cannot tread -- inside a peloton in the Tour de France -- and tortuous places -- the carpet inches away from his face --- where near-fatal levels of chemotherapy toxins force him to crawl to a bathroom sink to cough up blood. The levels of courage and generosity Lance shows are stupefying. This individual who defines excellence in a superhuman arena writes an entire book to say that it is neither his genetic heritage nor his good fortune nor his bad fortune that he has chosen to define his life. Rather it is his conviction that his life is his own, that plain incremental action is the tool to achieve that life, and it is his actions that define it. Author Philip Gourevitch in the July 1993 issue of Harper's says,&quot;The absolute ...is a treacherous place to seek lessons. By definition, it does not yield. Like the God of Exodus, it is what it is and it shall be what it shall be. For that reason, the absolute is useless as metaphor. It is incomparable.&quot;Cancer is an incomparable occurrence in anyone's life, as nonsensical as an asteroid strike. There is no way to compare it by any standard of fairness, humanity, or reason. But there is great value in adapting, growing and becoming stronger. Lance says that in the face of adversity, the concept of acting heroically and the strategy of plea bargaining soon resonate with the thud of pewter. Simple, definitive action gets the job done. Los Angeles psychiatrist Robert J. Elstad says, &quot;We experience ourselves by what we do.&quot; Lance Armstrong says, &quot;Move.&quot; A fascinating glimpse into the life of an excellent member of our species."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This is a winner. Lance brings you through every aspect of his thoughts and feelings. I could not put this book down. If you are not touched by what he has to say, then you must be dead. What a great read."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I just finished this book and I can honestly say that I have not been so emotionally moved by any other book. Of course I am a huge LA fan but this book will take you through emotions comparable to the ascents and descents of the Alps and Pyrennes encountered in the Tour de France. Bold and matter of fact writing that keeps you interested from cover to cover. Great insight into two of the most brutal struggles put to man-the Tour de France and cancer. As the book says,&quot;VIVA LANCE!&quot;"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"just an amazing book. Lance's battle and story he has to tell is just amazing. A must for any cyclist or anyone interested in bike racing, and learning about Lance Armstrong"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought the book on a Friday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon. Each chapter presents a new stage and an identifiable struggle, which is every bit as tangible as the challenges life serves us, even to given athletes. By the end, you will have experienced the struggle and may even taste a bit of the success brought by the '99 Tour De France rider, Lance Armstrong."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I read this book in one day. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It WASN'T just about the bike-- it was about Lance's struggles--his trials and tribulations as a person. I truly hope Lance Armstrong wins again on the bike, and continues to &quot;win&quot; in life. I recommend this book! I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"A well-written, compelling human interest story. I'm an avid cyclist; my wife is not. But we both devoured the book in one weekend. Long-time fans of Lance will appreciate the insights into his life both on and off the bike. Those who know nothing about bicycle racing will get a very readable introduction to a great sport. And anyone who knows and loves someone with cancer will appreciate the warm and human portrayal of those who face this all-too-common disease with courage and hope. This is a great book for anyone."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I bought this book mainly because I am an avid cyclist myself and follow professional cycling very closely. But true to the title, this book is not about the bike. And it is so much better for it.I found myself deeply moved by this book. I read the entire thing from cover to cover in a matter of hours. I got it in the mail around noon and couldn't put it down. I finished before I went to bed.The frank honesty and candor with which Lance describes and chronicals his disease and recovery are amazing. I can only imagine the pain and endurance it took for him to go back and relive the events of the last four years, to put them all in print. Much less the courage to invite all of us in to share and take part in it with him.I can't say just how strongly I recommend this book. Lance is an exceptional athelete, but more important he is the face of courage and strength in an abyss of insurmountable adversity. The inspiration and insight he offers are priceless."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance is a mystery to most americans who only idolize winners. In Europe, where they know cycling, he is almost universally disliked, not just because he is a doper, but because it reallyis about the bike, and his own personal fame.This book is an \\"I love Lance book\\" written by Lance! Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Touching story of beating the odds. A man, his mom, his bike, his friends, his health, his family.Armstrong matures as cyclist to world fame in France, and matures as human with epic battle with cancer.Life is precious commodity that at times we all take for granted. Lance still wrestles with the mystery of it all, not grasping its entirety, yet celebrating what comes next on the road, pumping as fast and hard as he can toward its finish line.Captivating background of his past. Especially important moment came when he lost his first pro event. His coach Carmichael had this monumental words for him: \\"Lance, you are going to learn more from that experience than any other race in your whole life.\\"Learn well, this man does. Obstacle after obstacle he pedals, over, through, around. Absence of father, youth, inexperience, cancer, comeback, new husband, fathering.He's a winner. Still yearn for him to meet the mystery to life, the one who has overcame the race we each must conquer: physical death. A great book by a leading cancer doctor: \\"Measuring Our Days\\" speaks of this doctor's experience with terminal cancer and death. He wishes someone could relate to him who has gone through and conquered it. Amazingly someone has! Jesus of Nazareth! The mystery and wonder and awe of it all! Lance is close, but not there yet. Would that the Spirit would grab him."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I simply could not put this book down. I stayed up until the wee hours following Lance's childhood adventures, his preliminary successes, his youthful brashness, his discovery and struggle with testicular cancer and his long road to recovery. Every part of the narrative is gripping -- his struggle with cancer (he was one of the most severe cases the doctors had ever seen) is brutally described from the chemo \\"poison\\" to the horrible catheter which practically became a part of his body. Although he doesn't lionize himself, his struggle and conquest has to be an inspiration for all who have suffered with the disease. I love biking too (although for me an hour is a long ride -- Lance says real bikers don't bother to take out there bikes if it's for under 5 hours) so I loved the descriptions of his training and races, particularly his focus on climbing mountain after mountain in the freezing rain to prepare for the Tour de France.In short, this book will give anyone an appreciation for athletic endeavors, but more important for the human spirit. We are spared no details of the medical horrors - a soberting account. Plus, I worship his wife Kik after reading how she dealt with all the various moves and life events. She's even more of a hero at times than Mr. Armstrong proving the maxim that behind every great man is a great woman."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"I have melanoma and bought this book with an eye toward my own issues. Unlike dozens of other books that have been given to me or purchased, this one &quot;tells it like it is.&quot; It was great! Lance Armstrong has an amazing ability to capture the essence of the experience, whether bike riding or cancer. I found myself re-reading passages to help me clarify my own thinking. I am very grateful that this book exists."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Lance Armstrong's biography is one of the best told stories, and most exciting, that I have ever read. It starts out with the chapter \\"before and After\\", this chapter tells about the basis of his life as a star athlete and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He then goes on to tell about his childhood and his gimped family. He grew up without a father, and with a young, not so wealthy mom. He tells about his struggles as a kid and how his mom was always there for him. He also tells how he came by his first racing bike and the triathlons he was in with it. He talks about his first races and how inexprienced he was. When he became more exprienced, he started to win some races then he started to win almost all of his races.His career was very successful, although he was very young. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 25, on October the second. His testicular cancer wasn't just in his testicle, it had spread into his lungs and his brain. While reading about the Chemotherapy treatments he had to undergo, I felt as if though I could relate to him. He told about how scary it was to go through with his brain and testicle surgeries, and how hard it was to be sterile. After he was done with his treatments, he met and married a girl named \\"Kik\\". She was there when he was planning to race in the \\"Tour De France\\". He wrote about his training and his struggle to get on a team. It was very exciting to read about him winning the tour. Lance Armstrong then had a son with Kik, and proceeded to race in the next years Tour De France, which he won again. He then took the Bronze in the 2000 summer olympics.Lance Armstrong tells his story so well, I could imagine every situation he was writing about. He describes things in a way that readers can really understand him. And he doesn't describe anything too much so that the reader would get bored. He writes with inspiration for those who ever were against odds. If the reader has cancer, I believe this book is perfect for them. Even if the reader is a normal everyday person this book shows us how to appreciate and live life to the fullest. If I learned one thing from this book its to never give up. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been against the odds."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"just finished the book. i could not put it down. i am a cycling fan and the in depth portrayal blew away my romanticism about the tour de france. i am also striving like most people to be a decent human being. lance's sbook does not hold out on the truth. he is honest and factual about life and the struggle we all endure. i am sure i am not alone in feeling humbled by this amazing man's survival against the odds. i feel i have a duty much to the publishers horror, to pass this book on to the next needy soul i meet. we all need a lance armstrong in this world. he is an extraordinary human being with an extraordinary story."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a tour de France, I mean, a tour de force. While reading, it was like he was right there talking to me. I enjoyed the book so much that when it ended I felt sad that I would no longer be able to listen to Lance speaking to me. His last sentence was like poetry: \\"I keep riding, into the highest peering hills...\\" I know nothing about biking, but his descriptions made it fascinating. And his description of his battle with cancer held me glued to the book. What a nice experience to be able to spend time with this great man! Thank you, Gutenberg."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is truly interesting and inspirational. I picked it up one Saturday evening and was finished by Monday morning. Armstrong's honesty is refreshing and, at times, shocking as he tells the story of his past, his fight with cancer, the grueling road to recovery, and his many journies. He captured my attention and my heart as he described his rides through the European mountansides, US plains, his love, marriage, and fear of never being able to ride again. A must read for all who need a pick me up, or a reminder of how wonderful and fragile this life is. Guaranteed to please!"},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"This book is a definite page-turner that starts with his childhood through his first victory at the Tour de France. I now feel a renewed sense of admiration for the sport of cycling, which has been marred by blood doping and other scandals. To read a book about someone who was nearing the top of his sport before being stricken down and then coming back to reach a higher level of performance will certainly inspire hope and growth in its readers in some way or another."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Unbelievable story. I have so much respect for what he went through and has accomplished. I did not put this down. I don't follow the sport, and this book is so much more than your usual athlete autobiography."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Most people know little about the world of competitive cycling. Few of us can say the same about cancer. In this book you can learn a little about both. While Charles Barkley thankfully tells us that he is not a role model, Lance Armstrong thankfully embraces the opportunity. This is not the book for you if you are looking for lots of details about cycling. It is the book for you if you want to read about the struggles and triumphs of an individual who happens to be the world's best cyclist. Something to think about while I ride in the rain."},{"Title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Read this book. I don't care if you know nothing or could care less about bike racing. This is one inspiring book. If you don't laugh, and cry, while reading this, you are not human.We all know the story--Lance rides bikes. Lance gets cancer. Lance whips cancer and wins not one, not two, but three (and counting...) Tour De France's.You need no understanding or knowledge of bicycle racing to appreciate this book. Lance is a true American hero, and you OWE it to yourself to read this book. I promise you that you'll finish it in two days and after that, you will find your ears perking up any time you hear the words &quot;Lance Armstrong&quot;.I've loaned this book to more people than any other book I own. Without fail, it's returned to me with a comment like &quot;Unbelievable&quot;, &quot;Incredible&quot;, or just a smile with a tear in the eye.Read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Dream Mistress","review":"An excellent story. Simply that. The dream mistress is about sleeping beauty, only in a different touch. Jenny Diksi has created a wonderful new look at what we normaly think, and does so with such skill. One of my very favorite authors, and one of my favorite books. Definately a talent worth knowing/reading."},{"Title":"Dream Mistress","review":"Floating sometimes inscrutably between the life of a young clothing designer damaged by her turbulent childhood and the life of an old homeless woman clinging to anonymity, this book develops the reader's curiosity but never delivers. Each of the storylines revolves around a romantic love relationship, and the reader finds herself entwined in the parallel plots despite their occasional obtuseness. Though the ride is entertaining, the climax never materializes and the ending leaves the reader disappointed and bitter."},{"Title":"Kitchens: Your Guide to Planning and Remodeling","review":"If you are beginning to think about remodeling your kitchen, read this book first! This book takes you through the basic steps of redesigning your kitchen, covering options for design, layout, storage, and appliances. The kitchens pictured are stunning, and run the gamut from Parade of Homes/celebrity level to actually affordable.I was able to see some wonderful options that are realistic, along with a couple dream items I may splurge on. While I have bought other design books and magazines since, this is still my favorite. It made me excited about remodeling!"},{"Title":"Kitchens: Your Guide to Planning and Remodeling","review":"I used this book to plan my own kitchen and it helped me avoid mistakes. I was very tight on space in my kitchen/dining area, therefore every inch counted. It gives great guidelines for minimum space requirements. For example, it tells you how much space is needed between a wall and a table; how much space is necessary for each person at a table; how much countertop space should be left by the refrigerator or near the cooktop; how wide an island should be; how much space is necessary for the aisle in a kitchen so 2 people can work, etc.Also included is assessing your needs and taking an inventory of your current kitchen which I found useful.Other sections such as choosing fixtures and appliances or selecting materials weren't as beneficial to me personally, but overall I would highly recommend this book to someone planning their own kitchen - it gives some good solid guidelines and things to consider when planning a kitchen."},{"Title":"Galapagos,: World's end","review":"In anticipation of a forthcoming trip to the Galapagos a visit to the local library turned up this 1924 book by Wm Beebe. Somewhat to my astonishment, the book captivated me. Wm Beebe (1877-1962) was not (as I heretofore had thought) merely a one-dimensioned, deep sea explorer. World traveler, naturalist, director of the NY Zoological Society -- he wrote books ranging from birding to jungle exploration. Beebe turns out to have been an early 20th century Loren Eiseley. This book records a 1923 trip undertaken by fourteen scientists from New York to the Galapagos in a steam power yacht, provided by a wealthy patron. They were later to learn that it was more suited to ladies &quot;sipping tea&quot; than oceanic cruising. They discovered to their astonishment that it was &quot;neither an inexhaustible reservoir of fresh water, nor a floating coal mine&quot;. They had to cut short their Galapagos collecting and beat an unplanned retreat to Panama for more provisions. Beebe is a very readable author, with many a well turned phrase sprinkled thru the book. He describes the ocean voyage as, &quot;... driving a momentary wedge thru sunshine, wind, and water...&quot; Later, in a small boat, going ashore in the Galapagos, he describes the gentle swell &quot;...which rose and fell as if the Pacific were breathing quietly and regularly.&quot; Accordingly, when it came time to jump, he appropriately waited for the ocean to &quot;exhale&quot;. He finds both comfort and wonder in contemplating the Darwinian explanation of all he sees. For Beebe, there is an &quot;honour of being one with all about me and in a small way to have at least an understanding...&quot; He marvels, for example, in picking up a crustacean's shell, that having parted ways uncountable millions of years previously, now, quite by accident, they cross again. Beebe deplores both the early sailing depredations of the tortises and the wholesale slaughter of animals by previous scientific expeditions (how many flightless cormorants do you need to get an accurate description?). This expedition restricts themselves to capturing various specimens, which they hauled back to the NYC Zoo. They also took back sacks full of lava rocks, sand, plants, etc with which to make scenic dioramas in the AM Museum of NH. On page 265 one comes across the single most arresting observation in this book. As usual, profundity lies hidden in the details. It seems that Beebe &quot;secured&quot; (his euphimism for collecting) several specimens of different Darwin finches on Daphne, and found to his astonishment that their crops all contained identical food items, despite their differing bill shapes. All, even the heavy beaked birds, for exaple had uncrushed seeds in their crops. He repeated this observations several times, always with the same results. So there is more to the oft repeated, now almost cannonical evolutionary explanation of the differing finch beaks. The various finches are all eating the same things! Natural selection provides what appears to be a reasonable hypothesis to explain the various beaks, but what is really going on? I can think of no less than four explanations, but that is another tale.

I hope the text worth it."},{"Title":"Galapagos,: World's end","review":"William Beebe's Galapagos: World's End was published in 1924, so it it is certainly not a substitute for more recent books such as Michael H. Jackson's Galapagos: A Natural History, Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch, Oxford and Watkins's Galapagos: Both Sides of the Coin, Jonathan Green's Galapagos: Ocean, Earth, Wind & Fire, or Tui de Roy's Spectacular Galapagos. However, Beebe's book contains a wealth of information about the history of the Galapagos, particularly that of the various pirates and privateers who used it as a base of operations, and of Porter's operations against the British whaling fleet during the War of 1812. Beebe's descriptions of what land exploration was like on the Galapagos back in those days(very, very rough) made me very appreciative of the excellent work Ecuador has done in making these fascinating islands readily accessible to elderly and creaky folks like me. I was quite interested to note the changes in our understanding of the biology and geology of these islands that have taken place between the time the book was written (1924) and the present; science, like life, evolves. The technologies of photography and photographic reproduction have also evolved, fortunately; some of the old black and white photographs reproduced in Beebe's book are almost unrecognizable.Beebe visited the Galapagos long before they became a 'must see' holy site for those of us interested in geology and evolutionary biology; at that time a visit to the Galapagos was a major expedition requiring lots of money, a steam yacht, and lots of planning--definitely not a jaunt for a casual tourist. So, while he describes in some detail the devastating environmental impacts of pirates and privateers, whalers, rats, goats, and other exotic invaders, he makes no mention of the environmental impacts one might expect from large-scale tourism on these fragile islands. As a recent visitor, I must compliment Ecuador on its efforts to protect and preserve these islands while simultaneously allowing those of us who find them fascinating to make our visits.If you are interested in the Galapagos or are actually planning a visit, Beebe's book definitely should be on your reading list, along with more current material."},{"Title":"Missing Pieces: A Coroner's Companion","review":"At the end of her new book of poetry, Missing Pieces: A Coroner's Companion, Kathryn Rantala presents the reader with an important coda. It is nothing less than a legend to the central theme of her work, both poetry and prose, in Missing Pieces. What, she asks the reader, is left when the corporeal body is cut off from youth, from love and from the physical plane? A fragment of what once was, fractured into parts and left like clues at a crime scene waiting to be photographed, cataloged and put into plastic evidence bags, is the answer Rantala holds out. Once these elements are processed the story they tell is splintered. Reconstruction is necessary if the pieces are ever to achieve entirety again. That job lies with \\"The Face Finder\\" who concludes Ms. Rantala's collection:Reflection on a larger sense of components. The hard and soft and missing, altogether. Reflection on the value of fragments found, whatever those fragments are taken to be: reproducible, unlikely, fey or impossibly hard to read.The reader is asked to supply the missing pieces of these \\"poem fragments\\", \\"all clinically considered along with the intrusion of those other elements: the intimacy of the random, the distance at which it absorbs, the sense that the indeterminate is safe and, always, the small reminding tokens of the familiar.\\" The poetry and prose has a leanness and an \\"intimacy of the random\\" that is befitting the subject matter. The last stanza of \\"Danger,\\" a poem about the assault of a young girl, is an excellent example of the power her sparse lines generate:Some of the things in the garden at the backs of the buildings grow forever: blackberries, glories and moss. Some local varieties of these can be identified and controlled.Rantala includes pictures taken from the archives of the Seattle Washington Medical Examiner's Office, dating from 1938-1944, as, \\"small reminding tokens of the familiar.\\" The pictures she includes are mundane pieces, not horrific pictures of bodies or graphic displays of crime scenes, and are designed to evoke visual fragmentation as a counterpoint to her poetry. Like her poetry and prose pieces the pictures are small glimpses into a world that is alien, yet hauntingly familiar: worldly yet ethereal in its stark, black and white, finality. In Missing Pieces Ms. Rantala has produced a work that is compelling in its images and hauntingly beautiful in its often complex search for the reconstruction of the fragmentary. The work transcends its physical setting in its universal quest for meaning in distress, decay and death. Does, the poet asks, death diminish our birthright? Does violence negate the sweetness of ripening adolescence or the melancholy of someone else's love letters? Does it absolve us of our sins of patricide, even through neglect? The answer to these question are the bones and sinew of Missing Pieces."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Candlemaking Techniques: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide","review":"I loved this book!

I've re-read various sections many, many times, and am re-reading it completely for the third time.

Laurens uses all the latest research on the brain and includes fascinating examples from his own work. This is not &quot;pop psychology&quot; but the real stuff, and it requires more from the reader than just a quick read. The material presented can change your life and show you why you have been hitting so many brick walls. It can help you put feeling and meaning back into your life. It can help you get moving again.The book resonates. But it requires serious study and doing the procedures as if your life depended on them. Patience and courage.I am immensely grateful to Laurens for writing it.Note: Laurens doesn't mention the teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky.

Over the course of the three books in his GemQuest saga, Wassner's skills as a writer are catching up to his skills as a storyteller. That is not to say he isn't a good writer, just that story is stronger than the writing.While on the surface the saga thus can be characterized as your typical \\"good guys rally to thwart the destructive plans of the evil overlord,\\" there is more to it than that, and Wassner's skills as a storyteller prove it with each succesive volume in the _GemQuest_ saga. Part of the fun of that trope is seeing how many ways it can be spun, and in Gary's case, I like what he is doing. Colton, the evil overlord, while not seen very much, is handled very well both in the scences he is featured, as well as the scenes when other characters try to understand the nature of his \\"evil.\\" Perhaps, these scenes depicting the \\"good\\" characters discussing the nature of Colton's evil are the strongest, as the characters debate about his motivations and reasons. From the first volume through to this one, Wassner is revealing more about Colton and his motiviations and origins. There still isn't enough told about him in this volume to gain a full measure of his motiviations, but this revealing is perhaps the most tantalizing part of Wassner's traditional saga.Another strong aspect of the overall story is how well the decisions and events of previous volumes play themselves out in the subsequent volumes, including this one. For the most part, I think the characters are pretty well-drawn, even if they are overtly nice to each other. In a cast of characters as large as Wassner has created, not all the characters are going to be one's liking, in this case though, only one character really didn't sit well with me, Tamara, one of the Sisters of Parth. The Sisters of Parth were tasked with protecting an ancient map and knowledge of the land. Throughout the _The Shards_ I found her to be a bit too naive, particularly when faced with revelations about her character. The remaining characters; however, are plausibly drawn.There were intermittent spots where a copyedit would have enhanced the story and book, but on the whole, I like where the series is going, that is to say, there are a few different directions where the story can go. This sense of unpredictability is very appealing. I also liked some of the new creatures and monsters introduced and fleshed out in _The Shards_, I'm seeing hints of a couple of different myths here.Suffice it to say, I'm looking forward to where Gary takes the story in the next volume, Revenge of the Elves."},{"Title":"The Shards (Gemquest, Book 3) (Gemquest)","review":"If \\"The Twins\\" was as introduction, and \\"The Awakening\\" continued the prelude, then \\"The Shards\\" begins the battle to defeat evil, and save the world.Our innocent characters are given many new challenges: Sisters are Parth continue on their secret mission to hide the map and are waylaid, the Elfin city of Crispen must defend itself against an ancient monster in the mountain that lives above a needed key, three elves and a flying human must make their way to Sedehar to free Premoran, Tomas and Davmiran attempt to contact each other and other chosen, Colton has his eyes and ears everywhere, and with the death of yet another Lalas, the race for the 11th shard is on. Betrayal and danger lurk everywhere.The pieces of the destiny of the world begin to come together, and many characters, Dav & Tomas especially, are seeing a picture they don't understand. And they are in the center of it. All the pieces and all the tools must end up at the right place, at the right time, to be used properly. I could tell you more about the plot, and some of the new characters we meet. But I'm not going to. The plot is excellent. The characters come alive. But it's the ethical themes and underlying story of this world that is most important. It's everything that happens beneath the characters and their plights that will break your heart.Rarely have I found an author who trusts their readers enough to give enough hints here and there to figure out what's going to happen long before most of the characters do. Let the light bulb go off for the reader first. Wassner gives those hints, and it makes for an incredible emotional journey.Near the beginning of this volume, Colton's immorality is discussed. It's decided that he is not immoral, but amoral, something altogether different, but possibly just as dangerous, at least for him. A being with different morals than our earthlings doesn't always have to be a bad thing, as our characters will have to learn. Many things in this universe aren't good, or bad, they are just things. Just nature.Another strong theme Wassner explores is that of the ethical ramifications of deification. What happens when a culture deifies someone or something, that, although not human and close to immortal, isn't a god? On this earth, the closest thing to a religion is belief in \\"The First\\" Lalas. Phrases abound, such as \\"May The First be with you\\", and \\"Firstspeed on your journey\\". If that isn't deification, I don't know what is. But Lalas are not gods. They do not listen to, nor do they answer prayers. Their wants and needs coincide with the needs of people only when it is convenient for the Lalas. And when they do not coincide? When seen from a lalas point of view, the petty fights between the peoples of the earth are exactly that: petty. And in vain. It is not the people who control this world.Once upon a time, I was very afraid of fantasy. My short lived exposure to Tolkien and Tolkien fans led me to believe that I'd need to read a 700+ page Silmarillion to understand any and all fantasy. A weakness on my part, perhaps. However, if all non-Tolkien fantasy is as accessible and easy to dive into as Wassner, my bookstore giftcard is getting spent in the fantasy section. The accessibility of these books is something that makes them all the more enjoyable and addictive.Five out of Five spaceships.Reviewer: Andrea Johnson for Multiverse Reviews"},{"Title":"The Most Wonderful Doll in the World","review":"Dulcy loved dolls, but she was always dissatisfied with something, and no doll had \\"it\\" all, that is, no doll before Angela.

When Dulcy lost her due to carelessness, her mother asked what Angela was like so they could find a replacement, Dulcy said \\"Oh no There'll never be another Angela. She was the most wonderful doll in the world...she had real yellow hair and eyes that opened and closed and she said Mama and Papa and sang Rock-a-bye Baby, and she could wave her hand and take steps. She had patent leather shoes with heels and a purse with a handkerchief in it...\\" and more. Dulcy loved to tell anyone who would listen about her lost doll. The memory of the doll became more wonderful and exaggerated each time she talked about her. Dulcy stopped playing with her other dolls as well, for none of them could measure up to Angela. But...What happens when Dulcy finds Angela in a pile of leaves and finds Angela wasn't what she had remembered? \\"She didn't even have patent leather shoes with heels or a purse with a handkerchief...This is a cute story of a girl who held on to a childhood dream only to find it was all imagined, and how she grew up and learned to be satisfied with things the way they where because of it."},{"Title":"The Most Wonderful Doll in the World","review":"This is a wondeful book for little girls 6-10.

Over the winter, Dulcy becomes insufferable with family and friends about how much better Angela was than any other doll, either gifts she receives or other girls' toys, and Angela's abilities and outfits continually one-up the other children's dolls. When Angela is finally found, Dulcy is chagrined to realize that the doll she imagined and the doll she lost are quite different. For such a self-aggrandizing person, Dulcy realized the moral of her experience awfully fast. Also, the repitition of Angela's qualities and outfits, with a new one added each time Dulcy imagines it, would be more suitable for a picture book for much younger readers."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"Although a little dated - but necessarily so, I found The Invisible Pyramid to be a powerful reminder of our (man's) egocentrism and of the unpopular probability that our brief parenthesis in time will soon end - in terms of geological time, which Eisley so forcefully describes. Perhaps the critics who find this work &quot;too pessimistic&quot; or &quot;too bleak&quot;, simply do not admit the presuppositions upon which they are based. This may reflect the critic's inability to accept the inevitable. In &quot;The Invisible Pyramid&quot;, Eisley provides a powerful defense of the position that humanity will probably pass from the scene and that it is doubtful that other similar species have occurred elsewhere in the universe. Such a conclusion is often mistakenly seen as nihilistic, reflecting a naivete' on the part of the reader. Some find solace in this view and others find dispair. Existentialists find solace by first passing through - and beyond - the gates of Eisley's dispair.Les Blough"},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"Loren Eiseley, regarded by some as the modern Thoreau, was an American anthropologist and humanist who enthralled millions with his elegant literary style and sense of the mysterious as he wrote about the origin of man, evolution, and related themes. I purchased this book, \\"The Invisible Pyramid,\\" a few weeks ago in order to collect yet another of his wonderfull works, and I thoroughly enjoyed it as I winged from city to city on travel for my job. It is important to say that among Eiseley's dozen books, \\"The Immense Journey\\" and \\"The Night Country\\" are regarded by many as his best (and those two certainly are 'must reading'). I first read \\"The Immense Journey\\" decades ago, and it changed my view of life. The current book in question, \\"The Invisible Pyramid,\\" certainly is a wonderful work, although perhaps not every page of its 156 pages is as consistently superb as the other two works mentioned. It is with great hesitation that I raise any critical comment of this brilliant and artful author, but my inent is merely to guide potential readers with limited time to select the other two books first before this one. \\"The Invisible Pyramid,\\" published in 1970, is a relfection on the meaning of man's first steps away from the planet earth, and was written just after the successful and dramatic return of the Apollo 13 crew. Eiseley does not shy from calling man a \\"world eater,\\" a species that is progressively destroying the fragile planet that brought man into being and which must nurture him in the future. In view of the age of the text, it is interesting to note the absence of terms commonly used today, such as \\"global warming.\\" Of the seven chapters, the last is a worthy summation, and is superbly written in the classic Eiseley style. In short, this is clearly a special and memorable book that I highly recommend, but it should be read after the other two Eiseley books mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"This book differs from most of Eiseley's other writing in that it seems to be more pessimistic and resigned. The dominant image presented in the book's essays - and not one most people would sympathize with - is that human society is like a slime mold colony. That is, from an original spore the colony grows and grows in complexity until it spews out new spores to be carried by the wind and start other colonies far away - as the parent colony dies, having put all its life into sending out the fresh spore.Eiseley took this veiw of man as the U.S. was moving into the early days of the exploration of space. It is an interesting analogy, suggesting that as life expands outward from our world the life that sustained the outward thrust will perish. Maybe so, but these essays simply don't convince or please in the way that his previous books of natural writing did. The gloom is too overriding and there is no sense of nature triumphant.While Eiseley was always a man of bleak vision, that vision was always before filtered through a kind of verbal and mental artistry that is not shown here. Even someone as pessimistic as myself prefers to be offered some hope of redemption for the human race. At this point in his life, Eiseley didn't seem to see any."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"I enjoyed this small book many years ago and loaned it out or lost it. I purchased it again. Eiseley, a palentologist writes a wonder apologia about how we became human and that wemay be the only humans in the universe."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"Others mentioned Eiseley's pessimism. That didn't faze me. His pessimism is counterbalanced by his wonder and curiosity, lyricism and empathy with nature and with humanity. Eiseley writes that we are a species caught between two worlds and a stranger to both; caught between Nature and Culture; between where we've come from and where we'd like to go. Do we have a true \\"home\\"? seems to be the question. The use of symbols (and words) has empowered us, but also separates us from the Natural world. The second half of the book picked up speed (keep reading if you find him too dry at first) Eiseley proposes a Third world between the world of Nature that we came from and the world in which our reaching for advancement in technology, knowledge, and achievement propels us ever farther (usually to the detriment of Nature) Is there a balance humans will be able to achieve that is either Between the two worlds (respecting and honoring nature AND our compulsion to transcend) OR is the Third World something entirely different, a momentous change in consciousness; something as radical as the beginning of language was to the humans of prehistory (you could say when we \\"became\\" human by use of symbol and language) Wonderful concepts and questions. I could not discern from Eiseley though What this third world would actually be. Maybe it was too early for Eiseley (or me) to conceive of this third world. It would have to be a change that changes everything - which we won't recognize until we are in it."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"The Mind's Eye: Traversing the Penciled Lines of Eiseley's 'Invisible Pyramid'There is an ounce of perception that lies at the corner of 'normalcy', influencing intuition and prodding creativity into motion. Without that perception we would ignore/avoid/deny the space that exists just on the other side of the subjective cultural fences our brains create. Such salient observations should prompt the realization that the subconscious is not truly 'us' because it witnesses and communicates 'us' from outside of our 'selves'--the 'selves' of our every day fantasy worlds called 'reality'.Taken from this vantage point, the only real Reality is the one exposed in dreams, when the subconscious reveals what we actually see...with our mind's eye. This is partially what Eiseley indicated in his poetic hints at humanity's current experiment commonly called civilization-or as he puts it, \\"the invisible pyramid.\\" By dissecting culture and giving it the guise of a phantom, he helps to do what Einstein did with physics--demonstrating the relativity of perspective...the subjectivity of experience."},{"Title":"The Invisible Pyramid","review":"This book differs from most of Eiseley's other writing in that it seems to be more pessimistic and resigned.

John Kobal was prominent in this group, having been smitten with American films early on. His vast collection of photos yielded several books on its own and is a standard source for illustrating Hollywood's past. &quot;People Will Talk&quot; is not a photo book. In its 700-plus pages appear 41 interviews Kobal collected between 1964 and the mid-l980's. The subjects are Hollywood veterans from various phases of the business. Appearing are directors such as Howard Hawks, dance directors such as Hermes Pan, writers (Anita Loos), photographers (e.g., John Engstead, Hurrell). And of course plenty of actresses - and Joel McCrea, the only actor appearing. When interviewed, most of the subjects were at the end of their movie careers, and this, plus Kobal's insightful questioning, resulted in objective, candid appraisals of their lives and the situations and people involved. While the interviewer was not so rude as to question his subjects' recollections during conversation, footnotes here and there in the text correct what may have been lapses of memory. Each interview is prefaced by a photo of the subject, plus Kobal's summary and evaluation of the subject's career. Although I've read every interview in this volume several times, writing this review was slowed considerably by my inability to stop reading them again and turn to the typewriter. This is just the book for movie fans who like to hear how it happened from the lips of those who made it happen."},{"Title":"People Will Talk","review":"I have a passion for old Hollywood, especially early 1900's through 1940, and I enjoyed this book so much.

All stories in it are great to learn about when it comes to.another.culture"},{"Title":"Song of Lawino and Song of Ocol","review":"I first read this book as a twelve year old being introduced into poetry by my Australian English teacher. Needless to say, I found most of the poetry books prior to this one, to be a torturous exercise for a twelve year old. Okot p'Bitek spoke to the reality that was so real and I could identify some of the characters in my personal life. The choice of words and how they are put together is what I took away from the book. I found the main character, Lawino, to be very funny. I am a Kenyan and on any market day I would go to the market and be surrounded by a lot of Lawinos who are very open and unique in the way they interact within their environment. Very self assured and full of confidence.

It's written as Dr. Axelrod's own experience in keeping Angelfishes. You'll learn more about Angelfishes while you read the book. The book provides generous pictures of Angelfishes' strains. Quite a complete brief on Angelfishes. Covers diseases and breeding too."},{"Title":"Freshwater Angel Fishes","review":"If you want to read about the authors life experiences rather than keeping, breeding and care of Angelfish, this book is for you. I ordered it thinking it would deal with the latter, not the former and was ratherdisapointed in its contents. I suppose that Drs. Axelrod and Burger have led active tropical fish hunting expeditions and thought they should share their adventures with the readers. I think you would be better off with an early edition of William T. Innes \\"Exotic Aquarium Fish\\". It has a detailed write-up on the keeping, breeding and care of fresh water Angelfish. Although this book has been out of print for many years, It may still be available on eBay or gathering dust in some book stores."},{"Title":"Freshwater Angel Fishes","review":"This book wasnt worth it at all, he hardly talks about anything the average owner wants to know about...he mostly talks about the wild strains, and how he went out in search of them!"},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language","review":"In this etymological dictionary, Valpy attempts and successfully manages to represent the Latin language as a language mainly developed from Ancient Greek, a development of which its beginning is lost in time and reached its peak at the time of Augustus, when Latin language borrowed more than 10,000 words from Greek.In addition, it justifies what many famous Latins and Greeks - Dionysius Alicarnaseus, Quintilianus, Varro, Claudius Didymus, Philoxenus Alexandreus, Terentianus Maurus etc, - have already confirmed a couple of millennia earlier, that the majority of the Latin language derives from Greek and especially from the Aeolic dialect.Although this etymological dictionary doesn't cover the total of Latin language, purposely leaving out many words like names of men, places and technical words, because as the author states, they are easy to find in other attested works, it does cover a huge amount of the Latin language.Valpy's etymologies even if not fully detailed are attested and methodically scientific; he is tracing the Latin word back to its Greek etymon, and leaving it there, since as he states: \\"...then becomes the province of the Greek Etymologist to trace it further back into Greek...\\" Besides, his etymologies have been historically supported since the decipherment of the Linear B inscriptions by Michael Ventris in 1953, which took the Greek language back in time for at least 6 centuries (15th cent BCE), making Linear B a powerful tool at the hands of modern etymologists, a tool that Valpy couldn't have.The reader must consider here that this dictionary doesn't trace the words back to the hypothetical IE words and bases that many modern Indoeuropeanists vastly use in their etymologies nowadays, since that approach has only been used in modern etymologies for a few decades and this dictionary was written long before that. However, that is not necessarily a waste, simply because etymology by definition traces a word back to its etymon, and, as more and more etymologists are starting to recognize, a reconstructed hypothetical word or base while it has great value in the study of comparative linguistics, is far away from being considered as an etymon.One possible snag with the book is that an average reader will not only need some knowledge of Latin but also must be able to at least read Greek, in order to follow the Latin words to their Greek etyma.This is a dictionary that must have its place in the library of a student of Latin language and/or anyone who is interested in the science of etymology."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language","review":"This book is a xerox copy of a very old tome that came before the days when they knew how the Indo-European languages were related. The core assumption of this book is WRONG, that is, that Latin springs from Greek. We all know now that Greek and Latin are cousin languages which both sprang from Indo-European. This book, besides this major misconception, is riddled with errors. Nonetheless, it's a useful work and a fun read for word nerds."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language","review":"Haven't used it too much yet, but as I do have a fascination for dictionaries, mostly about ethymological ones, I am certainly going to, very soon. It is a fac-simile of the 1828 one, and although the language has its XIX century peculiarities, it is not a big an effort to read it."},{"Title":"The Wanderer","review":"I read this book back in high school because I was intrigued by the title. I enjoyed it at the time, and through the years I always remembered it as one that really resonated with my gloomy adolescent mind.Feeling nostalgic, I located a used copy online and read it again, trying to recapture whatever it was that had engaged me so many years before. It was interesting to see the same story after having a bit more experience of life. It was not as deep as it had initially seemed to me before, and yet I noticed and understood many nuances and details that had been opaque to my teenage mind.The edition I bought included a short biography of the author, who was killed in WWI - this was his only book. It was interesting that the story of the lost love was based on real events in Alain Fournier's short life. It is a glimpse into just one young life that was snuffed out by war, all future promise never to be revealed. As such, it is a story which is nearly as wistful and sad as the novel itself. Just as one wonders \\"what could have been\\" if Meaulnes got the girl, so we wonder what other novels Fournier might have gone on to write, had he not been buried beneath the sod of Europe."},{"Title":"The Wanderer","review":"I had to read this book in college for a German literature course - which doesn't make much sense since it was originally writen in French and takes place in France. But hey, one character does briefly go to Germany during the course of the story so maybe that was the justification.Anyway, I have always remembered the book as being fantastic and one of the most emotionally powerful things I had ever read. So much so, that a water stained, yellowed papaerpack copy had come with me over 25 years and 10+ moves to three continents.So finally last week, I made the time to read it again both to try to remember the specifics of what was so good and also so I could share it with my teenage daughter. Imagine my surprise to find it somewhat simplistic both in storyline and wtiting. The passion of the characters that caused them to make bad decisions in their lives must have seemed heroic to me as a 20 year old but sure seem transparently stupid to me now.The general theme that you lose what ever you most passionately desire if you actually acheive it, does not really resonate with me now. Sometimes I find it to be true; other times not and in any case most older people don't desire things with the passion of the young.Anyway, interesting book. Differet from most other things you might read. Worth the time; especially if you are 20 years old."},{"Title":"The Wanderer","review":"I knew this book first from the film (english subtitles) and found it even better than Malle or Truffaut at capturing young sensibilities (and yes, immaturity)... I recommend it highly and hope that it will be released on DVD..."},{"Title":"The Wanderer","review":"If you like France, you got to read this, because every little French has read it and dreamed over it. It is a superb book to read when you are young, because it is full of passion, mystery, fog and despair. When you grow older, as noticed in other comments, you see the flaws and the blind decisions of the hero, but when you are 16 or 18 years old, it is all emotions to you. The author was very young: it is impossible to recapture the same spirit later, which makes of this a rare book.The story is set in Sologne, less than 2 hours south of Paris, and worth a stop if you go visiting the castles on the Loire, which you should. The region is poor,full of swamps, fog and great food and a splendid contrast to life in the castles."},{"Title":"The Usborne First Thousand Words in Japanese","review":"My wife (Japanese native)and I (Japanese speaking American) purchased this book for our two year old son. We spend 15 minutes with him daily going through the pages.

Over Thanks giving, after diner, my family was sitting around and my brother picked up the book.

I prefer that at the beginning of my learning, I see no Kanji. It is just too confusing!I also have a three-year-old son that has looked at this book also. I'm simply amazed at how quickly he has picked up everything that I've read to him. Each word has a picture and he quickly recognizes it.

I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot from it. It sets out th kana so you can learn from them and distinguish them. My complaints were that it does give you the exact English word for the Japanese word. It simply gives you a picture and leaves it up to you to speulate what the word actually means. Also, it doesn't give you phrases or anything, so the book is kind of useless if you are really looking for something to teach you how to communicate in Japanese. But I don't believe that was the intent of the book, so I letting those of you know to not buy this to learn how to communicate. Only to learn words. But it is a very entertaining book and I reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Usborne First Thousand Words in Japanese","review":"I like the series and I'm not at all sorry that I bought the book. However ... reviewers (on the UK site)have already referred to the poor proof reading. Now I am an almost complete beginner in Japanese, but it wasn't ten minutes before I started finding lots more mistakes. It would be silly to list them, but sometimes labels are quite wrong; in one case two pictures side-by-side have been given the same caption by mistake. You might take the view that a dozen or so mistakes in a thousand is not too bad a failure rate. You might, on the other hand, like to look at Marlene Goodman's 'Let's Learn Japanese Picture Dictionary' which has the same format. I've not yet received my copy of that from the States (so can't vouch for its accuracy) but I understand that it also gives the kanji. You may find that useful.If you are completely new to the series, it is perhaps also worth saying that of course simple children's-story-book pictures do not in themselves make the language any easier. There is a trade-off: some people will find that the 'everything you can see here on the farm' approach is not a good way to learn ... it's obviously not at all systematic. Against that, lots of reviews (here and elsewhere) suggest that it works very well for young children. It's cheap, cheerful, good fun - a way of adding vocabulary - worth buying, I think ... providing that you can get by without the Japanese for 'hedgehog'! (Perhaps the slips do not occur in the US version, but I'd guess the artwork is the same.)"},{"Title":"The Usborne First Thousand Words in Japanese","review":"Great for beginner's Japanese.

The writer is able to carry it off convincingly with his own background as a teacher and writer of philosophy, Unitarian minister, peace and Civil Rights activist, student of Indian spirituality, and author of a contemporary version of Lao-Tzu's the Tao Te-Ching.The language of the novel, including the many speeches and interviews with the eloquent President David Tremaine, offers a plain and concise rendering of classic wisdom. The challenges are all-too realistic: the endless exchanges of violence between Palestinians and Israelis; the hard-line policies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and key US Senators; and ultimately, the real-life terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of Sept. 11, 2001. Where this alternate history and actual history fully come together is with the latter events; and it is in the patient, insightful response of President Tremaine that the novel's ethos departs most radically from the knee-jerk counter-terror of George W. Bush.The novel confronts head-on the global reality of terrorism and its roots in injustice, oppression, and reciprocal violence. Uncommon Reason includes the story of a clan of Palestinians caught in the brutal crossfires of the Middle East, painting sympathetic human portraits on both sides. The Israeli, particularly the hard-line Zionist, position is subjected to more probing scrutiny than is commonly found in the Western press. In the process, the living, breathing, loving, suffering, questioning humanity of all the characters is simply and eloquently portrayed.Uncommon Reason is a genuine page-turner, a realistic thriller with flesh and blood as well as wisdom and analysis. What it uniquely embodies is a higher purpose: the injection of timeless wisdom into contemporary political discourse."},{"Title":"Uncommon Reason","review":"How would the people of the world respond to the leadership of the President of the United States if he were an enlightened sage? Mallard explores this question in depth in the inspiring new novel, Uncommon Reason.The principles of love, mutual respect, and selfless service are applied to current events including the Middle East conflict, the attacks of 9/11 and the current war on terror. Mallard shows how actions in one part of our global village affect people in another part and in the process we come to realize we are all connected to one another. Because of this it is important that our actions, and those of our leaders, reflect this reality; we cannot act unilaterally without the consequences coming back to shock us.The novel gives us hope that we can create a world that no longer requires us to resolve our differences with escalating violence. First, however, we must learn to listen to the perspectives of all who are affected. Only then can we act in a way that fosters understanding and engenders peace.Uncommon Reason is a must read for those who are truly desirous of a more peaceful way of living in the world."},{"Title":"Uncommon Reason","review":"Uncommon Reason is one of the most thought provoking books I have read. As an American citizen, I believe it is an important read for us all---a wake up call about our government and what our foreign policies support. It is not always a comfortable read, and it will have the reader questioning and searching for answers both inwardly and out.I believe we have become a complacent and apathetic nation---unquestioning and trusting the media and politicians far too much. Unfortunately, I fear that unless we deeply educate ourselves on the issues and continuously and fully participate in our representative democracy, it will take another attack on US soil to bring us back to the question, \\"Why do the terrorists hate us?\\" We have not fully engaged in finding the answer. Ending our ignorance is a means to the solution. Being brutally honest about our policies and their effects will bring us many answers and the peace we seek.

Mallard is an excellent book for anyone interested in political intrigue, Middle Eastern realism and Eastern wisdom. Colin manages tobring these three diverse topics together in a story that travels from New York City on September 11th to the equally explosive world of the Middle East. On this journey we meet an American president who must consider a foreign policy to deal with terrorism while not escalating further acts of terrorism. We also meet fundamentalistinsurgents seeking revenge and one deeply wise sage who realizes that enlightenment always sees the whole amidst the parts, no matter how extreme the parts maybe.

Is Saudi Arabis an ally?Read this book and you will wonder."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Hatred's Kingdom is not the kind of easy read you want to finishin a day. It might have helped if Gold had provided a time-line or chart of the significant names in Wahhabism &quot;history&quot; as well as other mid-Eastern countries and names. It was tough for me to keep things straight until about the fifth chapter.It is well-researched, and helpful in understanding the situation in Irag. It is also frightening. Don't our administration and military leaders have this background inform-ation? Many people have been wondering why our president keeps telling us that the Saudis are our friends...as if none of the9-11 conspirators were Saudi. Read this and decide for yourself.The problem with reading this book is that it reinforces myfeelings of helplessness and confusion as to why our &quot;leaders&quot; think Iraq if our biggest problem, and why anyone would thinkeveryone in Iraq would, or ever will, lay down their arms andwelcome us as their &quot;liberators&quot;.I think it is absolutely essential that we &quot;liberators&quot; under-stand the connection between the Wahhabis &amp; education/educators in the mid-Eastern countries. That concept is at the core of this book and it is an extremely important one."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"When I bought this book I new the author was the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations at one time and I had a concern that the book might be a bit bias against Saudi Arabia given the history between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Other then the author getting a bit defensive about the few times he mentioned the Palestinian Israeli issue, it did not seem to me that the author was being anything but fair. As a disclaimer I would add that most of the book deals with a subject matter that is rather new to me so it could be completely bias and I might not be able to see it. With this being said I did learn a great deal for the book and found it well written. The world the author takes the reader into is an unknown world for most of us and it will probably take a number of books of this type before the general public starts to see the light in regard to Saudi Arabia.The author provides the reader with a rather detailed history of how the Wahhabi sect of Islam has become the main if not only form of religion practiced in Saudi Arabia and how it is linked into the ruling royalty. What I found most interesting is the detail that the author gives about the connections between the rulers of the country and the practice of Wahhabi Islam. Up to this time I had always thought that the Osama bunch was a small fringe group within Saudi Arabia and that the government was more moderate and was interested with positive relations with the U.S. What the book shows is that the roots of the radical beliefs run deep and this is not something that will quickly disappear within the Saudi Kingdom. You almost wonder how U.S. citizens feel safe enough to live and work there given this deep and broad level of hatred for the western world.The author gets into a good amount of detail on the terrorist attacks against the U.S. up to September 11 and explains the connection to Saudi Wahhabi groups. He also spends a good deal of time talking over the how the wealthy in Saudi Arabia get money to the Osama type groups and just how hard it would be to stop. The only part of the book that I was a bit disappointed in was the last chapter where the author tries to detail out what he thinks could be done to correct this problem. This section of the book was almost embarrassingly light and was a let down given the rest of the book was so good. I do not fault the author for the lack of solid ideas to correct the problem, that is an issue that has been and will be debated for years. But I did hold him accountable for trying to pass this \\"glass is half full plan\\" past the reader as some sort of end all be all plan. The author should have had a bit more courage and just admitted that besides the obvious, he did not have a plan to resolve the issues. Overall I enjoyed the book and learned a great deal from it."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"This book was full of history and an indictment of Saudi Arabia, but it was kind of dry to sit and read.

Keep in mind the author's prejudices, but give him credit for his research."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Author Dore Gold is a former ambassador to the United Nations and has performed in-depth and objective research here based on official documents and factual occurrences. What is Saudi Arabia's relation to the United States in particular and to Western civilization as a whole? Is it primarily a matter of geopolitics or is it actually a fundamental difference of eclecticism, religion, and ideology due to the influential strains of fundamental Islam and virulent Wahabbism? Read this book and you can ingest the informational foundations to decide for yourself. It won't take too much contemplation. This is a very current and detailed account of what too many are not aware of. Gold also makes good points on what may be happening in this regions and world in the coming years based up these facts.Wahabbism and it's anti-western civilization hate-promoting are objectively elucidated and supported by factual evidence and cross-referencing. Transcripts from sermon's from the Mosques of Saudi Arabia are included. There are numerous sources of documents at the end of the book.Politically, the ruling family has had a lengthy and for the most part chummy relationship with American administrations over several decades. It's well known within SA and throughout the world that there are many who oppose the regime within this nation-state on the peninsula. Keeping the ruling family in power is preferable to what would possibley replace it. Such are the many nuances and angles of this culturally impervious nation.Home to the religious sites of Mecca and Medina, oil reserves, wealth, and Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia is publicly a protected pseudo-friend of the U.S. yet in actuality is an antagonist of United States and Western principles of civilization. Hopefully, the American public and members of Congress will read this book."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Mr. Gold's knowledge and scholarship, and his ability to bring his readers in touch with today's radical Islam in Saudi Arabia is fascinating. Prior to reading Hatred's Kingdom, I had only a marginal understanding of what Wahabi Islam was and what it had evolved into. You will learn that it should be no mystery why 15 of the 19 September 11th hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. The civilized world will have to deal with its largest threat since Hitler when confronting the terrorist threat personified by these radical, though not fringe, Saudi Islamic elements. In just a few enjoyable hours, the reader of this book will gain a perspective that is typically glossed over or totally ignored in today's media, but which must be understood by many more of us."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Quite unpleasant subject matter, coupled with an especially pedestrian style of presentation makes this book absolutely as dry as dust to read. Having said that clearly, it seems to me a most valuable book. Part of the reason the book is dry reading is simply that it is factual. Unlike many books, line after line of this text give explicit facts that can be verified or falsified by further reading. Factual information can be less pleasant, easy reading than a digested or even \\"sexed up\\" editorial. So, what I am calling \\"dry as dust\\" can also be seen as elegantly factual---just what we need.The context explained in all detail in this book shows quite precisely the relationship of Wahhabist Islam in Saudi Arabia to the government. The relationship is unlike what we experience in the West, and a lot of explanation seems needed. We see here, then, extremely good evidence that \\"Arab extremism\\" is identical with Wahhabism; that it is being exported in a consciously hostile way by the Saudis; and that it is as dangerous to most Muslims as it is to most Christians or Jews.Although this is very important information, it seems not to be entering as it should into policy making in the West. That needs to be changed. Perhaps at the next election, we might need a regime change (non-violent, thank you), too."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Dore Gold documents the Saudi role in bankrolling and inciting international terrorism up, down, and sideways.

Everyone who wants to know what is going on needs to read this book."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Sadly, the \\"extremist\\" Wahhabist ideology (or more accurately, Islam with a Salafist outlook) is winning the hearts and minds of Muslims all over the world, including in enclaves established within tolerant, all-too-often overly PC, Western societies.Dore Gold exposes the threat posed by this ideology while at the same time following the \\"money trail\\" back to its proponents in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In a well-documented narrative, he traces the origins of salafist thought back to ibn Taymiyya and his followers, through the doctrinal revolution of Abd ul-Wahhab, the Muslim Brotherhood of Said Qutb, and their modern ideological spawn throughout the Middle East. He describes the origins of the modern Saudi state, sparing us no detail of the slaughter the early Saudis wraught in their campaigns (read: Jihads) to \\"cleanse\\" the Arabian penninsula and the Middle East. He then demonstrates how Saudi petrodollars have funded terrorist groups from the PLO to the Moro Liberation folks, and how that money is siphoned into institutions in the USA and western Europe. A disturbing look at a growing threat, one which politicians of every party are all too eager to ignore."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Until the demise of Soviet communism, the U.S unfortunately found it necessary to ally itself with some unsavory countries in order to face larger global issues. Saudi Arabia, with its strategic location and vast oil fields, is an example of such a country. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the U.S./Saudi relationship basically ran on inertia due to our need for a stable government in that region.September 11, 2001 was a wake-up call. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were Saudis. Furthermore, the terrorist mastermind behind the attack was not only from Saudi Arabia but from one of its most prominent families. Clearly an American re-examination of the desert kingdom was in order. Dore Gold has provided the foundation for doing this and is in a good position to do so as a former foreign policy advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations.Gold provides a solid empirical analysis of Saudi Arabia's support for Islamic terrorism. The specific sect of Islam which constitutes the state religion of Saudi Arabia is Wahhabism. This sect is particularly intolerant. Its adherents hold an extremely narrow view of how Islam is to be interpreted, have utter contempt for anyone whose religious belief differs from their own and are willing to spread Wahhabism through unbelievable violence.Saudi Arabia has been able to spread Wahhabism, as well as its accompanying violence, through both its oil money and because of its special position within Islam as the birthplace of the religion. The two holiest cities of the religion, Mecca and Medina, are located within the country thereby giving Saudi Arabia even more influence as to how the religion is to be interpreted. As a visit to Mecca is required of all Moslems able to make the trip, Saudi Arabia has something better than a captive audience. It has an audience required by the religion itself to travel to the country where Moslems will be exposed to the extremist message of Wahhabism and thereafter take the seed of extremism back home with them.There are two areas in which I think this book is particularly strong. First is that it demonstrates the extremist nature of Wahhabism to such a degree that it is difficult to maintain a position of moral equivalence. No doubt many readers have heard arguments along the lines of \\"Yes there are extremists within Islam but every religion has extremists. What about the Christian Coalition?\\" It is difficult to take such individuals seriously and this book provides ammunition to respond to them appropriately. Wahhabism is so violent and intolerant that \\"extremism\\" in other religions looks mild by comparison.Second is the history of Saudi Arabia that Gold provides. When the Saudi family agreed to support Wahhabism in exchange for the political support of Wahhabis, it created a theocracy unknown to the modern West. What struck me regarding the relationship between politics and religion in Saudi Arabia was not necessarily how broad or how deep that relationship is but rather how intrinsic it is to the existence of the country. Politics and religion do not go hand in hand in Saudi Arabia but rather are interwoven into the fabric of the nation. This needs to be understood.My only criticism of this book is that Gold has not adequately addressed the possible alternatives to Saudi control of the nation with its accompanying support for Wahhabism. The Saudi family had a significant rival in the Rashid family. Would a Rashidi Arabia be any better? If the Rashidis were not Wahhabis, what were they? What is their interpretation of Islam, their position on Israel, their take on Shiite Muslims? Who else besides the Saudis or Rashidis might fill a power vacuum within the country? Although it might be difficult to imagine something worse than Wahhabism, it does not follow that any alternative would be something to smile about. More analysis on this would have been helpful.Almost everyone would now agree that radical Islam is one of the most dangerous forces the international community faces today. To address the problem, we must understand it. We also need to understand where it came from and how it continues to survive. Hatred's Kingdom is exceptionally helpful for such purposes."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Dore Gold does an excellent job laying out the history of the fanatical side of Islam which had produced the vast bulk of today's terror.Wahabbi instruction has infected the Islamic world almost entirely due to Saudi funding, and Hatred's Kingdom lays out where it all started. The bargain that the Saudi's struck for legitimacy with Wahabbi clerics is detailed here as are the effects.If you want to know \\"why they hate us\\", where they get their money, and how we got to where we are today, read this book."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"If you want to read just one book, to understand the cause and origins of terrorism, this is the book.After 9/11, like everyone else, I asked \\"Why do they hate us?\\" The President said \\"Islam is Peace\\", and we were told that this was not true Islam, yet muslims danced in the streets all over the world as they watched the Trade Center destroyed.I set out to find out why, and have read numerous books, about all aspects of Islam, Middle Eastern and Arab history, as well as the Koran. I learned that much of what I had been told was not true, that the news media are incredibly superficial and befuddled (surprise?), and that many apologies for Islam are phony. After all this, I still knew that I did not understand.When I read Hatred's Kingdom, I expected a Jewish/Israeli slant, and definitely did not find it. What I did find was a well-written, extensively referenced, well-organized analysis, full of structured historical info, and finally, an explanation which puts all the pieces together. The Saudis are definitely not our friends - they cooperate with us when it is convenient to have us do something for them (like defend their country, or buy their oil). Their rulers are totally beholden to a fanatical form of Islam, called Wahhabism, which preaches war and death, even to other forms of Islam. It teaches implacable hatred and violence toward all non-muslims, and they have actively spread this hatred throughout other muslim countries. It was behind the Taliban, it invaded Bosnia, and it disrupts Chechnya. Nearly every Islamic terrorist, regardless of where he grew up, follows the teachings of this sect, and so it all comes together.Generations of Saudis have been taught this vicious doctrine since childhood, including most of the 9/11 hijackers. Osama bin Laden grew up on it in Saudi schools. What's scary is that millions of other Saudis have been taught the same doctrines.Hatred's kingdom, it is indeed."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Mr. Gold has done a remarkable job doing what the hacks at the 9.11 commission couldn't: (paging Clinton/Reno/Hubbell crony Jamie Gorelick. They lost ALL credibility by removing Dr. Kissinger and fawning all over Richard Clarke) determing why 15 of the 19 hijackers were delivered from the House of Saud.It's simple: Wahhabism, as it is created, fostered, and exported in incredible amounts by our friends, the Saudis. Ambassador Gold documents the entire history of hate being preached in Saudi Arabia and it's troubling relationship with the country's leaders and its role in creating Bin Laden and like minded jihaders . In essence, the clerics in SA run the country like the mullahs of Iran, just more discreetly behind the scenes. The effects are no less dangerous. In the mosques and schools, daily invective of anti-Christian (American) and anti-Jewish (Israel).Not satisfied with complete mind control of Saudi citizens, and using the vast wealth of the country from petro dollars, Saudi Arabia has exported their militant form of Islam throughout the world including Pakistan, Yemen, the Philipines, the Balkans, and many other areas.Mr. Gold chronicles the history that the Saudi Royal has with the Wahhabi hating clerics. In return for large sums of money to spread their form of Islam, which singled out other Muslims as well non-Muslims, the clerics would not agitate for a cleric run state and sharia law.Mr. Gold leaves us asking incredulously, why didn't we expect this before 9.11. The al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda-linked bombings in 93, 95, 96, 98, and 2000 can all be tracked back to the Saudi approved clerical rulings and fatwas advocating jihad against all \\"non-believers.\\" The book details the complete intransigence of the Saudis during the investigation of the Khobar Towers bombings of 1996. President Clinton even visted the country to get their assistance.And for the leftists who dismissed Saddam and Bin Laden's cooperation in terror, the author reports on historical ties between secular governments and Bin Laden. They shared two common enemies: The United States and Israel.I wish Mr. Gold would have explored more deeply the actions the US and the world should take with the Saudis. Clearly, the US could use a new energy policy (drilling in Alaska should have been a no brainer). It severely disappointed me that President Bush had Prince Abdullah to the ranch, especially after hosting Prime Minister Sharon. Mr. Gold does point out that the violence inspiring sermons can be viewed as a violation of international law and definitely of President Bush's \\"You are either with us or the terrorists\\" edict.Mr. Gold does a good job at assuring us that Islam is a religion of peace, but offers little proof of that.Overall, an incredible book, well-researched, and further proof of the need for the US to listen to neocons like the editors of the Weekly Standard, Wall Street Journal, National Review, and Little Green Footballs (I believe) and reevaluate our \\"special relationship\\" with the House of Saud."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"A good resource, lots of details and facts and a good reference for the future. Since others have rightly commended the strengths of this book, I would like to point to a couple points Dore Gold makes in his book that are questionable in my opinion, according to my limited knowledge. Mr. Gold begins by arguing that Islam itself is not the problem. \\"Rather, the problem is the extremists in the Middle East who have manipulated Friday sermons in the mosques, textbooks in the schools, and state-controlled television to one end: to systematically prepare young people to condone the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians.\\" Sadly this incitement is common-place in mosques throughout the Middle East, in Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, Gaza and elsewhere, including Saudi Arabia.True, Muslim theologians long ago broadened the meaning of jihad, but the idea that the Islamic mainstream had, in the past, shifted away from the focus on jihad as a universal religious requirement, I think is at best a matter of debate. Dore Gold presents this radically intolerant stream of Islam (Wahhabism) as having broken off from Islam by stressing the older, militant meaning of jihad.Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, essentially attempted to bring Islam back to a belief in the oneness of God (Allah), 'above all (Ibn Abdul Wahhab wrote) a rejection of all gods except Allah, a refusal to allow others to share in that worship which is due to God alone (shirk). Shirk is evil, no matter what the object. The war against shirk (polytheism) became his central preoccupation.' In this, ibn Abdul Wahhab was following what he understood to be pure Islam, for the Koran states, 'Kill those who ascribe partners to God, wheresoever ye find them. Polytheists (mushrikun; that is, those of us here in the west) were his declared enemies,\\" according to Dore Gold. Reads like something the prophet Muhammad himself would have written.Yet, it is reported that followers reject the terms \\"Wahhabism\\" and \\"Wahhabi\\" as pejorative, believing their strict, 18th century interpretation is the only true Islam. Osama bin Laden and his millions of followers maintain their interpretation is true Islam. In addition to Osama bin Laden and his followers, Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, Yassir Arafat's Fatah, Palestinian Islamic Jiahad, Islamist groups all united in their anti-Americanism, claim to represent true Islam. Much of the \\"Arab street\\" supports the view. I'm not prepared to argue with it."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Hatred Kingdom simply says it as it is and always was.

The Arab countries were always dependant on the US and UK for making peace and dividing their territories appropriately among their leaders, like a father cutting slices of cake to his fighting kids.

Why can't we simply take in Saudi Arabia? I mean we are already in Iraq and Israel is as good as American territory... Why shouldn't we simply occupy Saudi Arabia ?!?.. They are rather more connected to terror than Iraq or Saddam Hussein. This way we ll be able to control all the oil in the Middle East and everybody will be happy. Jews can again live there where they want to be. They will be able again to recover all the land they lost in the Middle East. I think the whole the Middle East belong originally to the Jews and with American help they could be able to regain control again. Where the hell did these Arabs come from in the first place!!!!???Who cares why the Saudis hate the American... All of them are terrorists and murders anyway. They simply don't want to live our way... They hate democracy and freedom. We should invade every country that discriminates against Jews. We should start war against every single Arab, Islamic or whatever country which doesn't like our system. The only TRUTH is Democracy. ALL other ways of life should and must disappear. Why should we bother ourselves with trying to understand? It is just a waste of time.I would rather suggest as a response to the fact that no Jews live in the Arab countries that we prevent any Arab or better any Muslim to live in the United States. Who need these terrorists anyway? If we can have them under control we ll be controlling more than a fifth of the whole planet. We can achieve that with help from our best allies, the Israelis. They have the best experience in crisis situations. They know exactly how to defend themselves against all the stupid heavy-equipped well-trained full-of hatred Palestinians with their desperate suicide terrorist attacks. What the hell do they want any way? They should be thankful that they still live on OUR HOLY LAND! We could have sent them to the desert or let them live in Ghettos!! They cannot survive alone without our help.I will produce the evident for that ladies and gentlemen... There are more than 1.5 MILLION Palestinians in Gaza Strip what did they achieve?! NOTHING!! Although it is a very small and crowded area and although they have all the time in the world... they still live in a wretched pathetic way. If they were creative and as intelligent as the Israelis they could have build sky scrapers or something. Even though we allow them to work and support them with all the needed infra structure they didn't stop supporting Terror. What the hell have the Saudis to do with that?! It is just an excuse to hate the Americans and the Jews. In fact the Saudis and all other Arabs should be very thankful that we are taking care of these terrorists. I am very proud to be an American!! We should always and forever unconditionally support the Israelis in whatever what! We will fight the war against the hatred and terror until we kill all who support them!!The history shows us that it is useless to talk to Arabs. They are so stupid to understand. Besides coz they are not democratic all what they say is not acceptable any way. The best way is to ACT. First we occupy the land and then force them to give in. If it is necessary we can expand Guantanamo Bay. As we know it is simply legitimate to prevent terror before it happens.

Gold does not condemn Islam only Saudi style Wahhabism. Please do not buy into the intellectually dishonest reviews of this book. Furthermore, you cannot condemn this work simply because the author is a Jew! If one reads the book carefully, one will find no condemnations of Islam or of the Muslim population in general. In fact, Gold makes it known that countries like Qatar and Bahrain practice much milder versions of the ultra conservative Wahhabism without the same repercussions. What's more, Gold does not sanction military action against the Kingdom; instead, he suggests global standards that will curtail its blatant incitement against Jews, Christians, Shiites, Sufis, Hindus, Buddhists, and any other doctrine that does not adhere to their version of what the oneness of God is."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Dore Gold has written one of those rare works of journalism: an incredibly approachable work of history that demonstrates its relevance through self-evident connections to present-day events. The level of detail and scholarship in this work is both respectable and highly insightful to anyone seeking to learn the truth behind the whitewashed image of Saudi Arabia....After digesting Gold's masterwork, it is clear that Saudi Arabia is challenging Iran for mother-ship status as the base of operations for murderous global credos. Indeed, the most pronounced difference between the two countries appears to be that Saudi Arabia employs better Public Relations agents. Both countries openly support the slaughter of innocents. Both countries embrace and richly fund the forcible spread of their doctrines through murder and destruction. And both countries have made a lasting commitment to foster international terrorism by nurturing its lifeblood: a philosophical system that justifies this abhorrent and inhuman behavior.Gold goes a long way to properly identify Philosophy (or \\"ideology\\" in Gold's words) as one source of the irrational hatred that fuels these homicidal maniacs. He also correctly identifies the target of this hatred: secularism. Further, this secularism is very explicitly identified in Wahhabism as capitalism in the economic field, democracy in the political field, and freedom in the social field. Thus, while Western civilization has for centuries sought to divorce religion from the state, Islamists (and the Wahhabi in particular) wish to reverse this trend by removing the distinctions between church and state. Of course, all of the horrors of the Dark Ages will be revisited upon those who embrace this ridiculous creed, but that is a subject for another review.Gold goes onto correctly identify the nature of this agenda, however, when he cites that the \\"ideological motivation to slaughter thousands of innocent people\\" is no less important than \\"where terrorists received their training and which bank accounts they used.\\" He also properly concedes that until the West identifies the root cause of these phenomena, the war on terrorism is impossible to win. True students of philosophy, however, will be disappointed that Gold fails to carry his insightful observations to their logical conclusion. For, while he cites ideology as a \\"necessary condition\\" of terrorism, he fails to identify it as the sine qua non of terrorism-namely, as that thing above all others that must be uprooted to destroy global terrorism.Gold's research is only slightly marred by the somewhat disjointed nature of his presentation. While he does an admirable job painting in broad strokes (e.g., the history of Wahhabism as a cult of killers), the reader does suffer in spots from a disconnected chronology of events and their relevance to the overall text. Additionally, there is a good bit of knowledge regarding Islamic icons and institutions that is presupposed by the author. Finally, as mentioned above, Gold seems to be more like a plodding prosecutor preparing for trial than a journalist reaching for a grand story; as such all of the energy of the book is consumed in developing a record rather than drawing any conclusions or offering plausible alternatives. Despite these shortcomings, however, this was a fascinating and meticulously documented record of Saudi atrocity that provides a story that is rather a substantial departure from that told through the mainstream Western media."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Hatreds Kingdom is a good book that explains the history of the branch of Islam called Wahhabism. Some say that Wahhabism is no longer active in the world but it is alive and well in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The book is very informative of the modern and global threat of this radical ideology of Wahhabism and how it has spawned and is currently nurtured in Saudi Arabia. The book clearly illustrates one of the main drives of the on going battle of East vs. West which is the hatred and religious intolerance that is taught in the radical form of Sunni Islam named Wahhabism. Though Dore Gold has a bias opinion, which is evident, the book still is very informative. I would recommend this book if you are interested in Islamic Terrorism and the roots of its hatred."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I suppose the only thing one can say against this book is that it is not new. Dr. Fatima Mernissi (Islam and Democracy) talks about how the House of Saud is using its petro dollars to fund terrorism and suppress democracy, the New Yorker ran a story on this, just recently Robert Baer provided an excellent expose in the Atlantic of this same phenomenon in an article called \\"The Fall of the House of Saud\\".Thus the facts are well-known.But what Dore Gold has done in this one book is bring them all together in a compelling, authoritative, yet easy-to-read narrative. He has shown that although the Saudis have tried and are trying to peddle the worn-out lie that Middle East terrorism is the result of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; it is really they who are behind it.Or, as Baer puts it, once Abdullah tried to cut back on corruption \\"The third-generation princes were getting only about $19,000 a month--a fraction of what they needed for the lifestyles they sought. To keep even a modest yacht on the French Riviera requires a million dollars a year. What were they supposed to do? In order to make ends meet they had been getting into nastier and nastier business, taking bribes from construction firms (mostly the bin Laden family's) seeking government contracts, getting involved in arms deals, expropriating property from commoners, and selling Saudi visas to guest workers.\\"Dore Gold fills in the picture. He tells us that not only did the impoverished princes do all these illegal things, they also cashed in on the most lucrative trade around: international terrorism."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Along with David Pryce-Jones's The Closed Circle: An Interpretation of the Arabs, this book gives one much needed insight into today's Middle East and the countries surrounding Israel. What was most startling to find out from the book is that Wahhabi Islam outside of Saudi Arabia, in Qatar and Bahrain, does not produce the extreme opposition to fundamental human rights routinely found in Saudi Arabia. I don't recall if Gold indicates whether Wahhabis in Qatar and Bahrain execute those who desert Islam but they have routinely not opposed granting women the right to vote. To me, Gold's missed opportunity was to clearly delineate why Wahhabism is different in these countries and to try to formulate a policy approach with which Saudi Arabia could be transformed to be more like its neighbors and less like what Gold documents it to be today. The unholy alliance the House of Saud has made with the muftis is what is directly responsible for the vitriol fueling hatred in the Middle East. This is Gold's most valuable insight."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I gave this powerful expos&eacute; of Saudi complicity with global terrorism four stars instead of five since I was disappointed with the proposed solutions. But there is no question that this book goes further than any other in opening the vaults to Saudi secrecy. It covers their past, present, and future; it gives names, dates, sources, and exact quotations; it lays out financial evidence with checks, spreadsheets, and correspondences. All prove conclusively that Saudi Arabia is, and has been, a profound enemy of Western liberalism and is behind today's terror networks. He makes the case clearly that the Saudis have \\"provided the delivery system\\" to carry hatred and terrorism worldwide.Many topics in the book have been discussed or written about in the media since September 11th. What the book does, though, is assemble the key facts in a nice, easy to read format. Until this book, we've only been fed sporadic or disconnected details, clues, innuendoes, and history, all of them quickly denied or whitewashed by the Saudis and their highly-paid American p.r. consultants. But as deep as this book goes into exposing their support of global terrorism, with hundreds of citations, I had the feeling that I'd only seen the tip of the iceberg.The final chapter of the book, \\"Ending the Hatred,\\" did not offer me reason for hope, unfortunately. Some of the solutions proposed make nice reading but are highly unrealistic. He proposes that the international community take steps, for instance, to \\"monitor\\" and deal with \\"incitement and hatred emanating from mosques and featured in textbooks or on national television networks.\\" He hopes, in effect, that we can have the \\"international community...make the Saudis adhere to minimal standards of international behavior...\\"Not a chance! We couldn't even get European allies to help us remove Iraq's mafia regime or destroy their illegal weapons. The possibility that a world community could agree on definitions of \\"hatred\\" or \\"incitement\\" speech, or agree on \\"standards of international behavior,\\" are not great. Not in a world where slavery and religious wars still exist.Although Gold uncovered the roots of global terrorism in Saudi Arabia, and offers some solutions for its control, he did not spend enough time uncovering the soil that supports those roots: petrodollars. He briefly mentions that \\"the Saudi kingdom has provided not only the ideology that motivates terrorists but also manpower and seemingly endless supplies of money for terror operations.\\" He writes how the \\"explosion of oil prices in 1973 provided Saudi Arabia with vast financial resources... .\\" And he includes a quote from Bernard Lewis explaining how \\"...oil money has enabled them to spread this fanatical, destructive form of Islam all over the Muslim world and ... the West. Without oil ... Wahhabism would have remained a lunatic fringe.\\" But incorporating the idea that this vast and practically unlimited supply of oil wealth is part of the problem, and should be part of the solution, was not done.I would have liked Mr. Gold to have pushed the creativity envelope a bit more. For instance, we know that Saudi Arabia has used the \\"oil weapon\\" against the U.S. Is oil being used as a \\"weapon\\" again, this time as a \\"weapon of mass destruction,\\" if its profits are being used to sponsor the likes of Osama Bin Laden or Al Qaeda? Can a nation be allowed to intentionally misuse and violate Earth's natural resources for the express purpose of spreading hatred or undermining Western civilization? After all, the rights of nations to declare specific and measurable rights to their airspace, coastline, and underground minerals were agreed to recently and are still disputed. Are those rights immune from interference under all circumstances? Could a nation's \\"right of self defense\\" be expanded to include a \\"right of repossession\\" (of previously nationalized oil concessions) if its survival is threatened? In any case, I was not inspired by Mr. Gold's proposed solutions as being realistic, but clearly we must get serious. This book is a great start!"},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Gold delivers a meticulous chronical of the birth and repugnant growth of Saudi Wahabism.

Well, yes. And we do not need Gold to tell us that. We can see what rights (or lack of them) exist for women there. Or for Christians. And how Jews and Pagans are relatively lucky: for the most part they do not get to be in this nation at all. We ought to know that Saudi Arabia was one of the very few nations that was unwilling to vote for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Saudi Arabia has never been in a war with Israel. Yet, for those of you who know a few Saudis, try this: ask them what they think of Zionism. It may be an eye-opener for you.My point is not that Saudis are bad people. Quite the contrary. I think we ought to try to figure out why many otherwise friendly, goodhearted and bright Saudis have rather strange attitudes on some issues. And I think this book helps us do that.The author raises some issues that I think are relevant. First, what is the role of Wahhabism in determining the attitudes of many Saudis on questions involving the West, Israel, women, or non-Muslims? Second, where does Wahhabi money and other support go, and why? Third, just what connections are there between Wahhabi money and terrorist attacks on Israel and the United States?Gold's conclusion is that the Saudis must be held accountable for their actions. And this includes establishing international codes of conduct that will outlaw some of the incitement we see, including hatred taught in mosques, textbooks, and the media. Unless this is done, the Saudis will continue to preach peace to the West while funding terrorist groups that make peace impossible. Gold thinks that sooner or later, the Saudis will have to choose what side they are on. But I'm afraid that eventually, the Saudis may not be in a position to make a useful choice."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"guess what, I live in what Mr. Gold say as the \\"Hatred Kingdom\\". my review is simply this: Facts are facts and they don't change, Interpretation of these facts is what could change\\".First of all, blaming all terrorist actions in the world on this government only is like blaming all dieing animals on the wolf just because we hate wolves more than other prediators. it is really shallow minded and small thinking.Second, I didn't like the way he talk about us as if we came from the planet of apes, generalize that most of us are haters just because a tiny fraction -only 15- of us are terrorists, it is more of stereotyping than analyzing."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I've read this book out of curiosity, but unfortunetely found it to be without real or factual substance and no objective conclusion.Rather, it was politically motivated and written by someone who is naturally biased towards Isreal, and could not possibly have the objectivity nor the intention to write the full truth.Saudi Arabia may be a country with many extremists and people who hate America or the west, but we cannot take this view without looking at the big picture and all other factors including Isreal and the Isreali Arab conflict into consideration as well as the Amrican role in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle Eastern regimes that are supported by the United States.Therefore, I can honestly say that this book is worthless, dangerously biased, and incite hatred rather than understanding."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"After reading this book i have realized who is full of haterd its those pepole who are trying to triger wars and conflicts by poisning peples minds with lies.I feel very sad when i read such books which are written by pepole with known backgrounds and intersts.its an advice for every one looking for the truth, do not read about a nation from their enemis, isralis and arabs are in war for almost a century now.I'm not defending the saudi's but i cant accept to accuse any pepole's relligon with terrorism."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"This is an extraordinarily interesting, informative, and compelling book. It describes in detail the vicious, xenophobic, bigoted, bloodthirsty and expansionist ideology of Wahhabism, its historical impact on the region, and its commanding influence on today's terrorist movements.The book is also extremely well-written, and carefully documented.The only question one has, after reading the book, is why a topic so critical to American domestic security, and American policy in the Middle East, should so rarely be mentioned in the American media."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I have just read through the seventy- two previous reviews of this book on Amazon. I therefore will try to avoid repeating what has been said about Gold's historical analysis of Wahahabism his development of the thesis that present- day Saudi Arabia is a prime funder of terrorism worldwide, and a state which acts against the interests of its patron and as it were most essential ally , the United States. I will instead simply point to two other works which seem to affirm much of what Gold has to say, Craig Ungar's, 'House of Bush, House of Saud' where he links the Bush family to the Saudi corruption explaining how the US has not dared to really get to the sources of Saudi terror. I would also point to John Loftus work on ' The Secret War against the Jews' in which he traces the Nazi connection to what would become later a vicious Arab- anti- Semitic ideology of which Saudi Arabia( the chief distributor of the Anti- Semitic tract forged in Czarist Russia, \\" The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" ) is a principal proponent. Gold traces the role of the Evil Kingdom in sponsoring terror worldwide. He does not however do enough to show how US interests are so bound up with Saudi oil and money that acting against them in a real way could be detrimental. The fact is that the present war on terror conducted by the Bush Administration is in some sense hostage to Saudi terror.This book goes a long way toward exposing the evil, racist ideology of Saudi Wahhabism. It goes a long way towards showing the negative role Saudi Arabia is playing in the war against Terror. It does not however offer a realistic way out for US policy. To cut off Saudi Arabia is to lose its oil and money. To force regime change is to risk radicalization and anti- American takeover. To go along is to go along with a corrupt regime one which educates to anti- Americanism but one which is still dealing with America.I don't envy US policy- makers in this situation. The fundamental line of promoting democracy in the Middle East seems a joke when it comes to backward Saudi Arabia, a country totally unprepared for such a transformation.Gold's book if nothing else teaches us that the free world as a whole and particularly the US have plenty to worry about in regard to Saudi Arabia. It does not teach us however how to deal with this worry."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"The source of the major terror loose in the world today is described in shocking and sinister detail in this book.R. James Woolsey, a former Director of the CIA is quoted on the cover as stating, &Ograve;If you read one book to understand the roots of al-Qaeda fury, it should be this one.&Oacute;This book should be required reading for every high school senior, every member of Congress and every western government official. It should be prominently displayed in every non-Saudi library world wide.As stated on the flyleaf of the book, &Ograve;. . . Middle East expert Dore Gold provides the startling evidence of how Saudi Arabia not only is linked to terror, but in fact has spawned the current wave of global terrorism.&Oacute;The Saudi's are clearly not with us.They are not only WITH the terrorists, they ARE the terrorists parents and sponsors.The book reveals that the perception that a major factor in al-Qaedas fury is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a serious and dangerous error.The Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia have built a fearsome and largely unseen worldwide network which is controlling the riches of Saudi Arabia and other contributions to their cause obtained through supposedly innocent charities.This sinister, savage, and growing cause has as its principle goal, the elimination of any human being who is not a Wahhabi or who can not be converted to the Wahhabi religion, including non-Wahhabi Muslims.Wahhabi sponsored and supported organizations include Hamas, Hezbollah, the al-Aqsa brigade and numerous others. They also control organizations still operating in the US.Everyone should read this book, and insist that members of their Congressional delegation read it and then take appropriate action to destroy these monsters before they grow further."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"\\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" is an excellent and very logical account of the way in which the Saudi Arabian government and 'ulama have supported terrorism. It explains it very clearly in terms of the roots of Wahhabi Islam that tend to see non-Muslims as polytheists. In some cases, Wahhabis have tended to see even other sects of Islam in these terms.Many people in the West today are aware of the structure of life in Saudi Arabia. Non-Muslims cannot practice or proclaim their religion on pain of death; women are severely restricted both in dress and in opportunities - they are not allowed to drive and must be accompanied by a male relative on a bus or train (though not on flights); and cinema, theatre and Western music are likewise banned.What Dore Gold does in \\"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism\\" is to show very clearly the manner in which Saudi support for terrorism today is rooted in the ideas of Wahhab in the eighteenth century - which called for a return to the Islam of the first Muslims. \\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" gives very easy-to-read accounts of what the Wahhabis believed had corrupted Islam since the seventh century and how the Wahhabis believed Islam should be returned to the basic belief in the oneness of God.This, they felt, meant that Judaism and Christianity had to be attacked as unbelief. More often, actually, Wahhabis have seen these religions as polytheism, and have attacked them viciously in their propaganda with quotes from the Qur'an.We see very clearly how the Wahhabi armies of ibn Saud fought the Ottomans over several centuries to gain control of the Hijaz from the Hashmites (who rule Jordan today), succeeding after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.The oil wealth of Saudi Arabia in later years meant that the 'ulama and government could carry out Wahhab's original intention of spreading his form of Islam across the whole world, which we see has led to the setting up of large numbers of Wahhabi schools in the West and the conversion of many young people to Islam.Wahhabism was/is the toughest and most reliable defence for the US against potential left-wing revolution in the Middle East, owing to its uncompromising belief in murdering opponents thereof. Thus, the US government has strongly backed Saudi Arabia ever since oil was found in the Persian Gulf. The crux really is that Wahhabism believes it has an obligation to fight the Dar-al-Harb (non-Wahhabis, especially non-Muslims) regardless of the means used. This explains both why the US trained Osama Bin Laden against the Afghan PDPA in the 1980s and why Osama felt threatened by the placement of US troops on Saudi soil. It also explains why Muslim terrorists believe it is neither suicide nor terrorism to sacrifice one's life as a human bomb if one kills infidels in the process.The book is especially clear at showing why many attempts at modernisation by Saudi monarchs are firmly opposed by the 'ulama and how the 'ulama have considerable control over Saudi politics. Over the last thirty years, the 'ulama have in fact become vocal in their demands for an even stricted Islamic state in Saudi Arabia, and have in fact succeeded in tightening many regulations governing Saudi life. The whole book is clear in showing that Saudi 'ulama aim to spread Wahhabism globally by jihad, and how 'ulama see it as the highest goal of every Muslim to die in a jihad. Indeed, they point out that Wahhabism basically believes that nonbelievers have no right to live whatsoever. 'ulama and Saudi princes thus contribute vast sums of money to fuding such groups as al-Qa'ida, leading to such horrors as the September 11 attacks.Dore Gold points out the only by finding a substitute to lessen dependence on Saudi oil can the US solve the problem its alliance with a state built on an ideology of holy war has created for it since the September 11 attacks.In summary, an extremely clear book that offers a very good understanding of where Muslim terrorism comes from."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Anyone who looks at things in the world with a brutal eye for the truth knows what this book says already, hopefully. this piece brings to the surface alot of things that the media and the powers that be have kept from us, mainly that Saudi Arabia ios and has been a supporter of terrorism and that they themselves support and fund it, and indoctrinate others to follow it and act it out (watch some Saudi TV and see what they show on it, it's blatantly violent anti US rhetoric-and mainly state run). The material is presented in an easy to follow manner and deasl with the history of the subject quite well, however there are times where I feel like the author is trying to present it while maintainig a PC guise; the author downplays some topics and treats others too lightly. If you're putting somrthing like this out you might as well just do it instead of half @@@ it. But in all the book is good and contains thing speople should know, but as usual most likely wont look into, even thohgb it dictats policy, becasue Paris hilton and Speares arent in it. Books like this should be met with great media accclaim, we have the freest media in the world and yet we dont use it t all other than for entertainment, the news wouldnt discuss this stuff though it should. Read it, its worth the time."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Essential reading in understanding the present political crisis of Al Queda and Saudi Arabia. Also, essential reading for anyone embarking with political or business relations in the Middle East, and especially with Saudi Arabia. Well written, quick read, covers the broad picture and goes deep, but not long winded (not space filling like most books). Although the author shows much deeply and well founded incriminating evidence against Saudi Arabia, concerning Al Queda, you'll also discover, by reading between the lines, that Saudi Arabia cannot easily reverse their course. For they are on a course of longstanding duplicity and comprimise that cannot easily be reversed without the threat of massive inner self destruction. To read this book is to become accutely aware of what dangers could be avoided in making contracts with such a wayward nation."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Amazing truth about petrodollars funding Saudi Wahhabist export.

It does have a point of view, but 50 years of Arabs trying to kill off Israelis will give an Israeli an &quot;attitude,&quot; even if they are an accomplished scholar.I want to address an earlier poster who claims this book is propaganda and that mentions the Jews of Spain fleeing to Morocco &quot;where they live to this day.&quot; The vast majority Jews were forced out of Morocco after the Six Day War, having their property seized as well. They were even forced out of remote areas such as the Atlas Mountains of Morocco where they had lived for over 900 years.

A book that gets past the superficial headlines and quick-fix current events, to explain what really got us in this mess. Hatred's Kingdom uncovers the truth emanating from 300 years of Middle East history, and then chillingly explains where it's all headed. In the process, I got an inside look at an entirely new dimension of the Middle East conflict: the ideological front, where the battle is over civilization and society, not policy. I'm convinced that anyone who reads this detailed story of the Wahhabi-Saudi alliance, backed up by flawless documentation and exhaustive research, will demand that we in the West act immediately to prevent the next legion of Bin Ladens from rising anew. Dr. Gold devastatingly exposes the Saudi role in building the network of terror, which stretches to Saddam Husein's Iraq, that not only brought down the World Trade Centers but stands poised to wreak more destruction. Through this literary adventure, I came to see the Middle East and the world stage in an entirely new light. For my money, there is simply no better currents events book on the market. Get it, and read it immediately."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I am embarrassed to realize the extent of my own ignorance regarding the Wahabi menace. As a lover of history and one who could draw a fairly accurate survey of the events that shaped the West during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, I was grievously unaware of the monstrous theology and murderous campaign of Ibn \`Abd Al-Wahhab. One wonders how the terrors of the crusades could compare to the genocidal murder of \\"impure\\" Muslims by the fanatical armies of Wahab. One wonders still why the West fails to see the ever-present and growing threat posed by the Wahhabi poison which spans out from Saudi Arabia (our allies?) to infect Muslims around the world. This book is required reading for every American who feels the need to make some progress toward understanding why some Muslims cultivate hatred above all other \\"virtues.\\" Want to know why supposedly godly people feel compelled to murder innocent women, children, and men? Want to understand why they have no difficulty murdering their own kinsmen and fellow Muslims? It's the poisonous Muslim heresy of Wahhabism. Where does it come from and how is it funded and propagated across the globe? Saudi Arabia is Hatred's Kingdom as Dore Gold has dubbed it. This book is a good starting place and a dreadful portent of things to come as long as Saudi Arabia is not held accountable. The Saudi mission to spread Wahhabism has been incredibly \\"successful\\" in Indonesia, Chechnya, Bosnia, America, and of course, Palestine where their PLO has become the center of a maelstrom of Islamic hatred. One stat that might be instructive for all those who think the extremists are a small minority is that 79% of Palestinian children state that they want to be suicide bombers when they grow up. It would seem the \\"extremists\\" are the few who want peace. If you think this is all an academic discussion for Americans consider that 70% of the Mosques in America teach the Wahhabi doctrine. Get this book and learn what those \\"friendly\\" neighborhood mosque-goers really think about you."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"I just finished \\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" by Dr. Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador and a scholar on Islam and, especially, Saudi Arabia. His book documents the connection between Saudi Arabia and terrorism, including the side-by-side translations (Arabic/English) of memos and official documents calling for terrorism against America, Israel, Jews and Christians. Included in the book is the written proof of Saudi financial contributions to terrorists and actual sermons of the top mullahs calling for jihad. This is a chilling book. Saudi Arabia is not a friend and ally of the U.S., as this book proves. Of course, many of us have known this for a long time (duh), but seeing the collected evidence drives it home hard.Whatever \\"usefulness\\" the Saudi's may be in the war against Saddam Hussein, it is superficial at best. Dr. Gold's book proves that the heart of Islamic terrorism beats in Saudi Arabia. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about freedom of religion and freedom from armed zealotry."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"It is interesting in reading reviews of this book, that the very people who call Israel racist apartheid, boastingly admit that Jews cannot get a visa into Saudi Arabia precisely because they are Jews! Whew! And that's not racist?It's about time people pick up on who is truly racist and apartheid in the Middle East. Israel has an Arab population with Arab representation in the Knesset, while Arab nations are practically &quot;Judenrein&quot;: (free of Jews). Nevermind that Medina, one of Saudi Arabia's holiest sites was named Medina (which means nation in Hebrew) and was founded by Jews who were deliberately murdered and fortunate if they were just forced to leave, to run for their lives leaving everything behind.According to Arab propaganda, the fact that Dore Gold cannot get a visa into Israel because he is a Jew is of no consequence! Does this not clearly demonstrate that Saudi Arabia is precisely &quot;Hatred's Kingdom?&quot; How then did Zionism (the aspirations for the Jews to have a homeland in which all religions are respected and practiced freely, and where Arabs even hold political office) end up being labeled apartheid and racist?Has the whole world gone crazy? Why isn't this fact being brought up in the media? Why isn't the U.N. condemning Saudi Arabia for discriminating against Jews and Christians?The aforementioned reviewer as much as admitted that the title of this book is an accurate description. Enough with the turnspeak!I want to thank the reviewer for substantiating Arab hatred and racism to the readers' attention by gloating that Dore Gold cannot know anything about Saudi Arabia because he &quot;cannot even get a visa into Saudi Arabia because he is a Jew!&quot;In my book, that is the epitome of racism and apartheid. The world needs to read this book and demand an end to Saudi Arabia's apartheid and racism, directed at Jews, Christians or any other faith except their accepted version of Islam."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Dore Gold has figured out the source of the new terrorism. It comes from Saudi Arabia. This book is a sweeping history that begins in the 18th century and moves right up to the present tense. It is extremely well-written. Everything is explained here: Saudi Wahhabism, Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the PLO, Israel, Osama bin Laden, as well as al-Qaeda. Thus although this is a book about Saudi Arabia, the reader picks up enormous background about the whole Middle East. I read this book just as America came under an Orange Alert and finally I understand who is standing behind the continuing threat. I agree with the former head of the CIA, James Woolsey, who wrote on the cover of Hatred's Kingdom, if you have to read one book that explains the hatred against America in the Middle East, it is this book. I hope the highest levels of the US government read this book."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"A thorough analysis. To really understand what to most of us is incomprehensible, Dore Gold explains the historical, political and most importantly, the religious roots of this vile phenomenon. The fact that a supposed friend of America, Saudi Arabia, is supportive of this menace is unquestionable. What do we do with this information? No question about it, Dore Gold's book is a must read."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Contrary to some of the criticism leveled toward this book, I found this author to be very balanced and fair toward Islam. For example, Gold identifies the aspect of Wahabi theology that justifies jihad toward non-Wahabi Muslims, such as Shi'ites and Sufis. By labeling the latter as 'polytheists', extremist Wahabi groups have justified violence toward these groups as well as desecration of sacred Islamic sites. Gold documents both historic and modern examples of this, such as the intrusion of Wahabi jihadists into the Balkans.I found it valuable to learn the symbiotic relationship between the Saudi Royal Family and the Wahabi clergy and how the royal family gives the latter power and influence in order to maintain favor. Also, how oil money has funded the export of radical Wahabi ideology and the terrorist activities conducted by the latter. And paradoxically, because of Western dependence on oil, the money came from the very countries the Wahabi ideology holds in contempt!Sometimes the book is dense and hard to follow but I think every member of government who has a role in international affairs should read it.Sadly, in reading this and other studies, it becomes apparent that Western democracies ended up supporting many terrorist regimes in their attempt to fight the Cold War. Supporting the 'bad guys' just because they are against one's current enemies is a dangerous and risky strategy indeed and makes us look like hypocrites. Jimmy Carter referred to Khomeini as a 'holy man'. We supported Sadaam Hussein. Look where it got us!"},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Hatred's Kingdom, proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the Saudi government is both the financial and ideolgical engine of radical Islam. I learned a great deal from this book -- especially from the primary source documents in the back of the book. Saudi Arabia is no ally of the United States - it is part of the problem not the solution to the evils of terrorism that destroyed the innocents in the World Trade Center. What a great and informative read."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"A brave and important book that should be read by the president, his cabinet and everyone in Congress.

As I read this book I had to research out every accusation and event. From every data base I thoroughly checked, Dore Gold is in fact presenting true facts. Ok, maybe his opinion could be argued as biased, but not one actual circumstance in this book comes from invention or opinion, it is all one hundred percent supported fact that can in fact be checked, even with declassified CIA files. I found zero falsehood in this truthful account. I do recommend this along with SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Very interesting, hard-hitting book that brings the reader to a very difficult dilemma: just what do you do about a people that fundamentally believe that they MUST commit jihad (holy war) against the non-believers?This does not refer to Islam as a whole of course, but the growing sect of The Wahhabi established by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab in 18th century Arabia. The author offers an interesting history of the development of this extremist sect and how they infiltrate and influence mainstream Islam and national political leadership. We find that Wahhabism provides the dogmatic foundation that enable groups like Al Qaeda to form and extremist leaders like Osama bin Laden to gather a storng following.This book does not present an uplifting story, but puts a serious problem on the table. Hopefully, this is a problem that can be dealt with."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Obviously this book doesn't say that the people of Saudi Arabia are \\"bad\\" people. It is just saying that certain ideologies such as \\"Wahhabism\\" that construct the national identity of Saudi Arabia are \\"bad\\" just as \\"Nazism\\" or any other docrine that claims one race superior and another inferior. This is a great book as a companion to other books on the subject (such as the bible). While it isn't the final authority on the subject, it certainly is valuable to anyone that wants to understand how people are taught to hate. This doesn't mean that Saudi Arabians are the only ones taught to hate. Every country has cultural forms of teaching racism. This book is about the hate taught in Saudi Arabia and does a great job. Truth is humility."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"While the current east/west conflict is reportedly NOT about religion, it does need to be about fanaticism and hatered and how it is instilled in the youth through religious training in the Saudi Schools (warning to the west here, don't let religion in the public schools!) and how the United States in it's &quot;politically correct bias&quot; glosses over the real problem of hate, financial support of hate, and the relationship between oil and blackmail and terrorism.

The Saudi Royal Family has gotten themselves into a tremendous jam they can't get out of by supporting the US and their clergy that preach hateful rhetoric against the US.This book explains the history and hatred even between the middle eastern countries and people, also the differences between the different sects of Islam are explained and how much they hate each other. Unfortunatley they are taught to hate us more...."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Most Americans are by now well aware that 15 out of 19 of the Islamic terrorists that crashed into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were Saudi citizens. What is less well known is that, despite Saudi claims to the contrary, Saudi Arabia is probably the world's number one exporter of fundamentalist Moslem terrorism. In HATRED'S KINGDOM, Dore Gold details in a quite thorough way how one Moslem country could tell America that we are friends but behind our backs incite its own citizens to become suicide martyrs.The first third of HATRED'S KINGDOM is a minute historical overview of the Wahhabi sect of Islam. This part was slow going since Gold apparently omitted nothing of consequence about the birth and rise of Wahhabism in the 17th century. The final two thirds were most illuminating as Gold describes how the Saudi sheiks have been holding onto power by their fingernails for the last half century. Gold analyzes a thoroughly corrupt society of inbred princes who hide their corruption (rather unsuccessfully) under an all too obvious phony veneer of Islamic piety. Gold sees the Saudi sheiks are financial pragmatists. During the first Gulf War, these sheiks risked incurring the ire of the powerful Wahhabists by allowing Christian, Jewish, and (gasp!) female American soldiers to walk about unescorted. Gold notes the irony of America's victory in Gulf War I. With Saddam Hussein defanged as a threat to the Saudis, the Saudis could now feel freer to support a Wahhabi style terror network stretching from Riyadh to New York.Gold concludes by noting that the United States had better get tough on the Saudis to give up as a support system to radical Islamic fundamentalists. Unfortunately, he adds that there is no practical way to achieve this. As long as America continues to bail the Saudis out of whatever hole they have dug themselves into, the Saudi sheiks will continue to spout words of friendship to us and poison to a new generation of suicide bombers who are even now thinking of those 71 virgins."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"The untold story of the Real terrorists: The Saudi Royal family and the radical Wahhabis.This book will tell the big secrets that they do not want you to know.

Even as I write the bodies are still being recovered from the latest series of Islamic suicide/homicide bombings, this time in Saudi Arabia itself.Scores of innocent people have reportedly been murdered, many whilst they still slept, and hundreds more injured in these latest atrocities. No doubt these are the consequences of the activities described within this excellent book.Included within his own personal review of this book, Richard Perle (former Assistant Secretary Of Defence) declared \\"If the Saudis do not move to extinguish the fire they have been fuelling, they will themselves be consumed by it.\\"The author, a former Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, has through a meticulous study involving the use of previously unpublished documents, revealed the hidden depth of how Saudi Arabia has itself been the sponsor and paymaster of worldwide terrorism.These revelations and disclosures are very illuminating whilst some entities have tried to cover-up and excuse Saudi Arabia's funding and sponsorship of worldwide terror.A plethora of issues are investigated here, not least the Saudi funding of Palestinian terror groups such as HAMAS & Islamic Jihad, plus the payments to the families of Palestinian suicide/homicide bombers, including a Saudi 'telethon' that raised some $109 million for Palestinian 'martyrs'.The photographs displayed in this book reveal Palestinian school-children at kindergartens dressed in combat fatigues carrying replica firearms, with one young girl enacting the dipping of her hands in the blood of an Israeli for the cameras. A model of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock is nearby.Al Qaeda and the countdown to September 11th is also studied here together with an analysis of the immense global reach that the tentacles of such terrorist organisations can now extend to and their disturbing implications for us all.If anyone reading this book believes that Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US and the West in the 'war against terrorism', then they will rapidly discover that they have been mislead.This is an extremely through and well written study on this subject which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Dore Gold describes how Saudi Arabia's culture gave rise to Al-Queda and terrorism. The region was once a confederation of cities separated by vast desert, with Bedouin nomads crisscrossing the sands. They powerful fighters; some were so powerful that the Turks did not dare challenge them.In the 1700's, they began following doctrines of Wahab, later known as Wahabi Islam. Incredibly strict, it left no tolerance for non-Muslims. Even other Muslims, like the Shiites, were beyond the pale. According to Gold, Wahabism favored violence to preserve Islam, giving rise to Al-Queda, which promotes violent attacks on non-Muslims, particularly anything to do with the USA.I found the book biased because it describes Wahabi Islam like a bad-tempered monster that you can't reason with. But that's really what Wahabism is. The doctrine of Wahab leaves no room for its followers to coexist with anyone. It forces women to walk on eggshells so as not to offend the men with their presence. One of their words for \\"woman\\" actually means \\"evil\\".Thirty years ago, the people were not as numerous. Today, they are. Modern Saudis aren't sure how to negotiate the difference between their culture, which is very conservative, and foreign cultures, where everyone (particularly women) can live as they please). Their country requires women to cover themselves in public, while in the media they see women in bikinis. Women in their country are subservient to men, while in the USA they have total freedom.Take for instance the US Army bases in Saudi Arabia. You have female soldiers, bareheaded and clad in tee shirts, carrying guns and driving trucks. Saudi women aren't allowed to do that. How do you think a Wahabi follower feels when he sees women \\"empowered\\"? Can he accept that some women are not beneath him? How will he react to his loss of dominance?"},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"This book shows how the Saudis who have pretended to be America's friends are in fact supporters of America's worst enemies. Only this past week Saudis were once again involved in a terrorist operation action U.S. interests, this latest outrage being in Iraq against their own fellow Muslims, albeit Shiites.For a very humorous poke in the eye of the Muslims, and Saudis in particular, read Keshner's COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT. Great flying stories as well."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"As if we don't get enough of these talking heads over the airwaves, each trying to convince, yet all failing to persuade, today's environment and media saturated culture has now founded a target rich environment where they can peddle and advance their viewpoints without the redirected question of a host or moderator, the interruption of the guest in the other half of the screen crying \\"foul\\", or the inconvenience of the mandatory pizza commercial break, all through the magic of the hurriedly pressed written word.So what's the point here? Contrary to the old adage, in some instances a book should be judged by its cover, or at least by its author. Yes, Mr. Gold has a long list of credentials; yes he writes reasonably well; and yes, he, or his staff, have done some excellent research into his subject matter. However, I ask you, would you read a history of the ghettos of Soweto written by the white South African settlers, or an accounting of the Kurdish situation by the monster in Baghdad, or would your credulity permit you to entertain an accounting of the WWII Jewish experience written by the German SS? I think not.Mr. Gold is after all a right wing Israeli political representative and has a long and unabashed history of servitude to a particular cause for a particular government advocating a particular ideology, whose purposes are wholly served by portraying anyone in the opposition (Saudi Arabia is still \\"technically\\" in a state of war with Israel), in the blackest most evil terms possible, as is always the case in such matters. To the thinking man then Mr. Gold's motivation is therefore highly suspect for he comes to this endeavor from a very biased and prejudicial corner, and this work must then be automatically considered, rightly or wrongly, of doubtful sincerity. Under these circumstances, which I'm sure are well recognized by him, why he did not publish under a pseudonym is utterly beyond me.Having said that, let us take a look at what this book really has to offer. In brief: Nothing that we did not already know, suspect, or intuitively feel in the first interval after Sept 11, when the identity of the hijackers was released.While it may be argued that many of the elements discussed in the book may have some basis in fact; that the House of Saud is infinitely corrupt; that they have sold their souls to the devil in their unholy pact with the violently extremist and intolerant Wahhabi faction by letting them develop a ripe breeding ground for their evil and wholly warped and misguided interpretation of Islam, and have acquiesced to, and are complicit in, the worldwide export of this repugnant ideology in order to save their own reptilian skins; that they have attempted to further \\"buy\\" their own security by giving generously to those very same extreme elements who would eagerly turn upon them given half of a chance; and have allowed these supremely repressive clerical authorities in Saudi Arabia to terrorize and subjugate the impotent, hapless and deeply frightened populace to a degree one step above the Taliban, with no indication whatsoever that they have done so with the support, compliance and blessing of their \\"Western\\" overlords, and their intelligence services, in order to serve some particular ends which I'm sure that Mr. Gold must obviously be fully aware of, yet oddly never touches upon.Additionally, Mr. Gold uses as evidence excerpts of sermons and speeches, and hitherto unpublished documentation which although seemingly supportive, are none the less isolated remarks and unofficial or private transactions to the better informed eyes and ears of those of us who have been intently involved, well in advance of Sept 11, in the study of the country, history, religion, and culture of the Saudi regime, and who unlike Mr. Gold have actually lived there \\"among the natives\\" for extended stretches of time. It is a patent case of exhibiting the exception rather than the rule, and the presentation of \\"evidence\\" that is as incriminating as the check in the hands of the IRA originating from an account of an Irish fellow in Boston, who gave innocently to his favorite Irish charity.However, what really should be the clincher for the interested buyer reading this review is the fact that the information presented here is dated. While the assertions may have been somewhat verifiable before Sept 11, the truth is that since that fateful day when the Saudis got a very rude wake up call upon seeing what their hands had wrought, and becoming persona non grata the world over overnight, the security situation in Saudi Arabia has changed dramatically. No mention is made of the post Sept 11 crackdown by the now highly vexed Saudis on the more extreme members of the Wahhabi clergy, and their highly successful attempts at tracking the movement of terrorism suspects, the incarceration of those same suspects, and the institution of tighter controls over transfer of funds in and out of the country, and a host of other easily verifyable sober internal and external security measures. This is not to say that all is well and rosy in the kingdom; far from it in fact, as it is anywhere in any state on the planet. But as far as this reviewer is concerned, the material presented by Mr. Gold is no longer apropos to the present situation in Saudi Arabia.This book is therefore in my humble opinion imbalanced for it sensationalizes where it should inform thus placing effect above cause, and symptom over disease. As for this book being a great expose of the recent history of the Middle East, well...that is the subject for another review entirely.There are infinitely better tomes available through this seller that will give a more comprehensive, less agenda driven biased view, which offer a more comprehensive and critically balanced look at the unfathomable dichotomy and social tragedy that is Saudi Arabia. If you must read it, then at least wait for the paperback edition; I'm sure your wait won't be that long."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Has Mr. Gold visited Saudi Arabia? Does he speak Arabic? I wonder how he comes to his conclusion about Saudis and Saudi culture. The conclusion was built on some ill translated sentences and paragraphs that were picked from textbooks, letters and documents and were presented as \\"evidence\\". I think it is easy to use the method \\"pick, pick, pick\\" to generalize and make concepts. Based on textbooks, media coverage, books, speeches and documents, this method can be used, for example, to call the US \\"the most aggressive country\\" and its people, the most dangerous people. On the other hand, this same method can be used to prove that the US is a peaceful nation. My point is that picking sentences from speeches and choosing paragraphs from texts is not the right way especially when it comes to make judgment about cultures and people.In Short, we live in a strange world. If you have POWER, you can support your point. You can print books, get great media coverage and call your enemy whatever you want especially when your targeted audiences are not well educated about issues you discuss.By focusing on the Saudis, the main, yet implicit, purpose of this book in my view is to tell the book audiences \\"Americans\\" that Israel (the author's country) has nothing to do with recent Muslims hate of the United States. Why ? because it is all about the Saudis and Muslim problem and hate!!"},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Let's start with the title,Should the author have replaced \\"Saudi Arabia\\" with \\"Israel\\", he would been receiving a massive stoning by many people accusing him of \\"anti-semitism\\". The very first word, \\"Hatred\\", suggest its bias and may not be regarded as a valid source.Second, apart from the apparent position of the author, the book is clearly biased against many Saudis who cannot defend themselves due to linguistic limitations.Saudi Arabia is a perfect scapegoat from Israel. After all, both are in defiance of UN resolutions, both ban Evangelicism, and both are ceaselessly condemned by Human Rights Organization and Amnesty International.I come from that \\"Hatred Kingdom\\". I have been taught about Crusades, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (through what I perceive as a bias teaching, but then again, has there ever been any analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that was never labeled as \\"bias\\"?) and the only mention of the United States that I have stumbled across was in my geography class.I am just 18 years old, but I remember what I have been taught very well.Personally, I have never EVEN heard of Wahhabism until after 9/11.This book as a haven of false proof for people dying to hate Saudi Arabia.I shall discuss some points raised in his book.1) The myth that 15 of the 19 hijackers, mentioned at the end of every news report regarding Saudi Arabia, are Saudis was completely fabricated, yet held as a strong proof of Saudi Arabia's support of terrorism.(...)Apparently, 7 of the 15 hijackers turned out to be alive, reportedly having their passports stolen a while before 9/11. Some of these people have never even been to the US, and the alleged pilot of the plane crashed in Pennsylvania never even heard of the state.Thirdly, Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries that had its soldiers shot by terrorists in its war against terrorism.If the book was against Israel, millions and millions will accuse the author of being anti-semite. Never there has been any anti-Israel books that were widely promoted.I do not hate Israel, I do not hate Jewish people. In fact, I take pride in having some of them as friends. However, my point is, any anti-Saudi book written will always, get this, ALWAYS get the glamour and attention, thus becoming a best-seller.Do you think that it doesn't hurt me, personally, seeing an increasing number of Americans falling for that myth that Saudi Arabia promotes terrorism?Do you know how much it makes me sad to see these people bashing my country? What did I have to do with all of this?Before I get all emotional, I will conclude my review by stating the fact that Saudi Arabia has not, does not and will never support terrorism.What would Saudi Arabia gain from supporting global terrorism? Nothing.Do you really think Saudi Arabia would commit an act that would strengthen US-Israeli ties? Do you really think Saudi Arabia would commit an act that would undercut their own oil revenues? Do you really think Saudi Arabia would commit an act that would anger the world against Arabs?Me neither."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"The book lists historical events that occurred in the 19th-20th century in the Muslim World. Although many of those events actually happened, but they were twisted to serve the author's main point: attack Islam and Muslims, de-humanizing Muslims and portray the image of Muslims as terrorists (wholesale prejudice). Although he is claiming that the book is about Wahhabi as an extreme offshoot of mainstream Islam, he is attacking Islam as a whole (what else do you expect from a right-wing extremist Israeli when talking about their enemy?). While on the other hand legitimizing the occupation of Palestine by the Israeli Jews and making the daily killings of innocent unarmed Palestinian civilians children, women and elderly by the Israeli tanks and warplanes as &quot;self defense&quot; against what so-called &quot;Terrorists.&quot;When the Spanish Inquisition started killing every non-catholic (including Jews), where did the Jews in Spain flee to? To Muslim land in Morocco (and that's why there is still a high number of Jews living in Morocco till now. Now Dr. Gold comes and slice and dice Muslims as enemies of Christians and Jews! How does he explain the Arab Christians who lived for hundreds of years in the Arabic countries and still Christians till our days if the main goal of Muslims was to convert \\"The People of the Book\\" into Islam by forcing them to pay Jizya (tax)?This is a clear propaganda against Muslims and Islam judging one-fifth of the world population by acts of a bunch of people who don't represent anybody except themselves.I gave this book a rating of 3 stars because it brings up to the open (thanks to research done by the IDF) many historical events that were hidden from Muslim population in the world although I disagree on the interpretation of those events done by Dr. Gold. From the details in the book, it looks like it was produced by the Israeli intelligence to attack the Muslim and the Islamic way of life and the Islam as a religion. It mainly targets Americans in attempting to influence the public opinion against Islam and Muslims. A couple of things they missed, American people who want to pursue the truth (which has beautiful ways to shine), will not be misled by a cheap propaganda in one book. Second, de-humanizing 1.2 billion people does not really prove anything but the author's attempt to insult the intelligence of the readers."},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"a must read for our world today (unfortunately)God Bless America!"},{"Title":"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism","review":"Much of the exhaustive research in this book is outdated, well-known by world governments, involved many of the world governments when the events/transactions were taking place.

It is what criticism should be. I gained much in my own understanding of Teilhard, and am grateful to Rideau. I recommend this work to anyone who wants to struggle with Teilhard's thought.

This book is all about cooking duck using most techniques common to other types of meats plus at least one which is unique to duck and other fatty fowl. The nine techniques / preparations chapters are:SauteingBraisingRoastingConfit - a French cooking and preservation method unique, I believe, to ducks and geeseSmokingCuringSoupsSaladsTerrines and MoussesIt's interesting that while poaching is a common cooking technique for chicken, the technique is not included here for duck. This technique is largely replaced by the confit method. This is just one clue to the fact that a duck is different from a chicken and methods which work for one will not work for the other. The biggest difference is the level of fat in a duck's skin (but not in it's meat). This is simply due to the fact that ducks can fly and chickens cannot and ducks spend a lot of time in the water. This also explains why almost all duck meat is dark, more similar to a chicken's legs than to it's breast meat.The difference between ducks and chickens is the main thing which makes this book valuable in itself, especially since many of the techniques appear to be unique to duck cookery. A second great value to the book is that it spells out the right way to cook to avoid fatty flesh if your primary interest is to avoid the saturated fat without loosing out on the great taste of duck.Aside from the confit method, one of the best values derived from duck is the high quality of the broth one can make from duck, in many ways as valuable and as flavorful as stocks derived from veal. The only drawback is that to make a decent amount of duck broth, you need 12 carcasses or equivalent amount of leftover pieces.This book is by far the most complete collection of duck recipes I could find. The next closest sources are the Cooks Illustrated book entitled 'Chicken', with about 28 pages of duck recipes and 'Beard on Birds' by James Beard which has 19 pages devoted to duck, including many of the recipes included in Peterson's book. In fact, it is a sign of the times that Beard's book, published in 1979 (and probably date back at least 20 to30 years before that time) have several recipes on wild duck while Peterson deals exclusively with the two most common domesticated duck sources, the Long Island (or Pekin) duck and the Mullard duck, the most common source of cryovac packed duck breast.Comparing Peterson to Beard, one finds that while Beard has good recipes, equal to his reputation in American culinary education, Peterson has superior recipes and excellently detailed techniques and explanations for the duck specific methods. Worthy of his book on culinary techniques, the photographic instructions on cutting raw duck and carving roasted birds are impeccable.Peterson's work has placed him high in the ranks of American cookbook authors and this book is a worthy addition to his canon. In past books, I have occasionally found a bit of less than perfect sequencing of steps, so that one must be very careful to read his recipes through and think them through before beginning, but I find none of that clumsiness here. His impeccible descriptions of a sometimes demanding technique are invaluable.If I collected cookbooks for no other reason than to be an easy source of recipes, this is the type of book I would most quickly buy. Adding to the values is the selection of excellent oversize paged photographs of completed dishes joining the great color photos illustrating the techniques.Duck has an aura of luxury about it for a very reasonable price (as long as you leave off the foie gras). This book can be a great access to a new culinary direction. Recommended. Just be sure when selecting recipes that the type of duck matches the recipe. Recipes for fatty ducks may give poor results with leaner birds."},{"Title":"Duck Cookbook","review":"I was intrigued with the idea of cooking duck breast, and after I tried and failed, I figured I could benefit from learning as much as possible about the different ways to cook duck. Since I knew how to cook a whole duck, I figured it would not be difficult to cook just the breast, but failed miserably. Consequently, I set out to look for a cookbook that would show me all the secrets of cooking duck.This book not only did that, but it helped me understand what I did wrong. The recipe I used before purchasing the book was from Spain. Over there, is more common to buy a duck which is smaller than the one you get in the U.S., so I should have cooked at a higher temperature and a bit longer.I recommend it to those who have never cooked duck before, as well as to those that are interested in gastronomic adventures beyond typical duck recipes."},{"Title":"Duck Cookbook","review":"I've never met a duck I didn't like. If a restaurant has duck on the menu, that's the item I'll order. So buying a copy of The Duck Cookbook by James Petersen (I have several of his other cookbooks) was never really in question. What's surprising is that it took me years, YEARS to actually cook something from it.Initially, I expected several variations on roast duck, smoked duck, etc. But Petersen actually has few recipes for a whole bird. He found that since the breast is generally overcooked by the time the legs are cooked, most recipes are for duck breasts or duck legs or duck in pieces. That could work fine if I had an easy-to-get-to source for duck parts, but the local supermarkets (even the gourmet stores) sell a whole duck frozen for a not-too-unreasonable price, or they sell small packages of (usually frozen) duck breasts for prices that take my breath away. Unless I'm ready to take a trip to the Chinese market downtown (where duck costs little more than does chicken -- which darnit is as it SHOULD be), I have few opportunities to buy, say, 6 duck legs.This slowed down my opportunity to cook from The Duck Cookbook, though not my appreciation. The recipes are great -- or at least they seem so. Chapters are devoted to sauteing, braising, roasting, confit, smoking, curing, soups, salads, and terrines and mousses. They range from simple techniques (sauteed duck breasts) to elaborate variations (duck breast with blueberries, or duck breasts with chihuacle negro chiles, raisins, and almonds). There's plenty of recipes for items that use duck as an ingredient, such as hot-and-sour soup with duck (really, why haven't I made this already?!) or duck bouillabaisse. Even better, Petersen demystifies duck cooking, such as what to do with the fat, and is illuminating about other items (he extolled pistachio oil, enough so that I bought an entire tin when the recipe called for only a few tablespoons -- and I don't regret it).But despite the number of times I've read this cookbook, I've made only two things: basic roast duck (with predictably perfect results), and endive and duck confit salad with Belgian endive and pecans (great starter for a holiday meal). It's made me enthusiastic to use the cookbook more often -- perhaps it's worth the drive to the Chinese grocery after all.If you have a ready supply of ducks -- get this book. If you're stuck with supermarket options just as I am, it may be of lesser value. But it's still a good \\"reading\\" cookbook!"},{"Title":"Duck Cookbook","review":"I love duck but could never find a satsifactory recipe for it.

At first the Small Animals of the Hill aren't too worried; they at least have warning and can stockpile. But curmudgeonly Uncle Analdas Rabbit is sure this will be a \\"tough winter,\\" and he turns out to be far too right. The Caretakers hired to look after the Big House are slovenly and unpleasant, the weather is cold and the snow deep, and slowly, as the endless weeks grind by, more and more of the animals must abandon the Hill in search of food or to get away from the Caretakers' brutish dog. At last only Little Georgie, Willie Fieldmouse, and Father Rabbit (who has fallen ill) remain awake and about (though Phewie Skunk and old Porky the Groundhog are happily hibernating in the latter's burrow). Even Uncle Analdas, as tough an old Rabbit as ever made a stringy stew, has inexplicably vanished (what his family doesn't know is that he has resolved to follow the Folks to the Bluegrass Country and bring them home to save the day). There are moments of rare beauty, such as the Hill-wide reunion on Christmas-eve night; humor, as when Phewie is recruited to \\"skunk\\" the marauding Dog; and above all a heart-clutchingly authentic picture of what the wild things must endure. Though perhaps not a book for the most tender-hearted young animal lovers, it does tell a story of undaunted hope and courage, and in the end the Folks return and all is well again. A classic tale of animal heroism in the face of everyday challenges."},{"Title":"The tough winter (Dell yearling book)","review":"Fans of Robert Lawson's intricate, humorous children's book illustrations (Ferdinand, Adam of the Road) should know that he wrote as well. And boy, could he write! The Tough Winter was first published in the fifties, but it's still fresh as paint. The Hill is a small collection of homesteads in rural Connecticut but through Little Georgie the rabbit's eyes, it's a huge country, with dangerous obstacles (dogs)and delightful neighbors. Lawson fills almost every page with amusing drawings. The plot gets down to business immediately. The text is timeless; we're reading it to both our youngest and our jaded oldest children. It's a great read-aloud book. Fans should keep their eyes open for the other in this series, &quot;Rabbit Hill&quot;, equally good."},{"Title":"The tough winter (Dell yearling book)","review":"Ah, sequels. Can they ever live up to the original? Can Tough Winter fill me with the same calm and appreciation for animals that Rabbit Hill did? Should it even have to invoke the same feelings? No, but this didn't stop me from wanting it to, expecting it to, and being disappointed when it didn't. Does this mean you should skip reading Tough Winter? No, but you might want to wait to read it until Rabbit Hill has become just a fond memory so that you won't compare them.Reunion shows tend to be well-viewed, because fans like seeing all their favorite cast members together for yet another adventure. And Tough Winter is a likeable enough read, because all the familar parade of animals reappear. Even the same old humans show up. As for the adventure, well with winter right around the corner, the new folks decide to find a warmer locale. Silly folk! Why would they leave their home barely after having moved into it? I suppose they craved some of that Bluegrass Kentucky weather that Father always raves about. In their place, the new folk will leave caretakers. Stupid folk! Don't they know that caretakers can't be trusted? Worse, city folk make a mess of the countryside.Yes, despite the faith by some of the animals that the new folks will leave orders for the caretakers about taking care of the hill creatures, the caretakers turn out to be abysmal substitutes. They bring a city dog, guns, and cigarettes. If all these troubles weren't enough, Uncle Analdus is predicting a bad winter-and he is normally right. Danger blasts through each chapter of Tough Winter, coming in the form of a dog who endangers animal young, a caretaker who shoots at garden marauders, and even a stray cigarette that sweeps over the hill.Not until the hill succumbs to snow and ice does Lawson really allow us to spend time with the critters that we grew to love in Rabbit Hill, which is my main problem with the book. It's as if I had set out on a leisurely country drive to visit a friend, only to find myself having to elude fighting neighbors, raging drivers, and gusting winds. This isn't to say that weren't memorable moments before winter arrived. For example, there was the rescue of the new folks' cat by the field mice and the deer. There was also the rescue of Porky Woodchuck from the caretakers' dog by Phewy Skunk. Unfortunately, they feel overshadowed by all the drama invoked by the evil caretakers.Once Lawson returns to focusing solely on the animals, I feel drawn again into the charm of Rabbit Hill. I love the surprise that awaited the animals on Christmas Eve--even if no it wasn't a much-needed return of the new folks. The anticipation and glory of Groundhog Day is a hoot. And the journey of Uncle Analdus is heart-breaking and priceless. Lawson once again makes the animals feel alive to me as if they were living in my own backyard.When reunion shows end, whatever their merits, fans will typically clamor for yet another. Similarly, as I reached the final chapter of Tough Winter, which is a decent enough book, I regret that Lawson wrote only one follow-up book about Georgie, his family, their friends, and the new folks."},{"Title":"The tough winter (Dell yearling book)","review":"When Uncle Analdas, the old, old rabbit, predicted that a tough winter was coming, all the Hill animals said he was just getting old and gloomy. But as usual, Uncle Analdas was right. Thanksgiving brought ice, a major food shortage, and the beginning of a hard season. And then, when the Folks went away to Bluegrasss country for the winter, and left a neglectful caretaker and a mean dog in charge, every dweller on the Hill knew that Uncle Analdas' prophcey was coming true in more than one way! The story of how the various animals survive the winter...is well-written, and compliments Lawson's illustrations well. A great followup to Rabbit Hill, and a good prequel to Edward, Hoppy and Joe :-)"},{"Title":"The tough winter (Dell yearling book)","review":"The Tough WinterBy: Lawson, RobertReviewed by: D KimThis story is about a group of animals living near a forest and a lovely house. The rabbit elder, Uncle Analdas predicts that there is a harsh and tough winter coming up. Everyone thinks that he is just getting older, but soon everyone realizes that he is right. They ry to gather materials as soon as they can although it's hard and they know that they might not see spring because they will die of hunger. The main character, a young little rabbit is the grandson of Uncle Analdas. He knows how harsh the winter is and he ponders if he could ever see spring again.I iked this book because it shows the result of something if you are not ready. \\"It was a welcome treat, since the last scrap of hay had been consumed that morning for breakfast.\\" \\" That fire burned up every scrap of food, even most of what we had stored away.\\" Soon eveyone is dying and everyone is skin and bones. All the animals in the hill wished that they had listened to Uncle Analdas. Now Georgie's best friend lives with him beacuse his food store was burned down and he has nowhere to go.I also disliked this book because it shows how grumpy a person can be. Uncle Analdas was a very old and grumpy rabbit. He aways thought of the negative things and never the positive things. On groundhog day, when the groundhog saw his shadow, the old rabbit got very mad. He stamped on the ground and yelled at it. He stormed back to his home didn't talk to anyone for a while.My favorite part was when told the young animals a story. He told the story next to the warm soothing fire. He told them of a wonderful land where there was plentiful food and the people were very kind. Everyone, even Uncle Analdas listened in awe. It was like dreamland but father said that it was very far aaway...."},{"Title":"The Relationship Workbook","review":"Already, this product has been worthy for a therapeutic counseling setting.

Hanafuda was developed in Japan after the introduction of Western playing cards over 350 years ago. Instead of the usual Jack, Queen, King configuration of cards, the Japanese developed a 48-card deck consisting of 12 suits, each of which has 4 cards. The twelve suits represent the 12 months, and each month features a flower or plant that is in season for that month. This reflects the Japanese sensitivity to the passing of the seasons. Another difference is that the cards are smaller than Western playing cards and are made of a heavy card stock.This book shows how to play this game. It is basically a matching game in it's simplest form. You attempt to match cards in your hand with those of the same suit in the discard area. After you master the basic game, then you can try more complex forms in which you try to assemble special hands, similar to poker or mah jongg.This is a really fun game, and it's cool factor is increased due to the fact that this game is traditionally associated with the Yakuza. Try it out and show off your tough side."},{"Title":"Hanafuda the Flower Card Game","review":"This book covers the basics of Hanafuda in easy to follow text with plenty of pictures.You will learn how to identify the cards, build sets, score, and several variations. The most space is devoted to the standard 3-5 player game of Hanafuda (the Japanese version).The only drawback that I could see was that there was not enough space given to more of the variations. Specifically, I was interested in the Godori (or Go-Stop) rules used in Korea. But the book title is Hanafuda, so I shouldn't have expected them there. I had also heard that there is even a way to use Hanafuda cards for a solitaire game--this wasn't covered in the text."},{"Title":"Hanafuda the Flower Card Game","review":"I bought this book a while back after getting a set of Nintendo Hanafuda cards online. I think it is indispensible. What I especially liked is the flap on the back cover of my edition with all of the cards listed with pictures, seasons, names, and point value. This is very handy to use during a game. I even photo-copy it and hand it out to players along with the page on bonus point combinations in Honeymoon Hanafuda. There are a few confusing errors in text/illustrations, which is the only reason this didn't get five stars. Since this is the 14th edition, I would have expected them to be ironed out by now. For example, on page 27,the board and hand cards are mislabeled. There are a few others, which can make it very confusing for a beginner like me! Eventually figured them all out and pencilled in the correct descriptions. I would recommend this book to anyone starting out."},{"Title":"Hanafuda the Flower Card Game","review":"The book is good and has several games that can be played BUT if you live in Australia, don't bother buying it unless you already have the actual cards.

I have better dictionaries which are more comprehensive.No need for extra words.Thanks"},{"Title":"Arabic Practical Dictionary: Arabic-English/English-Arabic","review":"In looking through the other reviews, I'm shocked that nobody mentioned the little errors. It's riddled with little spelling mistakes. For example, on pg 316, library is taught as \\"maktaba\\" and this is true, but the Arabic spelling renders the word as \\"maktab\\", which is desk. It's missing the taa marboota letter at the end. Chocolate, on pg 249, has a haa at the end instead of the taa marboota (the difference is just two dots), which makes it read as \\"sheekoolathu\\". There are also a few questionable transliterations, such as dog on pg 269. The English reads as \\"kalb\\", when it's more like \\"kelb\\", but it's enough for an Arab to think you mean the human heart (\\"qalb\\"). On pg 294, the English for hand reads \\"ayaadin\\" when it should be \\"ayaad\\", however, the Arabic is correct. A few places have a noun labeled as a verb. The difference is as little as the taa marboota at the end.This book is advertised on the back as written for students, travelers, journalists and politicians. What it doesn't say is that it's ideal for Christian missionaries as well. This is just my position. It has the translations (correctly) for words like angel, the Bible, chorus, Christian, cross, crusade, Easter, flock, flood, hymn, priest, prophet, Protestant, proverb and the Noble Quran. My only issue with the Christian vocabulary is that its translation for Christmas and birthday is the same word. Birthday is \\"meelaad\\" and Christmas is \\"al-meelaad\\" (THE birth). Being unaware of this could make one wish merriment in completely the wrong way.Still, for its price and thickness, it makes a handy, concise guide that was just right for me. The back and front contain little charts listing important things like numbers, the alphabet and denonyms. You can survive in the Middle East with this book and learn a lot but you should already know the alphabet before buying it.Amy Michelle MosierAuthor of Aktuboo: A Guide to using the Arabic Script"},{"Title":"Arabic Practical Dictionary: Arabic-English/English-Arabic","review":"I was enrolled in an intensive, 20-hour/week Arabic class, and I was in serious need of a good dictionary that I could carry around in my backpack.

Typically, however, consulting this dictionary first saves me a great deal of time and headache. It also includes both translation and transliteration of all terms, which is very helpful when you're stumped about the pronunciation of a word.

I also bought the Hans Wehr dictionary, which of course, is Arabic-English only. I think this 'Practical Dictionary' is a useful for English-speakers, in that it works how dictionaries work in European languages: words are arranged alphabetically, not according to the root ('jadhr'). Sure, once you're used to dealing with roots, and with some practise, it'll probably become easy to look things up, but when you're just trying to get your homework done in time for class, this book works well.It goes from each language into the other, which makes it a handy little dictionary. Not quite pocketsize, but certainly easy to carry around in your backpack/briefcase.As for the fonts, I'd say the Arabic font is adequate. For some reason, the English font is quite a bit bigger, especially the headers in the English-Arabic section, and so when you go back to look up an Arabic word, all of a sudden, it seems unnecessarily small by contrast."},{"Title":"Arabic Practical Dictionary: Arabic-English/English-Arabic","review":"This dictionary seems good enough for advanced as well as beginner students in Arabic. My only beef with it is that it usually does not have the short vowels printed there along with the consonants which are of immense help to the beginner.

I was looking for a concise pocket dictionary to carry with me to class to suppliment the Hans Wehr Dictionary. I found this dictionary acceptable as a reference but not super helpful. It contains pretty basic vocabulary. If you are loking for anything more complicated, such as 'exile', it is pretty worthless. Although it does contain tranliterations of words, there is hardly any vowling. I found the the Oxford better as E-A since it includes voweling, multiple meanings and and also prepositions. However, the Oxford dictionary also has problems with accuraccy. The fact that the A-E section is aphebetical also makes looking up Arabic words combersium.

The vocabulary it offers is very contemporary, the Arabic is printed in a nice-looking font, and quality English-Arabic dictionaries of any size are hard to find. So I made a lot of use it for classes where written compositions were assigned. And it isn't too heavy to carry around and won't take up a lot of room in a briefcase or book bag. My one criticism would be that the Arabic-English half is organized by alphabetical order, not by roots as most Arabic dictionaries are. Best suggestion: get this along with Hans Wehr (Arabic-English only) and get going right away learning to look up words by roots. It's a slow and painstaking learning process, but it's a very necessary skill in learning Arabic, so it's really better not to put it off.

First of all, it has an up-to-date vocabulary (2004 publication), and it fits their budgets, as it's very inexpensive, compared to most university textbooks today; and it also contains almost everything they'll need in the way of grammatical points. The Arabic-English section is great training for students just beginnning to look up words using the Arabic script. The Arabic words are also transliterated, and I am a great believer in transliteration (if it's used correctly). Transliteration will solve any reading problems a student might have and allow that student to refocus quickly on the Arabic script with the right pronunciation in his or her head. Noun plurals are given and this is especially helpful with the broken plurals in Arabic. Any vowel changes that occur in the various forms of the verbs are also listed.

They were a defensive/reative force, we in the Army air cavaly were the offensive force. Book doesn't mention that because the seawolves had to operate off of boats, they couldn't carry our ammo load and therefore couldn't stay in the fighting as long as army gunships.

I was a doorgunner with the Seawolves at the same time as Dan, however, at a different detachment. His experiences, although different, brought back similar experieces that I had gone through. The baptism of fire in earning Combat Aircrew wings was similar throughout each Seawolf detachment. The spirit that embodied the Navy Seawolves was living thing no matter in what detachment you served. Our one mission, as far as the pilots and gunners were concerned was to not leave any comrads on the ground or in trouble. Our history, as detailed in Dan's book, bears this action out.

I was priviliged to be a member of the Seawolves' support unit at Binh Thuy. I saw them go out and I saw them come back. Once in a while I got to see them &quot;work out&quot; from the deck of a boat. Watching them roll in on their &quot;loop de loop&quot; and seeing the results was a sight I'll never forget.

Even though I am a 35 year old woman and don't have much military history to lean on, this book was easy to read, exciting and hard to put down.I recommend this book to anyone who flew in gunships, is a true Vietnam Veteran, or who is just interested in helicopters in Vietnam.Dan Kelly's experience with the Navy's Sea Wolves in Vietnam is more than what most people can handle in a lifetime. Suffering two painful injuries and serving two tours of duty and flying as door gunner through some of the most horrendous circumstances is the stuff heros are made of.The fact that he stresses going to Vietnam was *his choice*, and choosing the Sea Wolves was *his choice* shows you just what kind of man Dan Kelly is. It also shows you what kind of men flew with the Sea Wolves: The men you want to rescue you when you are in deep trouble.The men of the Sea Wolves were the kind of men you knew you could count on when you needed them. I'd be proud to fly with them anyday.Buy this book if you have the guts to fly along. You will re-learn what you may have forgotten about honor and heroism."},{"Title":"Seawolves: First Choice","review":"Dan Kelly has provided us with an extremely well written autobiography of his life with as a Seawolf. The book is articulate, very well thought out, contains sadness, empathy, glory, and pain. As a work it reads like fiction, easy to understand with an excellant storyline. His story of the Seawolves, as seen from the point of view of a 20 year old Crew Chief/Gunner is exceptionally factual and accurate. I know, I too was a Seawolf"},{"Title":"Seawolves: First Choice","review":"The detailed descriptions the author uses to go inside his head and catch a glimpse of what it must have felt like in Vietnam are well chronicled. Each night I could not force myself to read self-help books for wanting to get back to the action with Dan Kelly. This book goes further than recounting war stories;rather, it takes an opportunity to teach of our duty, our responsibility, to take responsibility for our choices. The author is a very positive person and being that after learning of some of his adventures is truly remarkable. Like he once told me when I asked how is he so upbeat on life after serving our country through the harrowing adventures he did, he replied, &quot;When you get that close to death,then and only then, will you know what it is like to live.&quot;"},{"Title":"Seawolves: First Choice","review":"Dan Kelly's &quot;Seawolves: First Choice&quot; is an action packed true-to-life Vietnam adventure. Dan captures the spirit of our involvement there, and takes the reader into the heart of battle with his personal experiences. I've known Dan for a number of years..but, I really didn't know Dan until I read his account of his experiences in Vietnam. This not only gives me a new appreciation of Dan, but a new appreciation of what he and his Seawolf buddies had to go through. It is interesting to note that without the Seawolves help and support in the thick of battle..the Seal Units would not have had the success that they had. Knowing Dan, I could see his personality coming through loud and clear. It was like I was there with him; hearing his laughter, his funny comments and just being around this charismatic character. This running commentary captures &quot;a day in the life of&quot; a Seawolf. I highly recommend this book to anyone that would like to know what it was really like in 'Nam. This would make a GREAT movie! I can't wait to read the follow-up books by Dan. He has a real talent in capturing and sharing with the reader &quot;real life&quot; experiences. Dan, thanks for sharing my friend!

They became a tight-knit family with the SEALS and the river-boat crews in the back-water swamps, canals, and rivers of the Mekong Delta. Anyone who understands the idea of standing by family when the world is going to worms can under-stand this amazing brotherhood of warriors. They frequently, and willingly flew into the jaws of certain destruction rather than abandon ship-mates under intense enemy fire. Although it might have looked like suicide, they were usually amazingly successful; and they went back and did it again and again! The Seawolves is Dan Kelly's story; it is their story. He was a Seawolf door gunner, trained to perch off ballance out the side door of a shaking UH-1 helicopter in a 110 miles-per-hour slipstream and shoot the eyes off a potato 500 to 1000 feet distant with an awkward M-60 machine gun fired free-hand. 43 Seawolves didn't come home from Vietnam; many others lost limbs to enemy action. All were heroes. Dan Kelly's book is an exciting read; it builds to a climax that candidly reveals just how hazzardous their mission and daily routine really was. I know; I was one of them."},{"Title":"Seawolves: First Choice","review":"I loved this book! It was interesting exiting and funny. I could not put it down. I was very interesting to learn about Veitnam witch is a very complicated subject but Kelly makes it easy to understand."},{"Title":"Seawolves: First Choice","review":"First, I was a \\"black shoe\\" (engineer) not an air-dale. While I did work with and knew members of HAL-3 DET 9, I am no expert in helicopter combat. Still, I will take \\"als932\\" to task for what I am sure is an innocently mistaken comment. In fact the book does specifically point out that later model UH-1 gun-ships do have more firepower and loiter time. The author points this out and credits US Army helicopters with coming to their assistance when they were attempting to rescue a downed Seawolf.As I served eight years eleven months including one \\"West Pac\\" and two tours in country in the US Navy before switching to the US Army NG where I retired, I appreciate books like this one that do give credit and acknowledgment to the other branches. One major point that the author makes is that whether it was Seals, SF, River Rats, 9th ID, Navy aviation, Army aviation or ARVN, we were on the same team and worked together."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing: The Tactical Secrets of Lake Fishing","review":"I'm just starting out fishing and I own a boat. This book did a great job of explaining how and where to troll on a lake. It also described a good process for locating fish on a lake. Finally, it was easy to read, fairly short, and to the point.If you're bank or fly fishing (i.e. not trolling), I'd probably get a different book. While you can still get good information about location, fish behavior, etc, you'd probably get frustrated with all the trolling specific content.The only question the writers didn't answer is how they got their wifes to agree to so much fishing. Now that would have been a secret worth sharing... Great job on the book guys."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing: The Tactical Secrets of Lake Fishing","review":"Just finished reading this book. Maybe it's because I'm an engineer, but I loved Rychkun's logical approach to finding and catching fish. This book pulled all the generalities I'd heard together (fish on a slack tide, fish early in the morning, fish at creek mouths, fish deep when it's hot etc) into a practical method to attack the spot you are fishing. It backs up the method with the scientific reasoning for each strategy.Without giving away too much of the book, most fish behaviour is driven by the following priorities:- they need to find the correct temperature of water- they need to find enough oxygen to breathe- they need to find food- they need to avoid predators and harsh elements- they need to reproduce.The theme of the book is that if you understand where in the water the fish are most likely to satisfy as many of the above needs, then this area will statistically have more fish, and hence statistically speaking you should catch more. It's not a guarantee - we all know there's no such thing in fishing - but I'm convinced it will increase your chances.Overall a very informative and readable book. I didn't like the way the short 'On the Water' stories were written, as the dialogue in them seemed to be too technical to be 'verbal' - but this is a small point. I give a hearty recommendation for this book.The book reminds me a little of a Ben Hogan?? quote when a reporter commented that he seemed to have more than his fair share of luck. Hogan replied &quot;Funnily enough, the more I practice, the luckier I get&quot;. I'm hoping that after reading this book and applying the principles I'm a luckier angler...."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing: The Tactical Secrets of Lake Fishing","review":"I lost my copy and am buying another. This book is as simple, yet logical, as it gets. Stop flogging the water. Be in the right place at the right time, everytime.

The pros are the first to admit that there are few hard-and-fast rules on the water. You can find fish one day, and they'll be gone the next, for no apparent reason. Depressing, isn't it?According to the author, we eliminate unproductive areas of water, reducing our fishing to only the productive areas of the lake. Sounds good, right?Now let's analyze the \\"predictable patterns\\":1. correct temperature -- trout can't handle water above 75 degrees F2. oxygen -- most lakes have adequate oxygen from the surface down to thirty feet, or deeper3. food -- finding trout prey is just as challenging as finding the trout themselvesNow let's use the \\"predictable patterns\\" to formulate our fishing plan: Fish in the first 30 feet of the water column that is also less than 75 degrees. Not that helpful, is it? Our plan still leaves lot of water to cover.This book does discuss the topic of fishing for trout in lakes from a non-motorized boat. There isn't much information on this subject, and it makes for good reading on a day when we can't go fishing. Just don't take it too seriously when the fish refuse to be \\"predictable.\\""},{"Title":"Trout Fishing: The Tactical Secrets of Lake Fishing","review":"This book was exactly as described by the author, a common sense approach for finding fish in a lake.

It is very informative and packed with information that history buffs will love. It also explains the evolution of Las Vegas from a western town teetering on the edge of becoming a ghost town to the boom that started with the building of the Hoover (Boulder) Dam and continues today. This book is very academic in nature, so you have to love history to like this book. Overall a very interesting book."},{"Title":"A Short History Of Las Vegas: Second Edition","review":"The Lands have an easy, breezy writing style. In particular they bring the last 100 years of Las Vegas history alive with many photos of the times and observations of citizens and visitors alike who were there. Although they do not discuss the role the divorce business or the wedding industry played in the city's development (and weddings are associated with Vegas almost as much as gaming), the picture of the city presented here is fun and informative. To quote the authors quoting Steve Wynn, \\"Las Vegas is a party that never stops. God bless this daffy place.\\""},{"Title":"A Short History Of Las Vegas: Second Edition","review":"This books gives an general overall history of Las Vegas and its chameleonistic changes over time. From the dawn of mans first wanderings into the Las Vegas area to modern day gambling mecca and suburban success, this book packs a short, but sweet punch into a somewhat short span. This book is good for people interested in Las Vegas history where general Nevada history leaves off,"},{"Title":"A Short History Of Las Vegas: Second Edition","review":"During preparations for a trip to Las Vegas, my daughter asked the question: \\"How did something like Las Vegas end up growing in the desert?\\"While I had been to Las Vegas before, I had only vague awareness of the forces driving its explosive growth in the post WWII years. \\"A Short History of Las Vegas\\" is an excellent resource for clearing up some of that vagueness.Myrick and Barbara Land take a straight-ahead chronologically ordered approach to laying out the history of Las Vegas. They begin with the archeological evidence of its pre-history, take us through the first native American, Mexican and European discoveries that have accompanying historical data. Then they walk the reader through the exploration of Fremont, the growth of the railroad (attracted by the fresh water springs that gave rise to the city's Spanish name...\\"the meadows\\"), the construction of the Hoover Dam, the growth of legalized gambling and liberalized divorce laws, and WWII and post-WWII growth from the growing entertainment (and organized crime!) and nuclear testing industries. Whew.They close with another portrait of Las Vegas, the place that houses more than a million residents who not only make the gaming and entertainment industries work, but the place that serves as a suburban home for those who work there.This is a book that is free of agenda, and doesn't offer a judgement on the goodness --or lack of-- in the illusion-manufacturing that drives much of the regional commerce. There is perhaps a little too much emphasis on the destruction of older gambling properties in favor of describing the town's second and third generation development...but this does not diminish the overall usefulness of the book in grounding the reader in the essential history of Las Vegas.Whether you've been there, going there, or just have in interest in famous American places: if you want a fundamental understanding of how Las Vegas became what it is today, this book is a good choice."},{"Title":"A Short History Of Las Vegas: Second Edition","review":"This history of Las Vegas is indeed short but more important than that, nearly every page is interesting and entertaining. I was not all that impressed with the final chapter about what there is to do and see outside the city which is why this book only gets 4 stars instead of 5. That last chapter seemed misplaced in this book. But the entire rest of the book which tells the history of the city is wonderful. It gives you all the most interesting stories and information without overdoing it. It is just enough for someone who wants an overview of the city but isn't all that interested in becoming an expert."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"First things first: if you are reading this review, it is probably because you are considering not just Walden, but Walden on audio. Does it work in that medium?Have no fear: not only does Walden not LOSE something by being read, it probably gains something from Mel Foster's excellent performance. My first experience with his reading was the production of William Bernstein'sA Splendid Exchange, and it was disappointing -- flat and lifeless. But he did a fine job with James Kugel'sHow to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now, and this is terrific, too; I'll assume the mediocre job with the Bernstein was the producer's fault.Now, to the book. So much has been written about it, both on Amazon and elsewhere, that there is little more to say. But I will say this: if you read it in college, or if, like me, you merely PRETENDED to read it in college, pick it up again later in life. It is worth reading, and studying, and savoring.Walden is thought of as the urtext of nature writing, particularly American nature writing, but that really understates the matter -- thus, my assessment of it as an \\"underrated\\" classic. It is really so much more: an essay on the nature and purpose of human existence, an exploration of human nature itself, and an example of how we can see the sacred in the mundane. Indeed, one could argue that Thoreau was not so much writing about nature, but using nature as a way of seeing the supernatural -- looking THROUGH nature to grasp the reality of the unseen.And forget any notion you may have had about Thoreau, the dreamer: this is actually a very practical man, who strives hard to show that what he is doing can be a model for what all people should do. Not that they should go live in a cabin, but rather that they can and should seek their own unique path of existence. (Thus, the different drummer). It is no accident that the first and longest chapter is entitled \\"Economy\\": Thoreau wants to demonstrate that following a different IS possible if we prepare ourselves. If he is not fully convincing that anyone can do anything they want and make it stick, he is, in my view, unanswerable in his assertion that we cannot and must not be satisfied with what we are given, or what tradition or even our own habits tell us what we \\"should\\" do. If for nothing else, Walden is must-reading for anyone, young or old, religious or atheist, American or citizen of any nation. Or even no nation."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"How does one review a classic? In this day of eco-spirituality, Thoreau is a must-read. This edition is easy to read, but not the best quality paper. I don't expect it to have a long shelf life.Thoreau is one of the saints of American ecology. His writing takes one to a different time and place, and yet one in which the rape of the landscape was already taking place. I suggest following Walden with Annie Dillard's marvelous Pingrim and Tinker's Creek.Emerson's essay on Thoreau is a happy bonus."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I concur that this is indeed the best edition of Walden. The editing by Mr Cramer is superb, as well as his Afterword. The format of the book is better than any other I have seen. I am glad I bought it. You will not be sorry you did."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Strangely surprising how pertinent many of Thoreau's perceptions, opinions and insights on habits and values are to modern day society and culture. And impressive how vehemently he professes these views in some sections. No sugar coating here. This is raw stuff, presented with language and skill we've lost over the years.My favorite quote: \\"One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels\\"Thoreau is inspired and inspiring."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"It has been 40 years since I first slogged through this classic. This time, I thought, it would go much easier. But, I find that my penchants have not changed any more than Thoreau's dispositions. For me, it was the same old slog.Of course, Thoreau has earned his place as an immortal. Of all the Transcendentalists, he is the one with clear opinions about moral issues. He knew slavery was evil, the Mexican War a land grab, civil disobedience a honorable course. Were he still alive, I'm sure he would be goading us yet. He would likely favor the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. Perhaps he would be advising Native Americans to retain their savage edge. In a world of finite resources and new gizmos every Christmas, \\"Simplify, Simplify\\" would still be his clarion call. Given his scorn for government, the military and do-gooders, he would probably hold libertarian sentiments. Vegans would love him. I don't think he'd be hogging the cameras though- to interview him you'd have to search estates, reservations or Hindu monasteries. My point is that Thoreau is still relevant to many current events and many disparate groups can cite his influence.But all this does not improve Walden nor does it make Henry a more appealing sage. For whom was this minimalist tract intended in the age of industry? Thoreau does not seek converts. He lays out his way with indifference to its reception. Walden is filled with classical references and quotes from Hindu scripture. Surely, Henry must have reflected on some of his less bright Harvard classmates who had gone on to run railroads or manufacture vanities. \\"The most delicious piece of brag in literature,\\" said John Bourroughs.After his death, Emerson quoted one of his friends: \\"I love Henry... but I cannot like him, and as for taking his arm, I should as soon think of taking the arm of an elm-tree.\\""},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau, as his many devotees (including this reader) know, is as relevant today as he was 150 years ago. His writings are available in a variety of hardback and paperback editions most of which are considerably cheaper than this book. So why purchase this particular edition. There are two reasons that seem to make sense: if you read and reread Walden a hard copy is more durable than a paperback; and this edition includes an excellent set of notes placed side by side with the original text which is a real convenience.So what about the book called \\"Walden\\" and Thoreau himself? Well those many folks who are devoted readers of course understand the importance of Thoreau to American letters. For someone who might like to read either Walden or one of Thoreau's other writings out of curiosity or necessity (required reading) there is one thing that this reader finds particularly interesting about him and his works: Thoreau was a practicing philosopher who created a set of values and proved their validity by living them. \\"Walden\\" among many things is an account of how the practice of such values can effect the way one lives.In academic philosophy there is a branch called \\"axiology\\" which is the study of values. Many a modern professor of philosophy would undoubtedly fault Thoreau for failing to build a value \`system' based on recognized philosophic criteria. Well, this is the difference between a professor of philosophy and an actual philosopher. Thoreau did not profess a philosophy he lived a philosophy. The values that he developed if adopted today by an individual would be just as practical and lead to the same level of happiness as in his day. Reading through Walden provides a running account of how to deal with mundane chores necessary to live (and live well) and to deal with the more cosmic issues of space and time (as understood by the individual). There are of course other tangible benefits that come from reading Thoreau, but obtaining a philosophy for living is certainly among them."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden has always been a big influence on my life since the first time I read in school. To this day I ask myself, \\"Do I really need all these things that I'm stressing about?\\" And then, I think of the few things in life that are really necessary. It's a healthy reality check and a great re-read."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Back in high school this was required reading...not the whole thing but a decent chunk. Pretty much all of us became obsessed with this book and we'd talk about it all the time, both during and after class. Our teacher was really good at his job, but this is also simply and amazing book. It's really a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I was thinking about how I found out that Thoreau's birthday was one day after mine. It was coincidence that one of my instructors told the class about her father's devotion to Thoreau's work. Then I realized how much he is quoted when people talk about living in a thoughtful way. If you need a reason to live life more fully then read this book. I didn't agree with everything he said but just from his writing I could see his personality and imagine talking to him about modern living and how people lose a lot because of it. He wrote about living in the woods (exciting huh!). However, it comes across as more of an account of his inner journey than just his experiences at Walden Pond. His view on spirituality was more about individual search then just sticking with what you were taught. Thoreau said he'd rather have truth than love and other things people strive for (and truth is something that you have to search for, rarely does it appear on your doorstep). People still read \\"Walden\\" after 150 years for its call for simplicity, which most spiritual leaders (like Jesus of Nazareth) acknowledge as a way for humans to live happily. Even if you don't read the whole thing, read the last page because it is very inspiring. Also, check out his essay \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers\\" because I think it is just as fascinating as \\"Walden\\"."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Many people have the misconception that &quot;Walden&quot; is all about how to survive in the wilderness, this completely misses the soul of the book. Thoreau didn't do his &quot;experiment&quot; to see if he could survive in the wilderness, he would have gone much farther from civilization for that. Rather, Thoreau wanted to live life on his own terms in a setting that allowed him to contemplate life on a higher scale then simply &quot;getting a living&quot;. As he states his life philosophy &quot;Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!&quot; ask yourself what it is that you NEED to make you happy, and live only for that."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden was written as a backlash against consumerism and conformity. Thoreau built his own house with affordable and left over materials and sustained himself for a very small amount of money. The philosophy that he offers is one that many of us could benefit in listening to. Do we really need the most expensive cell phone on the market, or will the free model do? Do we really need a designer bag? Does it make us any happier to buy a house that is so elaborate it will add ten more years before we can retire?Walden questions what is truly important in life and what things are unnecessary burdens that we allow society to place on us."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I guess I'm not surprised, scrolling through the many reviews of this book, to see that quite a few find it to be a tedious waste of time. This is, after all, America, where thinking critically is in critically short supply. If you are a literalist, if you've been weaned on airport novels and other pseudo-literary junk, if you are unable to relate to a multi-faceted jewel that sparkles on every imaginable level, then by all means stay away from this book.The tone of several reviews reminded me of the student in my Latin class who said one day, as we were reading a selection from Ovid's Metamorphoses, \\"This is stupid!\\" \\"No,\\" I responded tranquilly, \\"You're stupid.\\" Some people apparently expect an encounter with a great author to be a cheap turn on, like a video game or a shot of Jack Daniels. Not surprisingly, when the engagement requires the use of one's brain or at least a modicum of intellectual effort, many have to throw in the towel. The irony, of course, is that these are exactly the sort of people Thoreau was railing against in Walden.Walden, boring? You might as well say the Iliad, Hamlet, or the Canterbury Tales are boring. Walden is quite easily a work that ranks with these world-class masterpieces. Thoreau's magnum opus grows in stature with each passing year, and he ranks at the top of American prose stylists.Walden is a heroic epic, a farmer's almanac, a poem, a pastoral, a fire and brimstone sermon, an autobiography, a philosophical treatise, a journal, an annual report by a man who was the sole stockholder in his own extraordinary enterprise. It is a vicious critique of the unexamined life and a brilliant paean to the richer and more rewarding existence which is open to anyone who wishes to discover it.Like a stone tossed into a pond, Walden's influence will ripple through all of the ages to the very edge of eternity. If there ever was a book that could dramatically alter one's perception of the world, Walden is that book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden itself gets 5 stars, but this free ebook is just plain incomplete. Pretty frustrating to be reading this and to all of a sudden come across missing parts, i.e. when Thoreau is enumerating his living expenses, all the information is missing. Instead I spent the $0.99 and got a complete and well formatted version ASIN: B0056OZR26 which also has an illuminating preface by Emerson."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book is a description of Thoreau's experiment with living deliberately. From 1845-47, Thoreau lived in a small cabin that he built himself on the edge of Walden Pond, on the outskirts of Massachusetts. His brother had recently died of tetanus, and as a memorial, Thoreau wished to write an account of a week-long trip they had taken together on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, some 7 years earlier. Living in simple surroundings on the pond allowed Thoreau the time to undertake this project, which resulted in the book \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.\\" But in Walden, which was written several years after the events took place, Thoreau doesn't discuss his work on the Concord and Merrimack book at all. Instead, he lays out his philosophy of his approach to life and nature, juxtaposed with many observations of local flora, fauna, and characters.The first chapter, Economy, is an extensive tract, didactic at times, arguing for frugality and simplicity. When one remembers that this was written in the 1850s, long before electric carving knives, mp3 players, video games, or even cars, it is remarkable how clear and relevant his message still is for today. Page after page of this chapter is filled with quotes worth pondering, writing on the refrigerator, or even committing to memory. Subsequent chapters are a mix of observations on the local environment (e.g. The Ponds, Winter Animals), or Thoreau's dealings with others (Visitors, Brute Neighbors). The last chapter, Conclusion, in which Thoreau sums up his experiences living at Walden, returns to a more philosophical bent.This book speaks to all, generation after generation, and reading after reading. It frequently appears on syllabi as an assigned reading, which is too bad. While it provides much material for discussion, I'm not sure that Thoreau would have wanted anyone to be compelled to read it. As with any book, it's much more rewarding to work your way through it on your volition. Out of all of Thoreau's books, this is my favorite because of the balance it achieves between philosophy and observation, as well as for the ideas it describes."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I took only one book (Walden) recently when I packed light for a trip 240 miles down the Haul Road along the Trans Alaska Pipeline to the farthest north truck stop at Coldfoot. We live in Barrow, Alaska and wanted to get away to a simpler life for a bit.The tundra colors were spectacular and when we finally got to trees they were all gold and red. And there were caribou, dall sheep and musk ox.Our room at Coldfoot was very basic --two small beds, a chair and small closet ---that was it. No data ports, no TV, radio or phone.So we read a lot and I felt fortunate to have Thoreau with us.Even when it rained heavily and we had to shorten our daily hike, Walden Pond was there to recharge me, hopefully help me get out from under in this heavily consumer society.I love this man's insights, and am sorry he died at the early age of 45. This book is so current today. Please read it and share the ideas.Oops, now I am communicating about \\"Walden\\" over the Internet on a fairly new computer. Well, maybe will have to read the book again. Enjoy friends!!Earl"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I will not comment on Walden itself, because that is a matter whether you accept it to be a classic or not. My review is on the quality of this edition, which is superb. The book is a pleasure to hold--the paper is heavy and smooth, the print is sharp, and the award-winning illustrations are an added bonus. Unlike the other hardcover bindings out there, this is not an annotated version, so you get a pure uncluttered copy of the masterwork itself."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854. Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges. Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from. Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text. The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004). Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.\\"The Annotated Walden\\" by Philip Van Doren Stern was first released in 1970. The editor had also worked with the writings of Thomas de Quincey, Edgar Allan Poe, and Abraham Lincoln. In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes many \\"extras\\": an extensive Thoreau biography, details about the original publication, a lifetime chronology based on Thoreau's journal entries, photos of people and places featured in HDT's life and in Concord, selected woodcuts illustrative of the time, a bibliography, an index, and an annotated version of the essay CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- shed some light on the more complex references and turns of phrase. But Van Doren Stern was preoccupied with editorial minutiae: alternative phrasing between the final text and similiar journal entries, or how the final text differed from a previous draft or manuscript. As a result, these stylistic notes dominate the margins that should really offer more explanation of interest to the general reader, often making the annotations less than useful or interpretive. The index is merely a general one and doesn't help to pinpoint key passages. On the other hand, the volume is very visual and is more comprehensive than the others because of the photos, biographical material, and addition of CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. The text of WALDEN used here is a photographic reproduction of the printing used in the very first edition, which also makes thisvolume unique.Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal. Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\" (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life? Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses? Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph. He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more. His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\" Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories. At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\" So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\" (\\"Conclusion\\") Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time? Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript? Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life. Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement. Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with \\"It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau.\\" In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text. Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others. I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three. Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that \\"Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in\\" is NOT about fishing atall.Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions. Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions. If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book. If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his. Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by JeffreyCramer. It's a worthy addition to the Thoreau legacy."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I haven't picked up a free book for a while because of poor formatting issues. As I tried to read this one on my Kindle something kept bothering me. It wasn't until I was on the second page that I realized what was wrong.For some reason the entire book is off center. The right side flows all the way to the edge of the page. However, the left side starts off away from the edge. I tried to change the font to a larger size, but this just made it more noticeable.The text being off center doesn't seem like a big deal. However, I never got past it. It annoyed me so much that I ended up removing it from my Kindle because I just couldn't read it this way."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Beautiful, affordable, and edited by an undisputed expert on Thoreau's writings, this is by far the best edition available of this classic work. I cannot recommend it too highly, especially to anyone who, like me, re-reads WALDEN on a regular basis. Good size to fit into a bag or purse yet large enough for ease of reading, Cramer's scholarship is worn lightly so that the beauty of the words can shine through. This will be the standard edition for years to come. Buy plenty of copies--one to keep for yourself, the others to give as gifts."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau moved into the woods at Walden pond in Concord. However the book isnt about living in the woods. Its about stepping outside of \\"civilization\\" so that he could look at it objectively. From his perspective you see how much of the worlds misery is just stuff we bring on ourselves. like the following:\\" I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of.\\"He goes on to explain how once we have the items we need to maintain them, improve them, and in the end we end up slaves to the things we own. He looks at how we spend every waking day storing up treasures to mold or rust in a treasure room.He then goes on to look into what work is actually needed to sustain our lives. Once he has discovered this, he is amazed at the mountains of free time he has left. He uses that time to get to know the wolrd that we live in. Sort of in a \\"Song of Myself\\" sort of way.In the end this book was an inspiration to me personaly, to leave the fast paced chase of the dollar for a more relaxed and less stressfull life style. Now I chase waves and try to help out in my community. I find that I have tons of free time, and I don't even feel guilty if I waste it lying on the beach.Its not the sort of book that you get in the first read through, you will find yourself at the office or in a meeting and suddenly a passage from the book will pop into your head and suddenly it will make sense.I know this review is a little touchy feely, but if you read this book, and understand its message. It is a key to a secret club where you realize that \\"Hand Scraped solid Manchurian Walnut Floors\\" are in the end just flooring. And the truth is that Artisan Tibetan vase that you bought for such a fortune will one day be sold at a garage sale for a couple of bucks.Its a book that looks at the silliness that we take so seriously. I highly recommend this book to anybody, but especialy if you are doing well but still not happy. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"The first work I've read by Thoreau. Captures the beauty of simplicity. Looks inward instead of outward to find value."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Easy to download. Book is okay. Use on my iPad and Ipod and iPhone. That is convenient. Tata for now."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book is pure wisdom and common sense. The wasteful, consumption-oriented, more-is-better, environment-be-damned United States would be a better place if everyone read this book. It's amazing, and a bit discouraging, to realize how relevant this book is today, when one considers when it was written."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I loved reading this book and will read it again and again. It takes time to absorb, but is worth it!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I read the Doonsbury comic each day....it got me thinking about Walden Pond. Book is not what I expected but then again once you read it you know the real deal. It was a long time ago yet more modern than i expected."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Get this book and read it!No other remarks needed!It will be an enjoyable read!!!So don't hesitate and get it!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"If you plan on reading this outside with a soft breeze, or even inside with a ceiling fan, then the textbook size pages will begin to curl over time. The binding is literally blank, so you cannot tell what book it is on a bookshelf. Due to the page curling and bland cover this book is certainly not good for display or even a bookshelf.If, however, you are a Thoreau fan, then you will recognize that Thoreau himself would likely appreciate the simplicity of this design. It saves paper and resources by using a minimalist approach while containing the exact same content as any other version of this classic."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Classic..timeless...still worth the read...oh that we could all escape to the wilds in simple living...Waldens Pond..maybe we should go today..."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],x={key:0},E={key:1};function J(n,e,s,u,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",N,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),b(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const W=c(M,[["render",J],["__scopeId","data-v-255a6d46"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/56.md","filePath":"drive/56.md"}'),q={name:"drive/56.md"},C=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{F as __pageData,C as default};
