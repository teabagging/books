Copleston online again at the video site, and it is so charming, the whole thing. Bertrand Russell wins truly at every point with very elegant and ultimately rather humanly modest logic. What is so charming is that Copleston keeps going even though he is getting trounced on every point, and makes his arguments with great valor. And yet, and yet, it caused me to reflect that when Russell tried to write a \\"history\\" of philosophy he produced one of the most confusing summaries ever. Do not believe all the great praise here, for all the famous reviews seem to really be reviewing Lord Russell as a persona, who of course was incomparably brilliant, witty, charming and decorous. Or his work, which is a phenomenon in itself. But as a summarizer, he was clearly poor. Whereas, Copleston was one of the best ever, and his history of philosophy is so clear and honest, even, or maybe even especially, or modes of thought he apparently wildly disagreed with. It just seems to come down to a different talent. But as a debater with Russell, he was clearly no match, but a great sport."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's education, intelligence, style and wit are in abundant evidence. Although he does cover W. philosophy, it is in great bounds. And as much as I love Russell's piercing insights and dry wit, I occasionally cringed at the obvious British, 20th century perspective from which philosophies and philosophers were reviewed. This all works out just fine, if one knows better than to take some of his criticism as solid arguments. This book is a joy to read, even with occasional flaws."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell describes, in a clear and entertaining way, the philosophical theories of the main thinkers of Western philosophy. This is not the typical textbook, full of academic terms and complicated sentences. On the contrary, he efforts himself to explain the different concepts both clearly and easily. Although it is rather long, there's no reason to be afraid about it because it is easy to understand for people like me, who are beginners in the subject.Another intersting fact about the book, is that all theories are explained within a very detailed historical context. This contributes to the full understading of the reasons that influenced each author's ideas.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to approach philosophy through a comprehensive and easy to read work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"\\"A History of Western Philosophy\\" leaves out some of the most influential thinkers of the Twentieth Century, but it was written in and around World War II and it is often very difficult to predict who will be remembered and who will be forgotten in your own lifetime. That said, this mighty tome is a sourcebook of world-shaping ideas and precise logical arguments and contains many different ways of looking at various philosophical problems, including the perennial ones. The intricacy of Russell's understanding of each philosopher's mind is noteworthy for its clarity, and this becomes much more apparent with each reading, and even more so as the decades pass. My original copy is a paperback with a split spine, and its brown, dog-eared pages are filled with so many underlined passages now that I am loath to part with it, even though I have a new hardback in mint condition.As many reviewers have noted, Bertrand Russell disliked Nietzsche and was very critical of Rousseau. He didn't think much of Kant either, but this is what makes the book so fascinating. Russell is a lot like Nietzsche in that he is not afraid to cross swords with the greatest of philosophers, especially if their lofty notions can be sliced to ribbons by his acerbic wit and absolute mastery of logical positivistic technique. By the way, Nietzsche also had a low opinion of Kant, calling him \\"a moral fanatic a' la Rousseau.\\" And that was one of Nietzsche's kinder statements with respect to Kant, or Rousseau too for that matter. So really, Lord Russell is only giving Nietzsche a dose of his own hard medicine. His comments may seem scathing now, but we are far more forgiving of Nietzsche's type today than we would have been when Russell was writing this book. I mean, I love Nietzsche and have read almost everything he has written, but in truth he was a misanthrope who sublimated the dark side of his personality into a philosophy of power. His \\"girlfriend,\\" Lou Salome' knew this about him, and told Freud. Thus, Nietzsche the Superman was human, all too human. But then, aren't we all?Moving along, Russell offers one of the best critiques of Karl Marx I've ever read. He deals with Marx as a philosopher and an influence on the philosophy of others, and does not discuss his economics or his politics, except in a general sense. In this way Russell reveals some of the irrational biases that were largely unconscious in Marx as he developed his social and political theories. For according to Marx, it was not enough to interpret the world in various ways; the trick was to alter it. Thus, Marx was the first philosopher that Russell knew of to criticize the notion of \\"truth\\" from this activist point of view. This prompts Russell to launch into a discussion of the whole history of philosophy and the unconscious biases that have shaped them all. Fireworks popping in a night sky is the only way to describe the brilliance of Russell's prose as he tap dances through his own encyclopedic mind.Some of Russell's most favorable reviews go to Plotinus and David Hume. And he seems to regard St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas in a very positive light as well, perhaps because they both owed so much to Plotinus. Which is why his glowing account of Plotinus is so surprising, especially when we consider the fact that Russell was an agnostic, as well as a logical positivist (and eventually a logical empiricist), who, like Hume, regarded metaphysics as sophistry and illusion. And yet, the sheer beauty of the metaphysical world as described by Plotinus seems to offer Russell a rare form of personal redemption. Russell revels in the beauty of his philosophy and wears it like a cloak made of starlight. And why not? Hume's flawless logic and irrefutable truth offer very little comfort in our bruised and battered world. But the philosophy of Plotinus stirs the soul and fills us with a transcendent ecstasy.Students of religious history will discover that Bertrand Russell knew a great deal about the Church, its theology, and how philosophy did or did not interpenetrate its teachings at various stages of development. His account of St. Augustine is positively amazing, a distillation of his best ideas into pure gold. Russell's great humanity allows him to remain fully cognizant of St. Augustine's most outlandish metaphysical speculations while, at the same time, not believing them. He is always respectful toward the man and his great mind, and honors his finest insights as true philosophy. So, there is much more here than meets the eye upon first glance.A great companion to this book is Bryan Magee's \\"The Story of Philosophy.\\" If you're a starstruck lover of Sophia, read them both. But you can't go wrong with this one. It's packed with edifying wisdom and even humor. Its real value, however, lies in its technical virtuosity. Bertrand Russell was the philosopher's philosopher. He knew the field backwards and forwards and was uniquely wired to simplify its complexities and isolate its inconsistencies. They just don't make 'em like him anymore."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's Introduction is a well-written, entertaining introduction to philosopy. It is very expansive, covering dozens of philosophers and philosophical movements/trends/systems/etc., and spanning thousands of years.The only issue I have with this book is its exclusion of certain, lesser known philosophers whom I particularly like (a minour issue), and its sometimes superficial overviews of the philosophers within. That is why I suggest corroborating your knowledge with another, more in-depth introduction to philosophy, like Durant's Story of Philosophy.Though it is not necessarily a criticism, I would like to point out that Russell's bias toward philosophers appears very strongly herein, so the reader should not expect a completely objective, neutral approach-- Russell is adamently opposed to many he deals with, such as Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche, and other, less logic-inclined philosophers! Be warned: you are not likely to agree with his analysis all the time, and might at times find it somewhat inappropriate."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Sir Bertrand Russell is one of the most important philosophers and mathematicians of the 20th century and in this book, targeted to the lay person, he endeavours to explain what is behind the rationale of each and every important Western philosopher since Greek Antiquity and what was his contribution to modern Western thinking.His own philosophical ideas are portrayed in the end of the book by means of him showing what was right and wrong in his opinio in the most modern theories which he helped to develop in paralell to Whitehead, Wittgestein , Moore and others.The book begins with a very detailed description of the philosophical background in ancient Greece (circa 700 BC), portraying the thinking of Thales, Plato, Aristotle and all Greek philosophers important at the time and later, explaining the pros and cons of the philosophy each one embraced, giving a lot of pertinent and useful historical information on the historical background of each period. He does also adequate coverage of the oral tradition of the Iliad and Odissey, the foundations of Western literature.From Ancient Greece, to whom it devotes the greatest part of the book covering the ideas of Plato, Socrates and Aristotles, he goes to the heiday of the Roman Empire and the first steps of Christian Philosophy, to the period of the Arab conquest, Religious thought at the Middle Ages, the Scholastics thinkers, the rise of the Scientific thought in the 18th century, until the year where the book was written (1945). The at the time raging World War II gives special scope to Bertrand Russel, a notorious/contradictory pacifist, to show some philosophical schools as a spring board to Soviet totalitarianism and others to Nazism. It is interesting to note that, as happened also with other subjects in which Russell deep dived, socialisma and communism were of such issues where he many times changed his mind in the course of his long and fruitful life.This book (836 pages)is a serious effort to portray the best minds of Western civilization in a very clear and precise light, trademarks of Lord Bertrand Russel. There you will know that Nietszche, besides praising as semi-gods persons like Napoleon, Frederic II and Julio Cesar, great men who deserved to use all the means available in order to perpetrate their indidual ends, ended his shrot life mentally insane. Also, some very negative facts of the life of the great French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau are there, like, for instance, the lightness with which Rousseau had himself disentangled from robbery accusations by fingerpointing a woman servant he knew was not guilty. Sure, despite being a very devastating malefic influence to everybody around him, Lord Bertrand Russel had a high opinion of himself, never seeming to undertand that evil doing was a two-way road, that is, that he did evil to others as they did him.In my opinion, this is a very good reading for anyone interested in Philosophy, rational thinking, theories of origins of God, theories of the State, etc..Strange as it seems, not only one woman appears as a great thinker, one thing it would not be the same if the book was written today, where the general masculine bias would be pretty much diminished. Regarding Russell, he manifestly had a clear disdain for every thought emanated from women, something Mr.Ray Monk says was determined by the fact that Lord Russel lost his mother very early in his childhood."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Although I have an inherent loathing of logical positivism, and Russell is the pinacle of this, this book is a must for all philosophy readers. The sections on Aristotle, Locke and Hume are of a particular succinct quality; summing up perfectly the entire range of their thought. But, I have two large objections. Firstly, the omissions; where is Soren Kierkegaard? Where is Edmund Husserl? Where is Martin Heidegger? Where is A.N. Whitehead? And where is there any mention of existentialism or Phenomenology? Secondly, the review of Nietsche is awful, Russell wants us to discount and forget Nietsche all together. How can we do this? Surely he is one of the most important figures for the future of philosophy, especially in the area of ethical and moral questions."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"If you want a well written book on the history of philosophy, and do not already have a philosophy of your own, this is your book. Russell does an incredible job of describing the philosophies of a huge number of philosophers.The problem is that he inserts his personal philosophy into that of others, in a way that makes it impossible to tell whose philosophy he is describing.To be concise, Russell removes any part of philosophy that, in his opinion, can't be proven \\"scientifically\\".In this sense, Russell in total opposition to any Socratic style philosopher."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was one of the founding fathers of the analytic tradition of philosophy in the 20th century. He is considered one of the most influential philosophers in the 20th century and one of the great philosophers in history. This book was not written by a historian but a great philosopher, who is at par with some/most of the figures he commented in the book. Purely by this point this book distinguishes itself from its peers and easily ranks as one of the best \\"history\\" of Philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Russell is taking a huge broad spectrum of philosophical thought, going at it with his personal bias due to cultural and time in which he wrote it yet it is transcendant in its treatment of this huge swath of subject matter.His omnipresent humor deepens the work; Pythagoras and his aversion to beans was, for example, a great humorous diversion. Obviously what this book conveys most strikingly in my opinion, is that philosophy and truth is not something which is static. It is constantly shifting, as our vantage point shifts, and becoming yet at the same time, there are also constant truths which echo our humanity. Overall, a great read and very entertaining."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I bought this for my Philosophy 101 class last semester, and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was just as described, perhaps a bit better. It came in a very timely fashion, also. I got it about a week before one of my class mates who also had ordered their philosophy boos online. Score!The content is good. This book is set up in a way that I can easily find information on a good variety of philosophers that came up in class, on tests, and even every day conversation. However, Russell seems to have his own opinions on each philosopher and doesn't exactly describe them all objectively. His opinions are usually apparent, though, and can be easily separated from the concrete facts of the text. This is one of the most helpful philosophy books I have read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is the one of the most entertaining books that I have ever read! Bertrand Russell breaths life into a subject that is often depicted as somewhat dry. Russell pokes gentle fun at various philosophers and their ideas. I was especially amused by his description of Leibnitz view where the universe was something like a fancy mechanical clock where various figures (i.e. automatons) moved about in a synchronized dance when the hour was about to be struck. Indeed, Leibnitz seemed to believe that events occurred not because of cause and effect, but because of some preordained plan that was followed to the letter. Perhaps it is analogous to the present day when people often imagine that living beings are analogous to computers complete with hardware and software. It should be noted that in Leibnitz' day this sort of elaborate mechanical clock was novel and state of the art, and so one might model the universe in a was that reflected the advanced technology of the day."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's The History of Western Philosophy is a great tome on the history of philosophy. Russell does his best to bring the philosophy down to the laymen as well as illuminate the historical context of said philosophy. If one wants to know the development and genesis of philosophical ideas then Russell has provided this. This book is approximately half philosophy and half history. I am not too fond of history so this made the book drag at times. (But what else should I have expected with a book's title beginning with \\"The History\\".) If one is looking for an introduction on pure philosophy I would recommend looking elsewhere. I would also like to comment (as many other reviewers have) that Russell's book is hardly unbiased. However, this bias does not penetrate too deeply and is really a very small bone to pick with Russell.That being said, Russell's tome is great. It is as comprehensive and enlightening a history of philosophy one could ask for. If you are interested in philosophy or the the origins and developments of the great philosophers then Russell's classic should be list."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"My personal opinion is that this book will be forever a classical deed. It is not just a unbiassed philosophical interpretation. Much more, with this book the reader can grasp the whole picture which include and the social-economical, political, religious or military circumstances under which a particular philosophy has flourished.Previously I read this book in Macedonian and Serbian language. This is my third time reading it. This book is my Bible."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It amazes me that some people have given this book a low rating. I know that among professional philosophers this is not considered a great book, but that's probably because Russell makes the ideas clear and fun instead of using jargon to make things seem more complicated that they really are. Before you read this book you should be sure of your motives. If you want an introduction that is more of a textbook, then this is not the book for you. If you want an objective survey, again, you should go somewhere else. I must say though, do you really buy a book written by Russell not expecting to read what he had to say about the issues at hand? Finally, if you want a detailed review of some specific philosopher then you will be disappointed if you read this book.With that out of the way let me say who I think this book is for: everyone who wants to read about philosophy and enjoy it. Russell's style is truly unmatched by any other philosopher, while at the same time respecting the reader's intelligence. In this book Russell connects the philosophers to the time and space which they occupied thus shedding light on why some of them thought the way they did. This book can easily pass as a brief review of history because there are whole sections dedicated to describing the political atmosphere at specific times. Russell's comments about some philosophers made me laugh. I loved the part on Rousseau although Russell was extremely harsh. I believe that Russell has a love/hate relationship with Plato, therefore the section about Plato was the best in my opinion. I also liked it when Russell said that he doesn't understand a certain part of Kant's philosophy. If he can't understand it, what can the rest of us say? I really liked the fact that he included a small section on Islamic philosophy even though I disagree with his assessment in that area. All in all, a beautiful book that you should read if you want to:-Have fun-Study philosophy-Read Russell-All of the above"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell helped found the field of Logic. But unlike some of his colleagues (eg. Wittgenstein), Russell writes with the kind of clarity and erudition that is the envy of almost any writer. This &quot;History&quot; is the best of its kind; he covers every major philosopher from the beginning in a way that no other thinker could. I refer to the book on a regular basis, and it never fails to clear away any clouds of misunderstanding that Philosophy can often create.An invaluable work for anyone, even the professional."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a work of broad perspective, covering twenty five hundred years of history and philosophy, and will be most beneficial for anyone with less than a deep familiarity with the general principles of Philosophy. Bertrand Russell's thorough account of the history western philosophy is divided most properly into three books: the first dealing with Ancient, the second with Catholic, and the final with Modern Philosophy. Russell's work begins with the condition of Hellenic civilization at the time of Thales of Miletus and ends during the time of Russell's own distinguished contemporaries. Instead of dedicating a chapter soley to Thales, Russell deemed it more appropriate to deal singularly with Pythagoras first, simply because his influence was much more profound than Thales and others of the Milesian school. Likewise, while Russell suggests that Spinoza was a much greater philosopher than Locke, he nevertheless maintains that Locke's influence was far greater than Spinoza's, and that most appropriately more time should be dedicated to Locke instead. Although the basis of this work lies upon a particular philosopher's impact upon social and political sphere of life, Russell never fails to surface individuals with deep philosophical merit. In other words, Russell treats every principle philosopher from Pythagoras to Aquinas, all the way to his own contemporaries, despite how influential they may have been; but these individuals, though they may have been exemplary thinkers, are just dealt with much more briefly in regards to their lack of major influence. So, keeping this in mind, anyone looking to find a history of western philosophy that contains an abundance of great thinkers, with detailed summaries of their systems of thought and their influence upon the world, along with some very good general history, Russell's work should not be avoided."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Best book on philosophy that I know of. But don't get the idea that it's simple: Russell's style is clear, and he is witty, and this can lead readers to think his material is simple; but Russell now and then puts in very sharp and complicated theory-of-types analysis. Its divided mostly into names, which is handy for anyone dipping into the views of Parmenides, Plato, Bacon, Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Spinoza, John Stuart Mill, Marx, Nietzsche... there's a long list. Russell is happy to admit that academic philosophers have usually been cowardly types, and admits many names (e.g. Byron) not normally considered philosophers.Russell's style is so convincing he was often plagiarised - unconscious imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. Joad (who copied Russell on Marx), and Aldous Huxley (who based Brave New World on a Russell work) are just two examples.There are innumerable asides, which I presume (he wrote and assembled this book aged about 70) were the fruit of discussions in his youth and middle age; on psychology, groups, sex, emotions, animals, ethics, totalitarianism, adventures, trade - a vast range of topics.I recommend this to everyone willing to take some trouble. I've met many people who would have benefitted from its intellectual stiffening - for example a gifted physics man who couldn't seem to grasp that atoms are mostly holes, even though they don't look that way. And who had never understood that the square root of two is 'irrational'. Hoary problems - 'universals', 'analytical' and 'synthetic', 'induction', 'teleology', 'determinism' - appear here and there, and it can do no harm to know about them. Russell also is good at picking out the odd practical effects of beliefs: just one example: Stoics and Christians both believed (supposedly) in personal virtue: if external circumstances cannot prevent a man from being virtuous, there is no need to seek a 'just' social system.There are omissions, all I think to do with demarcation problems - the boundaries of philosophy, apart from politics, history, science, economics, and psychology. Darwin isn't here (much). Freud isn't here - but then Russell regarded the idea of unconscious motivation as the only significant part of Freud. Adam Smith isn't in. Marx is only treated as a philosopher: his economics is looked at by Russell in another book. Note that Russell seemed to regard Marx as 'socialistic'. All Russell's history in a sense is official: there must be innumerable people who were censored or killed or otherwise silenced; but Russell doesn't really bother with them. His book is a bit like commentary on a tidy, ordered library.Russell's history is typical 20th century western: prehistory, with Egypt, Babylon and the rest regarded as 'oriental despotisms'. Rather inconsistently, the Bible is admitted. There's a conspiracy of silence about Jewish beliefs. Then Greece, then Rome; then the dark ages, and 'middle ages'; Russell accepts that Islam was a transmitter, though I'm not sure he makes a good case. Finally, modern enlightenment and science. Not much was known about many chunks of history, so this schema appeared satisfactory. Some of his historical comments are typically Victorian: the dislike of Rousseau from hatred of the French revolution, and of Rousseau as the supposed origin of romanticism and silliness. Rousseau and Nietzsche and Carlyle were supposed to have led to extremism and Auschwitz; Plato and Sparta to Stalin.When eras change, Russell usually finds transitional people or ideas as exemplars: the Greeks treated in the then-usual awed way as a mix of peoples; Christianity as taking in Platonic and Judaic elements; Europe as church vs monarchs and feudal nobility and knights; Machiavelli, Erasmus and More at about the Renaissance. ...Russell himself doubted his success in describing the relation of philosophy to social events when science became important. Russell mostly knew maths, but was notoriously hopeless in practical activities; he literally couldn't make a cup of tea. Such things as the rise and fall of the idea of phlogiston, the growth of chemistry, changes in transport, and such things as anaesthesia, aren't really covered but taken for granted, in rather the way unreflective people seem to think motor cars and piped water and printing have always existed.Some accuse Russell of bias; typically these are:-[1] Catholics often can't face the rationalistic side of Russell. (They don't seem to know that Russell wrote a lot on mysticism).[2] People who like Kant and Hegel, and Nietzsche. Russell was not keen on German philosophy - when he was young, all official philosophers were Hegelians. He followed G E Moore in 'climbing down'.[3] Supporters of Wittgenstein. Russell was a friend of his, and liked his work when it was new, but decided later it was rather trivial[4] Supporters of Sartre and other existentialists. Russell dismissed it in a sentence: based emotionally on exasperation, and intellectually on errors of syntax.[5] 'Linguistic' philosophers of the Gilbert Ryle type - 'just another clever man' according to Russell.Note that, near the end of his life, Russell spent years on the problem of nuclear weapons, Kennedy's assassination, and, later, the Americans and the Vietnam War. For this reason he's partly censored, still.It's a pity there is no equivalent book on eastern philosophies... that would be something. Incidentally 'Sophie's World' is based on Russell."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It is heartening to see Russell's overview of Western thought in a new reprint. The project itself at the time and even in present time; is extremely ambitious. However, Russell manages the task with professionalism and the text is written in a style that can be read by most individuals interested in the beginnings of Western thought...but Russell takes this project further, paving the way for other recorder's of history and philosophy that was not explored at the time it was written, (1946) and that is, relating philosophy to its particular social and economic background. In other words, he attempts to put a certain philosophy, for example, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Marx into its social and economic context, revealing these influencing factors on (their) particular view of the world.Russell's magnum opus, \\"Principia Mathematica\\" , written in collaboration with Alfred North Whitehead, set the standard for logical positivism and analytical philosophy that is continued to be explored and taught in universities today. Although taking a decade to write, setting a new precedent in Western thought, Ludwig Wittgenstein took up the mantel, and changed analytical philosophy forever.From the end of WW2, Russell became what is known as a \`public philosopher', similar to the pragmatist, William James, taking Western thought to the people, writing in a style for the layman. This is one such work.He was criticised by his colleagues, including his once favourite student Wittgenstein, but he changed direction, writing about controversial issues of the time. He was a great activist joining forces with Albert Einstein and Albert Schweitzer, protesting the Hydrogen Bomb testing after WW2 that the U.S. was carelessly throwing around not knowing the full detrimental effects on human life.This book is a perfect place to begin for those interested in philosophy and considering it a subject for further study. Though a bit too general and biased in a few places, as any work is or can be, the student will receive a sweeping though accurate account of Western philosophy beginning with the pre-Socratics and ending with John Dewey and Logical Analysis.Russell has an engaging style, and many thought he would move into fiction and the novel; though he lived into his late nineties, he never failed to rise in the morning for his walk, arranging his thoughts for the days subject...one of the more prolific writer's of the twentieth century.A History of Western Philosophy is a book that should be in every library."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book ranks along side Will Durant's \\"Story of Philosophy\\" as the best book on Western Philosophy. The key difference is that whereas Durant deals only with some selected individuals, Russell gives a comprehensive history. Topics that get the short shrift in most histories (Pre-Socratics, Medieval Philosophy, etc) are given the full treatment here.'HoWP' has an authority that few can match. Russell was a great philosopher himself - no history of Western Philosophy is complete without a chapter on him!The book is strewn with gems of wisdom:1. \\"The union of idealism and love of power has led men astray throughout history, and continues to do so even today.\\" (On Sparta)2. \\"Religions that condemn the pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power. Throughout history, power has been the vice of the ascetic.\\" (On the clergy in the Middle Ages)3. \\"Contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people's happiness, and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race.\\" (On Continental Idealists)At times the book does get a little dense. There is only so far Russell is willing to go to make the subject accessible to the lay reader.I would especially recommend this book for history buffs. Russell dovetails the development of Western Philosophy beautifully with European history. There is no better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book that connects it with a subject you are already passionate about!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Written in the 1942-45, this book needs to be taken in the context of World War II. Although a courageous pacifist, Russell, nevertheless, is still an Englishman. This may account for his misunderstanding of Nietzsche, who at the time the book was written, was considered a spiritual father of Hitler, which of course he was not.Russell's handling of Aristoltle's logic is, indeed, brilliant. His introduction to most of the philosophers covered in the text is at least helpful, and at other times masterful. The Noble Prize winner for literature, Russell demonstrates his alacrity for written expression and the clearest thinking at a wondrous level. He does, however, retain his bias, which he does not express openly.So long as the reader can discount the author's British, Twenieth Century bias, he will find this book an ideal introduction for the layman to Western thought."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"First, it is extremely well written, easy to read, and often humorous. Russell's description of Nietzsche is laugh out loud funny and makes it hard to take him (Nietzsche) seriously ever afterwards. It is easy to see why the Bloomsburys were frightened of Russell's scorn and wit and avoided intellectual debate with him (and these were some seriously smart, snarky folks).Second, the book contains little less than the history of western thought. As daunting as this thick tome can appear, it is a far quicker read, and far more approachable than to read the collected works of thousands of years of the world's greatest philosophers (a term Russell uses liberally, expanding it to such figures as Byron for his influence on the tone of the time).If you like philosophy, or biography, or history or just want to know what all the fuss is about, and want a great read in the bargain: run, don't walk and buy this book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Don't be put off by the criticisms of emphasis and slighting of particular philosophers... This is a truly brilliant overview of western philosophy. Not for the casual reader, but if you have a real interest in philosophy you must read this book completely."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a delightlfully entertaining history of Western philosophy starting from the ancient Greeks up to Russell's time. For each of the several philosophers covered, Russell gives a bit of biographical information and describes in several pages their contribution to philosophy. This part is mostly objective and informative. The writing style is superb. After the objective description, Russell devotes a few pages to a critique of the philosopher's work and a discussion of their importance. In addition to covering the major philosophers, Russell discusses historically important trends or changes that affected philosophy, e.g. the dominance of the catholic church, Greek mathematics, the rise of science, etc.As a lay person, I greatly appreciated the brief summaries of important philosophies in a clear and modern language. For example, I personally have no time to read Immanual Kant's huge and difficult-to-read book &quot;The Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, so it is very useful to read a summary of this influential philosopher's ideas and to understand why he was influential. The only worry one might have is that Russell's account might be biased by his strong opinions. However, I believe Russell did a good job of separating his objective description of the philosopher's work from his own opinion of the merits of the work. Besides, the critical analysis adds greatly to the entertainment value and I happen to agree with most of Russell's very reasonable opinions.This book would make an excellent gift to an intellectual friend or family member -- for anyone curious about the world and about the historical influences upon our Western outlook."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Nietzsche is maltreated, slightly. To say that the book is biased, misleading, or that Russell's attitude is in any way arrogant, however, is ignorance and intolerance in itself. Of course, Russell does have a very definite opinion of each philosophy examined, but his own views do not lead him to distort any factual information and the distinction between his opinion and the other philosophers' is very clearly made. To find such rudimentary faults in such a great man is a sign of bland arrogance combined with terrible naivette."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have read the Chinese version of this book, it is so good that I cannot let it go. The books exhibits the volumous knowledge and sharp thinking of Berti."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As another reviewer noted, finding something new to add to the many reviews already posted is difficult. Russell's strengths and weaknesses have already mostly been noted. I will confine myself to some remarks about Russell as a historian.Where his work is weak, it is directly due to his biases, especially against religion. I do not fault Russell for being biased; I fault him for letting his biases distort his reasoning. I also do so on the basis of his own stated goals. Russell is not very successful in his own goal of achieving the \\"hypothetical sympathy\\" required \\"to know what it feels like to believe his theories\\" (Book I, Chap. 4). Instead, his history is thoroughly marked by presentism, a common fallacy in historical writing in which a historian retrojects current standards into the past. Professional historians try to avoid this error. Not surprisingly, Russell's presentism shows up most clearly when it comes to his antireligious and proscience stances.He continually faults philosophers for absorbing \\"superstitions\\" like astrology and alchemy along with whatever \\"scientific\\" information they received. The thought, of course, is that educated, rational men in any age should be above such follies. Today, a social historian would point out that in their day, in their time, given their world view, they could hardly do anything else. In such cases, Russell fails not only in his goal of achieving hypothetical sympathy, but also his goal of placing philosophers in their proper social situation.Although bashing the Scholastic and Reformation periods are also characteristic of his intellectual setting, Russell's portrayals border on wilful distortion. Russell grudgingly acknowledges the university was born in this period, but misportrays academic freedom as it then existed. In fact, modern notions about academic freedom are in continuity with, not a reaction to, the original university model. Russell blames the Scholastic assimilation of Aristotle for impeding the advance of science; on the contrary, the Church's acceptance of Aristotle paved the way for modern science. As Russell noted earlier, Aristotle tempered his metaphysical speculations with real world observations; Aristotle in effect gave philosophers permission to look at the world. It seems unlikely modern science would have emerged while the Church retained its Platonic orientation.When Russell turns to the advent of modern science, he mostly illustrates his own point that myths surrounding an event sometimes become more influential than the reality. Galileo's trial is a case in point. In reality, the Church had a longstanding tradition of adapting to new knowledge with very few problems. Indeed, Copernican theory was freely debated in the Catholic world for nearly seventy years. Copernican theory per se was not the central issue in Galileo's trial. Galileo was a victim in part of politics and in part of his own hubris. Wittingly or otherwise, he also managed to insult an otherwise favorable pope. Contrary to Russell's assertion, Galileo was ultimately convicted for what he did, not what he thought. Portraying the Galileo event as pitting dogmatic fanaticism against scientific advance is a modern myth.How blameworthy is Russell for these distortions of history? His stated goals were laudable, and reflected the direction which professional historians were heading. If Russell failed to achieve his goals, modern historians do not always live up to them, either. However, a modern historian would not be allowed to get away with such blatant distortions, especially in the face of acknowledged facts. So, though Russell acknowledges that scientists had very good reasons in Galileo's day to reject Copernicus, he still harangues Martin Luther and John Calvin for doing so. I cannot see anything other than pure spite in Russell's demonization of those who rejected the Copernican system.Read as a history, the best one can say for Russell is that he is hopelessly outdated. Perhaps it is better to read this work as a piece of history, an artifact of another time when bold writers had bold ideas and were not afraid to tackle grand themes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Well, this book is very interesting, I knew very little on phylosophy before reading this book and it gave me some bearings in the subject. The book's title says it all &quot;A History of...&quot;, it contains the author's view and the approach he was interested in exploring. The section on Catholic church was the most interesting and I would recommend it. I think the flaw of the book are due to lack of space, no one can be without flaws trying to make 3000 years of history of thought, and, of course, it will displease those who disagree with the author. Above all, I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book has two fatal flaws. The first is that it is 70 years out of date. Russell wrote the book during World War II and many of the concepts he develops are simply wrong. We've seen the failure of logical positivism and strict standards of evidential proof such as falsification. Hume's problem of induction cannot be solved, it can only be managed. The replacement is tools like Bayesian decision theory which allow you to weigh degrees of belief. There has also been a rise in analytic Christian philosophy and all of the arguments for the existence of God that Russell advocates are now out of date. The new arguments are based on the Big Bang and the quantum mechanics, both advances that were not well-absorbed into philosophy at Russell's time. If you are into the fuzzier side of philosophy there is also the later Wittgenstein and the rise of ordinary language philosophy. The second problem is recognized even by Russell's admirers, which is that Russell allowed his biases to influence his treatment of philosophers and topics that he did not agree with.If you came to this because you wanted to learn about philosophy and this was the only book you'd heard of then here is a better approach.Looking At Philosophy: The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made LighterA plain English but surprisingly sophisticated introduction.Ancient Philosophy: A New History of Western Philosophy Volume 1Kenny set himself a low bar when he began this four book introductory series. He wanted to write an introduction that is more fun than Coppleston's epic nine volume introductory series (still the best way to learn philosophy up until the early 20th century) but less biased than Russell's book (if he wanted to set a high bar he would have tried to be more accurate than Coppleston and more fun than Russell).Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and ApologeticsA modern look at philosophy of philosophy of religion."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's History of Western Philosophy should really be titled &quot;A staunch positivist's take on the history of philosophy.&quot; Russell's bias against any form of metaphysics is so great that he essentially dismisses any attempt to establish metaphysical principles as foolishness. This is not a book to read if one wants to get a serious appreciation for the greeks, the medieval philosophers, or the modern European philosophers in the continental tradition. If one wants a demonstration of arrogance, this is the book for you. My recommendation would be Copleston's 9 volume &quot;History of Philosophy.&quot; It is far more thorough and attempts to treat all philosophers and schools of philosophy seriously. With a greater amount of humility, Copleston honestly admits that he is writing as a Thomist and a Catholic philospher. Nevertheless, he presents the positions of others fairly and comprehensively. Fortunately for us all, few people take Bertrand Russell's opinions seriously and positivism is dead as a viable school of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It's fairly well-written, but that's not the point if you want a history of philosophy - you might as well read a novel. The real point people should be making about this book is that it is absolutely biased. He ignores Kierkegaard and Heidegger, doesn't understand Hegel at all, gives a Humean-biased interpretation of Kant, only just understands Schopenhauer a little (and, once more, doesn't see the wealth of insight in his work), and criticises Nietzsche on the all-too-obvious points, without pointing out some of his brilliant insights about the psychological content of philosophy (which, of course, lead onto Derrida in the '60s). The only passable areas of this are the areas on Greek philosophy, but that's because they've been written about so many times and are 2500 years old it's just about impossible to get it wrong (of course, Russell doesn't add any insightful new interpretations which he could have done in light of Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger - but oh, sorry, I forgot - he doesn't understand Hegel or Kierkegaard, and he ignoroes Kierkegaard and Heidegger). Where's phenomenology? To be fair, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had only just published their main works, but Brentano and Husserl certainly deserve mentioning - Husserl at the very least.Also, his attack on Bergson is pathetic. &quot;irrational&quot; ? That is quite arrogant (as is his treatment of others) when we try and consider what Russell's own original work was like. His major epistemological books like &quot;The Analysis of Mind&quot; and &quot;Our Knowledge of the External World&quot; are, closely considered, completely outdated (even when they were written in the early part of this century) and very shaky, far more shaky on their arguments than the idealist philosophers like the brilliant Bradley and McTaggart which Russell didn't like. If Russell hadn't been lucky and entered philosophy at the time when positivism and realism was on the rise, then no-one would remember him today. If he'd been born in Germany at the time of Hegel (or even at his own time, when Husserl and Heidegger were around), then he would have realised he's actually not very good at philosophy and can't understand it's most important aspects, and he would have stuck to mathematics and never muddied the academic waters with his useless repetitive nonsense. At least Whitehead, after writing the adequate &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; with Russell, went on to produce some important work like &quot;Process and Reality&quot; and some interpretations of the Greeks which excel Russell's pathetic efforts. Russell went on to write some non-mathematical philosophy (in other words, an area he is completely incapable in), and this heavily biased book with only almost no redeeming features, his witty style being the only one. In fact, if no-one read this any more I might have given it 2 or 3 stars and called it an 'interesting period relic' (certainly NOT a classic). As it is, considering it's current over-rated position when there are so many better histories of philosophy to read (Derrida's &quot;From Socrates to Freud and Beyond&quot; or Copleston's History, just as a few examples), it deserves to be forgotten and polemically attacked until it's at least assigned it's proper place."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book has an enormous positivist bias in the selection of the ideas and philosophers and in Russell's comments, and unfortunately many misrepresentations. This will be obvious to anyone well acquainted with the thought of idealist or theist philosophers. And this is quite understandable from Russell, given that his was during most of his life a staunch leftist and materialist activist, crusading against religion any form of morality. (although at the very end he strangely publicly admited that &quot;I am ashamed of saying this, but we need Christian love&quot;, mabe because of WWII etc.). I am not disappointed in Russell writing this history of philossophy, it perfectly reflects his views. The problem is that he does not state his view, bias and may thereby mislead many readers. I think that he really ought to have called this book: &quot;An atheist (or positivist) perspective on the history of philosophy&quot;, or have said something in the preface. That would have been clearer and more honest for those who do not know about Russell's strong activism and partisanship. I hope anyway that he did not write this book to mislead people.Anthony Kenny's history of philosophy is no better: it has also a strong bias (but idealist this time), but does not mention it either!The best history of philosophy remains, in my opinion, Frederick Copleston's nine volumes. It is big, but very serious, trying to give much attention to all philosophers instead of selecting his favorites. And although he honestly did not hide he was Christian but wrote clearly from the beginning that he was a Jesuit, he may have written the most balanced work. And this is why I prefer Copleston's history very much to Kenny's of Russell's. Or I still prefer the simple, unpretentious and short history of philo. by the postmodern Donald Palmer (Looking at philosophy). And he too is rather honest and does not hide that he is a postmodern skeptic and feminist."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The analysis of the philosophers and their philosophies is done with clinical precision. But somewhere you begin to feel the harshness of the criticism and the cynicism of the reviewer's mind jars on the readers' minds. The mind of Russell is one gigantic logical machine. The question is: can every human emotion be encapsulated by logic? Many a time we become witnesses to the demolition of the larger than life images of great thinkers - like Rousseau. It is as if Russell grudges them ( the philosophers ) their fame. But at the end of it all the book is a masterpiece and a work of monumental importance. Men like Russell are needed to keep the human race on the right track and be not led astray by the innocuous looking but dangerous writings of misled philosophers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book, although admirable in its intention to place philosophy in its historical context, is too biased to be helpful and even factually in error. The fact that it is an introduction is particularly disturbing as his extreme biases and factual errors would not be noticeable to people who are not familiar with the philosophies and historical records he sites.I am quite familiar with Classical through Hellenistic philosophy and was hoping to educate myself more on philosophy of later times. Yet I found his treatment of the areas that I am familiar with so ill portrayed and actually in a few places factually wrong, that I am not sure if I should continue reading as I do not trust him to explain other areas that I am not familiar with."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This edition (first published in 1946) has to be one of the most interesting and insightful narratives on the extensive history of western philosophy that there is. Beautifully captivating, complex and detailed this in-depth study is one that will fascinate you from beginning to end. It makes for a perfect introduction to the subject by explaining the fundamental basics of the topic, before then going into more detail with much explanation and examination of the topic. There is a reason why this book has become one of the best-selling philosophy books of the twentieth-century and why it remains unchallenged to this day, and that is because of the wonderful content that is blatantly meticulous and thorough on the subject matter. It gives on a sophisticated overview of the ideas that have perplexed people from the time immemorial that is intelligent and curmudgeonly skepticism. It is also one of the most significant and important philosophical works of its time, indeed of all time, that coupled with sheer brilliance of its scholarship is unequaled.The luminous, astute prose is quite beautiful coupled with the author's scrupulously honest and candid opinions, thoughts and outlooks that which make this an absorbing read. I have never been so impressed by something that gives a complete and comprehensive look at something that is such an important and key subject, which tells the reader so much about themselves (thus in a way is quite truth-drawing). Just a great philosopher's logical and coherent look at the history of his own subject, that is wonderfully readable and truly enlightening hence I cannot fault it. I sadly never had the opportunity of studying up to now philosophy but it is a subject that in recent times has become of more interest to me, especially since reading Bertrand Russell's thought-provoking book that just captures the mind. This colorful, astute walk through several millennia of philosophers and their work is inconceivably amazing and which sparks a deep interest in any reader opening your eyes to moral, ethical and analytical thoughts in Europe.This is a book that I would highly recommend to those studying philosophy, history and the changing thoughts and morals across Europe throughout the years. It is such an captivating and compelling read that covers pretty much everything on the subject you would want to know, and therefore there is nothing that is comparable or of an equivalent standard to it. I cannot praise Bertrand Russell highly enough, for he his contribution to the literary world is one that is marked, discernable to all and I thank him for it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"One of the low-raters commented that one might as well read a novel. I have to admit I have never studied philosophy, and couldn't tell you if 3 words in this book are true, but the writing is just lovely. Especially as I age I've lost interest in novels, but this wonderful writing calls me back time after time. His opening lines on Spinoza are priceless."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. He was also a great man in other ways. His history of Western philosophy is a tour--led by the greatest philosopher of our age--through the high (and some of the low) points of Western philosophy from its inception with the pre-Socratics to the middle of the last century. What we get are Russell's necessarily brief (my copy is about 900 pages) ruminations, criticisms, and expositions of the lives and ideas of the great and some not so great philosophers of European and American culture. We also get along the way an exposition of Russell's thinking at the time (1943) on many of the problems and issues of philosophy, history, politics, war, and culture.Russell's writing is lively and non-technical, although there are a few obscure and unexplained references. He has a wonderful, subtle sense of humor, which is often dryly cutting. Let me indulge in one tiny example: \\"In the above outline, I have in the main endeavored merely to state Bergson's views, without giving the reasons adduced by him in favor of their truth. This is easier than it would be with most philosophers, since as a rule he does not give reasons for his opinions,....\\" If a reader wants a lively, opinionated, not always quite accurate, selective but illuminating tour through the history of philosophy, she could not do better than Russell's book. This book, as its subtitle suggests, also contains much political and social history in outline and its relationship to the philosophies of the eras. Many of the connections and influences that Russell emphasizes are tendentious at best.Russell is best on modern philosophy. His chapters on ancient and medieval philosophy and history seem to come mostly from secondary sources. There is a lot of material on the history and philosophy of the late Roman Empire and Dark Ages that was a chore to get through and did not seem relevant to the course of Western philosophy--lots of obscure early Christian disputes were described at boring length. Thus I would think that a reader today who is not specifically interested in early Church history could skip or skim most of \\"Book Two: Catholic Philosophy.\\" Also I found it odd that Russell includes a chapter on Byron, who is not considered to be a philosopher, certainly not one worthy of a chapter in a single volume history of Western philosophy. The chapter on Bergson should simply be skipped. Bergson is no longer considered a world-historical or even important philosopher, and the chapter devoted to him was longer than other chapters on major figures.I would not use this book to study for one's Ph.D. qualifying exam in the history of philosophy. Copleston's multi-volume history is much more useful for the serious student of philosophy.The best part of the book is the very end, the final chapter--\\"The Philosophy of Logical Analysis.\\" This is worth reading and rereading even if you don't look at anything else in the book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I started this shortly after reading Durant's History of Philosophy book, so its hard not to compare the two. Durant's book covered far less history and only a few select philosophers and I liked reading Durant's synopsis of the ones covered more than the similar shorter ones found here. Where this book seemed to excel was the amount of material covered, whereas Durant only covered a few, Russell covered a large number of philosophers and history. Just the amount of additional material covered here makes this a nice complementary read. Although both books are obviously biased and so I'll have to read a few more neutral accounts. I also didn't like that often in this book Russell seemed to go off on tangents about what he disagreed with and set up what seemed to be straw man arguments to disprove the other philosophers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In 2001, I refused to call this book a pure reference. It was a safer bet, supposedly, to look for dry philosophical biographies--this way the reader rightly avoids Russell as he proselytizes for logical analysis.I've since changed my opinion of the book, though. I now believe Russell's blanket hate of putative \\"dogmatism\\" is better than a doomed try at philosophical and historical objectivity. For the summaries act as nice catalysts: you read Russell's dismissal of Nietzsche; you get annoyed at his caricature of Nietzsche as a frothing sadist; and then you joyfully go out to refute it all. Maybe you read Walter Kauffman's rehabilitative scholarship. Or maybe you pick up \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" and do earnest philosophy by yourself.Of course, if this is not seen as a plus in itself, here are some points about the actual content:1) Risking hagiography, the chapter on Leibniz is still an excellent summary.2) The chapters on ancient philosophy are much better than anything found in the Oxford, Cambridge, and Routledge encyclopedias. Here, at least, Russell rightly judges philosophical merit in its social and political context.3) For the most part, the author of \\"Why I Am Not a Christian\\" is not overly bilious when discussing Catholic Philosophy. Still, he does call Aquinas--argubly one of the greatest Aristotleans--a master of religious \\"special pleading.\\"4) Ridiculously, Russell does not offer anything about the Tractatus-period work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. There is also no mention of Kierkegaard (Russell could not have seen the Dane as too literary: this book includes a curious and very light chapter on Lord Byron).5) First published in 1945, the book thus has Frege, Whitehead, and Russell himself as its representatives of modern philosophy. Today, though, we have the great achievements of Popper, Quine, Rawls, Nozick, Donald Davidson, Daniel Dennett, and so many others. The beginning philosopher should look elsewhere in order to learn more about these contemporary thinkers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In a word: awesome. This book is the best introduction to Western thought (which means: to the Western mind and the way it thinks) that I have yet read. Russell does an excellent job in his choice of subject matter, his explanations of the various philosophies that Westerners have adhered to since the most ancient ones of Greece, and in his evaluations of each of those. He is fair, balanced, insightful, and witty from cover to cover in this book; even when I found myself disagreeing with him, I had to admit that he made a good point and he made it well. The only complaint that I have is that I think he shortchanged much of the philosophy of the Middle Ages, either skipping it entirely or only giving a brief mention to certain individuals and movements that I think had much more importance than he gives credit for. Aside from that, this is a simply amazing book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with Western thought and/or better understand their own thinking."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Most people might argue that this is a bunch of crap that Russell just put together and that its his own perspective of what good/useful philosophy is. Well they'd be half right. A major factor that people tend to overlook about this book is that it IS Russells own opinion on the history of philosophy, hence the words &quot;writen by Bertrand Russell&quot; on the book and not &quot;edited by Bertrand Russell&quot;. If somone is looking for a refrence of sorts for philosophy that is completly unbiased then I would suggest the Cambridge Dictionary Of Philosophy or the even better Oxford Companion To Philosophy. Other than that i have to consider this a GREAT book (altough i only read passages at a time) and really consider Russells opinions as valid ones that I (as a member of my high school debate team) find myself quoting quite often. In essence, its just a good step into a better understanding of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Although Russell's history is biased, it provides an excellent overview of Western philosophy's history - puting it in a political and social context and thus making it more accessible to the layman."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's classic history of Western thought continues to remain very popular, and rightly so. Though written several decades ago, it is still one of the best introductions to Western thought.Of course many aspects of the book reflect Russell's biases. Russell tends to downplay some of the more metaphysical thinkers (such as Plotinus, Proclus and the Neo-Platonists), skips over medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophy almost without a thought, and omits many of the critically important 20th century movements including positivism, analytical philosophy (Wittgenstein is omitted for example) and continental philosophy. Russell also tends to exalt the scientific and mathematical influences on philosophy and also the empiricists of England, especially David Hume and Locke.Still, this is a readable and useful overview of 20 centuries of Philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I am not exactly sure what led me to read this book.In high school and college, I avoided history and western philosophy as much as I could. They seemed like really dry topics to me. My interests and talents were scientific and mathematical. However, I am glad that I read this book, because, to me, it is one of the 20 best books ever written. Bertrand Russell won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was an accomplished philosopher, mathematician, and a very clear rational thinker. Russell provides a tour de force of philosophical history from ancient times into the twentieth century. He interweaves, remarkably, events in world history and how philosophers helped to shape those events. This book is quite long, but my interest in it never flagged. I highly recommend this book. It is an incredible achievement."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"You risk being seduced by this wonderful and dangerous book.It is probably (despite many other merits and demerits) one of the greatest lessons in bias ever written.There is little unique about the extent to which this work is biased.But Russell's mesmerisingly convincing style makes the likelihood that anything in the book is anything but objective a thought which will occur to only the most sceptical of readers.This is not to claim that Russell was being cynical or consciously deceptive when he wrote it.Nor is it to claim that he was wildly deluded or poorly informed.What the book does exemplify however, is how Russell's enormous skill as a raconteur, combined with well developed viewpoints on many of the subjects he discusses, as well as his powerful enthusiasm for historical anecdotes.If anything were ever to have the power to kindle any latent interest in philosophy, history or science, this book probably stands alone among the philosophical works of its era in combining the necessary ingredients.None of these 'popular non-fiction attractions' should in any way undermine the fact that the book often provides a good service to the reader, in terms of providing a more than adequate overview of the philosopher or philosophy covered.But even when it provides these resources effectively, any reader who is inclined to pursue the particular subject matter further, would, in most cases be utterly shocked to discover how any further research will probably present an extraordinarily different perspective, if, in many cases, for no other reason than as a reaction to the impressions formed by this book.For every viewpoint that Russell presents authoritatively in this book, there are often a multiplicity of other viewpoints to be found elsewhere, many diametrically opposed to those expressed in the book, ranging from those which are based upon more recent historical research, to those which treat Russell's assertions as a starting point for a debate, and finally to those which essentially constitute a contemptuous dismissal of Russell's unacceptable corruption of the minds of those who take the book more seriously than many scholars would.But it is wiser to take any unqualified criticism of this book as being as much an 'understandable overreaction' as it is to recognise that Russell's endeavours to make history and philosophy entertaining came at a price that any early attempt at popularisation might be expected to pay.Read it, be enthralled, recall that this is now well over half a century later, then read it again, book in one hand, mouse in the other, reach out for the internet, check out the latest writings on the subjects he covers, get the most from both worlds.No better book on the subject (including several more comprehensive and respected histories of philosophy) exists for making you want to do this."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was one of the preeminent thinkers of the Twentieth Century. It is difficult to imagine a man better qualified to compile and comment upon the greatest thinkers in Western Civilization. Of course, he does have a point of view, leaning more toward Aristotle's materialism than Plato's spirituality, and it is impossible to deny that it informs his interpretations of the great philosophers, but it really doesn't get in the way too much. His distillations of their thinking are as accurate as one may expect, and his commentary is always identified as opinion.What is remarkable about this volume is it's presentation of the sweep of Western thought from the Greeks through the last century, each school of thought seeming to grow out of or be a reaction against what went before. I highly recommend reading it from the beginning so the causes and effects of each period of philosophy and the people who grew from them are fully appreciated. It is dense going at times, but the reward is worth the effort it takes to plow through.That said, I found myself overwhelmed by the mathematical portions of the book, but that is not Russell's fault; if I have no head for it, he can't be blamed.It is not a work for the casual reader; a great deal will be expected. There is a wealth of information here, but one must really spend time with each philosopher in order to understand his observations and conclusions. This is a book that needs to be studied, and is not for the dilettante. It requires a certain commitment.Even so, for one who has neither the time nor the patience to slog through the actual writings of the philosophers presented here, this \\"Reader's Digest\\" version is just what is needed. One really cannot call oneself an educated person in our society without a passing knowledge of what is presented here. This introduction to Western Philosophy is about as good as you're going to get."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I've read this book twice and am always impressed by it. Russell is the most readable of philosophers, and this is one of his best books. It's easy to read and consistently interesting; there's hardly a dull page in it. You would think that the long middle section on the Catholic philosophers would be as dry as dust, but Russell makes it completely fascinating, a strength rather than a weakness. His overview of Plotinus is far more readable than Plotinus himself, and this is generally true of all the writers he discusses.The book is not without weaknesses. First, it's not long enough! Second, coverage of twentieth century philosophy is very brief (the book was published in 1945). Third, his coverage of William James (a favorite of mine, of course) is too unsympathetic and, apparently, too uninformed and superficial to be of much value. In this it shows haste, a fault which Russell admits in his Autobiography. Finally, I don't have the book in front of me, but I don't think he says much about the existentialists. These lacks are all the more galling because he does devote so much space to the Church, which is likely to be of less interest to most potential readers.But it wouldn't do to let these sins of omission cloud the view of the riches that are present. This is truly a great book, and one could do worse than use it as a guide and introduction to a reading program of philosophical history. I say &quot;history&quot; rather than &quot;philosophy&quot; because I think the writers he covers have been surpassed and have largely become irrelevant--except perhaps for scholars--toward developing a view of philosophical questions. This is more true for the general reader, because so many of the old books are so dreadfully written. To get a start on philosophical questions, one could hardly do better than Russell's Problems of Philosophy. But then, who am I to contradict Ray Monk, who called this &quot;the perfect introduction to the subject.&quot;Russell's education and his grasp of history and culture are unsurpassed (except for maybe Will Durant), and his brilliance and clarity shine on every page. This book is essential reading for one's education... but it may not say much to you personally. It won't change your life. For that kind of value, read Russell's Conquest of Happiness or Walter Kaufmann's Faith of a Heretic."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"History of Western Philosophy is Russell's attempt to reduce the breadth of intelligence, wisdom, creativity and thought of philosophy throughout the last two and a half thousand years. While in places the book is weak, and his personal bias shines through often, this is still a monumental work, and should be read by anyone interested in learning philosophy but unsure where to begin.The book begins with an introduction stating Russell's intent in very clear language. He is not interested in providing a detailed thesis on each of the major philosophers, nor is he willing or able to give enough of a background so that the casual reader will become conversant in his philosophers of choice. Rather, the intent is to give an overview, to whet the appetite, to stimulate the mind with what higher thinking is capable of. From there, we are given a brief account of the history and importance of the Greeks before plunging into a chapter by chapter exposition of major authors.It is an important part of this book that Russell allows us a look into the historical, economical and political aspects of each period. A proper understanding of a particular philosopher's thinking us not possible without at least some background in the conditions and prevalent thinking of the time. Without knowing of the huge importance of religion in the 15th and 16th century, is it so easy to appreciate Machiavelli's philosophy on power at all costs? No.As I said earlier, there are faults. Obviously, Russell has his own personal philosophy, and where there are other philosophers who disagree either in part or totally, he gives them short shrift. Kant and Nietzsche in particular are dealt with harshly, I feel, and this is mostly because Russell's views are almost completely opposite. However, importantly, he does not hide this point. He always refers to his opinions as his, and you are allowed to disagree. From the introduction it is clear that he is a person with an opinion, where you agree, perfect. Where you don't, he gives a clear enough appraisal that it doesn't really matter.In the end, this book serves only as an introduction. If you want to learn more, read the actual texts discussed as well as commentary from specialists. The goal of this book was to give a broad history, a coherent starting point and an easy access catalogue of great thinkers. In all of these goals Russell succeeds, and nowhere does he truly fail."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Many years ago Russell's &quot;History&quot; was my introduction to the subject of philosophy -and the history of Western civilization for that matter. My worn paperback copy has been read and re-read a dozen times. This book inspired me to delve deeper into the ideas and events which are covered. I always find myself going back to this book with a new perspective and Russell doesn't disappoint; every time I read &quot;History&quot; I come across an insight which I missed during a prior reading.Unlike other, more bland introductions to the subject, Russell is not afraid to tell us his opinions of a particular philosopher or movement. While his bias may skew the subject somewhat for the beginner, it does not detract from the overall value of the work. Philosophy can be a dull, difficult subject, however, Russell's style -his entertaining, often humorous prose, and willingness to interject his own commentary -serve to deeply engage the reader.The title of this book can be misleading. While the history of philosophy is certainly the central theme, it could more broadly be called &quot;A History of Western THOUGHT&quot;, because it encompasses individuals (and the movements associated with them) that might not necessarily be classified as philosophers, but rather as scientists, theologians, or politicians. Russell not only tells us what a particular philosopher believed, he puts their system into an historical perspective and does a masterful job relating the impact of their philosophy to history in general.Despite being written nearly sixty years ago, this is a timeless classic, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in introducing themselves to the subject of Western thought as well as to those who are looking for another perspective on the subject."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's history of western philosophy makes a great reference work to philosophers and philosophy at large. Naturally Russell, being a philosopher less than a historian, he is critical of the thinkers he canvasses throughout the work. That being said, the history really is great. Russell, being the positivist, isn't too critical on the great thinkers of less enlightened times. Understanding that Russell's views don't discount the philosophies but provide an argument to them, we can use this work as a great reference to philosophy without a great investment of time.This is the real beauty of the work: it makes a great reference work. If you don't feel like reading the entire thing (which I do suggest) you can use the work in piecemeal. This book provides basic understanding of the tenets of a philosopher while also provide a quick background of the life and times of the philosopher. I have used this book on several occasions to cross reference ideas and re-acquaint myself with the philosophers.Russell, in writing this book, chose to be concise and this can be seen as a drawback. His descriptions of philosophers and philosophies are by no means complete but they are in the short space he uses filled with information and anecdotes. Naturally he weights the time he spends towards the more important philosophers: he gives a vast section to St Augustine while we spends a scant page and a half on William of Ockham. This makes sense of course and the data he provides on the obscure is certainly enough to wet the mouth so to speak and allow the reader to do some research on his own -- you will have no trouble doing this because the research is well document through a great bibliography.A major complaint I have seen in regards to this book is that it covers little of the 20th century. I can see why this can be seen as a defect but we must remember that Russell was writing a history and not a field guide. At the time this was first written and even in the times later additions could have been produced the philosophies of existentialism and postmodern relativism etc were still at the forefront of the philosophical debate (in the present) and writing a history on this probably seem absurd.While Russell himself was apologetic about the way he handled this book in making it less than complete, we should praise him for creating it. Overall it is an excellent work and handled with the command of subject and history that is most rare especially in our times. I wont say that this is the only history of philosophy you should read but it may well be the best. I implore students of philosophy and students of history to get and use this book. If you do not fit into those categories get this book anyway... you will find it not dry but delightful.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Like most of Russell's writings, this mammoth effort is extremely learned, clearly written, periodically humorous, intellectually stimulating and predominantly compelling in its logic despite housing a number of statements that do not stand up to reason. The work is composed of three books totaling seventy-six chapters and is not for the time- or attention span-constrained. The nature of the writing is not fully or accurately conveyed by the title alone. This is not a standard, dispassionate textbook explaining the views of profound and/or influential thinkers throughout history. It is, rather, an admixture between such a text, a broader history of social and political events related to the philosophers (as indicated in the subtitle), an aggressive criticism of the subject philosophies and, to a more limited degree, an explicit elucidation of Russell's own philosophical views. In short, it is a very challenging endeavor that is, by and large, pulled off remarkably well.In each segment on an individual thinker or school, Russell analyzes the philosophic formulations, the ties to earlier and later thinkers, the degree of logical consistency found in the ideas and the moral quality of the individual(s) being presented. While no thinker comes out completely unscathed, Russell does single out those individuals deserving of his high regard in certain aspects. Among them, chronologically, are Boethius (\\"During the two centuries before his time and ten centuries after it, I cannot think of any European man of learning so free from superstition and fanaticism. He would have been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly amazing.\\"), St. Francis of Assisi (\\"one of the most lovable men known to history.\\"), Spinoza (\\"the noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers. Intellectually, some others have surpassed him, but ethically he is supreme.\\"), Leibniz (\\"one of the supreme intellects of all time\\"), Hume (\\"To refute him has been, ever since he wrote, a favorite pastime among metaphysicians. For my part, I fine none of their refutations convincing.\\") and John Dewey (\\"With most of his opinions I am in almost complete agreement.).Russell is a master of the polemic and there is no shortage in this work. Those who suffer the most scathing remarks include Plato (\\"Plato and common sense do not mix easily\\"), Aristotle (\\"Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples.\\"), Aquinas (\\"There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas. He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead.\\"), Rousseau (\\"the dictatorships of Russia and Germany (especially the latter) are in part an outcome of Rousseau's teachings\\"), Hegel (\\"Such is Hegel's doctrine of the State-a doctrine which, if accepted, justifies every internal tyranny and every external aggression that can possibly be imagined.\\"), Schopenhauer (His \\"gospel of resignation is not very consistent and not very sincere.\\", and Marx (\\"Considered purely as a philosopher, Marx has grave shortcomings.\\")As has been the case in everything I've read by Russell, I find a surprising number of statements that seem to be out of harmony with his normally clear thinking. For example, his criticism of More's Utopia, a communistic system with complete lack of freedom, is shockingly insufficient: \\"It must be admitted, however, that life in More's Utopia, as in most others, would be intolerably dull. Diversity is essential to happiness, and in Utopia there is hardly any.\\" Apparently, for Russell, freedom is not essential to happiness and communism would do nicely if only it came with more diversity. Similarly, in his concluding remarks regarding Nietzsche, he makes a stunning statement: \\"I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions.\\" This is exactly the sort of thinking that he excoriates throughout his writings when applied to the emotionally held, comforting beliefs of others that don't fit so well with his personal prejudices.Despite my issues with some of his views, I highly recommend grappling with him as a great vehicle for stimulating intellectual growth. Readers seeking a survey style introduction to philosophy will find this to be a richer experience than most available options and one well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It seems that the previous reviews cover most of the praise and objections that can be offered. I will reiterate those that deserve special emphasis. Many others have pointed out Russell's biases. As some have noted they are hardly hidden and quite clear to the reader. zencoyote above points out that this is only to be expected. Do we really believe that someone, anyone, can write a history of anything and not let their biases influence what events are given prominence and which are not? Russell's biases are clear (he often points them out to the reader himself) and add color to the text. If you want to read a history with a different set of biases then find a different author.The strengths of this book lie in the first two thirds -- dealing with the ancient Greeks and the medieval scholastics. When it reaches the modern age it begins to lose some of its brilliance. The selection of topics is curious -- Byron is included but Voltaire is not, Dewey is present but not Kierkegaard. A strangely large amount of space is devoted to Locke and I couldn't help but feel that he didn't do justice to Hegel's views (even though I think I am in general agreement with Russell about them).The most interesting aspects of this book are that Russell attempts to show philosophy in the context of society at large and provides a criticism of the various philosophies. This criticism is especially useful for a novice."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Philosophers take themselves far too seriously. Bertrand Russel is not an exception. In his own eyes, the book he would have kept for posterity would have been the Principia Mathematica, which was blown to bits by Godel's incompleteness theorem. Yet, while his own philosophy of Logical Atomism ran out of steam (and followers) by about the time he wrote this book, this book endures. In fact, he even won a Nobel Prize for it. And not without good reason.Histories of Philosophy usually lack either seriousness (like Sophie's World, which is an adaptation of this book) or wit (like the Columbia History). Granted, Russel can't be trusted on any German after Kant, everything leading up to the 19th century rests on pretty secure footing. In fact, it is an indepedant study I took in high school based off of this and photocopies of primary sources that made it possible for me to stay afloat in a graduate course on Hegel at the University of Chicago my first year.However, his treatment of philosophy after Kant has to be taken in context. Russel, however fair and objective you'd expect a philosopher to be, thought that his tradition of philosophy had more or less answered the big questions. That meant in exclusion of the Continental philosophers such as Jaspers, Husserl, and Heiddeger. Even his treatment of Analytic Philosophy ended with Whitehead, who was important in the very early part of the Century.That leaves the exclusion of Kierkegaard, and the treatment of Hegel and Neitzsche. Kierkegaard only became important in the 20s and 30s in Continental philosphy, and only in the context of a Hegel renaissance, as a religious corollary. As for Hegel, it is not Russel's fault that Hegel was used as an excuse for right wing apologists for Bismark. In WWI, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra was distributed along with the Bible to soldiers, (Hitler among them) and so it is not Russel's fault that he blames him for Hitler.Russel admits that he based most of this book on the work of experts, and it was thrown together in quite a hurry. That it falls prey to the errors of its era is not surprising at all, what is surprising is how well this work has held up. In fact, it does. I still recommend it to my friends who are looking for a digestible introduction to the field, but of course with Caveats."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's Hist. of Western Philosophy is an incredible introduction to the history of philosophy. If you want a straightforward description of each philosopher, I would recommend the encyclopedia, but if you want an in depth discussion of the philosopher's views, who he was influenced by, and his influence on other philosophers, Russell can't be beat. This book can be read straight through, or you can flip to the chapter on the philosopher or field of philosophy you want to learn about. The only problem with this book is that it deals with so many philosophers that it can only give about 10-20 pages to each philosopher (but longer to more influential philosophers like Plato and Locke), so if you need a great deal of info, this book won't be perfect. But this books advantages far outweigh its faults. My personal favorite part is Russell's commentary on each philosopher - he points out the strengths and weaknesses of each philosopher's philosophy. I highly recommend this volume for anyone interested in this wonderful subject."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I read this book in college (Wisconsin-Madison)and used it as the focus of a semester's final thesis. We were being challenged to actively refute a philosophical writing. I was fortunate to get this book before my classmates - because Russell wrote it in 1945, it is at times malicious to the Germanic Philosophies. Shocked that he was so shortsighted, he later begged redemption to a degree. Still a must for even the layperson to read at some point. The book reads as difficultly as the reader wishes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book would belong to Russell's \\"popular period,\\" i.e., the period after which he had his magnum opus destroyed by Wittgenstein, a philosophical novice, at the time. It would also belong among the worst introductions to the history of philosophy every written. Even when I first read it, just prior to entering graduate school in philosophy, I thought it a crime to call this a \\"history\\" of anything whatsoever.I have two problems with this text. To begin with, it is filled with Russell's personal opinions and topics, which are highly debatable. (It is difficult to read the section on \\"Catholic Philosophy\\" without being more than aware that this is a man who also wrote a book entitled \\"Why I Am Not a Christian.\\" Moreover, the section itself is entirely too long, given its relative obscurity in the philosophical world.) He has a supremely idiosyncratic view of the so-called \\"history\\" of philosophy. (Indeed, were the 3rd Viscount of WTF ever still breathing, I would not hesitate to suggest to him that he take an intro course in history: you know, get to know something about what is--because it represents the book as of being a particular account of \\"philosophy\\"--as important a term for the description of the book as it philosophy itself.) I have mentioned the attention he gives to Catholic philosophy. Yet, there is no chapter whatsoever on Soren Kierkegaard, indisputably the most important Protestant philosopher in the history of the discipline. What's more, if he's read Nietzsche, it's far from evident. That chapter reads like a rehashing of various bad books on Nietzsche.I have already hinted at my second problem with Russell's tome. The book is copyrighted 1945, whereas the book ends, if I recall correctly, with Dewey. Hold on a minute: what of Heidegger, whose Being and Time belongs with The Interpretation of Dreams and The First and Second Theories of Relativity as being among the most important books of the early 20th Century)? How about Bergson, or even the neo-Kantians in France? In short, it's as if philosophy on the Continent fails to exist after Rousseau.In short, THIS IS A SECOND RATE BOOK BY A WASHED UP PHILOSOPHER! If you want a short, readable introduction to philosophy, try Will Durant's \\"The Story of Philosophy.\\" It certainly has it's own problems, but it is far more fair and comprehensive in it's choice of topics."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"....well-placed within its historical context. Readable and not overly technical. Bear in mind that Lord Russell is as rationalistic and positivistic as Isaac Asimov, whose chronology of history puts down such &quot;mystical&quot; movements as alchemy and gnosticism."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book is horribly biased and even downright wrong in many places.

This has to be as bad as Durent's work on history of philosophy. I woudl give this book away, but I don't dislike anyone that much. Russell's depiction of previous philosphers was selfserving at best. All philosopher were to lead up to his philosophy. This books only should be used as a doorstop or kindling."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book is perfunctory and extremely shallow.

Michael's intense love for the children of the world because of his own inner personality of being a child-at-heart became a fault to everyone else through this extortion attempt.Ms. Campbell presented the facts between the TWO trails that were occuring at the time, not just one, and shows Michaels undeniable innocence all the way. Her unwaning support of Michael is echoed throughout the world with the minds and voices of the fans that really care about Michael.The story was intriguing and very sad as well. It's appalling to think that such a kind and shy person as Michael Jackson could be subjected to such harmful persecuting, and I have to admit that the story was compelling enough to make one not only feel for Michael, to sympathize, but to also feel his own pain and just begin to imagine what agony he could have felt at the time, and even to this very moment. It made me choke up, and I could not put down this book.This is a wonderful biography on Michael's \\"Scandelous\\" moments, and it totally proves Michael Jackson, again and again, that he has always maintained his innocence, and will always.

I've read Lisa's other book also, equally as good (MJ: King of Pop). She makes no secrect of the fact that she is an MJ supporter but her writing is factual and she obviously digs deep to get to the heart of the story. Because this book stops with the Chandler mess, you get a lot more detail than books that try to cover Michael's entire life. I for one, was happy to hear \\"the other side\\" of the 1993 allegations nightmare. Volumes have been written that are defamatory, malicious and sensationalistic and truth be damned. At least Lisa tried to present an alternative appraisal of that horrible time in MJ's life."},{"Title":"Michael Jackson: The King of Pop's Darkest Hour","review":"It is quite curious to me why after the passing of MJ none is interested to read this great book of Campbell.

Maybe some fans did read but they chose not to share or share somewhere other than Amazon.Different from the many books I have read, this is the only book that saw the 1993 case from the angle of a supporter of MJ. The book is foreword by Bob Jones, MJ's PR at that time. Campbell is, however, not totally biased towards her idol. She did point out some rumours in the book, like, Brook Shield was given $10000 each time accompanying MJ to shows, and MJ's grandfather received Public Assistance.It is interesting to note that throughout the book the writer kept spelling out those names who supported MJ through the first trial. And it mentioned more than one time Diana Ross was very silent on the trial.I tend to love very much those thing that is rare and scarce, just like this book.

But he falls asleep. and while he sleeps, the animals who live in the tree come down and whisper in his ear, \\"Senhor, spare this tree.\\" Each animal explains the long-range disaster that will occur if the tree is lost.The story, to tell you the truth, is a bit heavy-handed. But the illustrations by the author are worth the price of the volume alone. Ms. Cherry traveled to Brazil and painted the plants and many of the animals from life. The results are some lovely, large scale watercolors. There is also a map of rain forests round the world, a cross section of the different levels in a rain forest, and a border of the different animals in an Amazon rain forest.My students generally like this book. I like it, too."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"This book teaches children the importance of trees, including all the animals who need the trees to servive .

That is what Lynne Cherry is trying to get across. Although it is not just about trees it is about every creature and plant in the rain forests. In the Great Kapok Tree one man goes out into the forest under orders to cut down a large kapok tree. All the animals are watching him. After cutting for a while he becomes drowsy from the forest's scents and the animals come to him and speak what would happen if he cut down the tree.Not everyone would enjoy this book mainly because it is not the most exciting book out there, but it is extremely educational. You learn what is happening to the rainforest without having to read a massive textbook and the pictures are stunningly realistic.

It seems like every single animal in the rain forest comes to the man about to chop down the tree. They state so many reasons why the man should not cut down the tree. It is very informative about the dangers of depleting the rain forest, but I found the plot dry and not very interesting.

It is utterly one-sided, and places the welfare of animals above that of humans. At no time is the human story told. Instead, the \\"right\\" side of the issue (the politically correct side) is presented as the only possible way to think. It attempts to place on the shoulders of children the responsibility for \\"saving\\" the rain forest. Saving endangered species, environments, etc. is not the job of children."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated fable of interdependence in the rain forest. As a teacher, I use this story to teach about ecosystems here at home. Even though it is appropriate for younger children, I read it to my outdoor school students (5th-6th grade) on the day we study ecosystems to help them understand the inter-relationships we see and study in the field. I like to bring the story to life by giving the animals special voices (lots of hissssing for the snake, chattering for the monkeys, squawking for the birds, etc.) At first the students laugh and are amused by the voices, but when the tree frogs talk about ruined lives and being left homeless, they begin to get more serious, and by the time the sloth asks &quot;How much is beauty worth? Can you live without it?&quot; they are fully engrossed. After reading the story, I send the students out to find a &quot;magic spot&quot; to do a writing assignment: write their own story of &quot;The Great ______&quot; substituting a plant they have learned about during their week at outdoor school for Kapok Tree.The only thing I don't like about this story is that students, in their black and white morality, sometimes only take home the message that &quot;it's bad to cut down trees.&quot; I like the book &quot;The Gift of the Tree&quot; because it doesn't have this morality tale aspect, and &quot;Just a Dream,&quot; because it places responsibility on each of our shoulders, not just &quot;someone&quot; like the tree cutter in this story. But I use this story in conjunction with those others and discuss this issue with the students. This is definitely a classic in Children's Environmental Literature!"},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"My son and I love this book. We received it as a prize at an Earth Day celebration and have gotten a lot of use out of it. I love the beautiful pictures and my son loves it when I make up voices for each of the animals. I feel good about reading this book to him, because the message is clear. We live on a planet with many cultures and many other living creatures. We should respect that. I have gone out to check out other books by Lynne Cherry and love them all. But The Great Kapok Tree remains my favorite."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"Beautiful, wild places inspire and I love to introduce this concept to young children who are so very sensitive to the beauty around them. Children love to produce images of a world butterflies, rainbows and flowers. Lynne Cherry uses this love to capture and intrigue children in her book about The Great Kapok Tree set in the heart of the Amazon rain forest.Ms Cherry is an author and illustrator of children's books who has a sensitivity for ecological issues. In The Great Kapok Tree she presents a jungle teaming with life. A man tires as he begins cutting the great tree down with an ax. He tires and sleeps. While he sleeps the animals come out of the rain forest to give him a lesson about the importance of the tree. Snakes, monkeys, butterflies, parrots, toucans, frogs jaguars and sloths all give him a pitch. Each tree is important in the rain forest.Lynne Cherry's illustrations are gorgeous, green and so alive. Her inspiration was the Amazon rain forest which she traveled to and sketch while researching this book. Each page impresses the reader with the lushness and beauty of the region.While it may seem that the concept of ecology is a bit sophisticated for a four year old it is important to remember that our early values shape our lives. It is my hope that the children of today will have of deep love of nature that will inspire them to take the necessary care of the earth ion their future.This book is a wonderful gift to a child. I have read it to children numerous times and they are always mesmerized by it."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"This book is a magnificient view of how the rainforest works together as a complex community, yet is made simple to bring that message to young children. The big book version is wonderfully filled with detailed pictures that children love to see. I recommend this book to any parent or teacher trying to teach environmental awareness to their children and students. It get the children excited to see what else is out in the world and try to do something before it vanishes, just as the animals tell the man the rainforest community will vanish if he chops down the Kapok Tree."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"This book has been extensively reviewed and smothered in praise; I agree that it is a wonderful introduction to many topics. It can be used by teachers and homeschooling families to discuss the different sections of the rain forest canopy and the animals which inhabit it, camouflage (the jaguar), erosion and other effects of deforestation, the native peoples of the rain forest, the role of trees in producing oxygen, the concept of habitat, the concept of pollination, predators and prey, and the idea that our actions have an impact on all generations which succeed us. This can be tied in to a study of restructuring urban development to avoid sprawl, or the political debate over economic growth versus preservation of natural resources. New research is coming out about potentially valuable medications that can be made from engangered species which inhabit the rain forest; have your child analyze what might be gained versus what might be lost if we destroy this habitat. Discuss the depletion of the ozone layer. Although we don't know whether the tree was to be cut down to make way for development, to be used as lumber, or to make paper products, you can use this book to introduce the very real impact of recycling. Purchase some Seventh Generation paper products and read the quote from The Great Law of The Iroquois Confederacy:\\"In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.\\"The story of The Great Kapok Tree can be tied in with a social studies or science curriculum at nearly every grade level. Regardless of your child's age, don't hesitate to purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"Dear Readers,This book intrigues the imagination of children through the pictures and characters used within the story. The story is about how individuals need to respect others. It teaches children to be concerned about the world around them. Everyone needs to explore the world and strive to make it a better place in which to live.Many lessons can be taught by using this book. Students could complete a writing assignment in which they write to organizations that are trying to save the rain forest. They could offer their suggestions on how we could go about this difficult task. Through discussion and exploration of the world around them children could learn how every living creature relies on the other for survival. A mini-lesson on feeling and emotions could be taught with the use of this book.Students within my classroom have acted this story out by presenting a classroom play. They have written letters of concern about the destruction of the rain forest and its vast resources and animals. During the school year we have researched the products that are produced because of materials obtained from the rain forest and how they effect their own lives. The students within my classroom located several sources on the rain forest through the Internet, books, and magazines to enable them to develop a HyperStudio presentation about the rain forest. All of these projects and lessons involved cooperative learning, fun, and researching. Children need the opportunity to explore the world through a variety of methods.

The rainforest is a gift to us and cutting it down would be like throwing away one of the best gifts Mother Nature could ever give. Our earth doesn't have very many beautiful non-manmade things and we should cherish what we have left of our rainforest. Like the book says \`If you cut down the rainforest what will your eyes feast on?' I would honestly recommend this book to people ages 1-100. I can only hope everyone else got the message like I did.

It starts when two men walked into a rain forest. The larger man pointed to a large kapok tree. Then he walked away. The smaller man then hold his heavy axe started to cut down the tree. Soon he became very tired and went into a deep sleep. But as he slept, the animals whose lives depended on the great kapok tree started to come down to the ground and started to quietly whisper in the man's ear, talking about how important the rainforest was. Later a rainforest boy comes and whisper in the man's year too, agreeing with the animals. Then the man wakes up and he was about to cut down the tree but then he stopped and he walked out the rainforest quietly.This book has a moral.

Only recently has the importance of trees become apparent, brought to light by those who value the life that trees provide. Lynne Cherry is one of these people; her gorgeously illustrated book teaches the importance of trees and the abundance that they give to nature and its creatures.In this book, a man is hired to chop down a Kapok tree, one of the largest and most important in the entire forest. After just a few chops, the heat of the forest and the exertion of his efforts tire him out and he lies down to sleep. One by one, the different creatures of the forest creep over to him and whisper in his ear the importance of the tree, asking him to spare it and leave it to those who need it. By the time he wakes, his decision and his view of the forest are altered forever. This book is beautifully put together, both with illustrations and a story that's simply but powerfully written.I've loved trees all my life and this lovely story teaches children the importance of taking care of nature and animals. I really can't believe one person's snooty comment that nature preservation is \\"not the job of children\\". First of all, children will not be children forever; they are the future and it is our responsibility to teach them how to take care of the environment if we want them to be responsible adults. Second of all, children CAN make a difference! If you go to Lynne Cherry's website, you'll see that a kid's organization convinced Mcdonald's to recycle their paper products.I also disagree with the silly statement that the book puts animals above people. What it does is remind us that if we don't take care of nature, there will be no tomorrow for future generations. Besides, one of the \\"creatures\\" of the forest who whispered to the man while he was sleeping was a Native American who needed the tree, so the message of the book would be to put others ahead of yourself. I personally think it's refreshing to write a book that gives animals a voice since they're so often overlooked. This book is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Great Kapok Tree: a Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest","review":"Total Points = 100 (Highly recommended)Content Appropriate for Children - 20/20A fun story for children of all ages and a good introduction to many beautiful and animals.

I think this is a good book for these ages because you will learn about the rainforest and the animals that live there. It will teach kids what a rainforest is like today.

Her observations about people and human nature are alarmingly astute. She teaches about a little-known, but important, period in history, but she does not lecture the reader who is far too engrossed in the tragic relationship of Marc and Bluett to realize that he/she has learned something along the way. This is a book that you will gobble up in one sitting (not often said about a book drenched with history) -- and will linger with you for days to come."},{"Title":"Russian Dance: A True Story of Intrigue and Passion in Stalinist Moscow","review":"Author Andree Aelion Brooks renders the story of Bluet Rabinoff and Marc Cheftel so compellingly that one is tempted to read the book in one sitting -- not only to find out what happens next in this story of a great love, but also to appreciate the meticulously researched details of a turbulent era in world history. Whether the setting is the opulent world of the arts that Bluet inhabits in New York City in the late 1920s, or the day-to-day bleak subsistence and terror of Stalinist Moscow in 1931, Brooks creates a sense of immediacy and urgency -- a true &quot;you are there&quot; quality.In addition to chronicling the joys and perils of a great passion between two unique people, the book also serves as a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of idealogy and nation-building. Moreover, it makes clear how historical events affect the most personal of issues: love, friendship, parenthood, loyalty. In sum, an excellent book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Russian Dance: A True Story of Intrigue and Passion in Stalinist Moscow","review":"I thought it was an interesting story, however, I did find some of the historical information a little confusing.I also felt the main character was a little self-centered."},{"Title":"Russian Dance: A True Story of Intrigue and Passion in Stalinist Moscow","review":"This is a beautiful but haunting true story about a romance that occurred between two people during a difficult time in history. There is also a lot to learn in this book about Stalinist Russia and the emerging Communist party, and how it drastically altered the lives of people in that era. I highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are a Russian history buff."},{"Title":"Goethe and Beethoven,","review":"It is very nice book I like very much the historical books and the music books. Romain Rolland is a very good writer."},{"Title":"For the Record.(Vitals): An article from: The Register-Guard (Eugene, OR)","review":"At first I was sceptical, but this detailing of births in Eugene, Or is riveting! Wow! You will not be able to put it down. Great vacation reading! Suitable for children of all ages and adults. I can't wait to buy the paperpack. When is it coming out?"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I have enjoyed reading several other books detailing the customs and religious beliefs of the Amish. I purchased this book thinking it too would be enjoyable reading. In my opinion, this book is one of the most boring and &quot;slow&quot; books I have read in a long time. I will probably not even read the last few chapters, but go on to another author, hoping for more enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"This book gives a nicely written look into the life of a young girl being brought up in the Amish tradition. It focuses on Rosanna's life and that of her family, and allows the reader a glimpse into what traditions and values the Amish instill in their children. The story goes into detail about such things as holidays, prayers, weddings -- even down to how they set their tables! A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"While this book may not be for everybody, and it might not include all the aspects that a reader might expect - kind of a one stop shopping to tell everything that is necessary to understand this sect - it nevertheless tells you what the Amish are really like and why they wear the unusual clothes they do, as well as preach against the \\"worldly wisdom.\\" You get to follow Rosanna through her childhood, youth, courtship, and marriage, and child-rearing. Not only that, you see how her Amish life will differ from that of her Catholic friends, especially when they visit from their Philadelphia home.While this is not a modern day presentation, it is really useful as a historical piece. Just don't get bogged down by expecting a thorough intellectual examination of the Amish. The book is not intended for that. It is written as a honest, sympathetic and straightforward reflection of these folks from a religious, social, and economic snapshot. The traditions of the Amish are celebrated, and it's done very nicely. Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I loved this book....and was sorry to see it end. The author (son of Rosanna) wrote a beautiful yet simple and compelling biography on the life of his mother, and the people closest in her life. I felt privileged reading this story - almost as if I were a member of this close-knit community. This story of honor and simple values would be wonderful today as it was then. Probably the most surprising statements which helped me to put it in perspective were comments made about Lincoln.....while I would prefer to believe this was a modern day story - stage coaches were in use and Lincoln was the President of the day. I highly recommend this book as an insight into the wisdom of how people should hold respect for one another, how families could work together for each other's good......and how communities can thrive without the aid of much of the electronic gadgetry of our modern times. This is a book of simple wisdom and peaceable lives. I am so grateful to son Joseph for his writing. There is even a very few pages at the end of the book, telling a bit about him......I highly recommend this book and hope you find value in it as I certainly did."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The author is the son of the main character, Rosanna. Rosanna is the daughter of an Irish immigrant who is born around 1840 (my estimate as it is never given in the book). Rosanna's mother dies following Rosanna's birth. She is given to an Amish family on a temporary basis. When her father dies some months later, she ends up being permanently adopted and rasied by this old order Amish woman who later marries and bears more children.The author tells this interesting story, all the while weaving information about the lives of the old order Amish. I found this an interesting read. Explanations for why the Amish do things the way they do are given. There are details about their religious services, weddings, and funerals. Why they refuse to buy medical or fire insurance, why they refuse government aide, and why they refuse to fight in American wars is all explained.The author ends up going to college and later leaves the old order Amish to become a Mennonite. The old order Amish don't allow attending college as the author chose to do, to further his formal training as a teacher, so he had to change religious affiliations.What is missing from this book is a true spirit for Rosanna as a woman. Specifically, there is not much emotion or thoughts about certain things such as what it is like to mother children. There was virtually nothing about the experience of pregnancy, childbirth from her point of view, or how she could balance all that work and rearing so many children. The emotional aspect of losing her only daughter when she was just a toddler was not really elaborated on. I understand that it may be the custom to not verbally express emotions but I refuse to believe that emotions are not experienced...then again, if she was quiet about expressing her emotions I guess she would not have told her son therefore making these thoughts impossible for him to know and write about. Also missing was an explanation for what an Amish childhood is like, how much do they play and work? How much do they contribute to the laborious farm work the families accomplish? How does a busy Amish mother have time to pamper and enjoy her newborn baby? Also I'd like some parenting information such as common philosophies such as \\"is corporal punishment used\\"?Something else that I would have appreciated is a bit of an overview of the differences between the different orders and about the differences with the Mennonites. A better explanation of when and why people are ex-communicated, banned or shunned would put things more in perspective. There is nothing about this except a couple of sentences of inferred information. To get that information will take further research and reading.The account of the old order Amish is tastefully and respectfully written about in this book. I think this would make a great read aloud book for young children or as a book for a young person to read to themselves, perhaps if learning about American history or just to satisfy a curiosity about the Amish. There is nothing in here that is controversial such as sexual content. Since they live such a clean and virtuous life, there is nothing that needs censoring here for young children.The old order Amish are portrayed as a content, happy, and peaceful people. If we each changed a few things we non-Amish do to follow in their footsteps we'd be all the better for it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I remember my mother reading this book to the family when I was a child so when I found it in the bookstore I had to pick it up.I found the book interesting and the Amish a fascinating group of people. The book tells about the Amish and about growing up Amish. The Amish live a totally different type of lifestyle than most of us are used to and this book explains some of their reasons for why that is. In living close to them I was able to compare what the book said with what I saw them doing.If you ever find this book I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"Rosanna of the Amish is the story of a young orphan raised in the 1800's among the Amish of Pennsylvania. Beginning with it's first pages, the story reaches out and pulls you in. From it's descriptions of the Amish worship to the simplcity of daily life, it brings the often secluded world of the Amish to life, not only describing how things are done, but in many cases why...I couldn't put the book down once I started and to date have read it numberous times. It is a classic that bears reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"First written in 1940, this book tells the story of the author's mother, an Irish girl who was orphaned as a newborn and raised by an Amish neighbor after her father and older siblings move away. Rosanna grows up to be Amish in everyway, and over the years, she does get a chance to see her Catholic siblings from time to time and the difference in their lives.I enjoyed the character Rosanna and reading about her life. Her characterization, and that of other characters was good, but not outstanding. What makes this book so enjoyable is how naturally the author brings you into the Amish lifestyle. We learn about dress, selection of ministers, the bann, courtship, worship services, etc and very much feel like we're part of the scene. There are some differences compared to the Amish of today (and between different groups), in the exact specifics of dress, most using generators and having bathrooms today, etc, but the fundamentals of the group and their basic principles are the same.To anyone who is fascinated by the Amish or enjoys reading other Amish books, I would definitely recommend this one. This book has the advantage of being written by one who grew up in the community. It conveys the lifestyle very well and is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read all school year. I've always wondered about the amish society, but until I finished this book this afternoon, I didn't have any clue as to what the amish believed.Joseph Yoder makes it possible for people like me to really enjoy a school book.I really think that if you have any questions about the amish to go straight to this book and read it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I read this book almost thirty years ago, and read it again this year. My memories of a great story about the Amish were completely confirmed on the second reading. Joseph Yoder tells a very sensitive and caring story about his mother, Rosanna, and the family and Amish community in which he grew up. The reader must accept that the book was first published many decades ago and therefore was written to different standards than today's family stories. I credit the author with refraining from judgement when it comes to doctrinal differences among various Amish and Mennonite groups. The fact that he left the Old Order church of his childhood for a less conservative church, yet was still fully accepted in the community of his youth speaks for the respect he retained in the Old Order group. If you are looking for a completely family friendly story with great information on the Old Order Amish of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you will not find a more enjoyable read.Rosanna's Boys"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The book was in great condition and was exactly how they described it. Can't believe they only wanted a penny for it! The only thing was the first time I had to sit down and read it for a long period of time I started to smell something and when I pulled the book closer to my nose, I realized that it was the book that smelled like cigarette smoke. I gag almost everytime I open it, but spraying it with body spray seems to be helping =)"},{"Title":"MUSIC IN SEQUENCE: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO MIDI SEQUENCING.","review":"Music in Sequence is a book I found several years ago when I first began playing with MIDI sequencing. Written for a rank beginner, it briefly teaches the basics of reading music and finding notes on the keyboard. However, the heart of the book is making good music using a sequencer. The authors take you step-by-step through 15 sequences, each designed to teach you the techniques for making the most of the power inherent in sequencing. In addition to the specific instructions for each piece, there are suggestions for modifying the sequence in different ways, and additional pieces you can use as a seed for developing the ideas in each lesson further on your own.Something I particularly enjoyed about this book is its use of a wide variety of musical styles, and the whimsical selections they chose--everything from baroque (Pachelbel's Canon and Bach's Crab Canon) to classical ballet, to marching band music (Sousa's the Liberty Bell), to Gershwin, to modern pop, to the theme from the Muppet Show. It would be hard to improve on what these authors have done in developing an intro to the complex world of MIDI."},{"Title":"MUSIC IN SEQUENCE: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO MIDI SEQUENCING.","review":"I agree with everything in the review above - but want to add that the book is still in print.

You'll laugh a lot, and think about it long after you've put it down. The characters are vividly drawn, the dialogue crackles, and while the story has its exaggerated comedic moments (there's an amazing no-hitter that remains a personal favorite), the tone is realistic and the details ring true. Carkeet never makes fun of his characters -- ok, almost never -- but he sure makes them fun.Highly recommended, and if you enjoy this, you'll also enjoy his novels on linguist-for-hire (I'm not making this up) Jeremy Cook, _Double Negative_, _The Full Catastrophe_, and _The Error of Our Ways_."},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"The Greatest Slump is one of the greatest baseball stories. A hapless team of talented misfits struggle with their lives and psychological problems as they make their way through a winning season. Professional baseball has never been funnier. A classic of sports \\"anti-psych\\". Carkeet writes better than almost anyone else in America, and in this novel he pins the favorite pass-time on the point of his pen and shakes it until we are all splattered in laughter."},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"In a stroke of what may be coincidence, all the key players on a National League contender fall into clinical depression. Each teammate despairs in the face of crushing personal challenges that threaten to make the each day too horrible to endure. Yet the team's collective talent and years of mechanical &quot;good habits&quot; propel the club ever higher toward a seemingly inevitable and fatal humiliation. Life, friendship, honesty and humility eventually prevail. This book has a message for young male professionals and those who would understand them."},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"Novelist and Linguist David Carkeet's take on the great American pastime is really a take on the great American dream, in all its comic absurdity. Without giving away any spoilers, the denoument is inverted from that of the usual sports story. The fact that it's an ensemble cast seems to have been off-putting to some readers, but the basic theme is that of any \\"team\\" - and by inference, a microcosm of how we assemble ourselves as a whole in society as collections of individuals. We are more than the sum of our parts (or neuroses), but at the same time nothing without hanging on to our individual identities and idiosyncracies.This is an often hilarious book, but it's by no means a happy one. The observations about baseball, and of baseball, are incisive, but at the same time you don't need to be a baseball fan to enjoy the novel. It's one of the subtle characteristics of this book, as with any (well-done) book about a subculture, in that if you know the subculture, you'll recognize a nuanced description of it, but if you don't, you'll feel immersed in a new world.I wouldn't necessarily recommend reading this in the dark of winter after your team has choked out yet another futile season, but as a book of deep comic depression, it makes for good summer reading when you have a live ballgame to fall back on when you're all done.A minor classic in 9 chapters."},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"I wanted to like this book.The main problem for me was that this book had no discernible plot. It was just Carkeet moving from one quirky player's problems to another quirky player's problems. I only read until page 50, and the book's plot had not start moving at that point. Not a good sign.I also didn't like the tone of the writing. Carkeet seems very taken by his quirky style and cleverness. It overwhelms the book, and is ultimately what keeps the plot bogged down in minutiae.Perhaps his existing fans will like this book, but I found it boring and unenjoyable."},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"Interesting, fun-to-read book about a mismatched bunch of eccentrics, some of them would-be psychos, who come together to form a pretty good baseball team without losing their hangups, uncertainties, fears, hopes, dreams and odd-ball ways.At times a laugh-out-loud book, always a fun, \\"can't-put-it-down\\" book especially for lovers of baseball, the game and all the personalities and stories that surround it. Not for the baseball purist, however, just the fun lovers. As with life and most good books, it has a serious side mixed with humor, compassion, anger and, always, emotion. Good Read...(Out of Print, but worth trying to find...)"},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"This is a great baseball novel. My hat goes off to the author who captures the spirit of not only the game but of the players"},{"Title":"The Greatest Slump of All Time","review":"This was recommended as a great baseball book, and perhaps that sets the bar pretty low. Carkeet knows baseball, writing easily about nuance and detail of the game - to the point where a casual fan or non-fan will probably be at a loss. The problem is with the structure. The premise is that every member of a contending professional baseball team simultaneously falls into depression. Hijinks follow. Unfortunately, the narrative clicks so quickly from one character to the next, and there are nine protagonists, that it eventually becomes impossible to sort out one character from another. I found myself paging along, not remembering which character had which peculiarity, waiting for something to happen. Very little happened.Carkeet's prose is cute, and occasionally powerful. But the book is not particularly strong."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A very good read!Slightly different prose than the Lord of the Rings books.

And I really recommend reading it before you see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Get it. Just get it. I picked this book up for an English literature project in Middle School, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Tolkien superbly writes this novel, weaving a fantasy universe that have wasted countless hours of my time on wikipedia. Although it was written in a more lighthearted manner than the Lord of the Ring Series, also by Tolkien, it does not lessen at all the fantastic storytelling of the book.In short, a hobbit (an imaginary creature that resembles people, just half their size), named Bilbo Baggins, is whisked away on an adventure, along with a band of courageous dwarves, and a wizard, in order to reclaim the dwarves lost treasure that was stolen by a dragon named Smaug. It sounds like a story to start your typical Dungeons and Dragons encounter, but trust me that it will be much more than that. I couldn't put the book down after I picked it up, I think that I had finished it in about two days. If you've already seen the movie, don't worry, there is much storyline that the movie didn't recount. Besides, you can boast to your friends after reading this that you know how the Hobbit movies will end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great book.

Great for someone if they are a fan of the stories and surely a neccessity to a collector."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I put off reading this book because everyone I knew had already read it in High School. So, naturally I felt I would be less then interested in the topic now that I was older. I finally gave in and picked it up since I wanted to read it before the major motion picture comes out this December. Let me tell you that my ideas about this book couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely loved this book and kept flying through the pages eager to be swept up in the little Hobbit's next adventure. Tolkien keeps it fresh by introducing new and different characters throughout the book - and then does an excellent job tying them back into the story by the end. I feel this would be an excellent book for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Little Bilbo Baggins seemed at first like an innocent person, completely absorbed in his own little world, but as you read, you will find that no one escapes the wrath of Bilbo! This story is about a hobbit and a group of dwarves who set out to retrieve more plunder than is imaginable from the great dragon Smaug. Humor is very visible in this book, so if you like humor, and if you like fantasy, read The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you haven't already, READ THIS BOOK! Tolkien is the all time master of all fantasy--he basically created the whole genre! If you read the hobbit, you'll know why. The storyline is fantastic, the details are descriptive and imaginitive, and on whole, it's a fabulous book, even if you're not a fantasy fan. The only thing that I can suggest is that you read the Hobbit before picking up Tolkien's other works (namely, LoR or the Silmarillion). If you'd like to get a bit more background on the world of Middle Earth, though, I suggest that you read the Silmarillion. Fair warning, the Silmarillion is MUCH harder to read than LoR or the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot;&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a book of adventure. If you like adventure books you will love The Hobbit! The main character is a hobbit. Hobbits are small man-like creatures. Bilbo Baggins isn't looking for an adventure, but he ends up going on one. There are 13 dwarves, and a Wizard. They are trying to kill a dragon and get the stolen money from the dragon and give it to the owners. Bilbo has to fight goblin's, troll's, and on the way he finds a magic ring that makes him invisible when he puts it on.I like the Hobbit because the ring is so cool, and the book is so exciting when he's talking to a slimy character named Gollum while he risks his life in a riddle competition. The book is so exciting!You should read this book!Warning: The first two chapters are boring but at chapter three the adventure begins!

The plot was facinating, though somewhat conincedental, like when Bilbo slips out of the cave and just happens to find the dwarves and Gandalf. However, there are many interesting word choices. For instance, hobbit originated from the word holbytla, an Old English construct, means hole-builder. So the first sentence can be trnslated to &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hole-builder.&quot; It's a bit of a joke.Most of the names in this book go around in circles like that.

I think it should be required for students to read before they enter high school. So many times our schools don't enforce the importance of reading. Your brain soaks up literature and it also helps to improve your vocabulary. That would make this book the perfect example. And it not's a complicating book.

Being called the precurser to the Lord of the Rings does not do it justice. It is simply the most universally enjoyable story that I have ever read.

Martin"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of the most wonderfully developed stories that i have ever read. It has great humor and an incredible theme: anyone can make a difference if they put their mind to it. A lovely book for all ages and all readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a very exciting book. It had wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copycats. The story brings the characters to life with very descriptive words. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters.Gandalf, the wizard, is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and clever and can solve just about any problem with his magic or his wits. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with a lot of the different characters you meet throughout the novel. He has many friends of all races (which is unusal for the story) such as dwarves, hobbits, elves and even special magic friends that can be more than one species of animalsThis is very interesting book. It is fun and exciting and paints wonderful adventures in my head. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books. If J.R.R Tolkien's other books are as exciting and interesting as this one I think he should be considered one of the best authors of our time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is my favorite book so far. I read so many and this is my favorite. This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo and his friends. You must read this. I seriously could not put this book down. I read this whole book(330 pages) in six days. NO LIE!If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, and home again, and can take an interble hero(blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck) here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler...In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way(as he did)-if you do not already know all about these things-much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves get some glimpes into the history and politics of a neglected but impotant period!When i was reading this book it was like a movie and if i stopped reading i missed the whole movie. A++++++++++++++ Book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently re-read THE HOBBIT for the first time in many, many years. I liked it much more as an adult, and especially after reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a saga, while THE HOBBIT is a fairy tale. As such, it is lighter, funnier, and faster-paced than the trilogy. These qualities make it more entertaining and enjoyable.Unlike THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which plods along and contains many chapters where essentially nothing happens, THE HOBBIT contains action in every chapter. A new monster is introduced in each chapter, and something is always happening. The book holds together remarkably well, and contains an arc that ties everything together.The only drawback with THE HOBBIT is shared with all Tolkien that I've read. I think of it as the \\"Eagles Fly Out of the Sky\\" problem. Whenever Tolkien gets his heroes in a particularly tough fix, rather than having them use their wits to escape, he has eagles fly out of the sky and save them, or some other happenstance that is beyond the protagonists' control. The eagles swoop to the rescue twice. This is more than compensated by Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, but even that encounter ends by Bilbo inadvertently asking an unanswerable riddle. While I enjoyed THE HOBBIT enough to think that someday I'll read it a third time, I struggle with the message here and with the rest of the Middle Earth saga - do wits matter? Do things just happen? Should wen go with the flow? Or should wen just marvel at the fantasy?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an account of the amazing adventure of Bilbo Baggins. He leaves his lovely hole in the shire, under the guidance of Gandalf the wizard, and a dozen rough and tough dwarves. Although Bilbo is a bit out of place amongst the group, he turns out to be a both an important ally and wonderful friend. This tale will pull you and never let go of you. And it sets the stage for the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings serious. It gives the backround tale of how the ring came into the hands of our little hobbit heroes and introduces the characters that follow you through the Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone with a heart for adventure and a taste for fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is such a great book and is well liked because of its story, but I liked it mainly because of how well it is written. There were parts toward the end of the book that seemed to drag a little, but for the most part it was put together rather nice. I loved the fact that it was written as if from another culture and it spoke to the reader as if it was from a familiar culture or one right close to it. It talked to you as if you already knew certain things about something that you might never have heard of, and soon after it explains exactly what it was or hinted in such great detail that no two people could be far apart from what has been drawn in their heads. The Hobbit does such a great job in having the reader come up with his own conclusions of how something will turn out and the book will take some strange twist that proves you right and wrong at the same time. Such as, you know they will escape from something and so you play it out in your mind. When it happens, you had the right idea, but the way it was done wasn't even close to how you saw it happening. This book was written with extreme greatness and is built to always keep you on your toes and to keep you looking forward for what is coming next. This book makes my list of books to recommend, mainly because it was so beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and The Trilogy of the Rings were excellent.

Many a time have I shut the round door of study (always latched and locked, you know: never can tell when a nasty Sackville-Baggins will pop in), and settled down with a dog-eared edition of this book. I first read it years ago when my uncle Bob (a bit like old Bilbo himself) told me of the bourgeois burglar and the quandary he fell into when an acerbic wizard (Isatari) barged into his home in the cozy Shire. Inside a hole in the ground, Mr. Baggins signed a contract that bound us all to a delightful treat. Let us be thankful that he did, fellow reader! The adventures of Thorin and Co. enriched us who tagged along. You should buy this book for your child and yourself. Read it to him aloud. Tolkien revels in the narrator's interjections. Give the narrator your voice, and you child will have a warm memory; he will pass it on to your progeny; more warm moments will be born: in short, you will be better off for it.

Altho &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; gives background as to how Baggins found the ring, the &#34;Hobbit&#34; gives a much greater in depth view to the whole adventure.

It might get heavier at times with the detailed descriptions, but you will find yourself singing along the songs the dwarfs sing in your mind. very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It has been quite a few years since my first reading of the Hobbit and since I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and seen the movies numerous times. Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've lost count of the number of times I've read The Hobbit over the years, it was the book that started my love of all things fantasy and it was always a go to book that I could read again and again as I was growing up. It must have been at least 5 years since I last read it though so I wanted to pick it up again before going to see the movie. It doesn't matter how many times I pick it up I still love it as much as the first and it always surprises me how many little details I forget between readings.I know that most people have already read the story but if you're one of the few who haven't then I'd highly recommend it. It's a great story for adults but I also think it makes fantastic bed time reading with children because it's such a fun adventure story. There is a reason it's considered a classic! The last thing Bilbo Baggins is looking for is an adventure, he is quite happy living in his hobbit hole enjoying plenty of food and good company when he wants it (which is not too often thank you very much). When Gandalf arrives with a party of thirteen dwarves Bilbo is convinced they have come to the wrong person for help but the more he learns about their quest to re-claim their lands from the dragon who stole them the more curious he becomes and in the end he can't resist joining them.Bilbo is the least likely of heroes, he doesn't consider himself particularly brave or smart and he has practically no experience of travelling or fighting, but when it comes down to it the dwarves wouldn't have got very far without him. I always enjoy seeing Bilbo reach is full potential, he goes on a journey of personal discovery and proves to everyone just what a strong character he is. The story isn't as dark or scary as the Lord of the Rings books are and is suitable for a younger audience but it is still quite scary in places and the scenes with Gollum are particularly creepy. I love the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum but have to admit that I'd be hopeless at figuring out the answers myself if I was in Bilbo's place! The Hobbit is such an enjoyable story and a great introduction to the Lord of the Rings books, I really think I'm going to have to re-read those this year too!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As everyone knows, this is an absolute classic and a good place to start for beginners and veteran readers alike. It is especially nice to see the forward where Tolkin kindly reminds the teachers to boy try and read anything into the book - it is for enjoyment only, not dissection."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book!

Since then, I have been a rabid fan of scifi and fantasy novels, and I can attribute my discovery of the incredible world of fantasy fiction to this book.

It wasn't easy for our form teacher, Mr. Martin, to control 35 kids but when he started to read this book, from the very first words, all of us were captivated. We became so enthralled by the story that we used to paint pictures and make giant posters of the leading characters. Everyone had their own idea on how a Hobbit looked, or how a troll smelt! I would strongly recommend that this book be read to any child over the age of seven but make sure you read it with the light on."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is just amazing.

The entire fantasy genre owes its roots to Tolkein. Without him, we wouldn't have silly but brave Hobbits, beautiful and wondrous Elves, stalwart dwarves or daughty and prideful Dunedain. Tolkein was the first (and probably the best) writer to fully create a fantasy world that draws you in with its detail, astounds you with the vividness of its characters, and surprise you with the fulness of its history. If you love fantasy, but haven't read this book, then you are definitely missing a classic. Tolkein is one of a very few fantasy authors whose work can be honestly called &quot;literature&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am 12 now and first read the book in second grade. It captivated me and I was further hooked on reading. I even read Micheal Crighton's Jurassic Park that year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the Hobbit during the 4th grade summer. Now I'm in seventh grade and I still love it. Its a true captavating experience which will cause both insomnia and tiredness. Tolkien takes you to a place where you have never gone before. The creativity is endless and you feel yourself being pulled into the heat of the battles. You start shouting as battles are taking place and rooting for Mr. Bilbo Baggins to come on top. You can't miss this once in a life time experience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The imagination of the writer would be less admired if this tale did not have deeper meaning or did not suggest natural social, moral, and motivational problems with humanity. Please be sure to read 'The Hobbit', any one of the many on the shelf, and please be sure to consider what the author means to say about personal or spiritual journeys, mental excitement, moral enthusiasm, and general happiness (versus the evil of the mundane and predictable.) Too often in the process of reading the great stories, allusions are missed and metaphors are disregarded. Please soak in the book, and look beyond the swords, wizards and dragons. We all know very well that what Tolkien did best was create stimulating fantasy, but he stumbled upon greatness with 'The Hobbit'. He orchestrated a masterpiece through the kind of characters, language and setting he enjoyed best. (That is in my opinion a sure sign of a genius, confident in his ability to create literature in a nontraditional method.) It is the kind of book that causes epiphanies!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A truly amazing story with unparalleled use of imagination and outstanding of depth of story. With characters which are perfectly real and complex matched with the indepth world of Middle Earth which has languages, peoples, geography, and a true *feel* of its own, this story is amazing, and stands as my favorite novel, of course, next to The Lord of the Rings, which continues the plight of Bilbo's magical ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was an incredble book. It made me feel as if I was Bilbo and I must say it is a really good book to read.

The Hobbit is an amazing book for anyone over the age of 11. I first read it when I was 11 or 12 years old and still find new things to like about it now that I'm 41.

I can't think of anything negative to say about this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What a fascinating look into the creative process for \\"Middle Earth\\" this book provides! It's the first of Tolkien's works set in that realm, and it introduces characters he later tweaked to suit his needs in writing The Lord of the Rings. The first look at Gollum is a real treat, and so is the overall setup for the universe of the later trilogy. Dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins and hobbits...oh, my!Compared to the complex \\"Rings\\" books, this one tells a simple and straightforward tale. Its violence and general scariness level is about the same as most traditional fairy tales, making it suitable for most children although decidedly unsuitable for kids who get nightmares easily (I was one of those myself - \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" absolutely freaked me out). Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who lives contentedly in a very comfortable hobbit hole, welcomes first a wizard named Gandalf and then a band of noisy, hungry, demanding dwarves into his home. Before he knows it, he's been swept up in their quest to reclaim an ancestral treasure - a quest that takes him far away, on a journey from which he may never return.My well-meaning friend who suggested giving this book a miss, \\"Because it's just for children,\\" apparently has far different tastes than I do.

He'd prefer to stay in his clean hobbit-hole all day and night instead of going outside to the Hill. He dressed well, was fairly smart, and didn't mind company, but prefered his home to himself.Then, one day, an unexpected party forms in Bilbo's home. It included 13 dwarves and one wizard-Thorin Oakenshield, the leader, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, and Kili, and the wise wizard Gandalf. They had a merry feast, Bilbo still quite confused about the whole predicament, and began to sing in one of the many rooms of Bilbo's hobbit-hole. Bilbo was then given the shocking news that he would go on the dwarves' treacherous trek to the Desolation of Smaug as their burglar. Bilbo, being the respectable hobit he is, had never done any thieving, but Gandalf said he would satisfy them. They battled first the goblins going across the Misty Mountains, Gandalf saving all of them but Bilbo from the goblins' clubs and weapons. Bilbo had fallen, and in their rush, they had forgotten all about the little hobbit. When he regained conciousness, he stumbled around in the darkness until he tripped over something-a ring. He put the ring in his pocket and continued to stumble down the damp cave. His feet touched the edge of an underground lake later, and met a strange character by the name of Gollum. Gollum lost a riddle game to Bilbo, then realized that his \\"magic ring\\" had gone missing. Bilbo put on the ring in his pocket, and descovered that he became invisible when he wore the ring. Gollum began searching around the cave, leading Bilbo unknowingly to the exit of the cave. Bilbo escaped and met up with the dwarves and Gandalf, and they continued into the forest-until they met up with a wolf pack! They nearly didn't escape. After that little adventure, they quickly visited Beorn, a bear of a man, then traveled into Mirkwood-then taken captive by giant spiders! Again they escaped, and were taken captive again by the elvenking, and escaped there by floating down the river by barrels. After visiting Lake Town, they traveled onto the Lonely Mountain-the Desolation of Smaug. Later, Smaug is killed, and the treasure that was sought for so long was divided between the remaining-everyone but Thorin, Fili, and Kili-after the Battle of Five Armies. In the end, Bilbo returns to his little hobbit-hole, suddenly taking a liking to poetry.The main conflict is that Bilbo and Thorin and Co. are searching for Smaug's stolen treasure, and encounter many problems along the way. The resolution? They work together. They may fight along the way, but they get out alive.I guess the theme of the story could be that if you work together and think things through, you can get through anything.I reccomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, sci fi, and adventure!It really is an enchanting tale, and I can't wait to continue the Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about what happened befor Frodo then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about this world then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had the pleasure of listening to the Rob Inglis audiobook version of The Hobbit on a recent long car trip.

Apart from Sean Wadley's The Legend of Rudwin, I don't think I have ever read a book like this. It literally leaps from one magical scene to the other, like a deer flitting through a glade!The imagination in this one book cannot be equalled. To me it's a singular piece of work. Many refer to it loosely as a type of prelude... but no! It's far more than that. A classic to stand alongside the greats.The charming humour throughout the story is a reminiscent of forgotten times, and through the narrative you can read and see an old way of life - a forgotten way of story telling. And the author's love of nature blooms through the verses of every page. The characters are marvellous, and Bilbo - the hobbit in question - is without doubt the greatest of anti-heroes. He would rather spend all day eating and smoking pipe weed! Top man I say!Though I do read the new fantasy books that have followed in its wake, The Hobbit is still the very best as far as I am concerned. I'm just so glad the book is still loved and bought and reread multiple times.

The world is in-depth and very magical (well duh, it IS Tolkien after all). The story keeps you interested and having fun, and the book itself isn't even lacking in action. Now, don't hate me when I say this, but I actually think this book is better than the Lord of the Rings.

It's descriptive and a light read .All throughout history , we human beings have been fascinated of being Invisible - Invisible Man, Hollow Man, LOTR and of Course The Hobbit.

But it seemed appropriate to note that since I first read the Hobbit some 30 years ago and wanted to read it again, the purchasing options were surreal.My first version was just the mass market paperback, published during the seventies, it may have been a public library book, although I'm sure I owned it, or one like it later (after I read the Lord of the Rings series, I re-readThe Hobbit.) Having recently purchased LOTRO MMORPG software (Lord of the Rings Online Massively-Multi-Player Role Playing Game) because it's characterized as 'adult' friendly RPG, I've not yet selected a server to subscribe to (there are several stateside, as well as international locations.)I'm just as enthusiastic as everyone in J.R.R.'s fan club to see the up-coming release of The Hobbit at the theater. I can hardly wait to see how the screen writers deal with the crisis point of the Arkenstone. And, beautiful as New Zealand makes Middle Earth to appear on the silver screen, I even find traces of Africa and America in the novels.

I know I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it on my own time, and I believe I will do so in the future, so I can appreciate this book for what it is (it did have good scenes in it) rather than the chore my teacher made it out to be.Thanks a lot, teacher, for ruining my first experience with J.R.R.

I just needed to remember to add the bookmark when I was finished reading for the day..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, but also acts as a great predecessor to the acclaimed trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The story begins with the introduction of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys his quiet life in Bag-End, but has his routine disturbed when his friend Gandalf decides that he needs a change. The poor hobbit soon finds his home filled with a party of dwarves and himself the thief of an expedition to reclaim stolen treasure from the terrible dragon, Smaug.The quest is very exciting, with several satisfying detours that foreshadow larger troubles brewing in Middle Earth. The environments and battles are all vividly described, making it easy for the reader to imagine that they are actually part of the fantastic band of adventurers. Because each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, there is lots of motivation to keep turning the pages, but even if a reader does take an extended break, they are never at a loss for what is happening.*MINOR SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH*The only shortcoming of the novel is that although the theme that even little people can end up doing important things, Bilbo does nothing in the final, climactic battle of the book (The Battle of Five Armies) other than run and hide, despite having strong allies, a powerful weapon, and some new tricks up his sleeve. While this is understandable, considering how small he is, it goes against the stronger, more clever character that he became over the duration of the book.*END OF SPOILERS*In conclusion, you should definitely pick up this book if you haven't already, especially to read the foundation of the upcoming movie. Despite the minor shortcoming mentioned earlier, the adventure is very absorbing and the situations the characters manage to get themselves into and out of are unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first picked this book up at the school library. Later that day I started reading it in class, and found it extremely interesting.I liked the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes. He doesn't just simply tell the tale, he describes it and makes you feel like you are part of it. I felt like Bilbo Baggins from the beginning to the end, and even pretended I was there, solving the riddle(which I did try to do), talking to the dragon, and even climbing the mountains.I've often heard good reports and bad reports of this book. When I found it in the library, I thought what I thought every time I see a book I've heard of, &quot;Well, I'll give it a try.&quot; And through thinking that, I've probably read as many wonderful books as simply terrifying and horrid books. Through that also, I have found out what makes a book good, and what makes a book uninteresting to the reader...Since then, I've also noticed an improvement in my own books and novels. With every good author and good book I am encouraged more to write, since I suddenly pick up another technique of writing. Tolkien has taught me the most, and I never will forget that. All I hear is, &quot;Oh, I read that book when I was ten. It was okay.&quot; I am rather disappointed that was all they to say about a masterpiece of a book. I could encourage so greatly anyone to read and think about what they read here in this book, if they have read it yet. Above all the different types of books, I love fantasy the most. It gives me such an imagination, and also such a tale to think about or add to on boring days. My goal as a writer is to one day, become half as good as Tolkien is, for I think I could not become any better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A cheery hobbit named Bilbo is confronted by a wandering wizard and a truckload of dwarves, then suddenly finds himself trekking across the wilderness in a search for a dragon's treasure!

Much more accessible than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien's delightful tale of Bilbo Baggins' adventures will delight you, dear reader, no matter what your age. Enough said about that.What I will opine about is this edition. I had this when I was a youngster but over the years the book disappeared. I always swore that some day I would get another copy and now that I have, I remember why I loved it so much. This hardbound copy comes handsomely detailed on the cover with elvish runes (you can even find out in the book what they mean!) The illustrations and maps inside are lively and add to the reader's enjoyment. The paper quality and the binding are decent, but nothing to write home about. Still, my 8-year old has started reading the book and it hasn't fallen apart yet, so it seems pretty well made.The bottom line is that I have read other editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- several -- and I prefer this one over all others. Some stories just deserve a substantial feel that paperbacks cannot convey. It's a matter of permanency, and certain works like \\"The Hobbit\\" will remain after many others have faded. This edition just feels good in your hands and really does justice to the story and its author."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The character voices performed by Rob Inglis were spectacular and helped to keep my interest.

Bilbo Baggin's adventures take the reader through enchanted forests and moutntains, meeting dwarves, elves, wargs, and other strange creatures along the way. I read this as a kid and just finished rereading it, and it's as much fun the second time around. Now where can I buy one of those magic rings?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, like The Chronicles of Narnia, defines the standard for children's fantasy literature. Bilbo is one of the endearing hobbit-folk who populate Tolkien's imaginative world of Middle Earth. One day he is compelled by the wizard Gandalf to leave his comfortable home and set out with thirteen dwarves on quest whose ramifications he does not fully understand but in which he will play a crucial role as the group faces monstrous orcs, giant spiders, wolves, and worse, until finally Bilbo comes face to face with the dread dragon Smaug. Throughout his adventures, Bilbo's true character emerges and the reader comes to understand that underneath his soft exterior there is a steely center of courage and the will to do what is right.Tolkien's works have attained classic status through their excellent story quality, deeply coherent story world, and a perceptive eye toward human nature. Christian thinkers especially appreciate that Tolkien's stories, while not allegorical, are firmly rooted in a Christian view of the world.The Hobbit forms an important prelude to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but is written for a younger audience and is a better choice for reading aloud, since its prose is simpler and includes enjoyable repetitive elements in its storytelling style."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Funny, colorful, exciting story of someone who has an adventure and becomes all sorts of things he never expected to be--most of all a true leader."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hobbit is one of the most invaluable and indispensable classics given to the world of literature by Tolkien.Content: Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, comfortably residing in his comfortably furnished &quot;hole in the ground&quot;. His relaxed life-style, however, is interrupted by the magician Gandalf who enlists Bilbo as a thief. Reluctantly Bilbo sets out on a pilgrimage with 12 elves to recover a stolen treasure from a dragon. While trying to accomplish their mission, the unlucky crew encounters countless adventures imbued with life-threatening dangers. Exceeding the elves' expectations, Bilbo becomes of great use in these predicaments. The final bloody battle is the climax of the book.The alluring story line is something that will be parted with reluctance. However lighthearted the novel is, there is some profound symbolism and allusions to real facts. e.g. The final battle in the book is a blatant reference to the events of World War One, through which Tolkien has lived. He was obviously against it, as he demonstrates that myriads of decent, innocent people were obliterated. Also, basically the whole book reverberates the theme of maturing, demonstrated in Bilbo as he transforms from a timid creature to a more heroic persona.Overall:This is a beautifully written book. The writing style used by Tolkien is commendable. The word choice is charming and amiable. The overall style is simple and lucid, but very enthralling and captivating. Definitely something that can be read for leisure. The same can be said of the story-line. It is very solid and well-knit together, there probably isnt a single loophole to taint its value. Filled with wonderful tales of magic and adventure it is second to none in the fantasy class. One of those childhood books that will be fondly remembered later in life. It is only a shame that the sequels to this wonderful fantasy novel have plummeted in the content aspect and the delightful simplicity of Hobbit.In addition to Hobbit, I would recommend The Chronicles of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After waiting for seven months and not finding &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the library, though they had a copy, I read the Harry Potter series seventy-two times.

After reading the splendid and spectacular &quot;Hobbit,&quot; Harry Potter was forgotten for a while. The book is the one of the most breath taking books I have ever read in my entire life. It is about a creature called a hobbit. The hobbits are a little people, smaller than dwarves, and were a peaceful and lovable people. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; concerns a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins who embarks on many adventures when a band of homeless dwarves turn up at his hobbit-hole with the famous wizard Gandalf. The dwarves are in search of the east where the dragon Smaug took their gold and ruined their city. They go on so many adventures, it is hard to count.

Generally speaking the edition is spot on but some pagination issues arise when you come across artwork.

Tolkien fans by adapting the epic novel to a graphic version, illustrated by David Wenzel. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" many times and I worried that the adaptation would leave out too much of the original. The adaptation does leave out some things. However, I was impressed that Dixon and Deming captured the essence of \\"The Hobbit.\\"\\"The Hobbit\\" is the tale of one Bilbo Baggins of Hobbiton. Gandalf the wizard enlists Bilbo to go on a journey to Lonely Mountain. Gandalf the wizard lists Bilbo's profession as burglar, which seems humorous until a reader realizes the full scope of Bilbo's role.The journey to Lonely Mountain is fraught with adventure and danger, and some members of the party encounter great peril. Indeed, not everyone in the party who began the adventure was able to see the end of the adventure.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a subtle story in some ways in that Tolkien wrote the novel without explaining much about the world of \\"The Hobbit.\\" We learn much about Bilbo's world through interaction with the world, which is more typical of contemporary novels than fantasy novels, and is part of the reason \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are such great stories. However, Tolkien spent incredible effort in creating the history and mythology of both novels and drew on his created history and mythology to provide great depth to both novels (note that I am treating \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as a single novel rather than a trilogy). The graphic novel does a nice job of adapting Tolkien's approach to \\"The Hobbit.\\"We have an animated version of \\"The Hobbit\\" and a live action version of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for comparison to this novel. In general, Wenzel's illustrations are reasonably good. My only complaint is that some of the perspective views of the Bilbo made him appear too thin. I also note that Bilbo appears just a little cartoonish as compared to the other characters, which compare very favorably to director Peter Jackson's film characters. Perhaps species is a better term, since only a few characters from \\"The Hobbit\\" appear in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"While I am happy to have this graphic novel, I have already read \\"The Hobbit\\" several times and plan to read it again in the coming year. This graphic novel is not a substitute for Tolkien's prose. I recommend reading that book before purchasing this graphic novel because there is much more detail and much to enjoy in the Tolkien original. Though this graphic novel stands on its own, it is much like reading an abridged version of the original.In the realm of versions of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the original remains the best. However, I think this graphic novel is superior to the 1977 Rankin-Bass animated version. Regardless of which format you have, they are all worth enjoying if you are a fan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is just good clean fun, delightful for children and adults. If you've read LOTR and wondered how Bilbo got the ring, here's the story. I enjoyed Tolkien's omnicient narrator style in this book --somewhat like Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and more recently Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell-- which I suppose he adopted because he was writing for children. I think it's charming.I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Rob Inglis. He's a Royal Shakespeare company actor and the best audiobook reader I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot of them). He has a different voice for each dwarf, and he does a great Gollum, too. He actually sings the songs (nice voice!) and he even belches up ponies. The scene with the trolls is especially well-done. Mr. Ingliss could probably make one of Terry Goodkind's later books sound exciting, but The Hobbit actually is exciting and I highly recommend it for adults and kids.--FanLit.net"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this for the first time as an adult and will forever lament that I did not grow up with this story. I had seen the animated movie but thought I should start reading Tolkien at the beginning, so I picked up my dad's copy of The Silmarillion. Not a great choice for me at ~10 years old, as I was used to reading Judy Blume and Beverly Cleary at that time.I didn't try Tolkien again until I was an adult and looked over my husband's illustrated copy of The Hobbit, gifted by his school-teacher aunt and uncle when he was a child.I have devoured JRRT's works since then. That's how good The Hobbit is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's difficult to decide where J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit ranks among the all-time greatest works of fantasy literature. In a manner of speaking, guilt by association is to blame (or thank). A major factor in the success of The Hobbit is its connection with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The tale of the burglar Bilbo and his Dwarven compatriots' journey to find and slay the dragon Smaug acts as a prelude to Rings, and as such has developed a very unique stigma - it can almost be labeled the black sheep of Tolkien's fantasy universe, relying on The Lord of the Rings for its fame. The original edition of The Hobbit, released in 1937, was even altered to better match the storylines developed in the more recognized Rings series. However, despite these changes (which may or may not have been necessary), The Hobbit is a top-notch fantasy epic through and through. From Gandalf's battle with the mighty cave trolls for Elvish treasure, to Bilbo's battle of wits with the creature Golum, all the way to the Battle of Five Armies, the story is consistently energetic and the characters remain warm and welcoming throughout. What makes The Hobbit truly unique to this day is Tolkien's ability to use the setting of Middle Earth as a tool to weave a story that is unique in its intentions, but parallel to the fantasy epics it sets up.Many aspects of The Hobbit evolved out of the beliefs and knowledge of its author. J.R.R. Tolkien was an extremely educated man. He was the professor of Anglo-Saxon language and English language and literature at Oxford University for thirty-four years. All of his works of literature reflect his love of language - modern and historical, real and invented (including the beloved Elvish tongue). Tolkien's works were influenced by English and Celtic lore, and Norse and Finnish mythology, but above all he was influenced by a devout belief in Roman Catholicism, as evident by the Christian theology sprinkled throughout his works. This is evident at the close of The Hobbit when Bilbo renounces the treasure offered him at the end of his quest because he has no practical use for too much gold. In other words, he already had everything he needs at The Shire in his warm hobbit hole.One of the many timeless aspects of The Hobbit is its approachability. People of all ages have read and fallen in love with Tolkien's prelude. This speaks volumes as to the narrative voice with which Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit, a wizard, and thirteen grumbling dwarves. The language used to convey the story is very simple and yet paints a perfect picture in the reader's mind. For example, the riddles Bilbo uses to trick Golem out of his \`precious' ring are complex enough to dupe the readers (along with Golem), and yet simple enough to warrant thoughts of \\"oh man, I should have known that!\\" In a genre as imagination-driven as fantasy, being able to clearly visualize a world as vivid and complex as Middle Earth is essential to both the plot and the characters, and it is one of the strongest aspects of The Hobbit.Tolkien's method of storytelling is very similar to the way he employs simple language. Like an inverted funnel, everything starts off simple enough in Bilbo's hobbit hole in The Shire, but it doesn't take long for the characters to find their way into situations that compound upon one another as the story moves along. Without the reader even noticing it, Tolkien takes Bilbo and the dwarves from smoking tobacco in the large region of Eriador to the horrific events at the Battle of Five Armies - that is, from a nothing to an epic. This pacing is best represented towards the book's conclusion when all manners of Goblins and Wargs are closing in on the dwarves, humans, and elves that have taken refuge in the halls of the Misty Mountain. Just as all the energy of the war seems primed to take the book beyond its typical \`micro-epic' feel, Bilbo is knocked unconscious, and wakes only after the battle has been concluded. This type of transition is so smooth that, like the book itself, the scope of the War might not be comprehensible to readers until they have completely finished reading the aftermath.It's a very hard task to find fault in one of the greatest works of fantasy fiction ever written. In fact, the only way to find shortcomings of any kind is by comparing it to the few books in the genre that may have had better reception from the public - including The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter just to name a couple. In this way, once again, it's guilt by association for Tolkien's The Hobbit. The three volume Rings series is the quintessential fantasy epic - well-written characters from all different backgrounds and races traverse alien lands and face unimaginable foes so that they can save the world and their way of life. While some of those elements are present in The Hobbit, they certainly aren't to the same extent that they are explored in Rings. For example, the reader doesn't find out that any piece of land in Middle Earth is in peril until all but the end of Hobbit, whereas Rings is totally devoted to saving the world by destroying the One Ring. Up until the war in The Hobbit, Bilbo, Thorin and his dwarves want nothing more than to find and reclaim a long lost material wealth.In the end, a reader should never have to choose between any of Tolkien's works - they are all special, all brilliant, and, especially in the case of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, they all complement each other. And while The Hobbit may not have the truly epic feel of Rings, it does achieve a level personal interaction with the reader that the sprawling, conquering epic cannot match."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok; for those kids who need an introduction to the Lord of the Rings, enjoy reading, hate reading, love fantasy, or simply like to have stories read to them, this is the book. It is superbly voiced by Rob Inglis, who seems to make each character distinctly stand out in your head by mere intonation. He makes the reading fun. And it's great for long car trips, because there are quite a few tapes. My kids listen to it while they are doing their chores- it keeps them from getting distracted. Now be warned: there are a few scary elements, such as wolves, nasty goblins, a slimy cannibal cave creature called Gollum, a dragon, and a large war at the end which is not described too much, but in which many people including a few main characters die. Thus, it is lot for the little kiddies as much as the 9-11 age or older.But don't get me wrong; this book is a lot of fun for older folks, too. It is a great treatment of the hobbit for fans of Tolkien of all ages, but it isn't at all a bore for those who know nothing about the books. If you're thinking about getting the trilogy, this is a nice introduction (it differs a bit in tone and style, but it's the same world).

I highly recommendthis book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is more about the Collector's Edition packaging rather than the work itself, which has been reviewed a great number of times already and, for the most part, hailed to be a fine work to read for anyone who likes adventures, dragons, wizards and other strange and wonderous things.The Collector's Edition is boxed in green leather-like material, with a title nicely displayed on the front, while gold and red runes and English text stamp out the title on the boxes' spine.The book itself is also bound in the same green leather-ette, and the gold and red stamp are present here as well. Please note that the material is not leather, rather a good imitation of it.The paper is thick, with the text being printed in black with green accents. The text itself is large, easy to read and goes on for 320 pages. I did not notice any imperfection, missing paragraphs or pages or chapters.There are five full color illustrations by J.R.R. himself and a good number of two colored drawings. You will also find Thror's Map as drawn by the author.Overall, this packaging is sturdy and sure to last for generations and many re-readings. Despite the rather high cost, it is a worthy investment and it looks well and impressive on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Written By: J.R.R. TolkienIt is a Faiytale Adventure.It is a story of Bilbo baggins, who is a hobbit. One day he finds himself in an adventure with dwarf. After his adventure he realizes he barely excapes with his life and adventures are funner than he thought.In a way this is very much like, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, because Buck and Bilbo were both taken from there home and force to go were they did not want to go; but Bilbo made it back to his home and Buck didn't.If you don't like reading try reading this.I very much like the style that Tolkien wrote this book in, because it keeps you wanting to see what is going to happen to Bilbo. On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style. To you students read this over the weekend because you may not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My six and nine year old kids were fascinated as I read this illustrated (and abridged) version of the Hobbit. The younger boy is not interested in books without pictures yet, but thoroughly enjoyed hearing the story with the beautiful drawings. The pictures provided a focus and context which were very helpful.This should be a good introduction before the Fellowship of the Ring movie this fall (2001), and I'm looking forward to the illustrated version of the Lord of the Rings in the near future, I hope."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have never read this series of books before. &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; seems to be a typical boys schoolbook. I remember my brother had it as some required reading in secondary school.My recent interest in the story emanated from the conversation I had with a couple of male friends, since the movie is coming out at the end of the year. I asked them what the main plot to the story was - their descriptions peaking my interest. They proceeded to tell me that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was the first book so I was quite excited about getting a copy to read. At the bookstore, I was pleased to find this illustrative edition, which has some fantastic pictures. When I showed it to my friend he was very envious and wanted to borrow my copy...even though he just recently finished reading the story again. Suffice it to say that this further increased my interest in the book and story. The graphics really aid in imaginating how the characters look when reading the story for the first time. I have already bought the matching illustrative version for the combined &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books.I haven't yet finished &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but I am sure that I won't be disappointed and if anything, both books will look great on the bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The characters in Tolkien's story are lively and likeable as well as realistic in regards to personality and traits. The story telling is fantastic and detailed. Tolkien talks through third person, but uses the character Bilbo Baggins as a conveyor for the story line. The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is a story I would recommend to anyone, whether fantasy fiction is their gig or not.Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. He belongs to a quiet folk who enjoy a good meal to eat and a pipe to smoke. As Bilbo is doing just this one morning, an old acquaintance who happens to be a wizard named Gandalf comes calling. Gandalf brings with him a band of dwarves who seem to have no where else to stay, and Bilbo can only be hospitable. The dwarves, led by an &quot;enormously important dwarf&quot; named Thorin Oakenshield, impose upon Bilbo, invading his home and eating his food, but in turn offering jovial company, great stories and song singing. Soon, however, the dwarves reveal their purpose for their unexpected visit. They wish for Bilbo to accompany them on their treasure hunt . . .I charish this novel for several reasons. One reason I enjoy this story so much is because there is no beating around the bush; everything is &quot;one-two-three go&quot;. There is no long introduction in the story's beginning that will take sense away from the story if you do not read it, like in many fantasy novels. I also enjoy the way Tolkien writes verse and poetry and riddles into his story. When the dwarves come to Bilbo's home, they sing songs about treasure. While on the road, elves are overheard singing as they travel through the forest, as well as goblins. Later, when Bilbo encounters the infamous Gollum, they exchange several riddles. Tolkien is a talented poet as well as a story teller. Most of all, however, I enjoy the quaint humor and almost over-abundant common sense of Mr. Baggins. He is a delightful character to read, and he makes Tolkien's novel a gem to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read The Hobbit, and I think that it was an exellent book. Reading the Hobbit was like going on an adventure with Bilbo Baggins and the rest off the characters and creatures in the book. The Hobbit is very intertaning it takes you on an dangerous adventure throw a make belive world there are many things that Bilbo faces some are good and some are evil. The Hobbit is about an adventure that Bilbo and the elves take looking for a treasure that is gaurded by a dragon. I think that everyone should read the Hobbit young or old, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a true classic book despite what people say. Anyone who could possibly hate this book even a tiny bit doesn't know how to enjoy classic and well written literature. I'm 13 and have read books by most of the classic authors including hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;; George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;; Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;;Kafka's &quot;Amerika&quot;; and Homer's &quot;Illiad&quot; and &quot;odessy&quot;. These classic books are the greatest of our time, but J.R.R Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy&quot; are defidently better than all of these. If a person could give anything worse than a 4 star they are ignorant, fools that don't know the difference between &quot;The Cat In The Hat&quot; and the great writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a 4 star rating is worse than what this book deserves. If I could, I would give this book 6 stars.

It was amazing&#8230;I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s a choice for the tween population mostly because at times it seemed a little childish for an adult, but at others I wouldn&#8217;t allow my six year old cousin to read it. If you are going to read this with your child you should know there are pitch-black scenes with goblins and trolls in scary caves, the dwarves and Bilbo get captured a couple times which included being whipped once, strung upside-down and almost cooked at one point, and even Gollum has a conversation with himself and decides whether or not he should eat Bilbo! Along with that there is a war that happens which can get gory at times, and a fight with some huge spiders and evil wolves.The ring in this book has such wild powers and to see a hobbit, a simple and small creature, show as much courage and bravery, along with all the action-packed scenes, fascinating imagery, magic and a bit of underlying comedy makes this a classic that anyone will enjoy.

However, it is a prequel. (Minor spoiler follows, I hope minor, anyway!) Set back when Bilbo was a young adult (in Hobbit lifetimes, that is!), it tells the story of how Bilbo traveled with a group of Dwarves (Tolkien spelling) -- and occasionally a grey wizard named Gandalf -- across the wilderness, mountains, and forests of Middle Earth to reclaim the Dwarves home Erebor, located in a mountain called the Lonely Mountain.During the trip, they have a variety of adventures. The story does not end with the reclamation of Erebor, but I will avoid mentioning anything after to try not to spoil it too much!It is an epic tale written with younger readers in mind than The Lord of the Rings, but still full of the adventure and the true neither-completely-good-nor-completely-evil good vs. evil battles Tolkien is so great at writing. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a Young Adult (YA) Fantasy. It is a fun fantasy adventure story which can be enjoyed by younger adults and older adults equally. Current Amazon Product Page recommendation is for \\"ages 12 and up\\" and \\"grades 7 *and up*\\" and this seems appropriate. Please do not be intimidated by the aura of JRR Tolkien and the stature of his 2 main works (The Hobbit andThe Lord of the Rings: One Volume). The Hobbit has not stood the test of time due to praise from critics or from analysis by scholars. It has stood the test of time because it is loved by fantasy readers of all ages. Please do not let the upcoming movie delay your enjoyment of the book. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job creating cinematic versions of the Lord of the Rings and I fully expect him to do so with the Hobbit as well; However, I strongly recommend to READ THE HOBBIT NOW which will allow for greater enjoyment and understanding of the movie later.The Hobbit has long been a favorite story of mine; an old friend who might not always be at hand but is never forgotten. Fortunately, it is now available as an e-book so it is easier to keep track of. This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is living a comfortable and predictable life in the Shire until Gandalf, a wizard, decides that Bilbo is needed to assist 13 dwarves on their quest. Bilbo will join the quest as a burglar based solely on Gandalf's recommendation and no prior experience. Bilbo is dumbfounded to find that he is expected to travel through goblin and troll infested lands to confront a dragon that has stolen the dwarves' rightful treasure. It is great fun to follow Bilbo's transformation from a homebody to a dauntless adventurer while never losing track of his roots. The enhanced version contains additional drawings which are interesting but probably mainly of interest to longtime fans. The enhanced version also contains some audio content (Tolkien reading passages or reciting poetry or songs) which I could not access through my Kindle (only compatible with Ipad and Iphone).This is a must read story for those who are fans of the YA Fantasy Genre. The Hobbit (Enhanced Edition) is 4,956 Kindle locations long excluding sample of The Lord of The Rings. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer novels, such as those in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.Update December 2012: I was not able to access the bonus audio content with my Kindle Fire HD. This content is only compatible with IPad and IPhone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and it's sequel The Lord of the Rings are widely excepted as not only being some of the best novels written in the 20th century, but the best Fantasy novels ever written. Many people have exhaustively reviewed and analyzed these stories, as well as the differences that resulted from the printing of each edition of these books over the years. I am going to do neither. Not only am I not knowledgeable enough, I'm not interesting in becoming knowledgeable enough to do so.This review is for people like me - people who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings films and are looking forward to the new Hobbit films and are perhaps interested in reading the books, as they have never done so previously. So is the book as great as people say it is? Well, yes. However, personally I didn't think it was perfect. Make no doubts about it, this book was written for a young audience. By no means does that mean adults won't enjoy it, but it's something to note. I tried reading The Hobbit as a child and gave up on it quickly. Tolkien narrates the book as if he is sitting at a campfire telling you a story. The narrator converses with the reader outside of the story - a style I've never really been fond of.Additionally, certain elements of the story can be odd at times. In a book with characters named Bilbo and Gandalf, the Trolls who try to eat the main characters at the beginning of the book are named Bert, Tom, and Bill. Also, there are a lot of talking birds here - which I find a bit ridiculous even for a fantasy book. Tolkien trys to justify why the main character Bilbo, a non adventureous type, would go on a adventure and it never seems believable. That aside, the story is amazingly entertaining. There is a ton of content here. From encounters with Trolls and Goblins, magic rings and Elves, Dragons and stolen treasure, to a battle of Five Armies (which is actually Six Armies if you count the talking birds). I can see why the filmmakers have decided to split this book into two Hobbit movies.Anyone who is considering reading The Hobbit - you should. It's a classic and everyone should see for theirselves what they think of it. Personally, I am always disappointed when a Kindle version of a book is more expensive than a physical copy. This Kindle copy was $10.99 at the time of purchase. You can order paperback copies of the book for a few dollars less. However, there are many different editions of this book, each with slight differences and this Kindle version is the 50th anniversary - supposedly the most up to date. I can't say for sure, but for a novel as amazing as this, I feel as if I definitely got my money's worth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I realize that are a thousand reviews for this book already, but since The Hobbit is one of my all-time favorite novels, I simply have to throw in my two cents worth. This is a great prelude to The Lord of the Rings, for many reasons. First of all, it's compact and fast paced, somewhat unlike LOTR, but it gives a fine glimpse of the magic of Tolkien's world. To me, this is really the first book of LOTR and an essential part of the series. If you've read LOTR but not The Hobbit, then you simply have not read the complete LOTR. Simple as that.This is a delightful book of high fantasy, aimed at young adults but still plenty satisfying to grownups. The characters are solid and interesting, and the setting is pure magic. The book draws you in from the opening lines and keeps you immersed in Tolkien's fantasy world until the very satisfying conclusion. Yes, it's a book featuring dwarves, elves, a staff carrying wizard, some common fantasy monsters, and so on and so forth. But Tolkien was the one who spawned the \\"usual\\" fantasy elements, and so for its time the book was quite original. And regardess, the book is just flat-out entertaining and maintains a unique feel. Even if you've read many modern fantasy books, The Hobbit will stand out from the crowd.Setting: 10 of 10. A magical experience throughout. Characters: 9 of 10. The characters work well for the book, though a few of the dwarves are underdeveloped. Plot: 9 of 10. Simple, yet effective. Just good fantasy fun. Pacing: 10 of 10. If you like fast pacing, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Good quality recording. Only difficulty is that the file names are not correlated to a chapter. Files are based on size, and end at any point within a chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a little concerned about getting this book, since there are a couple of reviews that nitpick about the binding, the black & white illustration, etc, and argue that this edition is inferior. (I have worked in a printing studio, and can be pretty picky about my editions.) But I am happy I went ahead and ordered it, because going back and rereading the Hobbit in this edition has been a great experience. The dust jacket is printed on nice matte paper, and it feels like a new version of one of the old editions. The black and white illustrations are crisp, and are incorporated into the text at the right spots, and the color plates are bright and very clearly printed.I have not looked at the annotated version, and I am sure it is a great book if you are reading the Hobbit with a mind toward understanding the minutia of Tolkien's work. But if you want to read The Hobbit the way it was intended to be read, you can't go wrong with this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story of , \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, grown greatly as time passed. A pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s morphed into the basis of the blockbuster films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, The Hobbit, myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many others already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of The Hobbit ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford. This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something. The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke. This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :)All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

It will endure for generations to come with its handsome gold-stamped, deep green leatherette binding and sturdy slip case that allows the volume to vertically free-stand when outside a bookcase.The crisp, clear print allows your eyes to flow effortlessly over the text with occasional pauses to delight in Tolkien's original illustrations rendered with elegant simplicity.

The Hobbits have perfectly boring and perfectly happy existances in their cozy homes. That was what Bilbo Baggins had, at least, until the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. Now Bilbo (without, of course, having ever been asked for his consent) is going on an adventure to retrieve the dwarves' gold from the dragon Smaug.J.R.R Tolkein's writing is literally beautiful. Every little song and ditty he includes in his books is well-thought-out and fantastic. The plot moves along at a good pace and it is the right combination of peril, adventure and magic, and, in the Hobbit, there's a bit of the whimsical factor too.I advice every fantasy lover to read the Lord of the Rings series if you haven't already, and I especially suggest to read the Hobbit.

Tolkien's The Hobbit may both please and disappoint - the latter, because it is so much lighter, more comedic, less sophisticated, less on the epic scale than LOTR. It is very much a children's book, and one that really should be read aloud in the night to children before bedtime. It is much more lighthearted, and has far fewer truly scary moments. However, it will please those who would like to know more about Hobbits, The Shire, Elves, Dwarves and sundry monstrous creatures that inhabit Middle Earth. The origin of Frodo's orc-detecting sword, Sting, is given; the ancestors (perhaps?) of Shelob are revealed; Bilbo himself, seen only in his great age and not for long in LOTR, is here in the prime of his life and revealing some of the characteristics of practicality and courage that reappear in Frodo. Aside from Ursula K. Le Guin's dragons, which are without parallel, the great Dragon Smaug is among the best I have encountered in fiction, and the description of his loot-filled cave is superb. The lust for gold and jewels experienced by the Dwarves is clearly the precursor of the lethal lust for the One Ring felt by so many in LOTR. Be warned: there is some horror. There is dread and anxiety. The evil creatures of The Hobbit are equally as evil as those in LOTR, but as readers we are less exposed to them, and the mood is soon lightened by the antics of either Bilbo or the Dwarves or both. There is the classic, familiar journey, or Quest; Gandalf fills the role of the wise guide and father-figure (though with less gravitas); there are terrible set-backs, unexpected hurdles, ghastly encounters and a fabulous battle scene, prefiguring the great battles of LOTR. Basically, The Hobbit is LOTR writ small, funnier, lighter and a lot shorter, but no less satisfying as a story for all that."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this book from another seller after Readinggirl never sent my book.

The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is just a normal, modern day hobbit that lives in a normal, modern day town (modern for the &quot;old days&quot;). He just wants to live in peace in his \\"hobbit hole\\" and to drink tea and eat cake all day. He enjoys visitors and certainly isn't looking for an adventure. But what he gets are unexpected guests who are strangers and an adventure he'll never forget. Over the edge of the wild, through the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood forest, and to Lonely Mountain where the dreaded Smaug the dragon lies, guarding the not forgotten cache of treasure once belonging to the legendary dwarfs under the mountain whom once existed. Bilbo's job is to assist the descendents of the legendary dwarfs (yes, they are dwarfs too) in taking back their precious treasure. On this epic journey, they battle trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, and encounter many more mysterious creatures and obstacles. I thought that this book was great, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a fantasy like quality to it.

Especially at getting the treasure and defending themselves and eachother when they were in dangerous situations. I think this is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is amazing how good someone can describe some things. Such as J.R.R. Tolkien does in this book. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes fictional stories, Dragons, elves,and all of that good stuff. This is an all around good book that you can't put down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A truly wonderful book, and THE cornerstone for fantasy. A must read for true fantasy fans so they will understand Tolkienian references with other writers.Kids will love because it is an easy read. Parents will love it for it is truly a good clean story. Adults will enjoy it for the historical value and amusing style.The only thing I would criticize is the simplicity of the story. Too many details are left out for my taste (of course that is part of the magic, it requires you to use YOUR imagination to flesh out the story!), but I think that is mostly due to the looooooooong storylines I have read in the last 3 years.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was written by a linguistic professor in the armed services in WWI in a series of letters to his son, Christopher Tolkien. Before this book was published, fantasy did not exist in the realm of fiction. The depth of the world created and the play with language make it easy to forget this book was written for a child. This book is in many ways the Sgt Peppers of Rock and Roll, the Beethoven's Fifth of symphonies, the Romeo and Juliet of love stories. Each time I read it, I discover something new about writing and about myself. Do yourself a favor and get to know this particular Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this great play of literature so many times it is hard to tell where to begin, I only can say that it was the perfic classic. Well developed mythical characters, many of them based upon figures throughout mythology. This book should be read aloud to every child or read by the child. The sooner one reads it the quicker they may become enlighted with its imagination."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Having just re-read these back to back, The Hobbitt is a much simpler read compared to the trilogy. Having been written for children, that very much comes across in the writing style. However, it serves as a good introduction to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and affords you a look into hobbitts prior to delving deeper into the epic saga. Overall, a bit disappointing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was quite a good book a good adventurous book but... It wasn't what I expected of a prequel it had very little to do with the actual Lord of the Rings series except for a couple of chapters which jokingly showed similarities.It also had another feature where it had it being told in a bed time story type of manner almost Roald Dahlish. I did like this...but it sepirated it more and more from the original trilogy and made it quite kiddyish. All in all this is quite good as it's own book. but does not fit as a LOTR prequel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I very rarely use the adjective &quot;cute&quot; to describe a fantasy book but this was! J.R.R. Tolkein made me fall in love with his little hobbitt and even though the story telling style was different from the modern fantasy I've read, I became used to it and found myself enjoying it.The action and in this novel never ceased to amaze me. Some authors pack in too much, making the story seem like a disorganized whirlwind while other authors remain painfully stagnant throughout the book. Tolkein proves his talent with well paced action along with very good character development.Although &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; is written in a different vein from most books written today, it was refreshing and I found myself adapting to it with pleasure. On to the Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An excellent book. I recomend it to anyone and everyone. The Hobbit is the prelude to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Ring.

The Hobbit I just reread for at least the third time, and it is well-written. By the time one comes to The Return of The King, his prose is stilted, seeming to mimic Malory's Morte d'Arthur and deserve the same kind of criticism Mark Twain wrote regarding Fenimore Cooper. Also, if anyone notices these things, in The Fellowship Sauron seems unaware of the existence of the ring, and doesn't know whether Gollum or Bilbo have it, and can't find the Shire. By the time the Return of The King was written, Sauron's existence depended on the Ring and he vanished when it was destroyed. I am not quoting but Gandalf does not seem to think the Ring is essential at first to Sauron's power but would prove disastrous in his possession, while later to destroy it is to destroy Sauron. Also he seems to know where Frodo is at the last when Frodo dons it. This may seem subtle to some, but you can't actually have it both ways. It seems as though Tolkien changed his own ideas about the nature and power of the ring, but never went back and revised his text.Him they sent thither. Sore hard were their travails. And thus he spake... this Malory pastiche belongs in the 16th century, or in Dante Gabriel Rosseti, but not in the 20th. I am surprised so many are sucked in by it. Still, \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\" finds Tolkien back in his best story-telling mode and sections like this make for great reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i think Bilbo was a nice character in this story.

I suggest you read this story prior to seeing the movie (coming this Christmas). If you have read or seen the Lord Of The Rings this is the beginning of that story.

I remember being captivated by the excellent imagery and wonderful storytelling. It was so great that I had nightmares about the giant spiders of Murkwood for weeks!So I was delighted to come across the BBC version of this. It is so much more than a guy with a British accent reading Tolkien's words - it is more like a stageplay for your ears! I meant to ration myself to one side of a tape per day, but after listening to the first I gave in and listened to the rest nonstop."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The interesting thing about The Hobbit is how close it came to never seeing the light of day. J.R.R. Tolkien's classic children's fantasy book only exists because he was bored while grading his students' papers and accidentally created the mythical creatures known as Hobbits.But I think The Hobbit in particular came into being because Tolkien loved the old fairy tales and myths and couldn't find any contemporary books like the old ones he enjoyed reading. The Hobbit is such a fun book to read that it's almost sinful to admit it. Treasure-hoarding dragons, greedy song-singing dwarves, a jestful old wizard, and the trickssy Gollum all add up to creating a wonderful classic.The Hobbit is a throw back to a much older tradition of fantasy stories than what we're used to nowadays. I recommend this book in particular to everyone familiar with The Lord of the Rings, since it will help to fill in the gaps on what happened before the events in that story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review does not contain spoilers.If you love the Hobbit, which most do for its enchanting story, and you have the extra few dollars to spend, buy this edition. Not only does this beautiful leather (well, \\"leatherette\\" looks like leather), hardcover edition contain fair size, easy to read text and beautiful illustrations and maps, it also adds to the look for any bookshelf (the side of the book has the rune translation of \\"The Hobbit By J.R.R. Tolkien\\". It also comes with a leatherette case with a beautiful illustration. The are absolutely no cons for this product unless you want the book to read the story to you! :P*Additionally, if you are trying to decide whether to get this edition or the regular Collector's Edition (the red one), buy this one! It is better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For years, I have somehow avoided reading The Hobbit even though I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and seen all the movies, and loved everything about them. For some reason, I just wasn't that interested in the story of how Bilbo retrieved the ring.As it happens, I was \\"forced\\" to read The Hobbit for my college English course at Ohio State this quarter. So not only did I finallly get to read this book, I also got to discuss it in great detail with a bunch of other people. Discussing a book with other people is a great way to have a greater appreciation for the author and the book itself. With The Hobbit, much was discussed about Tolkien's creation of races, and how they fit with a certain social structure of Middle-Earth. Very interesting stuff.I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Hobbit is an amazing piece of literature. But everyone knows that. I think that the LOTR trilogy are better books. Personally, I prefer the darker take in the trilogy than the more lighthearted, jovial tale that is The Hobbit. Bilbo is a great protagonist, as the reader, you grow to love him, and truly want him to escape danger, as you do for all the other characters that went on the journey with Bilbo, to retrieve the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug.Tolkien is a great writer, and the way he plays with being the narrator of the tale is amazing, and makes the story that much more fun to read. Plus, The Hobbit is a book that could easily be read and understood by fairly young kids. And it's a great way to start someone who has never read fantasy novels before.Thank you, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a review about this edition not about the writing, as doubtless if you are considering this particularl edition you have either read the Hobbit or pretty much know the story.This is a beautiful book. It seems like it is the Prof's very own edition because his own drawings are inside. There are at least 5 beautiful full-color watercolors and many more green block type prints.The cover is a delight. I just received a used copy that has a copyright of 1966 but I think it must be a 1973 copy. In any event the cover is vibrant and goregous as if it was printed yesterday. The type is big and clear. Highly recommended as a beauitful keepsake that is the perfect size for repeated readings. It is also sturdy. Great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit written by JRR Tolkien is an adventure fantasy novel in which contains a profusion of courage, adventure and Imagination. These three qualities unite, and create one of the finest adventure novels of all time. Tolkien keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat begging to turn the page by delivering climax after climax in this famous fantasy novel.Tolkien initially grabs the reader with his in depth descriptive writing. His words describe the adventures of Bilbo Baggins so vividly that the reader becomes overwhelmed and begins to believe that he/she is indeed the protagonist. Although Tolkien intended The Hobbit to be a children's novel, the writing is still relevant for all ages. The Hobbit can take any average overscheduled adult away from his/her everyday stresses and return them back to their untainted childhood imaginations. This getaway is created on behalf of Tolkien's fantastically vivid descriptions of landscapes, feelings and characters. Even though the story is completely unbelievable, Tolkien describes everything in such incredible detail that the reader starts to believe that Hobbiton is a real place and being Bilbo Baggins is not fictional anymore.The Hobbit is also a great read because of the never-ending climaxes throughout the book. Tolkien grabs the reader and keeps them captive for an entire novel. It becomes hard to put down the book because you are dawning on another expedition right after you just finished one. One could argue that Tolkien attempted to create a tie between the reader and the protagonist. Tolkien creates this tie through the comparison of Bilbo's sleeping patterns and that of the readers' patterns. Whenever Bilbo has had a long stretch without sleep the reader has not put down the book, however when Bilbo goes to sleep it is in a recession in the story's peaks. For example after Bilbo had left home he had slept very little until he went to Beorns house. This patterning style gives the reader an opportunity to take a rest. This use of literacy makes The Hobbit a very entertaining read.In this novel we meet many different characters, enemy or friend. All of which seemed to be relevant except for the thirteen dwarves Bilbo travelled with. It would seem as though Tolkien added these characters just to aggravate the reader. During the novel these thirteen dwarves who were supposed to be running the show did nothing accept slow the process down by either passing out, getting lost or being captured; with the exception of Elrond, who is able to translate the moon-runes, and Bard, who is able to understand the language of the bird, Roac. Therefore leaving only two practical dwarves. Throughout the novel the reader continuously ask himself or herself \`why doesn't Bilbo just leave these idiots and do it himself?' This question remains unanswered at the end of the novel, in turn leaving the reader irritated. This is indeed a small blunder created by the author, however if he did indeed make these dwarves relevant it would have enhanced the story.All things considered, The Hobbit is a fantastic adventure novel for all ages. It constantly brings the reader out of the frying pan and into the fire. It is truly unbelievable how imaginative Tolkien was. His literary intelligence gives every reader of The Hobbit a reminiscent taste of what it was like as a child with a wild imagination. The novel truly tickles the minds imagination, leaving us believing that everyone should have a little Bilbo Baggins in them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"HobbitThe book was a repeat of what was on TV in the beginning; it ended up just being an okay book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didn't much care for the dialogue, it was off putting and a distraction.

That is a great many years too many. My memory of this book was one of boredom, dryness, and an overall lacking. It is quite apparent that either my memory is lacking or I read this book much to young to appreciate it fully.This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I particularly appreciate and identify with a hero who is not macho. He is not strong. He is not selfless and morally superior. He is made of real things, and is enjoyable with his flaws. You root for him when he comes through in a pinch; he has an ability to come up with clever ideas under pressure. But he, good old Bilbo Baggins, would rather prefer being at home taking tea and eating cakes.There is great wealth here - in imagery, action, character, conflict, and, yes, humor. This classic fantasy is so entirely engaging that you are constantly eager for what happens next. How on earth can they escape the goblins? Surely the party will all die at the legs of giant spiders!Often you hear of books that are \\"must reads\\", and there are so many of those that you just brush off as fluff an nonsense. This is one to not be brushed off, as it is timeless in its appeal to all audiences (well, above a certain age, since I in my single-digit youth didn't fall under its spell, naturally).

I recalled the basic plot elements and the overall premise of the story. And, because I'm breathing, I know that it's the prequel to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. And, since it's considered a classic, my expectations were high.I'm wondering, however, why I feel so underwhelmed by this novel. It contains all the elements of a classic, mythic heroic quest. It's not unnecessarily lengthy or bloated (a mere 255 pages in the edition that I read), and the episodic narrative moves along at a smart pace. Tolkien has indeed created one of the great fantasy worlds in all of literature--Middle Earth.Perhaps it's the skimpy character development that bugs me. Bilbo and Gandalf and Thorin are quite memorable (especially Gandalf, who figures prominently in the ensuing LOTR novels), but Tolkien provides minimal characterization. Each is rather two-dimensional, and, as a reader, I found it quite difficult to empathize with any of them. I also found Tolkien's narrative voice to be decidedly uneven--at times the narrator sounded charming and colloquial only to veer into bombast and melodrama, and the narrative tone fluctuated from self-deprecating to self-important. And a few of the major events in the story lack detail. For example, we are told rather little about the climactic Battle of Five Armies, and, of Bilbo's return home, the narrator simply states, \\"He had many hardships and adventures before he got back\\"--yet he describes none of them. Perhaps I'm quibbling--and I know many of the Tolkien faithful will accuse me of sacrilege--but I expect more substance and narrative depth from a classic of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book and loved the movie.

I needed something fun and spunky for a rough time to keep myself distracted, and had plans to see the movie, so this was too perfect!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are into wizards, goblins, trolls, dwarves, dragons, hobbits and adventure, then The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien may be just the type of book you are looking for. In better detail, if you didn't know, a hobbit is a little person. They are about half our size and have furry feet. They live in small hobbit holes and like to be left alone by people not of their own kind. The Hobbit is the exciting prelude to the award-winning triolgy The Lord of the Rings. The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's journey is quite different than that of a normal hobbit. He sets off on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a great wizard named Gandalf. They would travel all across the land, which was called Middle Earth, and fight trolls, dragons, and something called Gollum. The purpose of the journey is to regain the dwarves' stolen treasure. In some parts of this otherwise flawless book, Tolkien over desribes things. When there is no excitment in the story at a certain time, I found myself wanting to move on and skip pages. I do not think you should look this book over and not read it because it looks like something a geek would read. This however is not the case, because The Hobbit should be looked upon as a great work of art, not something that is simply tossed aside. The book will keep you wanting to read more the further you get into it. As you continue to find out about Bilbo's exciting adventure, you will find that you have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first book to delve into the world popularized in The Lord of the Rings, in which the reader's focus is on hobbits, a race comprised of homebodies with large furry feet and a decided lack of ambition.Bilbo Baggins is one of the least adventurous of hobbits, and is less than pleased when Gandalf the Wizard appears and twists his arm into embarking on a quest with a gaggle of rambunctious dwarves. But embark he reluctantly does, and what follows is an adventure that is far more charming, if less epic, than the pomp-laden Rings trilogy.Tolkien presents his own twist on existing mythologies and fairy tales, giving us a game of riddling and presenting, for the first time, in-depth cultures that defined orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves and humans under a unifying concept that has lasted for well over a half-century (and counting).Okay, okay, so this book is important in the annals of fantasy. But is it a good read?Yes.Tolkien has taken all of this in-depth detail and hung it on a time-honored plot that will never get old. Bilbo is the unlikely, reluctant adventurer who finds within himself the capacity to be a hero, overcoming various obstacles to a climax involving a firebreathing dragon (the evil Smaug). Stories don't get any more exciting than this, and the details that are Tolkien's trademark add a layer of depth and texture that help to bring this world to life.If you are considering reading the Lord of the Rings because the movies made such a big splash, or have already started that trilogy but been turned off by the weightiness, I urge you to start with the Hobbit. It is clean, easy reading that really inspired everything that came after it. The trilogy is everything that a Tolkien fan could want, but The Hobbit is what makes Tolkien fans happen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitI read the Hobbit bt J.R.R. Tolkien. It only took a couple of days for me because it was definately a oage turner. If you like stories of good versus evil and stories of adventure than this is a book for you. The Hobbit is probably my favorite book of all time. If you read the Lord of the Rings trilogy than you should the hobbit. The trilogy takes place after The Hobbit, and if you read The Hobbit it puts things together that you didn't realize in the trilogy. So i definately recomend this book to everyone because it's a fun read.John"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The is a wonderful bookand I suggest everyone to read it.

The story takes place in Bag-End in the hobbits hole on the hill. Long ago in a mystical time of goblins and dragons.Some of the most impoutant ebents in the story were when the dwarves and the wizard came in to Bilbo's house and asked him to go on a adventure with them. also when the characters were going through the Misty Mountains they goy into some trouble with goblins, that is also when Bilbo got the ring from Gollum that saved his life so many times afterwards. Then they go to Beorn's cabin in the woods and stay there for a while he gives them supplies and they go on. They make it to the edge of Mirkwoodwere the wizard leaves them there to go on there own. They have troubles with spiders and elves while going through Mirkwood. Then they fimally get to Smaug and can't figure out how to kill him and get their treasure. The conflict in the story is that during their whole entire journey they run into goblins and things that are bak and evil. The theme of the story is that even if you are small you can make a big difference.In the book Bilbo is a small little Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So begins one of the greatest books of this century. The amazing journey of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire who sets out on a quest to the Lonely Mountain. Tolkien spent years perfecting his world of Middle Earth creating characters, languages, and stories that revolutionized not only the Fantasy genre, but literature as we know it. Beautifully written, and absolutely imaginative, readers will be enthralled as they read of dragons and wizards, treasure and riddles. Peter Jackson brought the trilogy to life, but if you want the complete tale from the beginning you will find no children's book better than 'The Hobbit.' A must for every home library!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I approached The Hobbit at the age of 25. Never having read anything by Tolkien and being recently uninspired by the overrated trilogy, I decided to read for myself--what's the big deal here?The Hobbit is not a comfort book for me. Since I didn't read it as a child, I don't have fond memories to draw me back. I can, however, somewhat empathize with those who do read and re-read this charming tale.The Hobbit takes the reader on a trip over wide landscapes, mostly from the perspective of a gentle nobody, Bilbo Baggins. Tolkien works hard to reveal characters as different types of people. Hobbits, Dwarves, Wizards, Dragons, Trolls, Goblins, Eagles, Wolves, Elves, Spiders, and Humans all represent some type of human condition. The young reader of The Hobbit will not realize that he or she is quite possibly being exposed to every type of person he or she will ever meet. Let us thank Tolkien.Tolkien gives the same breadth to the landscapes of adjacent but strange lands and the inhabitants therein. The land fits into Tolkien's environmentalist sensibility very pointedly. That is, this isn't a purely fantastical story--neither is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--and that's what makes Tolkien's work so wonderful. Like C.S. Lewis--they were friends, in fact--Tolkien is able to pour morality, politics, philosophy, and spirituality into his works without mocking or tricking the reader.If you have not read The Hobbit, please do. You'll enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Garrett HansonMr. Fiske'sHonors EnglishThe Hobbit ReviewThe Hobbit was J.R.R. Tolkien's first claim to fame, but it is better known as the precursor to the famed Lord of the Rings series. It is a story of struggles, adventures, and unlikely heroes in a land called \\"Middle Earth\\".Hobbits do not like adventures, as the famed Bilbo Baggins once said of adventures, \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\" With the help of the far more important, but less noted wizard Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) does in fact set out upon an adventure with thirteen Dwarves to return to Lonely Mountain and regain their treasure, in so defeating the cruel dragon, Smaug.They out wit orcs and goblins, battle spiders and evade elves, Bilbo finds the Ring, yes the Ring, and out riddles the morose Gollum to keep it. They achieve many things, making many friends and even more enemies before reaching old Smaug and the Lonely Mountain, and still they know not what to do about it's treachery.The Hobbit was definitely not a stroke of genius, but a work of genius after years and years of writing lore on goblins, elves, dragons, dwarves, and such, such is all the great things you may have or may yet come to love in Tolkien's writing. The Hobbit however, is a first in Tolkiens lore, and The Hobbit was the first taste of Tolkien much of the world got. Although over shadowed my the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is important in understanding Middle Earth, and it does it in a fun way. It is something you could teach you kids to read with, while still enjoying it yourself.The Hobbit was originally intended to be a before bedtime kids book, and it sends a very potent message to it's intended victim...it doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, or how big you are, even the smallest can change the world. To more extent, hopefully we are, in the end, better off, but that is a matter of opinion, for greed is the bleeder of wealth, and happiness can be found in small things, even after big adventures. I did find Tolkien's style rather youthful and informative allowing me to see far in advance the come of events...nonetheless he did an excellent job in portraying the turn of events that was and is The Hobbit. His imagery and imagination are unrivalled, yes, even to those of us who saw the movie first. For those of you who don't like Old English, don't worry, it's hardly used in The Hobbit. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord of the Rings, or simple wants a good book to read to the young ones before the lights are turned out. Further more I expect you'll get hooked on Middle Earth, so I suggest finding a copy of the Lord of the Rings, because lets face it, for those of us with an imagination, the books are way better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit.J.R.R.Tolkien.United States- New York.Ballantine Books.1937, 1938, and 1966.287 pages.My attention was grabbed, my mind was stretched, and my thoughts were taken to amazing enchanting places. Reading \\"The Hobbit\\" was not only and intriguing experience, but kept me wanting more and more. When a timid, respectable creature called a hobbit is talked into going on a wild, dangerous quest by a wizard by the name of Gandalf, Bilbo's cozy, quiet lifestyle is drastically changed. J.R.R. Tolkien is an incredible story teller, and his studies of ancient languages and his life in Britain influenced and enhanced the ideas and characters in the book. The fictional land of Middle-Earth in which the story takes place is magical and sometimes evil. Bilbo Baggins leaves the comfortable, beautiful shire to embark on a journey in the midst of danger and evil, and along the way he is transformed into a hero.By the author showing Bilbo's development into a hero, he proves that ordinary people can overcome obstacles and also develop into heroes. Bilbo started off as a weakling. He was surrounded by luxury and a wide array of foods, but after he got over the shocking news, he accepted Gandalf's request for him to be the \\"burglar\\" of the quest, and from then on he got increasingly courageous. By the end of the journey, he had accomplished so much. He had confronted the trolls, escaped from Gollum and stolen his ring, slaying a giant spider, rescuing the dwarves from Mirkwood, and even coming face to face with a treacherous, gold-stealing dragon named Smaug. All of these things molded him into a hero, not to mention helping the dwarves regain their stolen wealth, and making the area surrounding Lonely Mountain safe again.When the author wrote this book, he was looking past its enchanting tale to the trilogy to come known as \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This book is the solid foundation of which all of those books follow. This book really emphasizes the character development of the main character, Bilbo. It is interesting the way the author created the creatures of middle earth in that all hobbits are good, but all goblins are evil, and the personality of someone differed according to their family. Bilbo Baggins is heir to the Tooks, who are more adventurous, and the Baggins's, who are very respectable and would never take part in such radical happenings. Throughout the story he sometimes switches back and forth between each family's point of view, but for him to reach his full potential he must be like the Tooks so he can be courageous and unafraid to partake in the great quest for the dwarves stolen gold. In the book I also noticed that there is a constant struggle between good and evil. The magic ring that Bilbo acquires from a hideous creature named Gollum in the darkness of a deep tunneling cave, affects him in a powerful way. The ring he found allows him to disappear instantly when he puts it on his finger. Although he thinks this is very useful, the ring is evil and Bilbo becomes addicted to it and always keeps it with him.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a good, original read, but it obviously lacks realism because of it's out of this world setting and characters. That's not so bad though because it is fun reading about something that is completely made up, so you can leave your present state of mind and just relax and enjoy the book. J.R.R. Tolkien had a very smart way of writing which is shown in the elaborate details he put into each creature and the way he made everything come together in a complete way at the end but at the same time made you want to read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. I did not detect any flaws in the plot, but then again I wasn't really looking for them because I was so caught up in the story. I have never read a book that has a similar subject as \\"The Hobbit\\" because it is so unique, so it makes it difficult to compare it to other books in that way. Relating to the book can be done only by the underlying tones, not the actual events since it is a fantasy. The forces of good and evil is something that I can relate to because we all know what right and wrong is, and the consequences of each kind of action. I thought the book was well-written and very amusing and fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, is a story about a hobbit named Bilbo, 13 dwarves, and a wizard named Gandalf who go on an adventure to retain gold from a vicious dragon who had stole it from them over a hundred years ago.

The narrator can go a tad slow at points, but it's much faster than a \\"popcorn read,\\" and it saves your voice if you have multiple sections (I have 4 of Freshman English) to read to.Why is this better on audio CD?1. Compatibility Issues: I bought \\"The Hobbit\\" on iTunes after my iPad refused to play certain chapters over my iTunes Match from my computer. I find this rather suspicious considering that my MacBook Pro had no problem playing the burned copy of my CD before.2. Mp4 Recording: It's split into \\"two books\\" meaning that each book is somewhere between five and 6 hours long. No 3-5 minute snippets like the CD's have which make it super easy to start and stop for classroom readings.3. iTunes Player stinks: You cannot easily start and stop from a specific second of the recording. Instead it jumps about a minute and a half at a time. Good luck starting at a specific paragraph if you accidentally bump a key. It won't happen.If you have the audio CD, you can play this from a CD player, or burn it to a computer and choose a variety of digital players to use. iTunes works just fine so long as you're dealing with the 5 minute long clips as opposed to their 5 hour long clips.If you're brave, you can also loan this out to other students or perhaps a new teacher."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can barely believe there are those that think this book too boring &amp; pointless. First off, the book is barely 300 pages long, if that. Secondly, it has a point, and that's to tell a engaging story. I guess some people just don't get it or go in for this kind of thing. Pointless and boring? You haven't seen such till you read certain volumes of Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. For me, this book is like a doorway into another world. A wizard, a hobbit and a group of dwarves go on a quest to oust a dragon from their mountain and run into orcs, wolves and spiders on the way? Jeez, what could be cooler? I found it engrossing every step of the way. The only criticism I would have for the book might be that the latter part of the book takes an abruptly more serious tone than the first half of the book, but that's only fitting since it prepares for the more serious tone of Lord of the Rings. This book is Classic Fantasy. For the number of reviews that wanted to give this book 0 stars, even if they are only a handful, I give this book 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I believe the Hobbit was not a fabulouse book the way most people rave about it.

Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).&quot;Also, it must be said, hobbits do not tend toward adventure! A loving family, a comfortable home, a good meal, a pipe of tobacco, and a pint of beer are generally all that is required to make us happy.HOWEVER, in recent times, hobbits HAVE begun to have adventures and to participate more fully in the deeds of the Wide World.

Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937. The Hobbit is a fantasy that takes place in Middle Earth. Middle Earth is filled with dragons, knights, castles and grand battles. Grassy valleys, dark forests, grey mountains and blue rivers is what Middle Earth looks like.The story starts off in Bilbo Baggins hobbit hole. Bilbo, like any other hobbit never leaves his hobbit hole and eats five meals a day. A hobbit is a furry fellow who is slightly smaller than a dwarf. They don&#8217;t wear shoes because they have leather feet.Hobbits never go on adventures. That is, until one morning when Bilbo&#8217;s house is filled with thirteen dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit is asked by the wizard to join them on their journey. After a debate, Bilbo decides to go help the dwarves recover their gold from the Dragon, Smaug.Bilbo didn&#8217;t know how to take care of himself without being in his hobbit hole. Sometimes they didn&#8217;t eat at all and Bilbo was used to eating five meals a day. During his adventure Bilbo fell into goblin caves, was caught by wood elves, attacked by killer spiders and was in the Great War with the Goblins. (spoiler)The main characters are Bilbo the hobbit, Gandalf the wizard, Thorin the dwarf king and Smaug the dragon. My favorite character was Gandalf because he used magic. He used magic for fun to entertain by making fireworks and also as a weapon of mass destruction to kill his enemies. I liked the use of imagery in the book. The words used to describe the mountains, forests and dungeons made you feel as if you were there. The plot was exciting, action packed and suspenseful.I really enjoyed The Hobbit and would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or books with medieval settings. Will Bilbo and the dwarves kill the Dragon Smaug and recover the lost gold, or will Smaug kill them ? Will good triumph over evil?

Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, is the main character here who, despite his unwillingness to join a mass of dwarves and Gandalf, a wizard,on a quest for treasure, finds himself taking on the many of their battles. Encountering goblins, spiders, and wolves, Bilbo is savior to his dwarf friends. After encountering the groups' nemesis Smaug, he feels he is a better person having left the comforts of his hobbit hole. Ultimately Tolkien writes a fine tale about taking risk and confronting fears to achieve a greater vision of oneself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Let you know first off that I'm not a heavy reader. I could name all the books I've read in my lifetime and that really means I've not read too many, probably about 12 total. However, seeing the trailer to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, I was too convinced to start reading the books. So, I bought the Hobbit (which is the prelude to the Trilogy) and I started reading it. Low and behold, I was amazed and just taken away at just how page-turning this book is. Every moment I got, I read the Hobbit and I enjoyed every moment of it. Tolkien's writing is not terribly old-fashion so it's not too hard to comprehend though it does take some time to get used to his style of writing. Once you do get used to it, your in for a huge adventure filled with odd creatures and even some minor humor. But Gollum's riddles and the Ring's power make this adventure all the more interesting.READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful and exciting book. It was written by J.R.Tolkien. The main characters in this book are: Bilbo Baggins, Gandolf The Grey, and the twelve funny dwarves. These interestig fourteen creatures go on a treasure hunt to retrieve the dwarves gold and kingdom back from an evil dragon.I recomend this book because it's very exciting and unpredictable. Also many fantasy authors have read this book to get a better idea on what to write. This book is the first fantasy epic and is loved by many readers, including myself. This book will take you to many unexpected places and sharp turns. This is a very good book and if you read it, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was tottaly amazed from the time i read the first chapter of this book. J.R.R. Tolkien brings you right into this amazing fantasy world. The book is mainly about a hobbit who lives in a hole. J.R.R. Tolkien puts in some awesome detail about his home. A hobbit is a humanlike creature that lives underground, smaller than a dwarf. The book starts when Gandalf, a mysterious wizard, and a group of dwarves visit the hobbit. They bring the hobbit on a long journey to defeat Smaug, a dragon that sleeps on gold and jewels. this book is action packed right from the thrid or so chapter. One of my favorite parts was when the hobbit fights many giant spiders. Any lover of fantasy books has to have read this. This book will keep you reading all the way through, the ending is awesome by the way, and Gandalf plays almost no part in the book but does in the other books from the series. The Hobbit came dangerously close to being my all time favortite book (almost beating Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone). This book is a must have!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This set of CD's is of the \\"no frills\\" variety, but that does not detract from it being a great story, compellingly told by Rob Inglis.My copy had a defect on disc #7, but Amazon exchanged it promptly and without fuss."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo, who is very lazy. He's lives alone in his house underground. But then one day he met this wizard,and said that there's a dwarf and father has treasure in this castle far far away. That a dragon is guarding and he wants to try and get it back. So the hobbit go's on the adventure to get the treasure back with seven dwarfs and the wizard. But one thing is the Hobbit didn't really want to go because he wants to stay at his home and eat. But they make him come. On there journey they meet different people and fight with different people along the way. So your going to have to read and see what happens at the end of the story. This book is a good book to read when your in the ages of 8,9,10 and 11."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit consists of action and excitement, non-stop.

Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped. Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is a great prequel to the lord of the rings. Read it before or after the lord of the rings, both ways great!It introduces some important characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, AND Gollum. If you find the lord of the rings a bit to much, read this book, because its more just fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can still remember reading this book for the first time like it was yesterday. I was ten years old and it took me an entire summer to read. This was a time when we (my family and I) didn't have a VCR, cable TV or home computer, and I spent a great deal of time reading. Now, I'm definitely not the type of person who curses any of those modern technological wonders (especially since I consider myself a tech-junkie), but it's taken me many years to realize how fortunate I was to discover them later in life.The Hobbit was a milestone in my life, something many avid readers will be able to appreciate. It became the standard by which all other books would be compared for years to come, and made all those Hardy Boys books I'd been reading forever obsolete. It's the first book I can remember reading where I was actually transported to another world, an alien world so full of magic and color that my own seemed drab in comparison. It was also the first time I can remember feeling true regret after I'd finished reading it, because I knew there would never be another \\"first time\\". Granted I was only ten, and there would be bigger fish to fry in the years to come, including bigger and better books, relatively speaking, but at the time I thought I had reached some sort of literary Nirvana.I remember watching the animated movie after we got our first VCR and how it became a household staple for years. It hasn't aged very well, but when I was a kid I must have watched it a thousand times (amazing how kids can do that). When we went on vacation I'd listen to the radio-dramatization over and over again on those long road trips. I kept those tapes all the way into my teenage years until that fateful day they had played themselves out completely. I remember a cheesy old Gandalf shirt my uncle gave me and how devastated I was when I burned a hole in playing with fireworks. Ok, you don't want to hear my life story, but I'm just trying to illustrate how this book became something completely inseparable from my childhood.Strangely enough, I didn't read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy until I was an adult, for obvious reasons. The Rings books are far darker and more complex than the Hobbit. I loved them when I finally did read them, of course. Now that the movies have arrived, interest in the books, and especially \\"The Hobbit\\" which provides needed back-story has risen, and all the books are selling like crazy. Good. These are some of the best books ever written and deserve to be appreciated in their true form as much as possible. It's one of those few books which have the perfect blend of story, language and theme. It's probably one of the most perfect books ever written and will always be a personal favorite to re-read no matter how old I get.Do yourself a favor, turn off the VCR, log off of the internet, and read this book. If you have kids, buy it for them, or read it to them; something every parent should do. Good stories never go out of style, and this is one of the greatest books ever written for anyone of any age. Read it once or read it a hundred times. There's never a \\"first time\\" again, but the trip to that magical world never fails to satisfy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My first memory of my father is him reading me the first page &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when I was a small boy. The book has remained a favorite of mine over the years, and I've read it and re-read it again and again. Finally, I decided to buy this handsome collector's edition, bound in green leather, slip-cased and containing JRRT's full color and two tone illustrations.The high quality book -- the paper it's printed on is THICK -- and illustrations just add to the story, and make it easy to slip into the fantasy world he's created.Not cheap, but definitely worth it for lovers of hobbits and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As far as books on tape go, this is one of the best I've come across. My parents bought it for me fifteen years ago, and I still pull out this 6 hour set or the twelve hour Lord of the Rings series when I'm driving cross-country.The Mind's Eye dramatizes JRR Tolkein's books with a full cast (there are a few people who voice multiple characters), and the voices from The Hobbit appear again in The Lord of the Rings. And because The Hobbit includes six hours of tape, it gets pretty much the whole story.This is well worth your money"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; can only be called the necessary beginning to what many believe is the best fantasy tale ever written. Although it was written as primarily a children's book, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; provides people of all ages a wonderful chance to explore Tolkien's world. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is not considered to be a part of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series, but is a book that simply must be read before starting LOTR.In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; we learn of Bilbo Baggins and his adventures with a group of dwarves and a wise wizard. Each chapter builds on the last, and the book is nearly impossible to put down once began. Even after several reads, one can find new surprises and joys when least expected. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; also is more humorous than most might think. It is a pleasure to read and you will find yourself laughing out loud in every chapter.Indeed, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; remains even today at the top of the mountain when compared to other fantasy books. Although there are hundreds of books about the Lord of the Rings and middle earth, none should be read before this one. It is the beginning, if you let it, to hours and days of enjoyment with all the Tolkien works."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Because of Tolkien's reputation as a master story-teller, I began reading this book with absurdly high expectations. The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed. Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the &quot;adventure&quot; which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.But Tolkien rarely disappoints. Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic. As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied. At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: &quot;My dear Bilbo! Something is the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were.&quot; Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure. As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed. My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished. I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it. Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person. His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory. This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable. And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.What's more, you can go &quot;there and back again&quot; again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off. For all ages, this book is eminently readable and re-readable, and belongs on every bookshelf. Don't miss it, because you will miss one of the most enchanting escapes that literature has to offer."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, is this better than any other trade paperback version of The Hobbit?

Read the book before you see the movie! From what I've seen, they've taken greater liberties with this movie than they did with LOTR. Galadrial and Legolas, and presumably others, do not appear in this book, and I don't see how, if it took LOTR 3 movies to complete, how can it take 3 movies to do the &#34;Hobbit&#34;? Anyway, enough about the movie, a great book, a classic.

Then, a thunderstorm came upon them and they found a dry cave and slept there for the night. Bilbo was awakened by a scraping sound, then he saw the stone wall open. The group was captured by Goblins.They found themselves in a large cavern in the mountain. The Goblin scowled at them. Then Thorin stepped forward and explained to him that they did not mean to trespass. Gandolf appeared at the door and freed the group from the goblins. The group ran ahead and Bilbo was lost behind them.Bilbo found an underwater lake and a ring on an island in the lake. He found out that the ring made him invisible. In the lake also lived a creature named Gollum. Gollum was a creature that ate other people. Gollum approached Bilbo and Bilbo told him he desired to find a way out. They then played a riddle game and if Bilbo won, he lived and if he lost, he would die. Bilbo won the riddle game but Gollum still wanted to eat him, But then Bilbo accidentally slipped the ring on his finger and became invisible, so he escaped.He met with the group again and walked with them for a few days.

It can stand on its own as a self contained story, but when read in conjunction with the Lord of the Rings, it's deceptive simplicity suddenly falls away. Many people have said you don't need to read this in order to enjoy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and this is true. However, you are cheating yourself if you don't. Many major and key players from LOTR are introduced here, not to mention the extremely important moment when Bilbo Baggins finds a lost ring in the caves under the mountain. This story is less than 100 years old, yet it resonates and feels like Tolkien was basically rewriting old myths. The argument for this can indeed come from some of the source materials that Tolkien used, but as far as I can see, the story is wholly original. It's wonderful that in the age when everything was modern and sleek, Tolkien gifted the world with this age old story. This book may have been written for kids, but I have noticed that many more adults seem to enjoy it than children. It may be Tolkien's overly descriptive language can turn kids off, but this book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book full of adventure and fantasy.

Tolkien has been one of the better books I have read in quite a while. The detail and language Tolkien uses is unique in that authors don't go the distance as he does to describe something. The Hobbit takes place in a world filled with elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other mythical creatures. The hero of the story is a hobbit, which are small men, named Bilbo Baggins. He receives a call for adventure when a well-known wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves show up on his porch, asking for his assistance. Hobbits generally never like adventuring and would rather stay home, but Bilbo reluctantly accepts their offer. The dwarves main quest is to retrieve their lost treasure that is currently guarded by an evil dragon. I gave this book a 4 out of 5 because it's one of those books that you have to read in your life. Whether you hear people talking about it, or just find it in a library, Tolkien was one of those rare authors that everyone could enjoy. The book did a great job on detail, settings, characters, and development. Reading this book reminded me a lot of Brian Jacques, Redwall series. They share a similar style of writing that gives me a sense of de-ja vu while I'm reading. In every sentence there is a detailed description of even the smallest thing. The characters in the book were also one of the reasons I gave it a high rating. Each one was unique, and had his or her own personality. The only thing it lacked was that it needed a little more action. There was a lot of excitement throughout the whole book, but it only seemed to get action packed at the end of the book. Even with its flaws it's still one of the best books I have read and will probably continue reading the series. It is worth reading whether you're new to Tolkien books, or enjoy just reading fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein is a great novel.

The plot has many small climaxes and resolutions that create a very exciting plot. This novel is also extremely easy to read. It reads quickly also, it can easily be read in a weekend.

They all enjoyed it, but only one,the daughter, has accompanied me on this trek through Middle Earth. This mastery of fantasy has brought me and mine, hours of literary pleasure. No other author of fantasy has been able to touch JRR Tolkien, in respect to depth and intricacies of storyline.

So I picked it up and scribble 'In a hole there lived a Hobbit.' That is a quote of J.R.R. Tolkien. That is how he began into the adventure of this lovely book. How amazingly awesome this is written. Tolkien has a wonderful way of story telling and bringing adventures to life. (as he diminstrates with this book) Biblo Baggins will be remembered ages from now as the main character in the greatset prelude to the greatest trilogy.The story starts off with Bilbo living hapily in his hobbit hole not bothering anyone. When the wizard Gandalf. (which is my favorite character. If you read LOTRs you will find to love him even more) He tells Bilbo that he has been chosen to come with a band of dwarfes to help get their riches back. Bilbo is reluctant but goes anyways. I would love to write a long review telling all that happens, but that would give away this wonderful book. And the best part about it is the first time you read it, it's amazing. Just know that there is battles with orcs, other hobbits. Great meetings with elves. (Elrond) Battle scenes involving a great archerer. Please take my advice and read this book. It is the book that has changed all fantasy writings and has changed most writting styles. Please read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is an amazing read for all ages and demographics. There is a large amount to be learned from a book like this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this story many, many times since I was 16 (and am now re-reading prior to the Hobbit movie release at the age of 50) and I continue to enjoy the story's depth, intrigue and mystique.While Tolkien was no slouch as a conceptual artist, the story this time is beautifully enhanced with the amazing art of Alan Lee. Throughout the book artwork is included at the beginning of each chapter, on multiple occasions within each chapter and especially at crucial moments of the story. For first time readers and children especially (Tolkien wrote the book for 8-10 year olds) this significantly aids in the interpretation of Tolkien's succinct and masterfully crafted descriptions of characters, the landscape of Middle Earth and the action scenes too!Tolkien fans and Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Movie fans will know that Alan Lee and another artist were selected by Peter Jackson and used as the principal 'conceptual artists' during the production of the movie trilogy, because he loved their art work and how they had accurately and creatively adapted Tolkien's words to portray his world and mythology. If you have the LOTR 12 disc box set - in the extras DVDs of the LOTR you will see that Alan Lee embraced the movie production beyond what he was employed for and has a true love of all things created by Tolkien and of Middle Earth itself. Alan Lee is a master conceptual artist and with a few quick pencil or brush strokes (e.g. sitting down in the 'proposed set' for the Hobbiton township) he quickly and accurately depicts Tolkien's vision of words into a picture or scene for all viewers to enjoy.This book has a significant number of detailed pencil sketches and superb water-colours of key events, characters and action. I have read this book on my IPAD which allows you to 'zoom-in' on each sketch and colour drawing (I presume the Kindle Fire has the same functionality) and you can interrogate what's happening or what Alan's trying to portray to the reader, in even more detail. Superb reading and enjoyment. Cannot recommend it enough.I also have Alan Lee's 'LOTR Sketchbook' compiled during the production of the LOTR, again another masterpiece of conceptual artwork; I hope as he was employed again as the conceptual artist for the Hobbit Trilogy that he will produce a 'Hobbit Trilogy Sketchbook'."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Sometimes I wish the fantasy genre didnt exist because some people wont read Tolkien because they say they dont like fantasy.

I love a book that can take you into its world and keep you there, even when you are not reading it.I believe what Tolkien was able to do with The Hobbit and The LOR series is create a world we all hoped existed.

Although there are several versions of this book regardless, the tales and details of this book make you feel like you are living the adventures yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Obviously, The Hobbit is a classic. This is my second time reading it, and the themes in the book are very strong and enjoyable. However, the language and style of writing used in Tolkien's day can feel clumsy to the modern reader (or at least to me). Sometimes the sheer length of his sentences impedes the fluency you would like to see in a book geared towards children. However, as a coming of age story, it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is amazing. Why did I wait so long to buy this book?!

It is in my top five reads of all-time. The Hobbit is another adventure of a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and his elf compadres as they overcome a myriad of obstacles and their cleaver escapes. if you like stories of fantasy adventurism you will love this book with its plots twists and unexpected turns."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can be said about this book that hasn't already be said?Of course, this is an amazing book. The story is fantastic, whimsical, engaging, and has a moral depth uncharacteristic of many modern novels. It is considerably lighter both in content and length than The Lord of the Rings and is meant generally for a younger audience, but that does not affect it adversely. I won't go into too much detail about the story itself. I'll just say that if you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and do so! I'll focus the rest of my review on the version that I bought.I got the Hardcover released on September 18, 2012, which has a green cover with a little &#34;Now a Major Motion Picture&#34; emblem over one of Tolkein's illustrations of Smaug. The binding and physical quality of the book is, of course, more than satisfactory. It includes a decent copy of Thorin's map, although it is spread over two pages, and thus some of the center of the map is lost. I would have preferred to see a fold-out map. It contains some excellent illustrations by Tolkein at various points in the story, including a drawing of Bilbo's hobbit hole. Overall, I have no issues with this physical manifestation of Tolkein's immortal story.5/5"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Seeing the movie made me want to read this book again. It never gets old. A timeless book in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you're a trivia buff or want to know more about how the book was written this annotated version of the Hobbit is an excellent choice. I love all the details included. There is almost more content in the annotations than in the book itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Perhaps I'm at a disadvantage, but I read Fellowship of the Rings before I ever read this novel. I am a big fan of Fellowship, and therefore this book left me wanting......more?LOTR trilogy is a darker story with a better view on the evils in our world. The Hobbit, to me, while a fun story, seemed more innocent and almost naive. After a friend explained to me that The Hobbit was written before the death of his son, while LOTR was written after, it seemed to make more sense. However, I prefer the harder journey, for I feel that there is much more earned at the end.The story is a fun story, one that I am sure we will read to our children. But as a 24 year old, I just felt that it wasn't what I was looking for in a novel. Yes, it is a classic and I believe it is for a reason, but I believe it is for a younger audience. Had I read it sooner, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book and the process of getting it for the kindle was super easy.

Great book, easy read and you know how easy it is to download to the your reader!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book! It's probably my favorite out of all the Lord of The Ring book series. It's absolutely brilliant! The main character Bilbo Baggins is funny, and just plain awesome. My favorite part in the whole book is probably the riddle challenge with Gollum. This is a book people are going to read over and over again. I sure know I will and that most of my siblings have already. The little stories that go along with the main one really add element to the book. I stayed up reading for hours then hours more thinking about what I'd just read.

Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped. Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses, and it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero, a tiny fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (&quot;It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort&quot;) His life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do...Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful &quot;wee&quot; people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was a gift from a family friend who knew of my passion for reading (as a 9yr old kid). But my taste favored more romantic and classical novels and so this book sat neglected on my bookshelf for 10 yrs! Finally, one day I decided to give it a chance and to my surprise I couldn't put it down! I finished the book in a day and in the following 3 weeks devoured the entire Lord of the Rings series which had also been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I have never been a fantasy fan, and still don't consider myself one... which just goes to show how excellent an author J.R.R. Tolkien is to have captured my imagination. The Hobbit is altogether a most charming read, filled with endless moments of adventure, humour and suspense. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters and the fantasy. I recommend this book to any book-lover who would like to sample a master-piece of unsurpassed creativity and imagination. Take it from a convert! *grin*"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Back in the late 1970's, in an era when radio drama was disappearing from public radio, the American prodcution of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were created with a full cast of voice actors along with music and sound effects. Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first fell in love with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings in 6th grade. That love hasn't faded over the ensuing 40 years. This audiobook - and the companion for LoTR - do the original full justice. Rob Inglis is a master of voice and characterization - and he brings the book fully to life.I do wish that this were available on MP3; transferring the disks to iTunes is a bit cumbersome. But if you're looking for a fantastic listening experience, this is more than worth that minimal effort."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While the pages of this book have gold leafed edges like a bible, the pages aren't quite as thin. The printer did a great job of making smaller print text without any smudges and is actually still easily visible to someone like me who is kind of blind. The inside front cover has a colored map of Thorin's map of the secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. The back inside cover has a colored map of the Wilderlands. I like that these maps are in color and not black and white, but I don't mind that the illustrations inside are black and white. This book is small, but I doubt it could fit in my pocket. But, it is most certainly small and light weight enough to fit comfortably into my rucksack back pack and go with me wherever I go, which was the whole point of getting this so I'm very pleased with it, especially for the price. This is far superior to any previous paperback print of this book. The imitation leather cover is awesome as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" stands as the definitive edition to Tolkien's classic work. Douglas Anderson works from a simple premise - start with the final intent of Tolkien as can be reasonably determined and issue that as the main text, and then provide textual commentary, noting changes from previously published editions of the book, discuss possible sources and allusions, and frame characters, settings, and plot events in the context of Middle-earth and Arda at large.The book itself is a large, coffee table type book, featuring Tolkine's painting of Smaug set against the \\"Mirkwood\\" painting. Tolkien originally modelled the painting after a previous work, a color drawing, illustrating the elf Belg meetign Flindor (later renamed Gwindor) in the forest of Taur-na-Fuin. This watercoloured was first published in \\"Artist\\", No 54, and also appeared in the Tolkien Calndear 1974 under the title 1973. The back of the cover includes Tolkien's original description of \\"The Hobbit\\" from the original 1937 British edition.This edition contains Douglas Anderson's acknowledgements and thanks, Tolkien's \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\" and Anderson's extensive introduction to the book, and then obvioulsy the main text. There are two appendices: \\"A: The Quest for Erebor\\", \\"B: The Runes\\", then the Bibliography, and the Map of Wildernland. The introduction is an extensive essay on Tolkien, featuring information biographically and frames \\"The Hobbit\\" and its development and its sources in terms of its effects on Tolkien's mythology and also his writings for his children, even alluding to \\"The Oragog\\", an unpublished, unfinished story written by Tolkien in the early 1920s about a strange creature going through remarkable landsacpes. The intro also goes into detail regarding the composition of \\"The Hobbit\\", includes a facsimile of a page from one of the original manuscripts, and goes through the processes that led to the publication of the book, and also gives us extensive information on the revision history of the book as well as various foreign editions.The format of the book goes like this: there is the main text aligned so that is a large amount of white space on the left side of the left page, and the right side of the right page. [, with different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences. Then, onnumerall ]Different sections of the text unobtrusively numbered at the end of the respective sentences, with the annotations appearing on the aforementioned white space made available. The format works wonderfully as you can read the text uninterrupted and only refer to the annotations if you so desire. Unlike the 1988 edition of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", the annotations are in very close proximitiy to the text under discussion, so you can easily just read the annotation by looking right next to the text and then continue, and (in most cases) not have to flip pages and then return to the spot where you left off. Due to the length of some of the annotations, some [of the textual annotations] flipping will be required, but that is the exception, not the norm.Removing the textual annotations from appendicies in the 1988 edition and incorporating them in the main body of the book greatly assists in the ease and study of \\"The Hobbit\\" that this version actively accomdates and encourages. That is the key change between the original and the revised versions of \\"The Annoated Hobbit\\" in terms of format. In terms of content, there is not a lot of change, with one very significant exception. The second edition [also] features \\"The Quest for Erebor\\".Originally slated for publication in appendices \\"The Return of the King\\", this text was removed for considerations of space from the final product. The first text published was in \\"Unfinished Tales\\". Christopher Tolkien then published an earlier version in the 1996 book \\"The Peoples of Middle-earth\\", which was unknown to Christopher at the time of the 1979 \\"Unfinished Tales\\". The \\"Unfinished Tales\\" version is Text A. Then Tolkien wrote a typescript, Text B. Tolkien then wrote short, compressed version (most likely in order to retain this material in the final book). This is the third version (Text C).The version found in \\"Unfinished Tales\\" is an amalgamation of Text C with long extracts of B appearing after it, with Christopher's extensive commentary. The text in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" is Text B, which has never been published in its entirety before now.Although some previous reviewers have found this strange (which too me is odd, given the nature of annotated books), Anderson represents every single revision, and the original reading the revision replaced, in the form of annotation. Although some of these revisions are trivial, there is some highly interesting content present in the revision history of \\"The Hobbit\\". Most notably is the publication of the first edition version of Chapter Six, \\"Riddles in the Dark\\", where Bilbo first encounters Gollum. The first version radically differs from the 1947 rewrite that first appeared in 1951 and has become the definitive version of the chapter ever since. In the first version Gollum freely wants to give the ring away, and apologises profusely for not having the Ring to give to Bilbo after Bilbo wins the riddle contest, and shows Bilbo the way out in recompense for not having the Ring to give to him.Other interesting textual annotations are revisions where Tolkien brings consistency between his two major Hobbit books. He brings the geography of \\"The Hobbit\\" more into line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (changing \\"One afternoon thney forded the river\\" to \\"a river\\"), and most interestingly changes the original 1937 reading \\"swords of the elves that are now called Gnomes\\" to \\"swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin\\". Tolkien used Gnomes as the name for the Elves tribe of the Noldor in the 1920s and 1930s, and associated iwth the Greek work \\"thought, intelligence\\". Tolkien stated he abandoned the name, because \\"it is quite impossible to dissociate the name from the popular associations of the Paracelsan gno-mus = pygmaeus\\" (Letters, No. 239). Both examples are from Chapter 3, \\"The Last Homely House\\". There are several more examples like this, including one where Tolkien changed \\"after the sack of the mines of Moria\\" to \\"after the battle of the Mines of Moria\\", due to Tolkien's changing conception of his mythology\\".Some more interesting annotations deal with the stone giants from \\"Over Hill and Under Hill\\", which never appear anywhere else in the legendarium, and likewise the older city upon whose foundations Lake-Town was built upon, likewise never elaborated on anywhere else. Also included is a previously unpublished poem from Chapter 3.In regards to artwork and various editions, \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\" includes numerous illustrations from forien editions of the novel, sprinkled liberally through out all ninteen chapters of the book. Due to space I won't list them all, with the exception of Josef Madlener's \\"Der Berggeist\\", a painting of an old man in a long hat sitting feeding a goat. Tolkien wrote on his copy of the picture that this was the origin of Gandalf.However, here is the artwork by Tolkien present, with page and chapter listed. I will also reference if the artwork appears in either \\"Pictures\\" or \\"J. R. R.

I firmly believe that this version is the best audio presentation ever produced of tolkiens work. Why? Well, its really a voice character based play complete with ambient sound effects, it's theater of the mind set in tolkiens universe. It's NOT a plain old voice of one person doing his best to give you a read over like some grandpa reading a bedside story (not that i'm against that mind you, it's just not my cup of tea, ya know). My kids grew up hearing this on long car trips, and it kept us all entertained with a shared universe we could all enjoy at the same time.

Now my fourteen year old son has the same interest in hobbits, elves and dwarves.

I understood the characters and i could picture what they looked liked because it has good discription, but other than that the rest of the book didn't grab my intrest.

After reading this book I relized that i'm just not into fantasy stories."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book a number of times over the years and have never grown tired of the tale. The story involves the sudden arrival of a wizard into the quiet village called the Shire. The wizard informs our hero, the hobbit - Bilbo Baggins, that he will be visited soon with a great task. Bilbo soon finds himself involved (not by his choice) in helping a band of dwarfs in an exciting tale of adventure and wonder.We follow Bilbo and the band of dwarfs as they make their way through many perilous areas. Fighting goblins, trolls, and wolves; captured by elves; and finding a dragon. All the makings of an endless tale. It is great to see how the chracter of Bilbo develops. Bilbo is reluctant at first to go on this adventure, but then realizes that one small hobbit can make a difference.This story introduces the reader to the world of Middle Earth. A world full of wonderful and amazing creatures and people. When I first read this story I was captivated by the intricate world that Tolkien had created. Little do we know that this story is the beginning of the end for the Third Age of Middle Earth.I know enjoy reading this story to my children and watching their eyes widen at various adventures encountered."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The lord of the rings trilogy was just straight and flat out boring. I hated those books so much that I couldn't describe. The hobbit, however, is ten times better and actually has some good stuff and action scenes to it. The whole thing is interesting, since the plot is very unique, and also the characters are richly and warmly developed. This is the stuff that good fantasy is made out of, and I don't know why Tolkien changed his writing skills when he wrote lord of the rings. Anyways, this book rocks. It's a great book to read next to the fireplace on a rainy night inside your home, and the paintings which are held inside this book, (In other words what Tolkien describes and how he describes it) Is simply and positively extraordinary and different from all other books that I have read, and I've read lots of books. Anyways, get this book. At first, it didn't really seem interesting. But a lot of great books don't immediatly start out interesting. But after the slow parts, it's like a rollar coaster. The lord of the rings, however, was slow all the way through. I'm surprised that people even manage to read all three installments.Anyways, this book is great. Many other authors have copied Tolkien and just came out with pale imitations. This is the original fantasy book which started the entire genre of good fantasy epic novels. Read this book.

Until *The Hobbit, Part I* becomes available on DVD, I'm posting the film review here.]WARNING: Spoilers ahead!While Gandalf the Wizard [Ian McKellan] remains timeless, it was obvious from the start that the Bilbo Baggins of three *The Lord of the Rings* films fame [Ian Holm, now pushing 80 years old] would have to bow out for the making of *The Hobbit*. Director Peter Jackson had surely asked himself, \\"Who could portray a young Ian Holm?\\", (but not necessarily a younger Bilbo Baggins since we now perceive Bilbo to look like the actor.) Answer: Martin Freeman. And he was right - Freeman effortlessly coalesced into the lead role.In the first of the two *The Hobbit* entries [sub-titled: *Into The Wilderness*], a more youthful Bilbo Baggins is craftily crow-barred by Gandalf into embarking upon a great adventure (Hobbits *despise* adventures!) and by serving as a burglar for a grumbly troupe of thirteen dwarves, all of whom are determined to reclaim their lost family treasure from the Evil dragon, Smaug; however, the actual battle with Smaug at the Lonely Mountain will have to wait until Part II [to be entitled: *Into the Fire*] is released.Part I largely focuses upon the history of the dwarves and the initial hazards that they encounter during their single-minded quest, chiefly battling orcs in the Misty Mountains and finishing with their tribulations with the giant spiders of the vast and ominous Mirkwood forest.It's worth noting right off that the screenwriters very shrewdly rehabilitated the puerile songs of the dwarves [found throughout the book], transforming them into a range of vivid action scenes. This strategy achieved a pair of worthy ends: 1. I've heard audio versions of this story and to include the dwarf renderings of these archaic and lengthy songs would have been in profound conflict with an effective film conveyance. 2. These newly-fashioned scenes provide additional fodder for the artful expansion of the general lack of book material, thereby reinforcing audience interest.Honestly, a movie version of Tolkien's *The Hobbit* could feasibly have been corralled within a single feature-length film [just think of all the ground that was covered inAvatar (Original Theatrical Edition)] -- but the financial anticipations of the producers [greed], which tended to tenon seamlessly with Peter Jackson's lust for detail, had dictated long ago that viewers would have to hang on for a \\"final\\" conclusion. Part I features an ending of a sort but perhaps it would be more forthright to regard it as a dramatic finale.One looming uncertainty which has kept Tolkien fans off-balance was whether the screenwriters would go dark with *The Hobbit* in an effort to effectively link it up withThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)series, particularly since Tolkien originally penned the earlier work as a sort of kids' fairy tale. In retrospect the answer to the question was probably evident to Peter Jackson from his earliest conception of a film version, noting additionally that his time-honored philosophy is that first-class films cannot simply mirror the books from which they are taken. A good screenplay massages a book for all it's worth but the visual and audio aspects must be fully accommodated too.Particular figures such as Gandalf, Elrond [Hugo Weaving], Galadriel [Cate Blanchett] and, Gollum [Andy Serkis] have already been firmly established in terms of image and it would be less than prudent at this juncture to radically manipulate the personalities of these prominent returning characters. And speaking of Galadriel, she was never a personage to be found in *The Hobbit* but Peter Jackson mined her from Tolkien's trilogy, casting her very strategically in his film version (along with Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom who also did not appear in *The Hobbit*) to further expand the script. Blanchett's presence additionally helped to overcome the gender gap of the book version. Still, these two actors are not in any way just add-ons -- their respective roles and performances have imparted considerable gravity to the story.It is impossible to separate this film's noir-ish ambiance from Howard Shore's magnificent soundtrack. He's done it again! Upbeat and even a bit frivolous at the outset, the filmscore soon slips furtively into darker realms as the story advances, a few heroic themes being reserved for the appropriate dramatic moments. One is acutely taken with the leitmotif which Shore appended to Beorn, a Prokofiev-ish ponderousness integrated with a more serious Beethoven-like dignity... the perfect musical emulsion for the venerated skin-changer.Once initial New Zealand and Australian actors' guild stumbling blocks were surmounted, the Kiwi locations again became a reality, a twin-island geography wholly adequate for the production when supplemented by studio settings, all of which have lead to the presentation of an astonishingly exceptional end-product. It would certainly have proven problematic to reproduce The Shire's Hobbiton in Eastern Europe, a location which was suggested during the early union-troubled days.Martin Freeman's dazzling performance has eclipsed even that of Elijah Wood's stellar lead role in *The Lord of the Rings* films. The former's ebullient energy ironically seems to have retrospectively amplified Ian Holm's earlier portrayal of Bilbo in the New Line Cinema trilogy of films. The remaining cast members have also set the viewers at complete ease as they creatively played out their respective roles. Peter Jackson undoubtedly learned early in his career that, given spot-on casting, at least half the battle is won. And it's hardly surprising that a particular limelight shines on Fili [Robert Kazinski] and Kili [Aidan Turner] since this caveat, for those of us who already know the story, will markedly impact most of us when we get to view the second film. The director is clearly looking ahead.In the larger view *The Hobbit* story lacks the bulwark of heroic figures which we encountered throughout *The Lord of the Rings* series, Aragorn, Boromir, Theoden, Faromir, and so on. Still, imposing characters such as Elrond, Beorn, and Bard the Bowman provide us with a subliminally more-than-adequate melodramatic security blanket. The bottom line is that this superb movie is not simply the detritus of *The Lord of the Rings* films. It's gratifying that Peter Jackson was shrewd enough to not endeavor upon such a futile follow-up attempt -- he created this film from scratch. Embracing that same notion, the screenwriters saw to it that the storyline endured sufficient jumbling so that the tale is not precisely as linear as the one we encounter in the book. This film stands on its own.With better than a baker's dozen of little folks in starring roles the temptation to over-incorporate moments of comic relief [vignettes of Gimli] must have rivaled the gnawing urge which only The One Ring could normally generate. While some tasteful levity fell well within the bounds of a palatable script, I did actually breathe a sigh of relief once I realized that few such incidents were forthcoming.The computer generated images aspect of the movie, while perfectly executed and integral to the overall work, are nicely supplemented by scale doubles, forced perspective images, miniatures, and other Jackson-ish tricks of the trade. No fear -- these facets of the film are all first-class and delightfully palatable. Gollum is better than ever. Additionally, due accolades can hardly be suitably imparted to all the folks who helped to polish this film to excellence by means of effective make-up, articulate stunt work, unequaled cinematography, precise production design, and all the other crew activities which only ever seem to rate a fleeting line of scrolled credit.One is pleased to observe that the new role of Warner Brothers and MGM [Hollywood-based companies which recently acquired New Line Cinema] did not perceptibly obstruct Peter Jackson's proclivity for artistic detail. The casual but essential impedimenta present at every place where the Dwarfish Crusaders land aids us all to subconsciously believe in the reality of Middle Earth along with its numerous and varied inhabitants. Probably much credit for the focused attention upon the near-infinite number of magical nuances should go largely to Alan Lee, a man with an unbounded imagination coupled with a vast artistic talent.I present only a singular critique of this film and it has nothing to do with the body of the movie itself: I feel compelled to comment that the decision to incorporate the endless scroll of Tolkien Fan Club members' names within the end credits is ill-advised and indirectly demeaning to the actual cast and crew. What do these people actually contribute to the film's production? Loyalty and moral support? The folks who have indeed delivered something more tangible are appropriately noted elsewhere within the credits. But most of the listed individuals have played no real part whatever, regardless of the syrupy patronization conducted by the film-makers toward this particular faction of Tolkien enthusiasts. Including these names in the film credits, which also takes in the so-called self-appointed \\"guardians\\" of Tolkien's work [a trivial minority of Tolkien Fan Club members], amounts to little more than a shallow ego-bribe. It's presumptuous as the devil to assert that Tolkien's books *need* guarding by anyone -- the affiliation here is more akin to pretentious posthumous tail-gating on the venerable Old Master.The credits perquisite imparted by the film producers, appears in my view to ostensibly head off any whining outrage raised on the internet by those Tolkien radicals who are wholly unyielding in regard to the slightest manipulation of Tolkien's texts. This posture is pure nonsense. In the end, if one's name is included in the film credits then how can s/he ever issue an untainted appraisal of the film? In truth, such an individual could never ethically issue a fruitful critical review, (nor would they likely be *inclined* to criticize, which leads me to question the motives and ethics of the producers on this front.) But here I ramble witlessly upon a topic which only faintly deserves to be dignified by my attentions to it. In truth, my mini-rant is not even a legitimate film criticism - it's really just a pet peeve.In summary, *The Hobbit* contains enough MacGuffins and other surprise moments to make it seem like a new story while still paying a more than adequate tribute to Tolkien's original manuscript. Martin Freeman was surely a brilliant choice to play Bilbo. I can hardly wait to see Part II!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have nothing to say about the story except I enjoy it.

Tolkien definitely tells the Hobbit in a much more innocent, almost-naive voice, which is understandable, considering (1) he hadn't fully conceived of the darker-themed LOTR at the time, and (2) it is a children's story.While it is a children's story, The Hobbit is still a masterpiece that anybody can enjoy.

I guess my eyes have just been trained to automatically jump to find a numbered footnote when I see a referenced footnote number within the text and I've had to consciously avoid doing that because it's like going back to school rather than merely reading for enjoyment. The storyline can easily be understood without the footnote, making the footnote quite distracting. But going back and reading the footnotes at a time other than when the text is being read is quite enjoyable and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since others have already written reviews about the story I am writing about this particular edition. Buy this edition if you want to keep it on a book shelf or display on your coffee table or night stand. Because the book is housed in a box that is equal in quality to the binding, the experience of handling and opening the book to read gives a surprizing addition to the pleasure of experincing the tale. The colored glossy illustrations (5) also add a dimension as well as non glossy green and black ones(7). There are maps on the inside covers of The Desolation of Smaug and Wilderland. Runes printed in gold go around the cover of the book. If you are a true Lord of the Rings afficionado or know one, it's time to upgrade that paperback to this superior edition. Terrific gift!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This beautiful version of Tolkien's The Hobbit is one of the best versions you can get of this book.

KhauP. 5This book takes place before the Fellowship of the ring which is part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, who is a hobbit that lives his peaceful life at the Shire. Hobbits are little people that live in comfortable holes. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf visits Bilbo and invites him to go out on an adventure with some dwarves. Bilbo agrees and his adventure starts. Little does he know of what challenges with he run across...One thing I like about this book is the way the author describes something.&quot;Hobbits are little people, smaller than dwarfs. They love peace and quiet and good tilled earth. They dislike machines, but they are handy with tools. They are nimble but don't like to hurry. They have sharp ears and eyes. They are inclined to be fat. They wear bright colors but seldom wear shoes. They like to laugh and eat(six meals a day)and drink. They like parties and they like to give and recieve presents. They inhabit a land they call The Shire, a place between the River Brandywine and the Far Downs.&quot;This is an excellent quote that is discriptive and simple at the same time. It caught my attention and provided me with lots of background information that I would stumble and be confused without.One thing that I dislike about this book is the way it lengthens things that are boring or get boring. Most of these things are not important in the story and easily get forgotten.They can also confuse you.&quot;You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.&quot;This is an example of somethings I dislike. If you are not really concentrated, this could confuse you. I had to read over that paragraph a couple times before I acually understood much of it. Later on in the book this paragraph seems irrelevant. You should also only try to read this book if you have a lot of time to spare. It is pretty long and there are lots of parts in the book that will take some time to understand.My favortie part of the book is the beginning. It caught my attention with good descriptions. They were not too long and acually told you how something looked or felt. There was no junk about descriptions that you can't even visualize and remember enough to care. The beginning was solid and it didn't leave you confused and wondering what the author meant. My least favorite part was Chapter 18. It didn't lead to an ending well. There were a couple boring parts that I wish were taken out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, here is my problem with reviewers. 1) Stop with the spoilers people!! Some readers would like to read the story without knowing what happens at the end. 2)Nearly every author and/or book is compaired to Tolkien. He may be the 'Father of Fantasy' but he isn't all there is to offer. Not every book is written to parrallel middle-earth and the books Tolkien created. I know that some of you die hard Tolkien fans out there are probably ready to kill me now for saying that, but it's true. Yes people, there is a thing as creativity. Authors tend to use it every now and again. And yes, there are simularities between every book and the Lord of the Rings, if you look for them at least. But there are also similarities between Lord of the Rings and older books like The Odyssey. Or any other book you can think of. But why look for them? It just destroys your enjoyment of the book you are comparing it to. If you read every book expecting it to be like another one then you won't catch on to what the author has in mind. To all you unenlightened people out there, get a life, not every book is a Hobbitt want to be. And not every author is a Tolkien want to be. Stop bitching and maybe you might actually enjoy a book or two."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit named biblo Baggins. He decides to go on a adventure with a trrop full of dwafs. They are ambushed by trolls and saved bythe wizard Gandalf. Later while in the misty mouantains they were captured by goblins and took them to their king. Soon the wizard saved them again by the wizard and his magicaal sword Glamdring,The foe-hammer. One of the most feared foes of the Goblins {even though it's a sword}. then retuned Orcristto thorin the leader. While they were escaping Biblo found the ring of power. After they escaped they were attacked by the goblins and wolves then saved by eagles. Then they arrived at the loly mountain and stole one of Smaug's jewl's which broght his anger on them. Then he attacked the island city and was killed by the black arrow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Charming is, I think, the word that describes The Hobbit best. It is a novel intended for children (not children too young, obviously), and so one should not expect too much serious writing in the book; but even so, it has a magic all its own, quite different than its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo Baggins is a character you get to know and love, and even feel sorry for, throughout the book. The Dwarves are amusing, too, and Gandalf is one of Tolkien's most unforgettable characters. If you want to read a book that led to the definitive novel in fantasy writing, a book with endless charm and humour, read The Hobbit. It's short, it's easy to read, and it's fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the Hobit is a great book for kids.I really enjoy the adventure they go on.I like Gandalf.I read it with my dad.If you like adventure books this would be great for you.Each part keeps getting better and beter.I love J.R.R Tolkien.You should tell your friends to read the book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have to admit, I would have never given the Hobbit a chance if I hadn't been assigned a book report in which I'd have to read a fantasy book.

Escaping from goblins, being rescued by giant eagles, killing dragons, and protecting a hoard of treasure may seem like a typical adventure story. This story will tingle the senses and twist your imagination to new heights and leave you wanting more and more! In a lifeless, boring, adventure-less, hobbit town with a shy, dull, adventure-less hobbit came an adventure of all adventures, one that couldn't be turned down. The shy hobbit meets a wise, risky, well-known wizard who talks the hobbit to throw a party and the hobbit accepts. At the party, the hobbit meets thirteen dwarves, who turn out to be his traveling companions and each have different traits and personalities which both aid and the hurt the friends on their journey. The friends start on their journey and they must travel through dangerous mountains filled with deadly goblins. There the hobbit proves his usefulness and saves the dwarves from the goblins from there on the hobbit pulls the dwarves and sticky and dangerous situations. This book is terrific. J.R.R. Tolkien's writing is detailed and flowing that lets the reader feel like he or she is actually in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good sense of imagination and adventure. This is not just for kids it can be just as exciting for adults too. I encourage anybody who has read this book to read the other books in the series.Reviewed by Jimmy Byars"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read The Hobbit 20-25yrs. ago and, to this day, I still have not only The Hobbit,but also the trilogy, The Silmarillian and The Tolkien Companion prominently and proudly displayed on my bookshelf.

Until one day a brigade of dwarves and a magical wizard came barging into his ordianary life. Bilbo,then was forced to go on this insane quest across what seems to be an entire country, just to find some gold. This gold originally belonged to the dwarves until taken away by the terrible dragon, Smaug. Bilbo and the dwarves are now off on an adventure. A very dangerous adventure to be more precise. They start off by encountering trolls, who want to eat them for dinner.

At first I believed after much reading I have come to see new aspects in the story. The way that the author describes the setting made me feel as if I was marching through the woods on the adventure. During the dwarves adventure they come into contact with many obstacles such as goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step from the opening of the story onward is a great adventure. Within the woods fo the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy written novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings. Although as unrealistic the story may seem, I found myself hping for Bilbo the hobbit to save the dwarves through each adventure. I recomend this book for suspense and mystery. Hoping that the dwarves will find their dragon and get the gold in the end, I read on!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The author has done a great job with this best loved novel. Through journeys into the life of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, I was taken into a year of endless adventures. The wild journeys in the mountains of the Mirkwood Forest are full of fear. Bilbo goes through many exciting trips like fighting dragons meeting trolls,drawfs,and goblins. Bilbo Baggins even got the unwilling chance to be at the Battle of the Five Armies. While reading this book, I was taken into a world I thought could never exist, through the imagination of such a gifted author. This book made me realize that I could write about anything because the books with the most fantasy make the best page turners, and that is why I give this book four stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I JUST READ THIS BOOK IN SCHOOL FOR MY ENGLISH CLASS AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO READING IT CUZ IVE HEARD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT WHILE I WAS READING I BECAME SO INTERESTED IN IT I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK AND SHOULD BE READ BY EVERYONE.JUST 1 WEEK AFTER READING IT IM ALREADY STARTING TO READING THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY AND IM REAL EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

I am now on to th LOR trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my &quot;read again&quot; books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out.

You may wonder why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 well to tell you the truth I thought the ending definatly could have been better. The entire story is based on a quest to rid an ancient dwarve fortress from SMAUG an evil dragon well it turns out that the adventures dont kill smaug and he plays a minor part in the long run.

The only character that was developed enough was Biblo Baggins. As for Gandalf and the thirteen dwarfs, since they weren't that devloped I found myself not really caring about them as much as I would like. However, despite the negative, there is still much more positive things to be said about this novel. It's a great fantasy/adventure, and it basically pioneered the way for other fantasy/adventure stories to come. It has plenty of action, and it is rarely boring. All in all, I reccomend this novel, and I am eagerly going to read The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am normally not a fan of fantasy novels (although I love RPGs) but I decided to pick up &quot;The Hobbit&quot; because I had heard so much praise about it.

Great to read now to get a head start on the movies. I recommend to everyone who enjoyed the lotr saga."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not a review specifically of The Hobbit, but more of what this book is compared to Tolkien's other writings. Tolkien's true masterpiece is The Silmarillion, which he wrote in WW1, believe it or not. The Silmarillion is a very deep and complex book, to much so for children. Thus he wrote this book for children taking some bits and pieces from The Silmarillion. You can think of the difference as comparing reading the bible to a bible story for kids. After the success of the Hobbit, Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings which continues from the Hobbit and is somewhat more of a young adult type of work, more complex than the Hobbit but still nothing like the Silmarillion.Does one need to read The Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings? Not necessarily, but I strongly recommend it. There are some parts in the hobbit that some people may find mundane or silly, such as the songs the dwarves sing. But it gives a very good world of what is a Hobbit and if you like that, you'll probably like the Lord of the Rings too. Keep in mind the LOTR is a long series and it seems a character just walking across a field can take 30 pages.On a whole though The Hobbit is certainly one of the best books of all time and can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Obviously now is a great time to read it as the movies are being made of it (finally!). One good thing about reading it is there are some characters not in the movie and of course there are some things in the movie that aren't quite like the book. And you'll have a better idea of what things are going on. But some people may even rather read the book after the movie. I think its more enjoyable to read the book first though, then reread it again later. I also think the book gives you a much better insight into Bilbo than the movie can. And Bilbo isn't the same guy as Frodo in LOTR either."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"classic, with the movie I thought it was time to read it again after 20 years. just takes you away fromtodays day to day duldrums. makes you want to go on an adventure"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So after seeing the movie I had to rush home to read the book. I haven't read it in a while. Upon completion all I have to say is the story is there, but it's really hidden. Me and my dad who are both Tolkien fans discussed it and we both came to the same conclusion. The movie is better. But this isn't a review for the movie. It was harder to feel like I was there in the Hobbit. One can tell that Tolkien has an amazing story going through his mind but he just doesn't quite convey it well on paper, but the reason for the four stars is that you can almost follow his thought process. I'll probably read it again sometime in the future, but it won't be for another ten years or so."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a good book that gives you a lot of background for middle earth mythology.

The history of this land was so detailed that it was almost as if you were reading a non-fiction book, except that it was extremely exciting. There have even been a number of atlases published on Middle Earth that, I believe, can be found on Amazon.com. The characters in The Hobbit were very well put together. The only problem I had with this book, at the time that I read it for the first time, was that the characters in some of the parts seemed to all have the same name. You couldn't tell which one was which! Upon reading it a second time, I found that it was much easier to understand. This book was made for children, unlike its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. I loved the suspenseful parts of The Hobbit, such as when Bilbo enters a secret door in The Lonely Mountain to confront Smog for the first time. I really am a fantasy nut, so this review may be a bit of an exaggeration.

I first read The Hobbit when I was eight years old, and have read the book seven or eight times since. This book is not as powerfull as the trilogy that it preceeds, but is far better in its own way. As is well known the book was written for children, because of this alot of people try to insult the writers style. Like I said, they just don't understand. That is what attracts me to the book. The drifting, whimsical style that makes you feel like a child every time you read it. Some of the other reviews said that it was poorly written, that could not be farther from the truth. It takes an exeptional writer to tell a tale in such a captivating manner, and someone with at least minimal intelligence to recognize and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R.

Definitly a must read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings series as a teenager and I remember myself being completely fascinated. 10 years later, I've read the Hobbit, after seeing the movie (The Hobbit: An unexpected journey) and it was okay, a little boring at some points. Maybe the target audience should be teenagers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Love the inside look! Pictures were very vivid. The inside story was very cool to read and very well written. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I did not read this book until I was in my 40s, and I am sorry it took me til then.Admittedly,I am partial to the LOTR trilogy,otherwise I would have given 5 stars.To me,this is perfect for young people to be introduced to Mr.Tolkien,and a wonderful adventure.I love that there is no technology,it is all good vs.evil,being to being,if that makes sense.My son's and I share a wonderful bond with these books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent adventure tale!

It was a chore to read some of it. On to the LOTR!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was amazing. The plot, and the characters, the entire read was beyond perfection.

I plan on reading this book time and time again. But first I must read the Lord of the rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins doesn't want to go but you will. It is a great journay and it is great fun to admire Tolkein's imagination. The book is full of real-life lessons and valuable philosophy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!a close competitor with the original trilogy!!!!! I think that Tolkien out done himself, and so did Peter Jackson!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love &#34;The Hobbit&#34; every time I read it, Tolkien is such a great writer. My husband is reading it now that I am done."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book pulled me in from the begining and did not dissapoint me all the way tothe end. Full of suspense and action, the characters are endearing, the plotis easy to followall around a great book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An OK read but the movie has a much more developed story line. Surprising when a movie trumps a book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book. I'd read it over and over. Its full of fun, adventure, hope, treasure, friends and loyalty. Id recomend it to all age groups"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first Tolkien story I have read and I am very impressed. The Hobbit is a great book and I recommend it to young and old.

All together, great read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After hearing every line in this book is like poetry and an assortment of praise, I decided to buy it for the kindle...there are no problems with formatting or anything...I am already planning to read it again.

Galaxy Tab 10.1 would not show some of the extra features like maps. It did provide a link to get to them online.

Loves reading it from the Kindle and she said really likes the story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an awesome book! I rated it 5 stars because it has adventure, details, a few jokes, and detailed illustration. If you haven't read it, you should because you'll probably like it so much that you would want to let everyone know how AWESOME it is. If you do read it I hope you like it and share it. Thank J.R.R Tolkien for such a great book! :) Also you should rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I haven't read The Hobbit since 1975-ish, but I was planning to read it again before seeing the movie. This turned out otherwise, but I was happy, happy, happy to rediscover the youthfulness and positive humor that is not present in the film! The whole Hobbit-y series is wonderful for 10 year olds (or earlier) to 100 year olds (or later). They are not books to be trifled with - my first reading long ago sent me to read the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, Icelandic sagas that formed a strong base for Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"And I love the first movie. Peter Jackson has such imagination. Tolkien has become a favorite of mine in my old age."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our children and grandchildren learned to read with this book and continued on to read Lord of The Rings. We started reading it to them but they were so impatient they started reading it themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I don't know what to say. I'm touched and amazed. Read this story. It will enrich any day, and bring great emotion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the 5th time I've read The Hobbit since 1966. I have lost my original but this edition has definitely been changed and I am not convinced I like the changes."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story that keeps your interest. A must read for all ages, and it is fun to see how Bilbo gets in and out of trouble."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"as each time before a delightful read. I do recommend it and \\"The Lord Of The Rings! all very good reads to say the least"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well worth what I paid for the Kindle version - $7.00 or so. Art work is fantastic, audio readings by Tolkien himself delightful. How many have actually heard his voice?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Loved it. Can't wait to read them Lord of the rings trilogy. Even better the second time I read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Couldn't find my original copy and wanted the set to be complete. Wanted to re-read this book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"3 movies better tell the whole story. Peter Jackson left a lot out in the Lord of the rings.....hello ....Tom Bombadill?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Nice to read on the Kindle! I have the book, this is a first for me, the Kindle was nice change of pace on re-reading this story!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Yes I just had to read the Hobbit again! It was just as wonderful as when I read it while in my youth. You just have to soak up the wonderful tale that Tolkien came up with and hope the movie does it justice."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased this book for my 11 year old grandson. He loves it! Has shown it to his 13 year old neighbor/best friend, and he thinks it is a good version of this book. His friend has also begun to read The Hobbit; they are critiquing it together. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I haven't read the Lord of the Rings series and wouldn't consider myself an avid fan, but I thought The Hobbit was very entertaining once it picked up its pace. Although I thought the beginning was a bit slow, the book is full of great adventures and rich imagery. There were times I didn't want to put the book down. I only wish I had the hard cover to enjoy the books and illustrations a bit more (but that's not what you buy a book for anyway). Tolkien is always a genius, so I didn't expect any less."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I started reading it as a test to see how it looked on my tablet. After the first couple hours of reading, I quickly became enveloped in the story. Great characters, fun adventures, unforgettable moments. Definitely a good read for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Exactly what I expected. This is my third copy of The Hobbit that I own and it is a great addition to my collection! Definitely worth the purchase!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really liked the ease of downloading the book that I have been wanting to read ever since the first lord of the rings movie came out. It was well worth the price I paid for it at Amazon for my Kindle Touch."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I arrived at my first reading of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit after first seeing The Lord of the Rings movies when they premiered, and then I followed that by reading the novels. I guess I'm working backwards.What an enchanting little book this is with a language so lyrical it seems to sing! In fact it does sing at times. And you can't help but love Bilbo and his ever-present need to be back home safe in his hobbit-hole, cradling a good cup of tea.The story format is episodic, which makes sense for an adventure quest and I suspect is also a product of when it was written, but the narrative feeling of \\"this happens and then this happens and then this happens\\" disconnects the tale a bit. I'm probably being too nitpicky. The Hobbit is timeless good fun so don't miss out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I got hooked on this book last year when I read it, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the lotr. I myself have never been a huge lotr fan, but I think that may change! This say this is a beautifully written classic, even after years of loving Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm not going to try to pretend that I can write something very original on this literary gem. The only way to describe the joy it gives is to give a nice copy to the other party and let her read the book, or rather let her enter the wonderful world created by Tolkien. I'm impatiently waiting for my son to grow up, so that I can read this to him. I don't know who'll enjoy Tolkien's world more, he or I, but I'm sure we'll come across this masterpiece more than once. And who is to complain, anyway?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book twice, once a few years ago and again this past summer for my English class. I learned something new each time I read it; the elements in this book can teach a person a lot about life and human nature. This is definitely a must-read classic!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Maybe 1 star is a little low for this book...should have given it like...2, but there are just better books. how can this be the best if there is better? i reccomend a better book like Harry Potter(1-4)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"one day while sitting in my class at school, we watched a movie. instead i chose to read The Hobbit. it should have been good right? after all...it is so famous. i soon learned i was wrong. what a horrible book. do not read it. forget about all the other reviews. they just think bilbo the bimbo is hot. (however they could think that...) STUPID BOOK! id rather be forced to read the story of how grass was given the name grass."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Yes, I had to read this book in school. It was very very boring. It was about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He went on a big andventure with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I didn't read this collector's edition, but I don't think there is much difference."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After writing LotR Tolkien should have hunted all of his Hobbit books and burnt them in a giant bonfire.This book tells about the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and a number of Dwarves (I can't remember the actual number, because all the dwarves were so similar).This book is so silly, juvenile and ridiculously written that it is completely unprecedented.People are defending this book by saying that it's a childrens' book unlike LotR. Well here's some news for you. There are some actually good childrens' books out there.Not all would doom this 1 star, but no way would this book be receiving so many 5 star reviews unless it was written by Tolkien.I'm not saying someone couldn't like it, but from any sane point of view it just isn't *good*. Period."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Warning: Don't read this book. It'll scare you from reading any other book The Hobbit stinks. The Hobbit is terrible. The Hobbit is down right boring. It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb. It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit. Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure. All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home. While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring. He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea. The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow. To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends. I strongly recommend that you do not read this book. I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together. Unless you want to be bored to death, do not read the famous The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book in my literatuure class and I fell asleep a lot.(If I wasn't sleeping then I wasn't paying attention). I thought it was a crappy book. It appears that most people on this review list like it but I DON'T!!! This was a dread to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Unfortunately, I was subjected to read the first twenty or so pages of this book because I got it as a christmas present from my aunty. Not only that, I also received a compendium with the rotten book, which was of no use to me as I was not planning on ever reading it. Feel free to email me if you want this huge waste of time for free, though I strongly recomend you don't! This is a dangerous book and is an extremely bad influence on adolescents. Not only that, it is also more boring than having tea with nan and the relatives.DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wow .. this is the worst book I've ever read!! I would NEVER ever tell anyone to read this! It's just so weird and BORING. Don't waste your money! AHH .. I hated this book with a passion!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know for a fact that there are several of Hobbit fans. Though personally, I hated the first book and the entire series. Most of these people who've reviewed books by Robert Jordan, claim that his series is just another set of stories based on the writing of the Tolkien series. Many of my friends seem to agree with me that this story was a total bliss. Bilbo is a Hobbit who seems not to do much in the story. Of course, the whole meaning of him being their, is to keep the story revolving around a world of addiction. The ending of the story is horrible and it seems that Tolkien wasted his POOR and SENSELESS usage of his brain. No offense, but the suspense was not at all amusing and you felt as if you wanted the book to end on the first page. Bilbo practically does nothing to defeat the vicious (funny word to use here), dragon, Smaug. Surely this book was a waste of energy. The intricate details which are suppose to consist within this &quot;story&quot; are no where to be seen. The book does not unwind itself to a twisting and strange plot, but clearly a purposeless one. I despise and loathe this series tremendously. Bilbo is not exactly the character which you would find addicted to. He stammers and is basically a coward. Dwarves. Now where have I heard this word babled by little five year olds? Oh, that's right, Snow White and the Seven DWARVES! For the dwarves in the story, remind you very much of the ones in the Disney classic. Idiotic and Irritating. This book is a story of your everyday savior (supposedly Bilbo) having adventures and slaying a dragon. So it's like your medieval classics of a prince saving his beloved, only with a more dull and tasetless...yawn. Excuse me. Just remembering that I read the book makes me just faint in exhaustion. What was I drinking when I decided to read this piece of junk? And like all stories, there are monsters and strange happenings. Flipping through the pages, the words &quot;been there, done that,&quot; echoes through your crying mind. Crying because the story will NOT END! Agghhh! Gandalf the wizard is a bogus, he does absolutely nothing that would benefit to anything worth mentioning. Come to think of it, Bilbo reminds me of a pig. Small, always desiring food, foolish, cowardly, lazy...I can go on forever. Also, the series is quite poorly written. The words used remind me of the time when I picked up my first book around the age of four. Take my word for it, this is not the sort of book which makes you read till past your regular bedtime. One more things on the dwarves. They are useless characters and this story makes me want to vomit. No originality whatsoever is involved and the pages make me wish I was not even in existence. There you have it. I wouldn't even give this book a star, but since that was not an option, I had to settle for a WHOLE star. I'm just glad this guy's dead. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Why people claim to enjoy this book I'll never know. The writing style doesn't flow, the characters aren't particularly all that well developed, and the storyline isn't all that interesting. This is a prime example of what happens when Star Trek and Star Wars dorks pick up a book. They see the word &quot;wizard&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot; and get all gooey with excitement and think it's great literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had forgotten how well-written this book was. Nice use of foreshadowing. Very evocative descriptions of nature. And Bilbo was much smarter and helpful than I had remembered. People sometimes think of hobbits as comic characters, but they are really &#34;Everyman&#34; and Tolkien obviously wanted their virtues to be emulated. A book enjoyable by both children and adults."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Every time I picked up this book I it took me to a wonderful place of imagination i would recommend it to anyone with the love for tales involving these types of characters."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read the Hobbit several times, but it is always a wonder. Although written for children, you can always sense the depth of history and place that is the backdrop of this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What else is there to say? You can't go wrong with this one, it's got everything you could want from a adventure story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that loves the Lord of the Rings books or fantasy. It feels like the author is telling you the story. A unique style of writing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is for the 5 disc BBC dramatization of The Hobbit, with the white cover, ISBN 1620641135. There is a newer release, with a yellow cover, that packages this version of The Hobbit (1968) and The Lord of the Rings (1981) together with some bonus material. This is a full-cast audio drama originally developed for radio, not an audiobook. There are 8 episodes clocking in at a little under half an hour each.***This is a much-beloved adaptation with some serious flaws. It's easy to forget that it will be half a century old in a few years. It is presented in frequently abrasive mono sound, with dated effects, a few questionable casting choices, and more than a few questionable music choices.So why bother?Bilbo - that's why. Paul Daneman's Bilbo is clever, bumbling, endearing, and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious. In short, he is the perfect gentlehobbit. Much like Bill Nighy's Sam in the later Lord of the Rings radio production, Daneman is the overt inspiration for Martin Freeman's recent take on Bilbo in Peter Jackson's movies. Freeman does a great job, but the similarities are striking. In the end, Daneman's subtlety and sharpness set him apart as the greatest Bilbo interpreter.The rest of the cast for the most part dives in with great relish. There are unfortunately two glaring misfires: Gandalf and Gollum.Heron Carvic's Gandalf (interestingly pronounced \\"Gandalv\\" by most of the cast) is played as a sneering elite with a nasal drone. It is so vastly different from the great interpretations of Hordern and McKellen that it will probably take you out of the story the first few times he opens his mouth. Carvic is at least a perfectly serviceable actor, even if badly miscast, so you eventually get used to it.I can't really say the same for Gollum. Gollum is a tough character to play in an audio format, and even the fantastic later radio production of Lord of the Rings cannot escape the issue. Wolfe Morris hits the notes of manic schizophrenia just fine, but it is a screeching performance that is poorly served by the presentation. The audio is neither mixed nor compressed too carefully, so the dynamics allow Gollum's piercing wail to rise above the normal levels like a blaring commercial in the middle of a sedate TV show. The mastering leans heavily treble for the sake of clarity as well, due to technological issues with both the transmission and reproduction of radio programs at the time. In crisp digital audio on CD, it does Gollum no favors.Thankfully, Gollum is not in the story for long, and Gandalf's visits become more and more believable as the story draws on. Bilbo is there all the while, however, and his charm is a rock solid foundation for the rest of this aged, flawed, but ultimately delightful production."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I FIRST read the hobbits 47 years ago and I'll never tire of it.

It's an old friend for the same reason that Dickens' &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; and Pratchett's &#34;Guards! Guards!&#34; always end repeatedly up on my reading list. The settings are interested enough, the character development is adequate, and the prose is satisfactory. But these authors have a wealth of personal knowledge of language, metaphor, and/or the human condition that makes the reading not only fun, but an adventure in satire, sociology, semiotics, history, and philosophy. Granted, of Tolkien's works, this is the most childlike; however, that also makes it the most accessible, and perhaps the closest to the heart. Top ten in my all time favorites list for good cause."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitIf you watch the movie before you read the book you will enjoy the book better then the movie"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Fun book, I enjoyed it more than the movie though the movie was still entertaining.

No need to review the literary works here. The Collector's edition is the way to read the story in my opinion. The 50th Anniversary is very similar as I can tell, but I prefer the green to the gold in addition to the green marbled page edges. The usual 5 of Tolkien's original watercolor artwork are resorted to their full color version and all the black and white pictures of the original version are now printed in black and green. Likewise, the maps are in black and green and in the front and back of the book.I was tempted to get the annotated version, which looks intriguing for long-time fans, but as I no longer had an original copy this felt like the right choice for now. I may buy the Annotated Hobbit down the road, although for now this one is perfect."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of those stories that most people have read at one time or another in their lives.

Tolkien, 1.The fellowship of the ring 2.The two towers and 3.The return of the king. hope you like it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book written for all ages to read. It is filled with a multitude of characters; from short, plum hobbits, to gigantic, black spiders. There are adventures at every turn, and encounters with unexpected, and un-invited visitors. I enjoyed every venture in the book; from the songs of the dwarves, to the battle of five armies.One especially strong part of the book was how easy it is to read. The chapters are so interesting; it's not hard to follow the story at all. An example of a remarkable event is one minute Bilbo is fighting off huge, hairy spiders, and the next, he is sneaking into an Elf village ( page 157-172). The exciting events flow so well to one another, it was hard for me to put the book down. Another reason The Hobbit is so easy to read is the fascinating storyline and characters. The whole story revolves around a collection of bizarre characters; hobbits, dwarves, wizards, elves, and their adventure to find and slay a dragon. Their party is faced with many other terrifying villains before the dragon too. Like when they stumble upon the goblins' caves unexpectedly; they are brought to the Goblin King, who is huge, ugly, cruel and shows no mercy. Sections like that are definitely page turners. The flowing plots, storyline and characters are just a few of the many reasons to read The Hobbit, but there are many more too good to give away!I would definitely recommend this book to others, for many more than the basis I've acknowledged before. One big reason I recommend this book is that it isn't written to just one age group. Any age can enjoy following a mere hobbit Bilbo, outwit Gollum (page 80), or sneak up on a treacherous dragon's lair (page 211). A seven year old or a twenty seven year old can find pleasure in reading of courageous tales like that. And although anyone can enjoy The Hobbit, one thing that can help a great deal in reading this book, is good imagination. Imagination is needed in certain places, like when a character like Gollum is described, or when reading what the Misty Mountains look like in the sunset. So if you cant imagine or don't believe in what you're reading, it spoils the book. There are lots of mysterious, unbelievable events that take place in this book, that any-aged person with a good imagination can take pleasure in.In my opinion, this book is a classic, and of its own time. From short, bearded dwarves, to gigantic, jewel-covered dragons, the book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure, and is a definite page turner. If anyone's looking for an enticing book that no on will want to put down, The Hobbit is the choice by far."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Unfortunately I never this book as a kid, or in school; but in a way I am glad that I didn't. I think that I can appreciate it more now that I am older. I'm 26 and this is the first time I've read this wonderful novel. I did get to see 'Lord of the Rings' before reading it, but it only helped to enhance my imagination and awe of the world that Tolkien has created. It's too bad that they didn't make this one into a full motion film; I would love to have seen the \\"Battle of Five Armies\\" on the big screen.I've also purchased the collectors edition of 'Lord of the Rings' and I plan to read that next!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story &quot; The Hobbit&quot; is written by John R. R. Tolkien.

I was wrong! It was better than the Harry Potter books I think. It is really interesting! I want to start reading the other books in the series soon. I think the hardest part about reading this book is keeping the names straight. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had a hard time coming up with all these names! There is a lot of fighting in this book. I would suggest this book to readers who like challenging books and for readers who like fantasy and wars. This book is long, but never boring!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was brought up to me just before the Lord of the Rings came out. I have heard about it before dating back to my childhood and I have never really been interested in it's sort. I hated fantasy to be frank, but I decided to pickup the book and give it a whirl, I was hooked, if you don't want to spend money buying 12 or 13 books about Middle earth, don't read this book because it sparks imagination even adults can relate to, and it is hard to put down because Mr. Tolkien leads you with a carrot, and keeps it in front of your face and only lets you nibble through the whole journey, and by the time you are done you have eaten the carrot, and fallen in love with the book. I recommend this book even if you have seen the movie because it gives some good background, but it is just one of the most intertaining books that I have read in a long time! I got hooked, and I am willing to bet that it just might hook you too!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting. When I started to read the book I learned that this was true. I also started reading this book because I heard the name Hobbit in a movie commercial for the lord of the rings. I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.The main character is Bilbo Baggins. This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well, i found it. a very good renbition of the hobbit. buy it"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"TOLKIEN IS WONDERFUL!

The book is a prequel to 'The Lord of The Rings' however it is not quite as dark as that series, this story is much more beautiful and light hearted. you will find yourself laughing with and growing attached to the characters within the book.I would recommend this book to all ages, and i do."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This will be my third reading of The Hobbit.

It is much better that the BBC audio, which has a lot of distracting background music. These audio versions have been perfect for my 10 year old, who loves the story, is very intelligent, but has some reading difficulties. But... I am glad I did not just jump in and purchase this. I was an Audible customer for years, and they provide a wonderful service for those who can afford to buy the audio downloads. If I were getting an audio version to listen to myself, I would be going to my local library that has a copy with Rob Inglis reading the book. He is simply the best. As I pointed out earlier though, this is for my 10 year old who does seem to follow along better with a cast of charterers reading the parts. So I was able to get for free, the download threw my local library on Neibors. Now he has the chance to listen to the story, I didn't have to pay for a thing, and my library is justified in providing this service to its patrons. Win, Win!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, I read this book initially because it was required in my English class. I really thought I was going to hate it... But, I didn't! I was so surprised. Every book I've ever read in English has been boring, but this one was really good.Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit (obviously) who likes to stay in his little Hobbit hole and stay to himself. He likes so smoke his pipe, eat, clean, and take naps. His life style does a complete 360 turns when Gandalf arrives and tells Mr. Baggins he will be accompanying the 12 dwarves to go defeat the dragon called Smaug, and take back the land that was one the dwarves. Bilbo doesn't believe him at first and soon enough he got sucked into the whirlwind adventure.All of the adventures in this book keeps you on your toes, I was like what's going to happen next??? I tried not to \\"read ahead\\" or appear too \\"anxious\\" to find out what happened so everyone wouldn't think I was a total nerd lol. My favorite adventure that they took was through the Mountain were Bilbo was knocked out and left behind... This part was so creepy, I kept thinking BILBO GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THERE!!! Overall this story is fun, adventurous, and a great change of pace. I went into this book with really low expectations and came out really enjoying it.I really enjoyed how Bilbo's character grew as the story progressed. He didn't think he was fit to be a Burglar at the beginning and by the end he was confident and an amazing Burglar... I really didn't think he would have had it in him lol. I love all of the characters! There are some that are more \\"known\\" than others, but they are all likeable in their own way :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Possibly one of the greatest works of fiction ever written, it's only rivals are were authored by the same man."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am almost embarrassed to admit this, but as of recently I had never read The Hobbit. I got this beautiful edition for Christmas and settled in to let Tolkien's amazingly magical world of Middle Earth open up before my eyes. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for his own children, but even though it is supposedly a children's book it sweeps adults up as well and holds them in its spell through the entirety of Bilbo's fascinating journey.It is rare that a \\"children's book\\" is considered a prologue to an adult book, The Lord of the Rings (always considered by Tolkien as one book and not a trilogy). I am very glad I read The Hobbit first because it gets the reader acquainted with Middle Earth, and several characters and places are mentioned and continued in Lord of the Rings. At only about 300 pages The Hobbit is a fast and delightful read, and when you are finished you will probably do as I did and immediately begin reading and enjoying the incomparable Lord of the Rings.Although the films are good, Tolkien's imagination has to be experienced firsthand to be believed, and it all starts here with The Hobbit. Do yourself a favor and don't wait for years like I did to jump into the world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great read before reading Lord of the Rings. It gave great detail and information on Mr. Bilbo that helps the plot in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Quite a number of five-star ratings have been heaped on this book, and I don't think it's terribly shocking to add mine to the pile. However, those familiar with my somewhat critical reviews of the Lord of the Rings series may ask why, exactly, I rate the Hobbit higher. After all, most people in the modern age tend to almost ignore the Hobbit in favor of Tolkien's later trilogy on the war of the ring. Part of this, of course, can be attributed to the movie version, but what is it about the Hobbit that makes it so special?I honestly think that the way people ignore the Hobbit may have something to do with its difference in tone from the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit contains stronger fantasy elements, such as being attacked by a horde of giant spiders, burned almost to death by a dragon, or having boulders thrown at you by the giants in the mountains, and yet, it treats them all perfectly casually, whereas later books would have felt the need to explain these strange happenings. The Hobbit only explains things like this when they're unique, even for Middle Earth. It doesn't take itself as seriously as LOTR did, which actually added to my appreciation of it.It's a story about a small, peace-loving fellow named Bilbo Baggins, and how he goes on an exciting adventure with the old wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves; refugees from the Lonely Mountain, which is now inhabited by the ferocious dragon Smaug. They have many adventures before, after and during their incursion into the mountain, and Bilbo gets to show his mettle as a burglar, a fighter and a treasure-hunter. There are tragedies and battles over the course of the book, and eventually, Bilbo becomes more of a man, and receives honor, riches and the suspicion of his friends and neighbors for doing something so \\"unexpected.\\"The goblins, the spiders, the elves, the dragon, giants, Beorn, the dwarves and so on and so forth. It was good, clean fun, and I loved it all. Men factor into this book, but not nearly as much as in the Lord of the Rings, so by and large, this book is about fantasy in its purest form; fantasy people going on an exciting adventure, learning lessons about themselves and their world, doing incredible things, meeting interesting people, and finding themselves well-rewarded for all their hard work. It's the essence of the fantasy story.Even Bilbo's job as a burglar rarely leads him into doing anything questionable. Yes, he sort of stole the Ring, but Gollum wanted to kill him, so it was his only means of survival. Defending one's survival is enough of a reason to justify this. The same can be said of the meals he stole in the elf prison. The treasure they took from Smaug was really theirs anyway, so it wasn't stealing, as much as taking what was rightfully theirs, and as for the Arkenstone...The Arkenstone. That's an aspect of the story I found puzzling. Bilbo does eventually justify this by ransoming his share of the treasure in exchange for it, so I guess it's just fine morally. Still, I did find it something of an interesting moral dilemma when I first read this book, which, I guess, just makes the story even better, when you think about it.I also found the battles exceptionally-good and well-written. They were described about as well as in later works, but I found them more interesting, on the whole, because of the way the movements and actions of the enemy forces were described. They're the sort of battles that one can actually picture in their mind. Not myth-making battles, like the Shelob fight from the Two Towers, perhaps, but certainly very believable ones once the fantasy elements are taken for granted.It's really hard to write a story about a hired thief who never really does anything morally wrong, and yet, under analysis, the Hobbit seems to be just such a book. A rare and special type of book indeed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is actually one of my favorite books.

Tolkien has always been successful of invoking; it is a tale that Bilbo Baggins, the most lucky and entertaining beast out of the peaceful Shire to ever save lives, fight evil creatures, and win his way out of getting eatin' alive. I best love The Hobbit for its many attributions to new characters and places rediscovered again. The Hobbit is an equal success as to his famous trilogy and sequel, The Lord of the Rings. The book is excellent, and I don't recommend you to read this book, I order you to take up on its quest and cherish it as a simple hobbit telling fantastic tales, pertaining to one such as Bilbo Baggins of the Shire, would by the fireplace with the kettle steaming in the kitchen waiting for tea-time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Absolutely wonderful reading, you'll never lose interest. A must read before reading The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Just a short note re build quality of the book, rather than a review of the story everyone should know.This hardback edition features a strong stitched spine with no visable glue (so you can open it right out without worrying about damaging the spine) , fantastic quality thick paper pages printed with easy to read lettering, loverly colour prints by Alan Lee, a colourful embossed dust jacket with the main cover embossed with a silver dragon and Hobbit titled spine.

Tolkien and the land of Middle Earth but beware of evil like orcs, dragons, goblins, and Belroc a demon from another world. Not only are these things deadly but the land itself can also be filled with traps and other twists and turns. But fear not, for there are people who try to defend Middle Earth from such things, such as the elves of Elrond, dwarves of Morlia and other men of Middle Earth. Take the trip with a little hobbit name Bilbo Baggins and read about all this and more adventures in The Hobbit by J.R Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My introduction to the world of J.R.R. Tolkien 5 years ago, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is magical tale that will delight audiences of all ages. It is a classic, relatively easy to read, fantasy tale by the author who helped to define fantasy writing for modern times. Telling a story of how one small individual makes a BIG (especially in view of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;) impact on the world, this story is an inspiration as well as a captivating story. I recommend it for threefold reasons:1)It is an excellent fantasy story2)It is an inspirational story3)It is a great way to become acquainted with the work of the master fantasy writer, J.R.R. Tolkien"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tired of all those romance novels? Looking for a book full of adventure? Ready to leap right into the middles of a world full of magaic, danger, wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, dragons, and little people no taller than three feet? Searching for a book where the hero is the one who appears to be unlikely or unworthy of the title hero? Then the hobbit is the perfect choice to fulfill your reading desires. It is a tale of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, venturing out into the great big world. He takes risks, makes new life long friendships, and grows more mature and wise on his journey. Just when you things can't get possibily any worse, they do. The book presents a life learning lesson, that life isn't worth living if you don't explore it and get out into the world. In doing so you are setting goals for yourself, you never know what to expect but in the end you are a better person for getting out there. I thought this book was great! I recommend it, if one has the patience and the understanding to read it. It is the book right before The Lord Of The Rings. It introduces some of the characters in the up coming books. Tolkien is an extraordinary author, his words put me right in the story. The images were brought to life through is his words. This book is a must. However, let me warn you that once you get started you're hooked."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins, the hero of the book, is hurried out of his home by the wizard Gandalf. He went through many fantastic adventures with his dwarven companions who view him as nothing more than useless luggage. He slowly earns thier respect and survives a world too large for a hobbit.

And I read them in order, starting with the Hobbit, and continuing with the three LOTR books. Among the four books, this is probably the most boring of them all, with dozens of characters, many with titles, a lot of side stories in the plot, a lot of text used for descriptions of scenery, and a lot of repetition. For those uninitiated with the lore and legend of Middle Earth, this book comes across as just another story of dragons, elves and dwarves set in a land that was probably medieval England post-Roman Empire. And there are the occasional songs and chants that break up the text. But the most important part of the story is the ring, which sets up the three Lord of the Rings books. The length and wordiness of the book puts it beyond the reach of most younger kids. Personally, I hope this book gets turned into a major live-action movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought this book was an okay book.

GREAT JOB"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'll be honest. It's pretty much impossible for me to really review J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Tolkien's 1937 prelude to The Lord of the Rings is my favorite book, ever, and has been ever since I first read it upon my father's recommendation when I was twelve. Since then, I've re-read it more times than I can count. However, with this read, I've done something new - I listened to the fantastic audiobook rendition read by Rob Inglis. So, I'll be focusing on that.Many readers, especially fantasy fans, are already familiar with The Hobbit, and even those who don't fit those categories are likely to know the basic premise with the recent first film in Peter Jackson's three part adaptation of the novel. So, I'll only briefly discuss the novel itself.The hobbit of the title is Bilbo Baggins, a well-to-do and - on the surface - boring hobbit of the Shire. To Bilbo's surprise, the wizard Gandalf recruits Bilbo to join exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield and his company of twelve dwarves in reclaiming their home and treasure at the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, the terrible dragon who conquered the Mountain many years ago. Of course, even getting to the Mountain is no small task, and Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and company have many exciting adventures.In Recorded Books 1991 production, narrator Rob Inglis delivers a masterful reading of The Hobbit. It's a rather challenging book, when one reflects that it contains dwarves (thirteen of them!), elves, men, goblins, trolls, spiders, wargs, Gollum, and a dragon, all with major speaking roles. Inglis does a fantastic job of giving each character a unique voice while also making them recognizable as one of their kind. No small task, that, but on top of it, Tolkien includes a great deal of singing and poetry in The Hobbit, and Inglis even sings like dwarves, elves, or goblins.This production was recorded a decade before Jackson's Lord of the Rings films and two decades before The Hobbit films, so Inglis never imitates the well-known actors when creating his voices but uses his own excellent interpretations of the characters. Inglis also recorded The Lord of the Rings for Recorded Books. I'm sure that will be excellent as well, and it's next on my listening list.This unabridged recorded of The Hobbit runs approximately 11 hours, and is a full telling the book as written, and not one of the various dramatizations produced over the years. As such a fan of the original book, I'm happy to have found this unabridged and well-narrated but not dramatized edition.I highly recommend The Hobbit as a novel to anyone, and am currently reading it to my children. Fans of The Hobbit or audiobooks will be very pleased with Rob Inglis' performance of the novel. The Hobbit is a classic well worthy of the name."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Love the lord of the rings books. I wanted to reread before seeing the movies.

I must say that so far, after viewing the first movie, I was correct in my first assumption. It will be interesting to see where the breaks will now take place between the next two movies and if it follows my guess. I also hope to see some things left out of the Lord of the Rings being addressed, but not to the detriment of the timing of the storytelling.

It was so good because they kept having many different adventures. So you never knew if they would die on this adventure or make it through to the next.This book also had to have a lot of time put in to it so I think that any one would like this book with all its adventures and magic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was one of the first fantasy books I was exposed to when I was younger, and even at that time I was mesmerized by the world of the Hobbit. The main characters were believable and down to earth, yet the story itself was epic. As a stand alone story it is a wonderful read, but when combined with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it makes for what I consider to be one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time. I reread these stories at least every 2 years, and it never ceases to capture my interest and stimulate my imagination. If you've never read it, do so now. If you've tried it once and didn't like it, give it a try again. One thing this story requires is a little patience. But don't most things that enrich our lives?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A perfect example of how great authors can transport us to a place that is so much ours but also very different.

It was a rage at the time, so many many many people thought it was a good book.Its a general rule that everyone has to read the Hobbit at least once in their lifetime. They have to. And for those who thought it was horrible-Youre comparing the first book of the genre to other books, such as the Wheel of Time, The Magic of Recluce, Wizards First Rule, etc etc.Keep in mind, everyone who loves fantasy owes a huge debt of gratitude to Tolkien. Without him, there would be no other books of fantasy that everyone has come to know and love."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy almost a decade ago and recently decided to read The Hobbit. The story was engaging and fun. I was disappointed that the story did not go more in depth regarding the elves, Beorn, and the lake people.

I suppose this isn't a fair expectation because The Hobbit was written first, and I only hoped for these things because I read The Lord of the Rings first."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"JRR Tolkien is the author of all authors.

JRR Tolkien has created a masterpiece with his world that he created for the Hobbit, LOTR, Children of Hurin, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.The amount of detail and historical chronologies are absolutely amazing.

I saw the movie Monday, downloaded the book on Tuesday and I've finished it on Sunday.My comments are about the Kindle edition. All in all it is not bad - it contains the line-drawing illustrations through the book, which is lovely. But the maps are disappointing. The map of the Wilderlands is at the back (fine in a paper book but awkward in a Kindle) and I completely missed Thror's map at the front - for some reason when I downloaded this book it started me out in the Author's Notes section, so I didn't see the cover, table of contents, or map until after I finished and went looking for it. Maybe this was just a glitch on my Kindle but watch out for it.Both maps, sadly, are almost impossible to read on a small Kindle (can't comment on how they'd look on a Kindle Fire etc). You can't see any of the detail and you can hardly read most of the words. It's not like you can't follow the story without the maps, but part of the joy of Tolkien is poring of his maps.I would give the book itself 5 stars, but the Kindle edition gets 4. It is one of those classic books that you really must own in good old-fashioned paper form, and I have a copy of my own at home. Only buy the Kindle edition if, like me, you're on the road when you have a hankering to read it again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read the book before and have seen the filmI got a Kindle from &#34;Santa&#34; this year and The Hobbitwas my first book to read on it - in a word brilliant"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The audio adds interest to the book and brings the author's voice to the listener.

He was frustrated (yet proud) when I couldn't wait for the next night to hear more and began to read it on my own.I have read The Hobbit at least 50 times since then, understanding the story in a different way at each age (I am now 23.) I am just as sucked in by the creatures' adventures as I was when I was young. I have to be in a certain mood to read the rest of the Lord of the Rings series, but I can always read the Hobbit.I am studying to be a teacher and I recently used The Hobbit in a mock lesson demonstrating a teaching strategy to my peers. I would love to use The Hobbit when I have my own class. I think the story is exciting and scary and appeals to elementary and high school students alike. There is much &quot;SAT vocabulary&quot; that I believe ought to be in a person's everyday usage. I was sorely disappointed when my classmates did not understand such words as &quot;repose&quot;, &quot;requisite&quot;, and &quot;defrayed&quot; which appeared in a short note left to the main character Bilbo. The just of the note was that his friends were thanking him for hospitality and accepting his offer of professional assistance; followed by the terms of the business venture. Anyway, my classmates thought that someone in the story had died because one of the terms was that the business partners would pay for Bilbo's funeral expenses if he died and there was no one to pay for them.Complaining about our present educational level aside, I think this book could be used in many ways; discussions of journeys, how spiders spin webs, are there different levels of stealing? what does it take to make a decision that changes your life completely, as well as everyone else's expectations of you, and more.Most importantly, this book is fun for both teachers and students to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hey, this book is awesome!

The characters are well discribed (except the 12 dwarves becuse they would have to write another book they are so complicated! One is fat one is grumpy...

All the good things that I would have said about The Hobbit have already been voiced many times in the positive reviews before this one, so please read some of them for more information about the book. My observation is that the minority of people that disliked the book seem to be very blatantly aggressive in their criticism without providing any substance to support their claims. Perhaps this is the reason so many people have expressed the fact that the poor reviews were not useful to them. I question no one's opinion for what it is, but I do question the way in which they choose to express it. Negative reviews, I think, would be welcome and considered, as long as they were well written and thoughtful, instead of combative and insubstantial in content. The Hobbit is a delightful story, and deserves all the praise it is given in the hundreds of positive reviews here (and many more). Best for children, but good for anyone who likes adventure and lore."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless.

Then he gets visited by a wizard - Gandalf - who invites some friends of his. Without really asking Bilbo about it first. So, one by one, 13 dwarves show up uninvited on his doorstep and eat all his food, and recruit him for an adventure he doesn't want to go on. An adventure to go see an old dragon called Smaug, kill it, and loot its big cave - because that cave, and indeed the whole mountain, used to belong to the dwarf leader's father back in the pre-dragon days.And the rest of the story is about the party and their journey to said dragon-infested mountain, during which we're introduced to dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins and a creepy creature calling itself Gollum, who has a trinket it's quite attached to. Oh yes, and there is plenty of song lyrics as well. I tend to skip those, because they bore me to tears. I could say the same about Tolkien's prose, but then I'd be lying. It doesn't bore me.It annoys me.My first impression when reading this book is that the tone of it feels incredibly condescending. I'm half-expecting to feel Tolkien pat me on the head at times. Just because you're writing to kids doesn't mean you have to talk down to them. That it was written in the 1930s is not an excuse! We could also argue about the overt racism (\\"goblins must be killed because they are goblins\\"), sexism (where are the girls?), or even weightism (Bombur is a \\"fat person\\" stereotype). There are also 13 dwarves for no reason other than that their names are quaint and funny to say because they rhyme. In truth, the only one with half a personality is Thorin. The rest are just fillers.\\"The Hobbit\\" promises much but is just a lot of dwarves and a hobbit faffing about, roadmovie style, except they're mostly on foot. Perhaps revolutionary at the time and it can't be ignored - or stressed enough - that Tolkien sparked a great genre, but I really prefer other fantasy authors than him.2.5 out of 5 riddles."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A childhood favorite, now in a leatherbound edition. It made a great Christmas gift! It came wrapped in plastic, and the quality of the green leather cover was very nice, very presentable in anyone's bookcase/library..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, and very good for you- and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it,\\" Gandalf said. This is how the great adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakshield, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin and Gloin began. The thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and the wizard Gandalf set off to use \`their' burglar (Bilbo) to steal back the treasure of the dwarves of Dale, stolen in the first place by Smaug the dragon. Gandalf leaves the group after they encountered three trolls, stayed at the home of Elrond, got lost in the goblins' lair, rested at the huge house of the man/bear Beorn, and reached the edge of Mirkwood. From there, the dwarves traveled alone and fought giant spiders, were captured by wood-elves, escaped by hiding in barrels, and were greeted and treated very nicely in Lake-town. Then the group traveled to the Lonely Mountain where the treasure was being watched carefully by Smaug. For a long time the dwarves and Bilbo waited until Smaug left and was killed by a Lake-town man. Then the treasure was fought over by dwarves, men, elves, goblins, eagles, and wolves. Finally the dwarf/elf/man/eagle side won the Battle of Five Armies and peace was restored. Bilbo was at last able to return home safely. I disliked the way this book was written, but I loved the story behind it all and I would recommend it to fantasy-lovers.One reason that I disliked this novel is that often the author would complicate simple things. For example, he would write \\"You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it.\\" Really all he needed, though, was- You will find out about it in a few days. The author definitely over used commas in The Hobbit. Sometimes the amount of detail was good, but a lot of instances the detail and description was confusing. One of the possible explanations for my confusion is the length of the author's sentences. For example, take the sentence, \\"The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky.\\" I had to read this sentence a few times before fully grasping the meaning of it. This is just one of the many paragraph long sentences.One thing I did like about this book, though, was the story line and the characters. Once I finished the book I was able to look at the \\"big picture\\" of the story rather than the specific details. I especially enjoyed the part in the book where Bilbo (with his invisibility ring on) talks to Smaug. I also really liked when Bilbo was playing riddles with Gollum because I could guess them, too. I also liked the character of Bilbo. Even though it seems as though there are many characters, Bilbo is the main character so you come to like his clever, kind, curious, and brave ways.Lastly, I really didn't like the amount of violence in this book, especially in the end. The ways the battles are described are frankly quite gross. For example, during the fight between Bilbo and the dwarves against the spiders, one spider is described, \\"Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks...\\" Also, during The Battle of Five Armies, the valley was described as \\"the goblins were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses.\\" These sentences were very disturbing to read.In conclusion, I didn't really like the way this book was written, but I loved the over all story and characters. The novel was violent and sometimes it was very confusing, but I did enjoy some parts of the book a lot. I recommend this book to fantasy loving readers who have a lot of time to read this novel and who don't mind reading about war.-C.

This is one of the best fantasy novels that I have had the pleasure to read. Tolkien's follow-up trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, is just as captivating, and I would recommend it as well. Even though the plot twists and turns every which way, the basis of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is none other than the age-old battle of all that is good and evil.

I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure.

The hero being Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a small dwarf-like humanoid species called a hobbit, a short, fat, uncoordinated, inexperienced, peace loving creature. He is taken on an adventure by an old friend that is leader of the quest and happens to be a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. This quest travels all throughout his world, and experiences many things that no one from his race has ever seen before. He is taken to battle Goblins, meet Elves, fly on the backs of Giant Eagles, and was almost a dinner for three very stupid trolls. Bilbo's reason, or place for being on quest was the title of \\"Burglar\\". He was assigned to steal treasure from the last Dragon alive named Smaug. Bilbo steals the treasure he was supposed to and an enraged Smaug reeks havoc on the city of men below him. After he is slain there is a huge epic battle at the end for ownership of the stolen treasure.

The book has us go on a journey with Bilbo Baggins and The dwarves that include Thorin, Balin, Fili, Ori, and some ten other dwarves and for about half of the way, The Great Wizard Gandalf The Grey. This book has definitely inspired me to go see the movie.

A warning to those who read to their children, the sentence structures are sometimes convoluted and extensive causing a need to read them to yourself before reading them to children.

I loved the humour and the poetic writing and devoured it in 2 sittings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For over fifty years, THE HOBBIT has been a wonderful introduction to the world of literature. The humorous tone and fantastic imagery of dragons, lost treasure, magic rings and swords adds up to much more than mere entertainment for children: they work to present the timeless themes of heroism and identity.By now, the comfortable life of Mr. Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole at the Shire is quite famously well known. Born into a respectable family and inheriting both his home and country gentleman status, Bilbo sees little need for new experiences. So when the wizard Gandalf brings the thirteen dwarves to Bilbo's home inviting him on a quest to recover a treasure from a fierce dragon, they find Bilbo unwilling to take risk. Moreover he lacks the self confidence to test his way of thinking against the wider world.The small hobbit is surprised to find himself running out the door, without any worldly processions, and leaving his home to set out into the unknown. Thus begins one of the motifs running through out the story; in facing the unexpected an individual discovers new strength. Soon he is confronting dangerous trolls and cruel goblins. When the dwarves prove unable to make good decisions or act effectively, Bilbo must go deep into his inner reserve of courage and common-sense to lead his friends to safety. To the surprise of Bilbo and constant delight of readers; with greater danger comes greater resolve and wisdom to do what must be done.Finally Bilbo enters the heart of the Lonely Mountain and pauses to consider this crucial moment; will he go forward with his plan to confront the dragon Smaug, or turn back out of fear. The decision alone in the tunnel is the defining moment in his ability to shape his identity and assert power over his own fate. What is more Bilbo knows it, and going on in that moment reassures his strength of character for the rest of his life.In presenting his classic story of a small, common person finding identity through heroism and grand adventure, J.R.R. Tolkien gave us a powerful way to learn about ourselves. The book was a favorite of mine growing up and has been a major influence in my writing. I hope you will give this book to a young person and share the magic of literature through this extraordinary adventure.[...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an increadible tale about a quiet hobbit of the shire who is swept away on a adventure through mountains and forests who meets elves and other friends and other less freindly creatures like goblins and wolves and spiders. This is a good book and I am sure that if you like this book you will love the lord of the rings series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story starts out with a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who lives at Bag End in a little hole. A knock on the door signals about 13 dwarves, Oin, Gloin, Bombur Bofur, Nori, Ori, Dori, but most importantly, Thorin the king under the Lonely mountains. The dwarves wish for Bilbo to go on a quest to get back the dwarves sacred gold from Smaug, the Dragon. On the way the group encounters goblins, and is trapped by a hungry group of spiders. Bilbo cuts the group free by putting on the ring he found when faced with Gollum, the bad. The ring allows Bilbo to become invisible. Also escaping three very dimwitted trolls by lighting the ends of ripped out trees and shoving the fire at the hungry trolls. On the way the group must pass through the Mirkwood forest, which holds halloucinations, and horrible creatures. The forest is pitch black, and the water can make you instantly fall asleep is drank. Held hostage by Elves, bilbo retrives the keys to the groups cell house, then stuffs them in seprate barrels, allowing them to escape. One night Bilbo talks to Smaug, realizing the only weak spot of the dragon is his left chest. At the end of this incredible story, there is a great war, including eagles, dwarves, elves, and goblins. How the story ends, you must find out but i will tell you Bilbo can now tell great storys, far and wide."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son saw the \\"Lord of the rings\\" movies and hadn't known the first story of \\"the hobbitt\\".

In the book a hobbit (very small people who live in hills underground) named Bilbo Baggins is set to go on an adventure with company of dwarfs that is lead by Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the Mage. They must go deep into the mountains take back their treasure that has been guarded by and Evil dragon named Smog. On their journey they run into a lot of trouble with odd creatures such as goblins and wolves. To find out more you're going to have to read this book.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It was an absolute triumph. There was never a boring moment in this book. It kept clinging to the book because of all the situations going on in the book. This book can suit any reader. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins was a home body who liked to stay in the Shire and mind his own business, but after Gandalf showed up on his doorstep with a group of twelve dwarves, he soon became an adventurous and courageous little hobbit. Bilbo was forced into Thorin's, the king of the dwarves, quest for his treasure that was wrongfully taken from him by the evil dragon, Smaug. On their quest for Lone Mountain, Bilbo and his companions were forced to adventure through mountains and valleys, in which they come across giant trolls, nasty goblins, and enormous spiders. With the help of Bilbo and his magical ring he found while being trapped in the darkness of the mountain, the dwarves defeat these evils and continue on their quest for home and riches. These challenges that Bilbo is faced with help build his character in order to prepare him for the battle with the wicked dragon, Smaug. In the end of the story, it is Bilbo alone who must face Smaug and recapture the mountain, while at the same time keeping peace with the armies of men, goblins, and dwarves.In my opinion, The Hobbit is a well written book that is enjoyable and interesting for all who read it. Though it is a children's fantasy, anyone who begins to read it will find themselves spending endless nights reading until morning due to the enjoyment and anticipation for the next scene. I would have to rate this book a ten out of ten for its creativity and quality of the writing. This story is a classic and a must read for all those fantasy lovers out there. Even if you're not into fantasy, I would have to suggest to you that you pick this book up right now and begin the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and his magical ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hey fans of John Ronald Ruel Tolkien!I would have given this book a six, but alas, there was no rating.

Here is a breif description of it, although, I can't do it a justice!If you could walk into the magical land of J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" you and your senses would be in for a treat. Your eyes could feast upon the rich earth, and the small ,plump hobbits, walking around the roads. As you peer out of your specticales, you would see small market places teeming with business. Perhaps you might see the farmer, bust with the never ending task of tilling his land to perfection. Their wives are singing whilst doing the laundry. Everyone is happy to be alive, in the place of comfort.If you were to put a hand to your ear, you might be able to hear the lone horse( as all but the largest hobbits can't ride them) telling his tale of woe for all to hear. And the old men, smoking their pipes as their rocking chairs creek with age telling each other \\" when I was a lad.....\\"The smoke reaches your nostrils, and you smile, for the smoke smells like pine, a delighful smell in a delightful place.

Like all great art, I see and understand more with each successive foray into Middle Earth. Tolkien's talent is indeed rare, for he possesses that much-sought-after skill of transporting his audience into a world that seems to be quite independent of author and reader alike. Indeed, one's impression is that this world has been and will continue to be whether or not he continues to read, and his position is that of the privileged observer. It is in every regard the most enjoyable type of story. I have no higher praise to lavish than to say that I come to love it more with each reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book! I read it in 6th grade and I thought it was great.

I am rereading this book for the 4th time in anticipation of the movie. This edition of the book is great. It's sturdy, has great binding and is actually a lot more light weight than it looks. I have the same edition of The Lord Of The Rings in red leather with a red leather slipcase and that book is like a dumbbell. Granted, that book is a lot bigger in content and page count, but it's noticeably heavier than its predecessor. I like that the Hobbit is a shorter book and more light hearted in content than Lord Of The Rings. I loved the Rankin/Bass cartoon Hobbit movie, I just love the characters and the story. Traveling through Middle Earth to reclaim treasure from a Dragon is just a great idea for a book. It's so well written, the songs, the poems, the riddles in the dark. This isn't just a children's book as it was once originally thought of, this is a benchmark for modern literature and fantasy. So many pieces of fantasy that I have grown up with and been a fan of have borrowed from this book, and Tolkien's ideas and creations. And for good reason. This and The Lord of the Rings I think are two of the best books of the 20th century, and two of the best books ever written. The Hobbit is my all-time favorite book. If you haven't read it yet, you need to. This edition comes with great illustrations and a decent map to follow the protagonists on their journey to the Lonely Mountain to steal back the dwarven treasure from the great worm Smaug, the Dragon. This is my most highly recommended book to anyone who likes literature or fantasy writing. And this is definitely the best edition you can get, especially for the price."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the book it si still a great read. The download is so fast.

A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Read this first when I was 9 and fell in love with the genre from this point on... Reading it to my own child now... And he's spell bound and I'm thoroughly enjoying the wonderful tale Tolkien spins once again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien created the Lord of the Rings books and then they turned into movies that amazed the world. But, before Lord of the Rings came the Hobbit. The Hobbit introduces Bilbo and Gandalf and all the other people. It's basically the prologue in the Lord of the Rings story. The story starts off with the party Bilbo wasn't expecting. That's why they call it The Unexpected Party. This only introduces the dwarves, Bilbo and Gandalf.After that, it's trolls, dragons and other mystical beings. Unsurprisingly, Bilbo and the dwarves can slay or escape all of them. But actually, it is kind of a surprising storyline. You won't know what is gonna happen next. But, why is this book good? Well.........The storyline is awesome and unpredicatable.You'll learn to like most of the characters, unlike some other stories I've read.Very big detail lets you see what's happening in your mind.There's a fat dwarf in it.But, of course, no novel is PERFECT. Just because The Hobbit is good, doesn't mean it's the best. Why would this book be bad?Well.........The first chapter(Unexpected Party) can confuse you at times.So many characters, you won't know which is which.The book annoyingly makes you flip back to find stuff you've already read. Well, it did with me.Thorin constantly reminds us about his past, which is unacceptably boring.The horrible Barrels Out of Bond chapter goes too far. Barrels swimming across an ocean is NOT exciting.Despite the many things wrong with this novel, they aren't very horrible things. The cons won't take away one star, giving The Hobbit a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As you read along, the adventures faced by Bilbo Baggins and his merry men, it is as if you have been locked up in a cage with just you and this book and you are on the edge of your seat from the moment you pick it up. Reading along there were times when I couldn't put the book down. It was unreal. You may have experienced battles in other books, but compared to little people of 4ft in height fighting against 10ft people you just it is just unbelievable how they manage to overcome them with victory that is all in mind. You have to read the book to understand the detail that the JRR Tolkien puts into these scenes. I have to say that the reason why I gave this book a four out of five was firstly because of the detail. The expressive words used within the book such as \\"He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts h could not scramble on top.\\" The descriptiveness of Bilbo's inability to climb up the tree in the quote is just of the many found in the book. Secondly I am a sucker from adventure stories. If you are like me then this is a book for you. The story goes on and never ends. You are left hanging until the last line. This is a classic in all minds and should not be a book overlooked. It is one for the whole family and I think that everyone should read the series in their lives."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an intriguing tale of a far away land. The book is about a hobbit named Bilbo&#65533;s adventures through Middle Earth. Bilbo runs in to all kind of troubles and in the end has to battle many foes. I think this book is the most exciting book I have ever read.There were no parts I did not like, but I can tell you my favorite part. I guess I would say my favorite part of this book is when Bilbo is in the forest trying to get help from the elves. I think everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The audio book unabridged version by Rob Inglis is fantastic. I was not surprised, because I had listed to his unabridged version of Lord of the Rings before this. My expectations were high and I was not let down.The various voices are very well done and consistent. The voices of the animals (dragon, thrush, raven) are especially well done. The enunciation is very clear and the noise level is very low (i.e., a high quality recording).Having short (e.g., three-minute) tracks is really helpful. The packaging is very good. All around a very professional package."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit, is a masterful piece chock full of mysticism and fantasy. This could easily be considered the epitome of great folklore. While adopting concepts from Greek epics such as Beowulf and other Norse legends, Tolkien continually surprises even the skeptic in us all. It has a series of twists and turns of mischievous deeds and heroicism, unraveling ever so slightly as the reader delves further in.As the novel begins, Bilbo Baggings, the humble, intelligent and often out-spoken hobbit, leads a quiet undisturbed life down in his hobbit hole at Bag End. However, soon enough this character is rudely awakened. And all his surrounding are in upheaval. This is a book of self-discovery and adventure; action and \\"peaceful\\" resolutions. It is an excellent read at any age.Tolkien is an absolute genius in the art of writing a fantastic trilogy or anything for that matter. He even devised an alphabet specifically for these books, a history and map of the lands in which these stories take place. This is and excellent example of fantasy type literature. The reader responds to Tolkien's writings like it is some sort of true happening in the news. This is fantastical writing and should be reviewed as such. Brilliant in all aspects, praise worthy. However, some parts did appear to be lacking. Where often times I found myself flipping from page to page for the action to pick up again. Nevertheless, this novel is few of many that actually places you, time and place, right where it's all happening."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's &quot;Hobbit&quot; is an important precursor story for the &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; trilogy.

It is right in all proportions, smells nice, opens well, printed nicely and have some great illustrations. Great as a gift or a bedtime story read!

Thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit are on a quest to find a hidden treasure, but first they must get past a dragon named Smage.The dwarfs and Bilbbo got caught by giant spiders and were wrapped up in webbing, but Bilbbo cut himself lose with his sword and killed the spiders. Bilbbo cut his friends loose and named his sword STING. The hobbit told the dwarfs to go on ahead so he could head off the rest of the spiders. When Bilbbo came out he saw that wood elves were taking the dwarfs away so he slipped on the ring and followed them to their castle by stealing the key and unlocking his friends. Then he escaped in the barrels.The dwarfs and hobbit got to Smage's cave and Bilbbo was talking. He watched them get locked up. Bilbbo found a way to get out had been. He took a cup and then confronted the dragon with his ring on so he was invisible and he Bilbbo went couldn't be hurt. The dragon thought it was a lake man so he flew to go destroy the town, but when Bilbbo got out, he told a raven to go tell the soldiers that they needed to hit him where the armor had been penetrated. By the time the raven got there, there was only one soldier left. The raven told him and he took his lucky arrow to kill the dragon, Smage.The gold and silver is theirs or is it? When they got to the bottom of the cave there were two armies and they were going to battle over the gold. If you want to find out who gets the gold, the dwarfs, the wood elves, or the goblins read the book The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you're looking for a little background behind Lord of the Rings, this is it. This book introduces the character Gollum and explains how the Ring came to be in The Shire. However, what is enjoyable about this book is its easy readability and there are many injections (in parenthesis) of Tolkien's humour in his narration of the story. Read about the invention of Golf (in a ridiculous way), the riddles between Gollum and Bilbo and the humorous portrayal of Gandalf as an almighty but occasionally vulnerable wizard. There is only one main storyline about Bilbo and the dwarves heading to defy Smaug, the dragon, in order to uncover their lost treasure, but despite this, their journey is interestingly full of ups and downs. Tolkien, once again, proves his immense creativity by placing his characters in absurb and hilarious positions. Even Gandalf, the supposedly dignified wizard, has been reduced to getting cornered high up on a tree or stuffing himself silly on bread, cream and honey. Needless to say, the title &quot;The Hobbit&quot; indicates that the story revolves around Bilbo Baggins and his misadventures.Simply said, this is one book that wants to make you read on and on. The only flaw is that it's a relatively short story and you'll wish for more. Five stars!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an exiting fantasy tale about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit. A hobbit is a small creature who walks around with hairy, bare feet. Bilbo lives a normal, everyday life in the village of hobbits called the Shire, until he is pushed out of his comfortable life by 13 dwarves to join them on a quest to reclaim stolen gold.In the beginning Bilbo has little confidence in himself but as the story goes on he discovers courage in himself that he never believed he had. Their adventure takes many twists and turns as they get closer to their destination, the lair of the dangerous and greedy dragon, Smaug.Bilbo and the dwarves encounter many obstacles along the way including their run-in with three hungry trolls, and their skirmish with a group of huge spiders. If you are curious to find out the fate of Bilbo and the rest of the unforgettable characters, you have to read this book.I thought it was very fun to read and understand more of JRR Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth\\" after being familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

And besides that, it is a fast moving tale of courage, loyalty, and perserverance.The language Tolkien uses will capture your imagination like few other authors are capable of doing.

I have read it three times and the following books twice. I'm planning on reading it again sometime. If there was more than 5 stars then you could truly give it what it deserves! For all those people who gave it one star, well @#$% you! You obviously aren't a fantsy lover and don't know good writting from bad. JRR Tolkien is a fantasy genious. Bilbo's story may seem long and boring at first, but the way Tolkien writes is truly awesome. The only thing I don't like about this book is the fact that it seems to have no point of view, is it 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person? Still: I LOVE THIS BOOK!!

Over protests from our 13 year old and indifference from our 9 year old, I began to tell the tale anew, in the evenings after supper. We are half way through the book, and fresh installments are requested almost every night. The audience is already inquiring about future adventures. The bottom line - this tale teaches lessons about integrity, trust, faithfulness and bravery in a way that children and adults alike can enjoy and appreciate. Lee's excellent illustrations seem to capture the essence of the character or situation. Tolkein set a standard quite early on that few have ever been able to match. Other authors that I also enjoy in this genre? My favorite is Stephen R. Lawhead."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is surelly one of the best books ever. If you will tell someone the name : &quot;tolkien&quot; the first thing he will say is Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, I think that the Lord of the Rings is far much better that The Hobbit, much more good and highlly writen, but The Hobbit is right after. Take a look on the Graphic Novel of it illustraited by David Wenzel, it is so good !"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book to read on your free time. When you start reading you can't stop. The charecters are really realistic. It really seems like there are some little people called Hobbit's live in little dens. It is very adventoruous and action packed. I could read that book again and again. This book has so many details it will blow your mind away. J.R.R Tolkein is a great aouthor and I would like to read more of his books! I just like to say thank-you to J.R.R Tolkein for writing this wonderful book the Hobbit. You shoould read it for yourself and find out the majic in the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than the Lord of The Rings Triology because it was more light hearted and fun, without all of the stark realism and dark foreboding of The Lord of The Rings. I felt as if I had really visited Midle-Earth and gone on an adventure with Bilbo Baggins and his friends. The transformation of Bilbo throughout the book was especially enjoyable for me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book at the beginning didn't interest me until i started to read a little further. Then i realized this was a great children's book after all. The way J.R.R Tolkien made Bilbo Baggins go through so many challenges was very good. It kept me wanting to read on to the next page."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the hobbit is one of the best books i've ever read. It was the first book that ever got me in to fantasy and i just loved it. I have read it many many times and it just gets better every time. I think everyone should read this book. So much happens in it and the story just keeps developing and going on. Its great!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is perhaps the best book of fantasy ever written. It combines timeless characters with an engaging plot to keep the reader interested at every point of the story. Many, if not all, fantasy books now published draw off of Tolkien's classic in one way or another. You will follow Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, and Thorin Oakenshield's band of dwarves on a journey through trolls, elves, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders, and a dragon not to be fooled with, to regain what is rightfully theirs (treasure beyond your imagination). Tolkien's wonderful descriptions of his characters and setting will suck you into the book, and the action/adventure will help you breeze through it (of course, limited use of Tolkien's fifteen invented languages helps too) Simply put: this book is great! No... better than great, superb! outstanding! Stupendous! Buy it! Rent it! Borrow it! JUST READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are between the ages of 12 and 3000 and you have not read this book you must do so now! This is for a variety of reasons. Even if you have no plans on reading the Lord of the Rings series (shame on you!) you should read this book. It is not long at all, roughly 300 pages, and every single one of those pages should be cherished for the rest of your life. All the characters will be loved all the way until the unexpected conclusion. The description is excellent. It doesn't spend 30 pages describing the way a rock has shine in the sun, (such as the owrks of T. Goodkind) but instead takes a surrounding as a whole and polishes it to shine like that rock.The bottom line: Read this now! If you plan on reading Lord of the Rings, you will need to or you won't understand much at all. Also, it is a great book on its own too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. I would recommend it to anyone form age 7 to 107.

If I were an artist, I would try to recapture the magic on canvas. Alas, I am a writer, and a mediocre one at that. Therefore, I can only try to tell you how delightful this tale is. As an adult who loves fantasy and science fiction, I was shocked when I realized that I had not yet read this tale. When I learned that a dear friend was reading it at bedtime to her first grader, I realized that I was long overdue. This is an amazingly delightful story. Aside from its tale, it looks at beings of different backgrounds and their conflicts. Not everything works out perfectly, and the ends don't always justify the means. However, the characters' characters grow, even when their stature does not. This story was written in the 1930s. Other than the lack of female characters, it is absolutely timeless and will still be popular a hundred or five hundred years from now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The introduction to the best story ever written, Lord of the Rings.

It had lots of those parts were you just can't stop reading the book. It has a really good ending. The author put a lot of surprising things in it that I don't want to give away. Mr. Blibo Bagens is my favorite person because he is a really kind hohbit. There is a movie on the hobbit at the library but the book is still a lot more detailed. Have fun reading! !"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first read The Hobbit I was 13 and although I did not fully understand everything and the language was not easy I loved it and finished it in a day. I could not put it down. Now I am older and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a must-read. This book appeals to a wide range of readers, whether they like a good cultural work, a story with lots of poetry, an action-packed novel, or even a novel that pays exclusive attention to details and character personalities! &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is all of those things, and much, much more. Whatever you pay for this book, it will still be a good buy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a very beautiful book, an even more beautiful story.First of all, Houghton & Mifflin have other Tolkien's books Collector's editions:The Lord of the Rings (Collector's Edition),The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)andThe Children of Hurin: Deluxe Edition, which are, all of them, flawless. Besides these, there is several hardcover editions and paperbacks, though not the same finish of the collector's.My point is, there is little you could complain about the collector's editions.About THIS edition: I already had theThe Hobbit (Illustrated/Collector Edition)[There and Back Again], and they are practically the same but for some extra pages telling some of the always interesting story of the editions and the gold for the green color. Nonetheless, I think the green is more close to what the book is made of and I think it looks better, too. Though, they both are very beautiful works.If you want the best edition and don't mind about anniversary ones, I'd say you get the green; it's easier to find and more hobbit like.But, before you decide, take a look at the pretty little 70 anniversary editionThe Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition; it's made just like the 1937 one.The road goes ever on and on..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"That the Hobbit is a great story goes without saying. You are probably wondering if it is worth the extra money to buy this particular printing of the book. Yes it is. This is a very nice copy of the book, the larger size makes it like a coffee table book, but it's not that big. It is still small enough to sit and hold and has high quality, glossy pages. The illustrations are well done and with at least one illustration per chapter it makes it great for reading with kids."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a teacher and frequent Amazon reviewer, I'm often in the position of encouraging others to read books I've enjoyed. However, I came to \\"The Hobbit\\" in reverse fashion: at the recommendation of a ten year old boy. He had to do some convincing, too, as I'm not a fan of fantasy; I'm sure I began \\"Lord of the Rings\\" long ago and put it down.That's how I came to be curled up in a chair on a winter's afternoon, avidly following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. What drew me in? Well, events in this well-plotted novel move swiftly, of course, and the human foibles of the not-quite-human denizens of Middle Earth are surprisingly compelling. I liked the knowing voice of the omniscient narrator, with its winks and nudges, and I laughed at the middle-aged persona of Bilbo as he longs for toast and a warm fire even as he leaves his hobbit-hole further and further behind. What moved me the most, however, was the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. It is a battle that features goblins and Wargs, dwarves and elves, a shape-shifting warrior and eagle platoons, but it is full of human sorrow in the kind of devastated landscape that only human wars produce.Thus, to put it succinctly, unlike my young friend, I read the book as allegory. (I'm a grown-up; I can't help it.) I'm rather glad that I waited so long to enjoy a book that everyone else discovered a long time ago.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wasn't sure if my seven-year old son would enjoy the story of the Hobbit. I certainly *hoped* he would. His reading level isn't where it would need to be to read this book, so I decided to read this to him. I am not disappointed. This is now my fourth or fifth time reading The Hobbit, which I've had four 24 years. With no doubt, reading this to a seven-year old boy has made this absolutely the most thrilling time I've read this. We are barely more than 1/2 way through, so I'm reviewing the experience mainly. My boy asks when we can sit down and read more. He looks like he's ready to fall asleep on the couch but wants me to press on. He pictures himself as the hobbit (being the same size and all), carrying Sting at his side. I try to make as many expressions as I can to read and he reacts to the book. And the mind of a seven-year old catches details that his poor father has missed along the way. I will be sad when we finish this book. This is proving to be a great bonding experience and so I'm paying more attention to every detail in the book and that only increases my enjoyment value of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I finished reading The Hobbit with my 4-year-old today, and I'm honestly sad that we're already through the book. What with the epic scope and the formal writing of The Lord of the Rings, it's easy to forget just how accessible, charming, and even funny The Hobbit really is. At its core, The Hobbit is a simple adventure story - a reluctant hero who accompanies some dwarves on a quest to recapture a dragon's gold - but as with all of Tolkien's work, it's the richness of the world that truly captures the imagination. From arrogant dragons to irritable Elven kings, from greedy relatives to goblin warriors, Tolkien creates a world that you could easily get lost in. But first and foremost, he weaves a great adventure yarn. Here's a story with underground mazes, riddle contests, capable (if a little arrogant) wizards, bizarre creatures, and so much more, and Tolkien ties it all into a compulsively enjoyable read. And, yes, as serious and epic as Rings is, The Hobbit is funnier and more enjoyable. Gandalf gets some wonderfully dry lines, the narrator is a little sarcastic, Bilbo genuinely likeable...I could go on and on. Here's all you need to know: both this 30-year-old and my 4-year-old often read more than we planned on every night, and we were both a little sad to get to the end of it today. And doesn't that really say everything about the lasting appeal and richness of this classic?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book. I'm going to read Lord of the Rings next.

That's my opinion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Everyone has read The Hobbit, and with Peter Jackson's movie under production at this writing, many will be reading it for a tenth or twentieth time.Is The Hobbit a children's book? Yes and no. Keep in mind the man, and the times. Tolkien was a survivor of trench warfare in the World War, the most brutal and dehumanizing form of hate and ugliness mankind had yet devised. He would not have been eager to glorify combat, and indeed the focus is on the adventure rather than the hack and slash.I'll not compare the morals and mores of 1930s Britain to the world of today, except to note that children then were more mature, and adults were less jaded. The Hobbit struck the right balance for the time. In a world without television, Middle Earth was good entertainment.In my re-reading, I found one particular passage very interesting. Recall the scene of confrontation between Thorin Oakenshield's dwarves and the men of the devastated Lake-town. Bard makes an appeal to Thorin for a share of the treasure, citing the damage and death done to innocents and the fact that a good portion of the gold had come from their ancestors. A very stirring case, and the reader finds himself nodding along. \\"Yeah! We gave the dwarves food and shelter, and sang songs about them, and they went up there and got Old Smaug all fired up, and now they're going to keep all the cookies? All we got out of the deal was burnt stumps where our town used to be!\\"*But then Thorin makes his reply, reminding the Lake-men that he himself is the rightful heir to the Kingdom Under The Mountain. \\"You people come marching up here to my house, armed with bows and spears, demanding a share of what is mine? You can leave you weapons at home, and ask nicely, and we might talk. But as it is, you look like thieves and robbers, and we don't negotiate with terrorists!\\"*Both are good arguments, so who is right? It may not be the exact point Tolkien is trying make, but I took from this the thought that forced charity isn't charity at all - that a grudging charity only leads to hatred and bloodshed. The author doesn't answer the question; the standoff is resolved when goblins swarm down the mountain and all sides must unite for survival.Or maybe that is his answer.Read The Hobbit again. It's still as good as it was the first time. And if you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?*I'm paraphrasing, of course."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit.

Considered by many to be a book for children, which indeed it is written to be appealing to children, it is also much more than that, in being a wonderfully enjoyable tale for all ages.Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit approaching middle age, living a respectable, and comfortable life in is little Hobbit hole. Then Gandalf the Wizard, along with thirteen Dwarves, appeared on his door step for tea one afternoon, and after that meeting, Bilbo's life was changed for ever, as was the fate of Middle Earth. Bilbo endured many adventures during his travels with Thorin Oakenshield and his band of Dwarves, as they quested for the enchanted gold of the Dragon Smaug.All in all, a wonderful read, a wonderfully written story filled with magical beings that set the imagination to sparkle.

One morning after a hearty breakfast, the wizard Gandalf arrives, and that's when the trouble begins. Gandalf ends up inviting a flummoxing total of twelve dwarves over for tea the next day. The dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the glory and riches once held by their forefathers, but they need a \\"burglar\\" to help, and hobbits are small, stealthy creatures.Bilbo joins their party on a whim after being teased by the dwarves and praised by Gandalf for his yet-unknown abilities. He soon regrets his decision when the rolling fields past his home turn into a dark, foreign country, and he doubts that he has what it takes to carry out an adventure of this magnitude.As Bilbo meets (and is captured by) trolls, goblins, wolves, spiders, and wood-elves, he begins to use his practicality to his advantage; when engaged in riddles with Gollum under the mountain, for instance, his wit saves him from a very unfortunate end. And he puts his riddling skill to use with Smaug the Dragon as well, using their conversation as a chance to scope out the dragon's weakness.Happy scenes are interspersed throughout the tale to keep Bilbo from despairing entirely; they rest at the Last Homely House as the guest of a friendly elf, the noble eagles of the mountain come to their rescue more than once; they find a faithful friend in Beorn, who is usually gruff and wary of visitors; and the men of Lake-town herald their arrival to oust Smaug the Dragon from the dwarves' ancestral mountain.But more often than not--and certainly more than he would like!--it is small, hearth-loving Bilbo who ends up saving the day, when he and his friends are faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Bilbo grows from a homebody to a hero with \\"a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck.\\"AnalysisThe Hobbit is one of the best books I've read all year.I know. I know! People have told me all my life that I need to read The Hobbit. But I always protested, claiming that I didn't like fantasy because there wasn't enough reality in it to \\"connect\\" to. Where I got this idea, I don't know--possibly from my brothers' fantastical explanations of Tolkien's books, which sounded far too removed from me to be interesting.As it turns out, The Hobbit is so widely regarded by readers of all stripes because of its humanity, its down-to-earth humor, and its realism. Who would've thought? (Everyone but me, I suppose.)As Michael D.C. Drout explains in The Modern Scholar: Rings, Swords, and Monsters: Exploring Fantasy Literature, applying Marxist theory to the story helps to understand its appeal: Bilbo represents the bourgeoisie, the trolls are members of the Cockney-accented working class, and Smaug the Dragon is the ruling class, literally rolling in riches. Tolkien himself was certainly no stranger to literature and theory, with a history of Anglo-Saxon epic poem translation under his belt. He incorporates themes common to Middle Age conquests while also sprinkling the book with a healthy dose of modern-day humor.Bilbo is an unexpected hero, the everyman who saves the day more than once. Though often he seems primarily occupied with eating breakfast, maintaining a tidy appearance, and yearning for his soft bed far from these dangerous adventures, he keeps a cool head when he and the dwarves seemed faced with certain doom. In fact, Bilbo's practical considerations are often what save them; while the dwarves stubbornly refuse to tell the Elf-King the purpose of their quest, which leads to their imprisonment, Bilbo cleverly rescues them, though his unorthodox methods produce more than a few grumbles among the dwarves.Bilbo is an incredibly likeable character with whom I can closely identify; who doesn't love a second breakfast? On a deeper level, Bilbo's moral ambiguity makes him a realistic hero; when he is bargaining with the men and the elves that are preparing to battle against the dwarves, who have become offensively greedy, he begins by complaining that the entire matter has made him uncomfortable and cranky, and he offers goods stolen from the dwarves to appease the other side.The Hobbit originated as a story Tolkien told his children, and the excellent narrative style and the thrilling twists and turns took me back to the days when my parents would read me bedtime stories. I felt like running from the hulking, humped figures of the goblins, and I shivered at the enormous hairy spiders of Milkwood Forest.Because of its intensely imaginative plot and Tolkien's masterful literary execution, The Hobbit is one of those few books that are equally attractive to kids and adults alike. But you probably already knew that!For more reviews like this one, please visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son(9) received this as a gift from my best friend when he starred as Bilbo (the hobbit) in a dramatic version of this book. All the cast signed it. It is a beautifully bound copy of \\"The Hobbit\\" - a real keepsake. My son proceeded to read the book over the summer. He really enjoyed it. I recommend this book to \\"kids\\" of all ages, especially boys. I recommend this edition to anyone wanting a special copy of this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I hadn't read the Hobbit since sometime in the mid 80's. After watching the Peter Jackson LOTR films, and reading news about Guilermo Del Toro filming the Hobbit I felt the need to re connect with Mr Baggins. I picked up THIS version of a beloved classic. I should mention, that to re read the Hobbit I bought THIS version, leaving my old paperback on the shelf in the closet. This book is simply a treasure, and easily is the perfect adventure story. This is the reason why I wanted to read this anniversary edition of the story, I thought it deserved special attention.The story is great adventure, with Tolkiens ideas layed out in fantastic detail. There are parts of this book, that made me laugh out loud (such as when the Dwarfs yell out at giants playing 'ball' by throwing rocks back and forth during a thunderstorm) and tender moments such as (when Bilbo takes a final look at the lonely mountain to say farewell to the final resting place of three of the dwarfs ) this also marks the end of Bilbo's adventure.Other fantasy characters seemed influenced by Tolkiens writings. Beorn who is a shape shifting wood dweller, more than reminds me of Hagrid from Harry Potter. Hagrid size and nature of how he lives is very similar to Beorn. I cant go on about alot of things in The Hobbit, this review could be as long as the book.Anyway I give the highest recommendation to The Hobbit. A great story by a great writer. Sit down and enjoy the writing of a brilliant author, and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read quite a few reviews here that seem to assume that you (the reader), are well versed in the Lord of the Rings series.Simply put, this book, when compaired to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, almost seem like they were written by two entirely different authors. Perhaps that's why this book is one of my favorites.The Hobbit is a children/young adult novel telling the tale of a small, unlikely hero named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo, known as a \\"Hobbit\\", is elected to play the role of burgler and help a hand full of bearded dwarves reclaim there stolen treasure from the dreaded dragon, Smaug.There are a few things to keep in mind. For one, this book was written well over half a centry ago. The english language has changed a bit over the ages it seems, and perhaps the age range it had been intended for then, will have a little trouble getting through it in our day and age.The second, as mentioned above, is that this book is not wholy in the theme of the Lord of the Rings trilogies. The narration is much more light hearted, even humerous at times. Personally, I argue that this is where the Lord of the Rings failed, with its dry, history text like narration. With the Hobbit, we get the feel of sitting around an old arm chair, while Old man Tolkien gets into his adventure, playing out the roles of the characters, and making the sound effects himself. Simply put... it \\"READS\\" a lot more fun.The Hobbit is also a little different from the Lord of the Rings as it takes the world around it at face value. A few things are explained in great detail, while most of the world at large is only breifly explained. Some people would prefer a greater detail into the world that Tolkien has created. Not all people, however, want a 4 page description on ever characters lineage, or every cities history. For those people, good new, tolkien has a near unlimited amount of text on his invention. For every one else, this book flows a little smoother than some of his other works.I will say that a lot of new readers are turned off by the first chapter. There is a lot of exposition, and it containt a lot of information that won't really make sense to new tolkien readers. My advice, is to push through. The book really picks up, and is one of the most magical, wonderful reads you'll ever get through."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In case this review gets listed for other editions (which sometimes happens) the aisn of the book I am reviewing is 0395177111.This book has a sturdy dark green slipcase with a stylized illustration on the front that looks like one of Tolkien's own drawings of a mountain in the background of a forest. The book cover is slightly fancier than the slipcase and has red and gold letters/language symbols surrounding the illustration repeated from the slipcase. The spine also has beautiful lettering. The book is very substantial and large (1.5 x 7 x 9.5). The text is not too small. The edges of the pages are a mottled green and white color. The book include maps in both front and back, front is a journey/adventure map, back is a geographic map. This is a lovely addition to my Tolkien collection and I am thrilled to have it. The red collectible The Lord of the Rings book is a nice companion to this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not a literary review, this is about the edition/printing only.This is a great paperback. I bought it because it was economical, but ended up enjoying it because it is of exceptional quality. This is NOT a mass-market, stiff as a board, tiny font, drug-store printing. This is a book with sturdy binding and thick matte paper with pleasantly large font type. While it doesn't lay flat on a table when open, it is very easy to hold open in one hand. I love hardbacks, but this paperback was a purchase I do not regret.GREAT BOOK, MEMORABLE JOURNEY WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERS, AND A TOTALLY RECOMMENDED EDITION."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by Tolkien is most definitely one of the best books ever. My Dad first read it to me when I was probably only 7, and I know I will still love it when I'm 100.The edition itself is amazing. The illustrations are by Tolkien, as they should be. The best illustrations in any book are either by the author or by someone the author personally chooses, because the reader can be sure that everything is illustrated as the author imagined it. Many times when an author illustrates his own book, the art is not the best quality, but not in this case. Tolkien was a great and creative artist in addition to being one of the best authors of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our 10 year old and 7 year old sons and their mum are really enjoying this recording every time we get in the car. Mum thinks the reading by Rob Inglis is superb (he uses different voices for the various characters and the narration and also sings). The boys are gripped by the story. This is 10 CDs long so you need stamina. Our four year old son finds it boring because it is so long. Highly reccommended for 7 to 12 year old boys."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had wanted this edition of the Hobbit for several years, and finally found it on Amazon. It is a beautiful book and well worth the reasonable price. It includes some color illustrations done by Tolkien, which really add to the depth of the wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is directed to C. Fletcher. I respect your opinion on the book, but there's a bit of background you need on the Hobbit. Admirably, you are critiquing the book from a perspective that the Hobbit wasn't written from. It wasn't meant for the masses or even meant to be an adult book. The Hobbit was written by Tolkien as a bedtime story for his son Christopher. If you look at it from that perspective you may see things differently.I'm not a father, but look forward to the day when I can read the Hobbit to my child."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story, well told by Rob Inglis.The packaging is of the \\"No Frills\\" variety, but otherwise I have no complaints.Amazons price of $25 as compared to the $39.99 printed on the box, has got to be good!My copy had a fault on Disc #7. Amazon exchanged it very quickly and without fuss."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story of a simple man on a long journey, I enjoyed every page and have read it again and again.It's a much better book than any on the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought that the hobbit was a great novel. Most adults should like it, and all children should. It was a great adventure story that inspired thousands of other books.In my opinion, the hobbit is better than the lord of the rings.JRR TOlkein is, ofcourse my favorite writer, and I have read all of his novels.If you liked the hobbit, you should read:\\"The Hobbit\\" again...\\"The Lord of the Rings\\"\\"On Fairy Storys\\"\\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth\\"\\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\\"\\"The Road Goes Ever On and On\\"\\"The Silmarilion\\"\\"Pictures by J.R.R Tolkien\\"\\"Unfinished Tales\\"\\"Roverandom\\"\\"The History of Middle-Earth, by Christopher Tolkien\\"All of theseare about Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a simple book, and a quick read. Do not read it without following up with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and don't read LOTR without starting here. You'll breeze through this fun and easy book in no time, but it will give you valuable insight into the real meat of the story before you even begin it.If you've never read fantasy, this is also a great place to start!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit sets the foundation for the Lord of the Rings. I think that one should read this before they read the Lord of the Rings. This book centers around the adventures of B9ilbo Baggins, who is Frodo's uncle. Frodo refers to his uncle a lot in the lord of the rings so it would be good to know what he is referring to. This version of the book is definitely the best version for the price. It is wonderful to read and looks very good on a bookshelf. The best part is their is no outer jacket that you would be afraid of tearing. You also must realize that Tolkien had this book published in the early 1930s and the story stll lasts to today. The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are what really started the whole modern Fantasy genre. The book was meant to be read to children but it is so good that adults will find it even more entertaining. I recommend this to any Fantasy fan it is truly a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book is amazing, it goes into a lot of detail and makes you believe that you know people or have been places just by reading about them. He also uses great charactor progression, like you can tell how the charactors change from the beggining to the end, especially bilbo. In the beggining i never would have expected for him to be so brave in certain situations, like the part with the dragon. Overall, i would give this book a 9.5 out of ten, because it was amazing, but it did have a tendency to go on for a long time about some things that seemed obvious."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo is a hobbit, a creature that is almost human like but looks like a child. One day a wizard named Gandalf comes to his door and asks him if he'd like to go on an adventure. When he says no, Gandalf scratches a mark into his door that means aster burglar. The next day thirteen dwarves show up at his door, and Bilbo is basically forced to go on the adventure. They explain that they are on a quest to regain their leader: Thorin's gold from the dragon Smaug who stole it years ago, and wish that Bilbo be their burglar( or professional treasure hunter). Their journey starts off well enough, until one night they see a fire and send Bilbo to investigate. He is caught, and the dwarves are also caught, and later Bilbo manages to be thrown into a bush. While in the bush he see's the wizard Gandalf cause the dwarves to argue until dawn, when they turn to stone. The party then travel to Rivendell (where the elves live) with some new swords, and find out that their swords were made during the great goblin wars. They also discovered that the map that Thorin gained had rune letters that told him how to find the secret door. They then head into the misty mountains. When they are taking shelter in a cave, they are captured by goblins, who take them to their king. Once again, Gandalf saves them by killing the goblin king, and allowing them to escape. While they are escaping Bilbo (who could not keep up and had to ride piggy back) falls down into a hole. He found a ring while he was feeling around, but travels further down with the help of his sword (which glows when goblins are near). At the bottom, he finds there is a lake, on the lake lives a creature called Gollum. He has a riddle contest with Gollum and wins, but Gollum plans to slip on his ring (which Bilbo found) and kill Bilbo. Gollum gets mad because he finds out Bilbo has the ring, and starts to chase him. He eventually leads Bilbo to the exit and Bilbo escapes. Soon Bilbo catches up with the rest of them, but soon the party is surrounded by giant wolves. Gandalf tell everyone to get in the trees. Eventually they are rescued by eagles and taken to their nests where they rest for a while. Later on they go to Beorn (a friend of Gandalf's) house. He gives them supplies, and they go into Mirkwood forest. In the forest the company is captured by giant spiders. Bilbo slips on the ring and is able to cut the dwarves free from the webbing and kill the spiders. Later on, they are captured by elves (except for Bilbo) and after a long time Bilbo finally arranges so that they can float downstream in the empty wine barrels that the town makes for the elves. After stopping in the lake town, the company reaches lonely mountain. They finally find the secret door, and when they open it, they find a tunnel into the mountain. Bilbo goes down and steals a cup from Smaug, and later they do riddles. Smaug flies off and attacks the lake town. While Smaug is away they explore the palace, and Bilbo finds the Arkenstone (an important dwarf artifact) and is given Mithril that is very resistant. A man in laketown kills Smaug by shooting an arrow into a weak spot on his chest. After this an army of elves and men go to the mountain to get the treasure, but Thorin refuses. The army lays siege on the dwarves. While this is going on an army of Wargs and an army of Goblins attack the Dwarves, Humans, and Elves. They are saved by the eagles and Beorn. When Bilbo returns home he is rich. The Hobbit by: J.R.R. Tolkein is a very exciting book.This book was very exciting. There were many times when you thought it was over for Thorin and Company and that the story would end there. When they were captured by the Spiders it was very suspenseful, you didn't know if someone would die. It was exciting to watch the battles play out. Many times when you thought they were safe, like when Bilbo almost got stuck in the door when he was escaping the goblins.This book had many details. I almost felt like I was standing in Beorn's house, or searching through the goblin's tunnels. He described Mirkwood very well and it was like you were there. Also a lot of the description was through actions, like when the dwarves chose Bilbo to investigate the trolls fire instead of going themselves.I liked this book because it seemed like it had a history. You could tell that the author put a lot of effort into the history. In one part of the book it tells about Thr Great Goblin wars many years ago. There was a really good story about how the treasure was stolen by Smaug the dragon, and it felt like it had really happened.The Hobbit is a really good book. I enjoyed this book very much, because it kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a really good fantasy novel, and a lot less serious than the Lord of the Rings series. The Hobbit as a exciting, well thought through, detailed, and overall great book.G.Bennett"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is targetted at LOTR fans who already know the story and are looking for a collectors' edition. This is the edition... fabulous binding, print and just perfect in every way...."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dragons, elves, wizards, and dwarves are just a few of the magical creatures you will meet in J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. Like all hobbits, he has a passion for clothes, food, bright colors (chiefly yellow and green), and second breakfast. And like all hobbits, he wants to be left alone in quiet comfort, not bothered by great, big, stupid people like you or me. However, one good morning Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf who is accompanied by thirteen homeless dwarves. The dwarves have been informed by the clever Gandalf that Bilbo is a burglar and that he can prove extremely useful on an adventure they have undertaken to recover their stolen gold and homes from the evil dragon, Smaug. Through their perilous journey they face blood thirsty wargs (wolves), horrible orcs (goblins), giant spiders, and many other unknown dangers in the dreary, mysterious forest of Mirkwood. Bilbo does end up making a spanking good burglar and despite his reluctantly nervous behavior at times, he saves his companions on more than one occasion. Finally, the fourteen companions make it to the Lonely Mountain, and it is Bilbo, unaided and on his own, who confronts Smaug, \\"the terror of a countryside\\". After the dwarves have regained their treasure, they become slightly greedy and refuse to share it with anyone else. This greed leads to the tragic demise of the Dwarf Lord and the beginning of The Fellowship of the Rings. As the Dwarf Lord dies, his dying words to Bilbo are very significant to note as they are the theme of the book-\\"There is more in you of good than you know...If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien has created a land for all of us to escape to.Easy to read and simple to understand, his smooth soft prose easily slips into the harsh gutteral noise of an Orc or baddy.

A somewhat self-centered but likable fellow with aspirations that rarely extends beyond a good pipe or his next meal, thrust without warning nor apology into a quest on par with those he would spin tales of over the course of an evening after dinner. There is no prolonged set-up inThe Hobbit. The author starts us off with a brief introduction and immediately proceeds to completely foul up his protagonist's current life and foreseeable future by commandeering him on the afore-mentioned quest. Thus the fun begins.Along the way Bilbo (a very small man, in both stature and mindset, and one with no desire to change either - thank you very much!) meets trolls and orcs and goblins and a even a huge, very old, and verrrry greedy red dragon who has no taste for thieves, but a taste for hobbits. Bilbo is so far out of his league, and caught up in world events of a world he had rather wished NOT to know of that it is a wonder he stays sane at all through his perilous journey \\"there and back again.\\"Everyone should read this book. Tolkien scoots us along (much faster than his drawlingThe Lord of the Ringspace) in a delightful fantasy filled with magic and wizards and creatures great and small, dangling us precariously sometimes over the edge of a few intersecting plot points (like snapping alligators in a pit) only to not-so-politely dump us off safe and snug at home once again with a few extra coins in our pockets and a lifetime of fresh stories to tell to everyone who was too timid to take the journey with us (and our strange new friends).This book is a classic because it is easy to read, enchanting, and fun. It started the whole of 'Middle Earth' which in-turn begat the whole of fantasy role playing (an annually multi-billion dollar industry now).
